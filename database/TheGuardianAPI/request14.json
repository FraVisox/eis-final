But there will be another potential crisis next winter, and the one after that, as Britain’s geriatric coal and nuclear power stations are slowly taken out of production, not least to meet important new obligations to decarbonise electricity supply by 2020. Anyone looking for the catastrophic consequences of failing to invest in a timely way in infrastructure, and fixating instead on borrowing off the books behind the taxpayer’s back, need look no further. This is not the first UK government that has got energy wrong. Tony Blair dithered for nearly 10 years before giving the go-ahead to a new generation of nuclear power, during which time much expertise had wasted away. The plan for a third generation European pressurised reactor (EPR) in Somerset, to be known as Hinkley Point C, was approved five long years ago. But George Osborne’s obsession with flattering the books has condemned this questionable and costly project to raising cash on the open market. It involves still unproven technology, EDF – which has the contract to build the new power station – is heavily indebted already. The market doesn’t much care to invest despite – or perhaps because – the UK, Chinese and French governments are all heavily involved. According to some reports, two thirds of the funding is yet to be raised. Now EDF’s finance chief, Thomas Piquemal, has resigned. Optimists think this may mean the final obstacle to much-delayed final approval has been shifted. Realists point to the unanimous opposition of the worker-directors on the board, all of whom fear for the company’s future if it commits itself to building a third EPR before the serious problems with the first two, in France and Finland, are resolved. Last month the Hinkley project director, Chris Bakken, resigned to “pursue other options”. The only unqualified support appears to come from David Cameron and Mr Osborne, and from French president François Hollande who confirmed at his meeting with the PM last week that he wanted it to go ahead. Pressing on with a multibillion-pound project in order not to lose face is rarely good business. All the same, the government – and the country – is in a perilous bind. The new plant may be a rotten deal, but it will take innovative thinking and a lot of new investment to keep the lights on after 2025 without it: Hinkley was intended to supply 7% of UK energy. One partial solution was suggested only last Friday when Lord Adonis presented his first National Infrastructure Report, examining how to improve energy efficiency and cut consumer bills. The former Labour minister suggested as much as £8bn could be saved by public investment in storage, and demand flexibility, to even out the daily peaks and troughs, as well as building better interconnectors with green energy suppliers like Norway and Iceland. Solving the trilemma of greener supplies, cheaper bills, and lights that stay on, was never going to be easy. But it would be easier if the state used its borrowing power for this core element of the infrastructure. Keeping the lights on is what governments are for."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2016/nov/18/defence-cooperation-talks-with-eu-could-delay-brexit-process","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-18T16:23:26Z","webTitle":"Defence cooperation talks with EU could delay Brexit process","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/18/defence-cooperation-talks-with-eu-could-delay-brexit-process","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/nov/18/defence-cooperation-talks-with-eu-could-delay-brexit-process","fields":{"headline":"Defence cooperation talks with EU could delay Brexit process","bodyText":"The Ministry of Defence and Foreign Office are working on plans for how the UK could continue to cooperate with the European Union after Brexit, making it less likely that the cabinet will seek a fast-track divorce that severs all ties with the EU. Including the areas of foreign policy and defence in any deal makes it more likely that talks will not be concluded in the two years required under article 50, meaning an interim deal will be required. Some Eurosceptics, such as John Redwood, are pressing for a clean break by next summer, leaving only a basic trading relationship with the EU, and fear the talks could deliberately be made more complex in an effort to stall the process. Officials in key departments are said increasingly to recognise that it would be a mistake for the UK to sever all defence, foreign policy and security links with the EU, and that it would be easier to resolve those broader relationships after agreeing an interim deal. It is also being argued that if the UK makes a clear offer to cooperate in these areas, it could oil the wheels in the more difficult negotiations over access to the EU single market. The formal Brexit process set out by article 50 of the Lisbon treaty requires the UK first to agree the terms of its withdrawal and then to negotiate its future relationship. But the degree to which the EU will strictly enforce this sequencing, and the separation of the two processes, is unclear. Sir Simon Fraser, a former permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, told MPs this week he believed the government wanted a continuing foreign and defence policy relationship with the EU despite Brexit. He predicted the future relationship talks would cover not just economic issues but also cooperation on security, defence and foreign policy. “They will all be part of the future framework agreements between us and the EU,” he said. He also said it was unrealistic to expect the talks on the UK’s future relationship with the EU, if it is to be wider than a simple trade relationship, to be completed inside two years. That was “why we are confronted with the question of whether we are prepared just to go to article 50 and leave, and take the consequences, or whether we would like to negotiate an interim ongoing relationship until we get to the final state,” he said. The desirability of the UK continuing to cooperate with the EU on defence and foreign policy issues is contested, but appears to be accepted by Downing Street. During the EU referendum campaign Theresa May based her support for remain partly on the need to retain security cooperation with the EU. Although the government continues to rule out concepts such as an EU army or a defence headquarters, on the basis that they would duplicate the work of Nato, senior Conservatives say this should not mean ruling out future voluntary cooperation on EU defence and foreign policy. On Thursday Germany’s defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, said of closer EU security cooperation: “The biggest resistance is coming from the British, and there we ask for fairness: whoever is leaving the EU should not in their last days block the caravan.” But the British government recognises that it cannot veto EU defence cooperation once it leaves the bloc, and may need to think more strategically. Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, recently said any defence pact that undermined the power of Nato was a “bad idea”, but the UK should be prepared to cooperate militarily with the EU once it had left the bloc. “If our friends want to go ahead with a new security architecture I don’t think, post-Brexit, we can reasonably stand in their way,” he said. “What we might suggest is that given that we are the biggest military player in the area, the only other nuclear power, it wouldn’t be a bad idea, if they do genuinely go ahead with such things, [to consider] a way in which Britain could be supportive, involved in the enterprise.” Some diplomats argue that the unexpected election of Donald Trump as US president could make smaller EU states more eager to retain a strong defence relationship with the UK, the pre-eminent European military power. One Tory MP said “The British cards are going to get stronger due to Trump. It is true if the 27 are determined to do themselves damage they can do it. But with the election of Trump, the security relationships have changed. Countries like the Baltic states will be demanding the EU behaves like grownups and stop saying we are going to punish the British. If we show goodwill over defence, and stop vetoing what they want to do, it is likely to change the atmosphere of the wider talks.” Defence policy is not an area of EU activity that falls under the scope of EU law, and so relatively flexible ways of ensuring the continued participation of the UK in foreign and defence policy activities will be easier to develop than, say, partial membership of the single market."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2014/sep/04/nuclear-power-stations-out-december-edf","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-04T11:30:22Z","webTitle":"Two nuclear power stations could be out of action until December, says EDF","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/04/nuclear-power-stations-out-december-edf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2014/sep/04/nuclear-power-stations-out-december-edf","fields":{"headline":"Two nuclear power stations could be out of action until December, says EDF","bodyText":"Two nuclear stations that play a vital role helping to keep Britain's already fragile electricity system intact could be out of action till the end of the year, EDF Energy said on Thursday. The ongoing problems at Heysham 1 and Hartlepool reactors, taken offline last month, forced Centrica, a 20% owner of the atomic fleet with EDF, to issue a profit warning. EDF Energy said it expected the two power stations to be back in service between the end of October and the end of December but that would be contingent on a range of factors. \"During the coming weeks the programme team will focus on completing the inspections and work to build a robust case for the safe continuing operation of the boilers,\" the company said. \"This 'safety case' is subject to approval from the independent nuclear regulator, the ONR (Office for Nuclear Regulation).\" The power outages following the discovery of a fault on a boiler \"spine\" at Heysham 1 have already led the National Grid to fast-forward an emergency plan to obtain more electricity from other providers to meet a possible shortfall. The Heysham 1 and Hartlepool nuclear plants have a combined capacity of about 2.4 gigawatts (GW) and are out of action at a time when part of the 2GW Ferrybridge coal-fired station is also temporarily closed down due to a fire. The margin between supply and demand inside UK's electricity system is already very low due to the retirement of old nuclear and coal plants. EDF Energy operates 15 nuclear reactors in Britain but its other reactors have a different boiler design and the company said it did not see a risk of them suffering from the same fault. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, issued its third profits alert within nine months, saying: \"On the basis of the latest estimates for returning the reactors to service, and the associated costs, Centrica's earnings per share in 2014 are now expected to reduce by between 0.6 and 0.9 pence per share (inclusive of the 0.3 pence per share announced on 11 August 2014).\" Earlier this week, the National Grid said it was officially bringing forward by a year a scheme to tap additional capacity to cope with closures of nuclear, gas, coal and oil power stations and unexpected plant repairs. \"At this stage we don't know if these reserve services will be needed, but they could provide an additional safeguard,\" said National Grid's director of UK market operation, Cordi O'Hara."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/jul/29/chernobyl-could-be-reinvented-as-a-solar-farm-says-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-29T10:04:14Z","webTitle":"Chernobyl could be reinvented as a solar farm, says Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/29/chernobyl-could-be-reinvented-as-a-solar-farm-says-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jul/29/chernobyl-could-be-reinvented-as-a-solar-farm-says-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Chernobyl could be reinvented as a solar farm, says Ukraine","bodyText":"The contaminated nuclear wasteland around Chernobyl could be turned into one of the world’s largest solar farms, producing nearly a third of the electricity that the stricken plant generated at its height 30 years ago, according to the Ukrainian government. In a presentation sent to major banks and seen by the Guardian, 6,000 hectares of “idle” land in Chernobyl’s 1,000 square km exclusion zone, which is considered too dangerous for people to live in or farm, could be turned to solar, biogas and heat and power generation. Pressure has been mounting for years to allow industrial development, but no indication is given of where the solar panels would be located. “There has been a change in the perception of the exclusion zone in Ukraine. Thirty years after the Chernobyl tragedy [it] reveals opportunities for development. A special industrial area is to be created in compliance with all rules and regulations of radiation safety within the exclusion zone,” says the presentation. Tens of thousands of people in Ukraine, Belarus and south Russia were evacuated immediately after the 1986 accident from a wide area around the nuclear plant and places where the radioactive plume descended. A few hundred people still live in 11 semi-deserted villages close to Chernobyl. There is “about 6,000 hectares of idle land, some of which can be used for placement of electrical generation facilities, and some for energy crops”, according to the presentation. The Ukrainian government said more than 1,000MW of solar and 400MW of other renewable energy could be generated. The nuclear plant had an installed capacity of around 4,000MW. The advantage of generating renewable power at the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident is that the land is cheap and plentiful, and the sunshine is as strong as in southern Germany. In addition, the grid infrastructure and high-voltage power lines needed to transmit electricity to the national grid remain intact, the presentation added. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) this week indicated it would be prepared to lend money for the renewable energy plan. The EBRD has already provided more than $500m (£379m) to build a large stainless steel “sarcophagus” over the destroyed reactor, which will remain dangerous for thousands of years. “The EBRD may consider participating in the project so long as there are viable investment proposals and all other environmental matters and risks can be addressed to the bank’s satisfaction,” said a spokesman. The move to solar reflects a new energy reality involving plunging renewable energy costs and escalating costs of nuclear power. Hours of sunshine in the Chernobyl area compare favourably with southern Germany, one of the largest solar producers in the world. In a recent interview, Ukraine’s ecology minister said the government was negotiating with two US investment firms and four Canadian energy companies, which have expressed interest in the Chernobyl’s solar potential. Meanwhile in Belarus, just 20 miles from Chernobyl, a 22.3MW solar plant is already under construction in Brahin district, around 20 miles from Chernobyl. The district was one of the most contaminated by Chernobyl’s fallout and the land where the plant is to be built is not suitable for agriculture."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/jun/02/flights-across-europe-cancelled-amid-french-strikes-labour-law","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-02T12:12:10Z","webTitle":"More than 100 flights across Europe cancelled amid French strikes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/flights-across-europe-cancelled-amid-french-strikes-labour-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/jun/02/flights-across-europe-cancelled-amid-french-strikes-labour-law","fields":{"headline":"More than 100 flights across Europe cancelled amid French strikes","bodyText":"More than 100 flights across Europe have been cancelled and many others delayed due to a strike by French air traffic controllers just over a week before the Euro 2016 football tournament begins in the country. Dozens were cancelled in the UK alone, with services to and from France as well as those that travelled over French airspace to Italy or Spain among those affected. Heathrow confirmed 40 flights had been called off on Thursday. Gatwick said a total of 28 flights had been cancelled. Other airports appeared less affected, with one departure to Spain cancelled at Birmingham, and two at Glasgow. The strike is part of wider union action in France against proposed government changes to the country’s labour laws that would make hiring and firing employees easier. French rail services were affected, but the impact on air traffic control services was minimised after only one union, the CGT, took part. France’s transport minister, Alain Vidalies, said the government hoped to avert disruption to Euro 2016, which begins on 10 June. The strike, also affecting refineries and nuclear power plants, is due to last into the weekend. However, Vidalies said four of the five unions involved had agreed to call it off, leaving the CGT somewhat isolated. Ryanair said it had cancelled 75 flights across Europe on Thursday, including 12 to or from the UK. Easyjet put the cancellation figure at 32, with 20 involving UK airports. Both airlines have called for an end to the strikes. EasyJet said: “As a member of Airlines for Europe we are working with other airlines to call on governments and the EU to develop an action plan to minimise the impact of air traffic control strikes on passengers.” France’s president, François Hollande, has rejected demands from the CGT that he scrap a bill to give companies more freedom to negotiate in-house deals on pay and conditions. An opinion poll for Le Figaro magazine showed 60% of respondents believe the CGT is abusing the right to strike. Previous polls had shown the strike had majority support. The government is keen to minimise disruption before Euro 2016, during which around 2.5 million people are expected to attend matches across the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/apr/06/uk-nuclear-security-is-better-than-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-06T18:10:03Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear security is better than North Korea’s | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/06/uk-nuclear-security-is-better-than-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/apr/06/uk-nuclear-security-is-better-than-north-korea","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear security is better than North Korea’s","bodyText":"Dr David Lowry (Letters, 5 April) presents a highly selective and misleading view of the recent Nuclear Threat Initiative report.

After years of planning, work can now finally begin on the country’s first nuclear power station for a generation. While for some this is a controversial decision, I welcome the government’s go-ahead. At the TUC’s annual congress last week, our theme was “jobs, rights and investment”. Hinkley Point delivers all three. It will be the largest construction project in the UK, creating 25,000 high-quality jobs and 500 apprenticeships. It will bring in billions of pounds of foreign investment. At a time when our economy is facing uncertainty, it is good for business confidence and proof that Britain is still open for business. And a deal that’s been signed by trade unions and EDF energy will ensure working conditions at Hinkley are among the best and safest in the construction industry. Now that Hinkley finally has the green light, our message to ministers is: “Don’t stop there!” HS2 and Heathrow expansion are both shovel-ready, and a new programme of affordable housebuilding is decades overdue. The slow progress on major infrastructure projects is reflected in the UK’s investment gap with other advanced economies. TUC analysis shows that between 2010 and 2014 the UK was fifth from bottom among 29 OECD countries for public investment, and third from bottom for private investment. So the challenge here is for both government and the private sector. But let’s be clear – the lead has to come from the government. Businesses want to locate where there is high-quality infrastructure, decent housing for employees, good public services, and a highly skilled and healthy workforce. Far from crowding out the private sector, government investment encourages business to invest and base operations in the UK. The slow and torturous saga of Heathrow expansion highlights another problem: poor government decision-making. Tens of billions of pounds are ready to be spent by private investors. The expansion will support 180,000 new jobs and provide a buyer for 10% of UK steel production. But the government is still dithering. With Brexit ahead of us, we can’t go on like this, or working people will be left to pay the price. One of the big Brexit risks is the loss of foreign investment. This would increase both the UK’s investment gap and our trade deficit. The TUC has been clear that the best way of addressing this risk is to maintain our access to the single market. But the government must also boost public investment, and improve the speed and quality of its decision-making on major projects. There’s no shortage of them in the public and private sector crying out for more investment. Businesses and families need high-speed broadband, high-speed rail and new council homes. While nuclear is an important part of meeting our future energy needs, renewable energy projects need more investment too. Cuts to support for solar power in the last few years have led to the loss of half the 35,000 jobs in the sector. We need sustained investment across the renewable energy sector if we are to achieve our ambition of a carbon-free future, and seize the chance to deliver more high-quality jobs. That infrastructure spending should be part of a national industrial strategy to make sure that the UK economy has the capacity for strong growth, and delivers decent jobs. As well as investment in infrastructure and technology, it must include more investment in people, and the skills they need for an advanced economy with high-quality work. But our industrial strategy can’t just focus on manufacturing. Too many jobs in the UK, many of them in service industries like hotels and retail, are already low-paid, insecure and low-productivity. We need action to improve jobs in these industries too, to make sure that people right across the country have the chance of a decent job with decent pay. So now that ministers have finally made the right decision on Hinkley Point, they must go further, creating more jobs with the pay and security needed to buy homes, raise families and enjoy a good quality of life."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2016/may/13/hinkley-point-cgn-china-general-nuclear-power-corporation-edf-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-13T10:43:39Z","webTitle":"China nuclear company will not build Hinkley alone if EDF drops out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/hinkley-point-cgn-china-general-nuclear-power-corporation-edf-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/may/13/hinkley-point-cgn-china-general-nuclear-power-corporation-edf-energy","fields":{"headline":"China nuclear company will not build Hinkley alone if EDF drops out","bodyText":"The Chinese company helping EDF with plans to build new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset has flatly dismissed the idea it would go it alone if the largely state-owned French company dropped out. “As a partner to EDF supporting the Hinkley Point project, CGN [China General Nuclear Power Corporation] has no independent plans to build reactors at Hinkley Point C,” it said in a statement. The Department of Energy and Climate Change reiterated the message with its own statement, which said: “There is no proposal for the Chinese to build a reactor at Hinkley.” The denials come after George Osborne’s father-in-law, Lord Howell, told the House of Lords that the Chinese were working on a “plan B” to step in if, as some expect, EDF abandons the controversial scheme. “Is my noble friend aware that the Chinese also have a plan B, which is to bypass EDF altogether and build two smaller reactors on the Hinkley C site and to do it rather quicker than the present Hinkley C plan?” Howell asked. He later told the Times that he had made the comments following private meetings with Chinese delegations. “This is the view of informed thinktanks and a deduction of the way they must be thinking,” Howell said. The new reactors planned by EDF would provide 7% of Britain’s electricity needs and are a vital part of the UK government’s wider energy policy. But the project has been continually delayed amid questions as to whether the company can afford to build it. Ahead of its annual general meeting in Paris on Thursday, EDF said the final cost of Hinkley could be £20.7bn, but later argued that it still expected the plant to be constructed for £18bn. There are also concerns about the European pressurised reactor designs that EDF plans to use in Somerset.

The weather has caused the occasional blip but Next has had a remarkable record in the past five years, overtaking Marks &amp; Spencer as Britain’s leading clothes retailer as sales and profits rose. The share price more than tripled in that time and Next’s boss, Simon Wolfson, was feted as a supreme retailer. But Next unnerved investors in early January with disappointing pre-Christmas sales that it blamed largely on the warmest December on record. Lord Wolfson also mentioned increased competition online and poor product availability at the Next Directory catalogue business. Tony Shiret, the veteran retail analyst, distilled concerns last week in a 26-page note that argued Next’s problems were more deep-rooted than they seemed. Shiret has argued for two years that the directory relies too much on customers who buy on credit and he now thinks the most profitable of those customers are spending less. The full effects won’t be felt for some time and Wolfson is clever enough to find ways to arrest the decline, but “we are just at the start of the pressure on Next’s UK Directory business”, Shiret concluded. That’s just one analyst’s view: but it raises questions for Wolfson on results day. George and Boris face a tour around Europe An email headed “meetings of the Treasury committee” is always worth clicking, and so it proved on Friday. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie and his gang are to question George Osborne and Boris Johnson this week on “the economic and financial costs and benefits of UK’s EU membership”. There’s been a great deal of heat but not much light so far in the referendum campaign, with all sorts of flaky claims made about the consequences of staying in and leaving. So putting these two on the spot to extract their version of the facts is a good thing in itself. But the sessions – Wednesday for Johnson, Thursday for Osborne – are much more than that. Each will in effect be pitching for the Tory leadership and, after the disastrous budget and climbdown on disability benefit cuts, Osborne will be trying to cling to his job. Don’t be surprised if some members depart from the EU script and seek to exert political pressure on the chancellor. Osborne’s problems take some of the pressure off Johnson, who might have been the star. But MPs need to get behind the London mayor’s largely unfunny routine and ask hard questions about his late conversion to leaving the EU. Bonjour, M de Rivaz.

Here are some questions for the energy and climate change committee to ask Vincent de Rivaz: ■ In October you said you would sign the final contract for Hinkley Point soon. Why haven’t you signed it and when will you? ■ When did your finance director resign, is it true that he left because of Hinkley Point and how does the fog surrounding his departure fit with your promise of a new era of transparency for nuclear power? ■ Why should we expect you to build Hinkley Point on time and to budget when you have overrun by years on smaller projects in France and Finland? ■ Who is getting the best deal, EDF or UK consumers on the hook to pay you more than double the current cost of wholesale electricity? ■ Who is making the decisions, EDF or the French government in concert with the UK? ■ If you knew what you know now, would you ever have agreed to build Hinkley Point?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/feb/28/brexit-weekly-briefing-eu-citizens-rights-battleground","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-02-28T07:01:21Z","webTitle":"Brexit weekly briefing: EU citizens' rights become key battleground","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/28/brexit-weekly-briefing-eu-citizens-rights-battleground","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/feb/28/brexit-weekly-briefing-eu-citizens-rights-battleground","fields":{"headline":"Brexit weekly briefing: EU citizens' rights become key battleground","bodyText":"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing, a summary of developments as Britain heads more or less steadily towards the EU door marked “exit”.

In Westminster, opposition peers are confident the government will have to make concessions as its article 50 bill passes through the House of Lords, although Theresa May is confident her timetable to begin talks in April will not be derailed. No votes are planned in the Lords until the bill reaches its report stage next week, but Labour and Liberal Democrat peers say a vote on an amendment to secure EU nationals’ rights in the UK could come as early as Wednesday, and is winnable. Opposition peers also believe the government could lose on a second amendment demanding parliament gets a meaningful vote on the final outcome, with a dozen Conservatives, including Tory grandee Michael Heseltine, ready to back it. The government insists the Brexit bill must and will go through the Lords without peers changing it. A row is also looming with the EU27 over the cut-off date after which EU citizens’ rights will no longer automatically apply. The issue is likely to be a big bone of contention in Brexit negotiations, with those who arrived in the UK before the agreed date allowed to stay, and those who come after facing a stricter immigration regime. The government is thought to want an early cut-off date to prevent a last-minute influx of EU nationals before the UK leaves. The commission and member states believe it should be the actual exit date – since until then the UK is still a member, and must respect EU rights and obligations. Meanwhile, analysis of government migration data suggests 28% of EU citizens are having their applications for permanent UK residency refused or declared invalid. The view from Europe British dosh is also a potential Brexit dealbreaker. The commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said the UK could expect a “very hefty” leaving bill and would not be able to walk away without paying for commitments it made while a member: Our British friends need to know, and they know it already, that it will not be cut-price or zero cost. The bill will be … very steep. It will be necessary for the British to respect commitments that they freely entered into. The Czech Republic joined Germany, Italy and France in insisting the UK must come to an arrangement on this divorce settlement – expected to come to about €60bn (£50bn) – before any substantive negotiations on a future relationship. Meanwhile, senior politicians from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia said the EU would negotiate as a unified bloc and doubted the feasibility of Britain’s aim of negotiating a free trade agreement within the two-year article 50 talks. And as the colourful language of Britain’s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, continued to ruffle feathers on the continent, Anna Maria Corazza Bildt, a Swedish MEP publicly took him to task over his description of Brexit as a “liberation”: In the history of Europe the word ‘liberation’ has a strong meaning … We are neither occupying you, nor a prison. Meanwhile, back in Westminster This week the Westminster focus shifted north from London, as Brexit sages pored over the results of last week’s two byelections in Stoke-on-Trent Central and Copeland in Cumbria. Both votes carried mixed messages about the various parties’ fortunes in the post-referendum era. The headlines focused on Labour’s disastrous loss to the Conservatives of Copeland, a seat it had held since 1924. But this was arguably as much down to more general worries about the party under Jeremy Corbyn, and the Labour leader’s attitude to nuclear power, a big employer in a constituency which includes the Sellafield plant. Stoke had been billed as more of a Brexit-focused battle, with the Ukip leader, Paul Nuttall, parachuting himself in as candidate with the hope of removing Labour in an area that voted strongly for leave. But even facing a pro-remain Labour candidate, Nuttall was well beaten – albeit with a slightly increased vote share. However, again this seemed less to do with Brexit than Labour’s superior local operation, and Nuttall’s various mishaps related to his recollection of the past. Similarly, while May raced up to Copeland on Friday to hail the victory as showing her party could “deliver for everyone”, any unifying ability she currently has over Brexit seems mainly to do with Labour’s current chaos. You should also know: John Major became the second former prime minister in as many weeks to deliver a barnstorming speech attacking the government’s approach to Brexit and urging it to give voters an honest warning about the risks. There will be no dramatic fall in immigration as soon as Britain leaves the EU, the home secretary, Amber Rudd, said. Post-Brexit customs checks at Dover could cause gridlock with lorries queueing for up to 30 miles in Kent, transport industry leaders said. The potential loss of banking jobs from London to the EU “threatens financial stability across Europe”, City sources suggested. Farmers warned food will “rot in the fields” and Britain will be unable to produce what it eats without access to EU workers after Brexit. British medical researchers are being removed from applications for EU research grants by European colleagues because of Brexit, MPs were told. Rising fuel and food prices are eating into household budgets as the falling pound pushes up inflation, according to the latest Guardian monthly analysis. The EU will play “hardball” and Brexit talks could get “gory”, Sir Ivan Rogers, the former UK ambassador to the EU, told the Commons Brexit committee. Thousands of doctors trained in Europe may leave the UK after Brexit, the British Medical Association warned. Net migration to the UK fell sharply after the Brexit vote, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. Ireland wants a special provision in any Brexit deal so Northern Ireland can rejoin the EU if it unites with the Republic, Irish taoiseach Enda Kenny said. British cancer patients could be left “significantly disadvantaged” by Brexit, leading oncologists said. A Brexit-driven exodus of “fintech” companies from Britain has begun, the chief executive of one leading firm said. Non-British EU nationals working in the UK’s social care system have risen by 40% in three years, prompting fears of a post-Brexit staffing crisis. Read these: In the New Statesman, Tom Nuttall writes that the age-old British tactic of divide and rule in Europe is not going to work for the upcoming Brexit negotiations despite the “hairline cracks” apparent in the EU 27’s apparent unity: Roiled by one crisis after another, Europe’s governments are determined not to allow Brexit to tear them apart. If they are struggling to manufacture a common vision for the future they will resist common threats ... Under siege from enemies within and without, Europe’s politicians will hardly feel generous if they detect British perfidy across the negotiating table. That is why they will be hypersensitive to any attempt to play divide and rule. It may have worked for half a millennium, but it would be dangerous politics today. In the Financial Times (paywall), Janan Ganesh argues that pro-Europeans must push for change after Britain exits the union because “Brexit is an idea whose only effective rebuttal is its own implementation”: There is more chance of Britain leaving and then rejoining in stages than there is of Britain never leaving in the first place ... It is a matter of steering the evolution of British laws and institutions towards the EU norm, until the gap between membership and non-membership withers. This is not just possible, it is probable. The best argument against exit was never the steep downside so much as the measly upside. Sovereignty is a dream: the gravitational pull of a unified Europe on our medium-sized nation is too strong.

The correspondence between the two Margarets, released on Friday to the National Archives in Kew after more than 30 years, shows them commiserating over the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and strikes in the steel industry. “I suppose if one is an ordinary working man and one’s union tells one not to vote for new machinery or technology because otherwise you will lose your job or your card – you just don’t dare,” the Queen’s sister told the prime minister in early 1980. “The steel strike is depressing.” The discursive, handwritten notes refer to other messages that had passed between them. Thatcher wrote in January following news that Princess Margaret had been admitted to the London Clinic for an operation to remove a benign skin lesion. Addressing her as “Ma’am”, Thatcher said she was distressed to hear about the hospital visit. Her six-page letter detours through a New Year’s Eve performance attended in Covent Garden and a trip to the United States. “I cannot help feeling that Washington is much more isolated from America than London is from Britain,” she wrote – an opinion that now, perhaps, seems dated. “In New York, I spoke to the biggest luncheon ever, some 3,000 people and we took questions afterwards. I found it fascinating – they are so easy to please and so delighted if you say what you really think.” Industrial relations provoked a characteristic Thatcher sermon: “Alas, the new year has started with a steel strike and it is difficult to see why because the two sides aren’t really far away from one another … People have come to expect an annual increase for nothing, it is difficult to get across the message that more money has to be earned and not just demanded.” The prime minister signed off with: “I remain your humble and devoted servant, Margaret Thatcher.” Princess Margaret’s spirited reply, dispatched from Kensington Palace nearly a month later on notepaper headed with a crowned ‘M’ monogram, began “My Dear Prime Minister”. The “things dug out of my face”, she explained, “weren’t worrying”. As well as expressing sympathy over the steel strike, the sociable royal described a trip to Cambridge for a debate. It was “rather dull, all about the church, lots of clerics” and full of “rabid conservatives – not a Trotskyist to argue with”. She continued: “They were passionately against the Olympic Games in Moscow. I tried the ‘but isn’t it hard on the athletes’ bit but they were adamant. “I suppose individuals must choose whether to go as it’s up to the Olympic Committee. If that silly boxer [possibly a reference to Muhammad Ali, who had been sent to Tanzania, Nigeria and Senegal by the US government to campaign for a boycott] doesn’t make a hash of it he might get Africa to cock a snook at the Russians.” The princess added: “I found it quite impossible to find out what is happening in Afghanistan. Are they about to wheel into Iran and get all the oil? More power to your policy of nuclear power stations. I wish they weren’t called ‘nuclear’ as people always think of the bomb. I’ve been advocating that since I was 20.” With a final flourish, she thanked the prime minister for allocating £10,000 to the NSPCC, of which she was president, and signed off with: “Yours very sincerely, Margaret.” The easy, conversational tone of the exchange does not contain any heavy-handed lobbying on policy. Few files relating to the royal family have been released to the National Archives in Kew recently; this year several are included. It is extremely rare for such a private note to surface. A Buckingham Palace official said it was “comfortable” with the release. The princess died in 2001 at the age of 71. Had she still been alive, the letter would have been withheld far longer. Other prime ministerial files relating to the royals released on Friday include one on visits made to Northern Ireland by the Duke and Duchess of Kent during the 1980s. In June 1980, the Kents, on their way to a reception to mark the 10th anniversary of the Ulster Defence Regiment at Hillsborough Castle, were reminded that “as is the case of all royal visits, it might be necessary for security reasons to cancel the visit at any time up to the last minute”. The duchess talked to the prime minister ahead of a 1988 trip. Thatcher added a handwritten note to a document instructing her civil servants: “Urgent. She spoke to me last evening about this visit and asked if there was anything I would like her to do. I suggested that she spend a short time visiting an army unit! Because it is important for their morale. Would you pursue this?” Scrutinising the list of engagements arranged for the duchess on a one-day tour of the province the following year, the prime minister noted: “It is rather a lot for one day. I hope it is not too much for the duchess.” Thatcher was also consulted by the cabinet secretary, Robert Armstrong, about transferring Earl Mountbatten’s private papers to Southampton University in 1980, the year after he was assassinated by the IRA. The documents filled 38 filing cabinets. Some had not been cleared for release. Thatcher minuted: “If they are available to scholars, that is open to the public … I should not move anything to Southampton unless it can be properly available to the public.” The Queen’s proposed visit to Brussels, to tour Nato headquarters and the European commission, in November 1980, prompted alarm in Downing Street. In one advance planning document, the prime minister wrote: “Please consider this in relation to a settlement on fisheries policy. The proposed visit could come at very bad time. The deadline for a settlement is end 1980.” The prospect of the Queen being caught up in a row over fishing rights did not trouble the Foreign Office. “Lord Carrington does not, however, think that this should prevent the visit from going ahead,” an official responded. Thatcher, it appears, eventually backed down – and not for the first time. “On balance,” a memo recorded, “the arguments in favour of the visit just outweighed those against.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/oct/22/hinkley-point-uk-energy-policy-is-now-hunkering-in-a-nuclear-bunker","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-22T08:57:41Z","webTitle":"Government finally admits it is subsidising nuclear - while cutting help for renewables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/oct/22/hinkley-point-uk-energy-policy-is-now-hunkering-in-a-nuclear-bunker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/oct/22/hinkley-point-uk-energy-policy-is-now-hunkering-in-a-nuclear-bunker","fields":{"headline":"Government finally admits it is subsidising nuclear - while cutting help for renewables","bodyText":"The government confirms that it is not continuing the ‘no public subsidy policy’ [for nuclear power] of the previous administration. That little footnote, tucked away at the end of the announcement of Wednesday’s French-Chinese deal to build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley point, detonates an atomic bomb under the UK government’s already bewildering energy policy and leaves ministers hunkered down in a nuclear bunker. Just the day before, energy minister Andrea Leadsom said: “It is vital that industries over time stand on their own two feet. I don’t think anyone here would advocate an industry that only survives because of a subsidy paid by the billpayer.” She was justifying 87% cuts to subsidies for solar power, just as they are on the verge of becoming cheaper than gas. The contradiction does not need spelling out. Nuclear power has had 60 years to stand on its own two feet. The admission it still needs subsidy (after five years of ministers denying precisely that) shows that traditional nuclear power can barely crawl. Whether this admission strengthens the challenge brought by Austria at EU level against the UK that it is providing illegal state aid remains to be seen. Ministers argue that big nuclear power stations are key to energy security. The spooks disagree, saying having a Chinese-run nuclear power station in the UK for half a century is a hostage to fortune. Ministers also say they are committed to cutting carbon from the UK energy supply, but that protecting consumers from higher energy bills is vital. Not many would disagree, so why are ministers all but banning new onshore wind farms, the cheapest form of green energy? It was a manifesto commitment, says the government, presumably included to appease the minority of people who oppose wind farms. On Wednesday night, the House of Lords disagreed and voted down the Conservative’s anti-wind rules. It’s a mess. But don’t worry, say ministers, we will shortly be announcing new policies – a “reset”. Except this explodes the most precious of all commodities in the energy system: investor confidence. “A reset is unnecessary and would create delays to investment and increase political risks,” say the energy policy experts Prof Rob Gross and Prof Jim Watson. Over 1,000 jobs have already been culled in the solar industry, with warnings of many more to come, while Leadsom was warned on Tuesday that the UK arm of an international energy company had suffered a credit rating downgrade following the government’s planned cuts to renewable subsidies. Her response was that the cap on subsidies (the Levy Control Framework (LCF)) was on track to be bust, due to the success of renewable energy, and urgent cuts were needed. The reality is more complex. LCF spending is projected to be above the £7.6bn cap set for 2020-1, but there is allowance for 20% “headroom”, i.e an absolute limit of £9.1bn. The projections are right at, though not above, this upper limit. The government says its cuts are needed to avoid the risk of the £9.1bn limit being breached and to bring spending down nearer to the £7.6bn figure. But Ed Davey, energy secretary until May, disagrees with the argument, calling it “bogus”. So down in the bunker, ministers are hacking back successful, cheap clean energy and throwing enormous subsidies at failed, expensive nuclear power. As ever the missing guest at this gloomy party is energy efficiency, the best of all energy policies. Ministers have rightly ditched the catastrophic Green Deal and promise a new plan shortly. Perhaps that plan will be so ambitious and smart, that the current mess will all make sense. It would be nice to be surprised. Note: The original blog did not specify Austria as the country mounting the EU state aid challenge. The explanation of the LCF spending has also been expanded since publication."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2016/dec/28/bob-hawke-blames-decline-in-quality-of-politicians-on-intrusiveness-of-media","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-28T07:41:51Z","webTitle":"Bob Hawke blames decline in quality of politicians on intrusiveness of media","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/28/bob-hawke-blames-decline-in-quality-of-politicians-on-intrusiveness-of-media","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2016/dec/28/bob-hawke-blames-decline-in-quality-of-politicians-on-intrusiveness-of-media","fields":{"headline":"Bob Hawke blames decline in quality of politicians on intrusiveness of media","bodyText":"Bob Hawke has blamed “the increasing intrusiveness of the media into private lives of politicians” for what he sees as a decline in quality of MPs and leaders in Australia and abroad. In a wide-ranging address at the Woodford Folk festival in Queensland, where the 87-year-old has spoken for eight years in a row, the former prime minister said “poor quality of representatives … is not a purely Australian phenomenon – it’s a worldwide phenomenon”. Hawke said the world was living through a unique period where it was the first time since the end of the second world war that there hadn’t been “an outstanding political leader … anywhere in the democratic world”. “Some people talk about Merkel and I do not run her down in any sense at all; I simply make the point that if you compared Angela Merkel with the chancellors of Germany in the postwar period, she’d rate about sixth. “So is there some reason why the quality of people going into the parliament is not as high? I don’t know the complete answer but I think, in fact I’m sure, that part of it is the increasing intrusiveness of the media, the general media and social media, into the private lives of politicians and their families. “I think this is more of a problem for the conservative side of politics than mine because on our side we tend to have some ideology-driven move which brings up good people.” Four minutes into his 20-minute address to a crowd of more than 1,000 festivalgoers, the former prime minister had broached one of his pet topics, calling for an overhaul of the Westminister system and the abolition of the states. “What we have today basically represents the meanderings of British explorers across the Australian continent more than 200 years ago,” Hawke said. “Lines were drawn on a map and jurisdictions and governments followed. And so you have 13 governments dealing with much the same issues and I believe that the simple fact is that the states should be abolished.” Hawke also warned that if climate change was not immediately addressed it would result in the imminent and “total destruction of mankind on this planet”. Drawing considerable ire from the progressive audience, Hawke advocated nuclear power as one integral part of the solution to climate change, returning to an issue he has been passionately pushing since the late stages of his prime ministership: that Australia, as the most geologically stable nation on Earth, has a responsibility to store the world’s nuclear waste. “Nimby – not in my backyard – ignores the fact that the world’s leading geologists have said that we have geologically the world’s safest backyard and we cannot ignore that fact if we are to be serious to ourselves, our children and our grandchildren. I think more work should be done on this by our government, leading to an affirmative decision. “It would be a win for the global environment and it would be a win for Australia,” he said, arguing nuclear powered nations “would pay well for the storage of nuclear waste”. He also added that during a recent visit to Japan he met with the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who he said “nearly had an orgasm” when he raised the mere idea of Australia accepting nuclear waste. Hawke said Indigenous Australians would be a “further winner” if Australia became the world’s dumping ground for radioactive waste. “The greatest stain upon this great Australian nation’s character, without any question, is the great gaps that exist between our Aboriginal brothers and sisters in terms of their health, their education, their living conditions, their incarceration rates and life expectancy. It’s a great stain. I would argue strongly that a non-negotiable condition of taking this big decision to take the world’s nuclear waste … would be that a significant potion of the income that we got in this way should be directed to closing these gaps that exist amongst the most underprivileged in our nation, Aboriginal people.” In his only dig at Donald Trump, which drew laughs, Hawke said: “There are few people of any substance – inside or outside the world scientific community – who now question the fact of global warming. I think there’s an incoming president of the United States, a guy called Trump, who says it doesn’t exist. To me that’s prima facie evidence of the fact it does.” Speaking later in a one-on-one interview with Guardian Australia, Hawke said it was “almost impossible to overstate how dangerous” it was to have the leader of the US expressing scepticism about climate change. He said if he was in Malcolm Turnbull’s position today and forced to play the diplomatic game with Trump, “I would hold out my hand to him. I would try to do all I could to be positive with him; to gently explain where I thought he was mistaken and where his pursuit of his campaign statements could create problems for the world.” Hawke also expressed alarm at Trump’s pivot towards Russia and protectionist leanings, saying: “If he starts to try and smash international trade, that will be disastrous. “One of the things that worries me most about him is his closeness to Putin. The man he has appointed as secretary of state has a business relationship with him. I think Putin is an extraordinarily dangerous man. I think he’s trying to recreate the Soviet empire and it’s that connection which I think should be very worrying to a lot of people.” Hawke said he did not advocate centre-left politicians emulating Trump’s populist style but stressed that every political party needed to be sensitive to the changing view of the electorate. “One fundamental issue which Trump did take advantage of was the increasing disparities of income in the United States. So many people saw the rich getting richer and it not being spread around. It’s affecting European politics too now.” Hawke also defended the prime ministership of his former treasurer and political rival, Paul Keating, conceding “I certainly would not argue that I would’ve done a better job than Paul” in guiding the Australian economy through the 1990s recession. “Paul was a very competent treasurer and he must be commended from where he came from. He had no formal training in economics and indeed, in the early days of government he said to me: ‘God I hope they don’t ask me any detailed questions in parliament,’” Hawke laughed. “But he grew in the job and become one of Australia’s great treasurers.” Hawke has become a major drawcard to the annual six-day Woodford Folk festival, which is now in its 31st year and pulls crowds of more than 120,000. On Tuesday night the former prime minister stole the show at the festival’s “welcoming ceremony”, leading a crowd of about 15,000 people in a rousing, operatic rendition of Waltzing Matilda complete with intermittent fist-pumping."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/sep/13/brexit-austerity-and-the-nhs-readers-on-david-camerons-legacy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-13T12:37:36Z","webTitle":"Brexit, austerity and the NHS: readers on David Cameron's legacy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/13/brexit-austerity-and-the-nhs-readers-on-david-camerons-legacy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/sep/13/brexit-austerity-and-the-nhs-readers-on-david-camerons-legacy","fields":{"headline":"Brexit, austerity and the NHS: readers on David Cameron's legacy","bodyText":"‘He will be remembered as the austerity prime minister’ He came to office with the narrow-minded belief that everything must rotate around reducing the deficit. This has led to terrible consequences for the poor, for working families and for the public sector and public spending. His inability and unwillingness to deviate, even when his deficit-reducing policies and austerity measures were failing makes him one of the worst Prime Ministers this country has ever seen. Above all he will be remembered as the leader who who, through his own weakness and inability to unite his own MPs, led Britain out of the European Union. For short-term relief from the critics in his own party and to protect his own position he has placed the future of millions of Brits in peril. Stephen Nulty, Liverpool ‘A smart operator but lightweight thinker’ Cameron occasionally looked the part when at the dispatch box, if you count doing well as scoring smart one liners against the leader of the opposition – which he often did. But on so may counts he did a bad job: letting Osborne loose on those on welfare who were in need of help, not further hardship; crowing repeatedly about achievements with the NHS when the truth was that under-resourcing and reorganization have all but reduced it to ruins. He’ll be remembered as a smart operator but lightweight thinker, whose lack of serious preparation and narrow internal Tory party political posturing led to the disastrous, inward-looking, petty nationalistic Brexit vote. Chris, company manager, Harpenden ‘A pale version of his mentor, Tony Blair’ He was clearly impressed by the electoral success of Tony Blair and chosen as the Conservative party’s version of that image, at a time when presentation over substance was all. I saw Cameron as a pale version of his mentor, possessing all the faults of Blairism; the presentation over policy; manipulating the narrative of economic incompetence of the previous government; talking the talk of equality of opportunities, while offering greater assistance to the very wealthy and little to nothing to improve the lives of the majority. And all of this without a party’s forceful desire for positive change that supported Blair as party leader and prime minister. He was a real opportunist who thought, like Blair, that politics was about electoral success and the grinding of his enemies into the political dust. It may be seen that Cameron’s personal failures were his party’s saving, a fate in reverse for Blair and Labour. Chris Edwards, solicitor, Port Talbot ‘A shameless exit’ The Cameron era: Brexit, the possible break up of the UK, bedroom tax, junior doctors’ strikes, Chinese nuclear power, zero hour contracts, rioting in the streets, bosses’ pay, further diminution of trade union power and public sector workers’ rights, worsening pay and conditions, continued stealthy privatisation of health and education, later and later retirement for workers, unaffordable house prices coupled with the selling off of public stock,, increasing disenchantment with the political class, and a quick shameless/shamefaced exit! Glyn Collins, London ‘He made the worst political misjudgement since Suez’ He will be remembered as the PM who took Britain out of Europe and changed the country’s identity for generations. Panicked by the laughably insignificant threat of Ukip’s one member of parliament, in promising a referendum he made the worst political misjudgement since Suez. Arthur Bliss, Cornwall ‘He put party interest above national interest’ He presided over the expanded privatisation of the NHS; the destruction of the education system by Michael Gove; the vicious and vindictive persecution of the poor and needy under Ian Duncan Smith; the absurdly inept economic policy of George Osborne; and the obscene rise in house prices, particularly in London. He put party interest above national interest, particularly in his inept handling of the referendum. He screwed over the Liberal Democrats over student fees and over electoral reform. He toadied to corporations and bankers while depressing the wages of almost everybody else. He utterly failed to do anything useful about the abuse of the tax system and offshore havens. I cannot think of a single thing he did to enhance the lives of the ordinary people of this country.

The victims, aged 15, 16 and 18, were playing the popular mobile phone game in Whittington Park in Holloway on Tuesday night when three male teenagers approached them. One of the alleged robbers, believed to be a 16 to 17-year-old referred to as Kushi, pointed what appeared to be a handgun at the victims while an accomplice demanded they hand over their devices. The victims gave up their smartphones and left the scene shocked but unscathed, police said. The attack came 30 minutes after another armed robbery at the entrance to Whittington Park at 10pm, in which a 24-year-old man had what appeared to be a silver handgun pressed to his waist as three men demanded he hand over his possessions. He too left unharmed after being told to turn around and walk away. Scotland Yard believes the incidents are linked, saying the suspect descriptions and methods used were identical, and both robberies happened near each other. PC Kevin Yeung said: “These were really shocking attacks on young people walking around a much-loved park.” He also appealed for witnesses, adding: “Robberies where a gun is shown or indicated are very rare and we are keen to apprehend those involved as soon as possible.” The first suspect is described as an Asian male, believed to be 16 or 17, 5ft 6ins tall and referred to as Kushi. He was wearing a black zipped jumper, black trousers and a black bandana covering his face. The second suspect is described as an Asian male, also believed to be 16 or 17 and 5ft 8ins tall. He was wearing a dark grey puffer jacket. The third suspect is described as an Asian male, believed to be 16. He was wearing a black zipped jumper, black North Face gilet, and dark trousers.

Pokémon Go, the mobile game that overlays a virtual world on real locations, has rapidly become a global phenomenon with millions of players, but its popularity has also sparked safety fears. Police in Cambridge told Pokémon Go users to be on alert following reports of a man being punched in the face at a popular meeting spot in the city. Six teenage Pokémon Go players had a lucky escape on Thursday when they were nearly cut off by the rising tide in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. Earlier in the week, police spotted three girls standing in rough seas near Hastings pier in East Sussex, and mine rescue crews and firefighters had to come to the aid of a group of teenagers in Wiltshire who became lost in a network of caves at Box. Japanese players were urged to stay out of nuclear power plants and the Fukushima evacuation zones, while and several car crashes have reportedly been caused by distracted players. Players in Canada have also been illegally crossing the border with the US in search of Pokémon, and in Bosnia they have been warned to steer clear of landmines. • This article was amended on 1 August 2016 because an earlier version said that players in the US had been illegally crossing the border with Canada in search of Pokémon. This has been corrected to say players Canada had illegally crossed the border with the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/live/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-live-updates-outbreak-deaths-italy-uk-us-australia-europe-vaccine-china-global-economy-toll-latest-update-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-21T00:07:59Z","webTitle":"Coronavirus as it happened: global cases top quarter of a million, as Italy sees biggest daily rise in deaths","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-live-updates-outbreak-deaths-italy-uk-us-australia-europe-vaccine-china-global-economy-toll-latest-update-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-live-updates-outbreak-deaths-italy-uk-us-australia-europe-vaccine-china-global-economy-toll-latest-update-news","fields":{"headline":"Coronavirus as it happened: global cases top quarter of a million, as Italy sees biggest daily rise in deaths","bodyText":"This live blog of the coronavirus outbreak is now closed. Please go to our new liveblog: Coronavirus latest updates Here’s a summary of the latest events: Two people died in the United Arab Emirates; the first deaths suffered by the country. The country’s official news agency, WAM, said each had suffered from previous health conditions. Israel also announced its first death. The country’s health ministry has said an 88-year-old man who had been suffering from previous illnesses had died. A member of the US vice president’s staff tested positive. The employee, who was not identified, had not come into close contact with either the US president, Donald Trump, or his boss, Mike Pence, who is in charge of the US’s coronavirus response. You can read a summary of the day’s earlier events here. Panama has confirmed 200 coronavirus cases, up from 137 on Thursday, the country’s health minister has said. Pence’s press secretary, Katie Miller, has said the vice president’s office office was notified about the staffer’s positive test on Friday evening. The statement did not name the individual. “Further contact tracing is being conducted in accordance with CDC guidelines,” she said, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cuba is going to stop allowing foreigners to enter the island, with the exception of residents, in a bid to contain the outbreak, its president Miguel Diaz-Canel has said. A member of the US vice president’s staff has tested positive, Reuters reports, citing Mike Pence’s press secretary. Pence was placed in charge of Washington’s response to the pandemic by the US president, Donald Trump. Neither the president nor the vice president had been in close contact with the patient, the press secretary said. Argentina’s authorities are trying hard to enforce the nationwide mandatory quarantine imposed Friday by President Alberto Fernández, with great difficulty in some cases. In the northern city of Jujuy, police in white full-body sanitary suits tried to arrest a group of youngsters who defied the quarantine, in a dramatic chase captured by an onlooker around San Martín park Friday morning (ART). The French Riviera city of Nice will be put under curfew from Saturday night, the local prefect has said, adding that it’s necessary to enforce strict confinement measures decided by France. Bernard Gonzalez has told BFM TV: A curfew is going to be put in place. This decree is essentially aimed at those who find it funny to gather together and defy public authorities. The curfew will start at 11pm local time (10pm GMT) and run until the early hours of the morning. Any irresponsible failure to adopt social distancing must end, Ireland’s president has said. Michael D Higgins appealed to young people to respond to official advice on limiting the spread of Covid-19. Another 126 cases were confirmed in Ireland on Friday, bringing the total to 683, and three people have died. Higgins signed into law emergency health legislation giving the power to impose detention and other measures. These new health and social measures may be difficult for many but they affect us all and we are at a point now when a person’s actions have consequences not only for themselves but for all in society. Irresponsible individual action puts all at risk. We must draw on our strengths now. Large numbers of young people have been seen socialising in Dublin’s Temple Bar, despite a high-profile warning against gatherings a short time earlier from the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. We reported earlier that the District of Columbia and New Jersey were announcing new restrictions. Now, the governor of Illinois, Jay Pritzker, has ordered all residents to “shelter-in-place”, beginning on Saturday evening (CDT). All non-essential businesses are to close indefinitely. Using a term that usually refers to the response to mass shootings, the governor said: To avoid the loss of tens of thousands of lives we must order an immediate shelter-in-place. Pritzker said the order does not mean people cannot go outside at all, but they are to stay home unless it is essential to go to food shops, pharmacies, doctors’ office, fuel stations, or other essential places. He called it a very difficult choice and said in the short-term it likely cost some people jobs. Ultimately, you can’t have a livelihood if you don’t have a life. The governor also said the scheduled date for all public schools in the state to reopen has been indefinitely postponed. I want to be honest with you: we don’t know yet all the steps that we’re going to have to take. The clampdown follows similar orders in California and New York. At least 11 people have died from the coronavirus outbreak in Brazil, up from seven on Thursday, the country’s health ministry has said. Infections now number 904, the ministry said, compared with 621 the previous day. Brazil is currently Latin America’s hardest hit country by the outbreak. Similarly, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium Helen Dickinson has said: The VAT deferral is a vital lifeline for thousands of firms and millions of jobs in UK retail. Hardworking staff across the retail industry should benefit from the coronavirus job retention scheme, which will guarantee wages and help keep people in jobs. But it is essential that both are delivered promptly and effectively. In the UK, where the prime minister has told the likes of pubs and restaurants to close their doors, the British Beer and Pub Association has welcomed measures announced at the same time aimed at keeping firms in business. The association’s chief executive, Emma McClarkin, has said: The government has been clear that pubs must now shut down. The safety and wellbeing of people is our priority. We stand ready to play our part in the fight against Covid-19 and in the process protecting our communities and employees. As a sector employing nearly one million people, the chancellor’s support package announced today on staff wages will safeguard thousands of livelihoods and help closed pubs try to get through this difficult period. We stand ready to work with the government to ensure that the support is accessible as fast as possible. There remain areas where we need further support to sustain our great brewing and pub sector through this difficult time, to ensure that all staff will have jobs to return to and to guarantee all pubs can reopen again when this crisis is over and continue to be at the heart of communities up and down the country. Two people have died in the United Arab Emirates, its health ministry has said. The country’s official news agency, WAM, reports that the two deaths are cases that suffered from previous health conditions. The death toll in Turkey due to the coronavirus has risen to nine, the country’s health minister, Fahrettin Koca, has said. He added that there was a total of 670 confirmed cases in the country; a 24-hour increase of 311. An 88-year-old man who was suffering from previous illnesses has died in Israel, the country’s health ministry has said. It said the man had been brought to the hospital about a week ago in serious condition. Israel has reported 705 cases of coronavirus, the large majority with mild symptoms. About 10 patients are in serious condition and 15 have recovered completely. The UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, has spoken to the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, about the need for global cooperation, Downing Street has said. They agreed on the need for a global response to this global challenge, and for countries to coordinate in order to stop the spread of the virus and limit the economic impact on our citizens. They underlined the importance of continued funding for the development of a vaccine and to support the resilience of healthcare systems in developing countries. The prime minister said that the UK had already committed £241m to the international response and would continue to look at what further support was necessary. The number of confirmed cases in Costa Rica has reached 113; an increase of 26 on Thursday, the government has said. It is the country’s largest single day rise so far. Two people have died so far in the Central American country and the health minister, Daniel Salas, has said the next 15 days will determine how badly the global pandemic will affect Costa Rica. Beaches have been closed across the country in an effort to stop the advance of the virus, with citizens asked to stay home throughout the crisis if possible. In Zimbabwe, the health minister Obadiah Moyo said a man who lives in Victoria Falls, a popular tourist destination, has been infected. Moyo said the 38-year-old had travelled to Britain on 7 March, returning home via neighbouring South Africa on 15 March. He put himself in self-quarantine upon arrival and later called his doctor after realising he was not feeling too well,” the Associated Press quoted the minister as saying. Zimbabwe declared a national disaster days ago and some citizens have openly dreaded the pandemic’s arrival. Already public hospitals lack basic items such as gloves. Relatives of patients are expected in some cases to even provide buckets of water. But Zimbabwe’s government has insisted it is well prepared to deal with the outbreak. This post originally and incorrectly said the infected man had died. It has been updated. In America, several areas are putting in place new restrictions. The District of Columbia’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, says social distancing directives for schools, local government and mass gatherings will be extended to 27 April. And New Jersey’s governor, Phil Murphy, says he’s planning to order the shutting down of all non-essential businesses and that he “almost certainly” will tighten rules on gatherings to restrict them to no more than 10 people – or possibly even ban them altogether. Here’s a little more detail on those Italian park closures we reported earlier. From Saturday, parks and public gardens will be shut down and people will be allowed to take exercise only around their homes, Reuters reported, citing a government directive it has obtained. Games and recreational activities in the open air will also be prohibited. “We must do even more to contain the contagion,” the health minister, Roberto Speranza, said. The death toll from the outbreak in Italy leapt by 627 to 4,032 on Friday, with 47,021 confirmed cases. Brazil’s universal health system will soon be overloaded by Covid-19 pressure, the country’s health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, has warned. “Clearly by the end of April our health system will begin to collapse,” he said during a teleconference with members of Brazil’s business elite, wearing a mask and sitting next to President Jair Bolsonaro. “Collapse is when there is money, health plans, but no room in the hospitals,” he added, making comparisons with Italy; which recently overtook China’s Covid-19 deaths. Brazil so far has so far recorded 612 cases and eight deaths. According to the minister, the number of cases will begin to climb rapidly in April and continue through May, June and July before levelling out in August and falling in September. In his letter Rouhani warns: The coronavirus outbreak has endangered the health of – and even presented a considerable threat to – humanity with no distinction as to nationality, or gender or religious backgrounds. This presents an opportune moment to further contemplate our common pains and our human principles. Today, all of humankind feels apprehensive toward the future; a future threatened in every aspect; be it health, business, and even social relationships and the way of life. The level of unpredictability and uncertainty is simply unprecedented. In language Tehran has rarely directed towards the US since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Rouhani urged the American people to form an alliance with Iran to fight a common enemy. It is self-evident that our success in what is likely to be a long fight depends on the spiritual and heartfelt affinity of all human beings. The international defence that we have to mount will not be successful without camaraderie on the part of the whole of humankind. Today, instead of soldiers belonging to different armies, human soldiers, donning similar colour uniforms belonging to no particular country are selflessly and altruistically at war against the enemy of humans across the globe. In this common fight, we all belong to one front. The US has so far not shown any willingness to relax sanctions, arguing instead that humanitarian exemptions mean the sanctions have not damaged Iran’s ability to combat the virus. The US has largely accused Iran of failing to take the necessary steps to stem the spread of the virus, saying lack of resources has not been an issue. The Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, made a direct emotional appeal to the American people to persuade Donald Trump’s government to lift their sanctions against his country, saying anything that restricts Iran’s own fight against the pandemic will undermine the fight against the virus throughout the world. Any hostile actor seeking to undermine Iran’s health system and restricting the needed financial resources to tackle the crisis will undermine the fight against the pandemic all over the world. The time has come for American people to halt this dark chapter in American history. Rouhani added that Tehran, Paris, London and Washington were not that far apart in terms of the spread of the virus. His remarks came after the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zaif, sought to enlist the help of the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, and the `EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrel, to use their influence to persuade Washington to relax their sanctions. Italy is taking ever tougher measures; closing all parks and telling people they can only exercise around their homes, Reuters reports. The country’s health minister has said Italians “must do more” to contain the outbreak. In the UK, Transport for London (TfL) is suspending road charges in order to help key workers get around the capital – but authorities are adding that other people should be avoiding the roads wherever possible. The congestion charge and the ultra-low and low emission zones are all to be suspended from Monday and until further notice. Wales first minister, Mark Drakeford, said he agreed with the measures announced by prime minister, Boris Johnson, to close pubs, clubs and restaurants. “Health is a devolved responsibility, and as Welsh ministers, we will tonight exercise our powers under the 1984 Public Health Act in order to close restaurants, pubs, bars and other facilities where people gather,” Drakeford said. He added: “This also includes leisure centres, gyms, cinemas, theatres and betting shops. I will sign the necessary regulations later tonight, and they will come into force immediately.” “We do not take this move lightly, and we know this will be immensely difficult for those employed in the industries affected.” Head of the French health authority Jérôme Salomon in his daily update said the situation was worsening rapidly in France. Urged people to follow strictly the advice keep 1m distance and wash hands. It is “urgent” to do this, he said. There are now 12,612 confirmed cases in France, and 450 deaths. Of the deaths, 87% were aged over 70 years old. There are 5,226 people in hospital, 35% of them over 65 years old: 1,297 of these are in intensive care, 50% under 60 years old. 1,587 have been released from hospital. “You should not wear a mask if you are not ill. These are resources that should be reserved for health professionals,” Salomon said A US disaster relief group opened a field hospital on Friday in Italy’s north, as the country’s coronavirus death toll showed no sign of easing. Samaritan’s Purse, a Christian disaster response group based in North Carolina, began setting up the respiratory care unit in Cremona, about 90 kilometres (60 miles) southeast of Milan, and expected to receive its first patients later Friday. The unit, located in the parking lot across from the city hospital, provides eight intensive care unit beds equipped with ventilators, 20 beds for general care, a laboratory and pharmacy, and is set to expand over the weekend. “We came here because our fellow brothers and sisters, our Italian brothers and sisters, are hurting,” said Kelly Suter, health director of the new hospital. Hospitals in Paris are scrambling to find more intensive care beds, ventilators and medical staff ahead of an expected spike in the number of coronavirus patients in coming days, with the figure expected to peak in April, doctors said. Coronavirus cases in Paris and its suburbs now account for about a quarter of the 11,000 cases across France, and has about 250 now in intensive care, up from just 50 five days ago. The death toll in all France as of Friday evening stood at 450. “We are working at full speed to ramp up the number of intensive care beds,” Antoine Vieillard-Baron, head of the surgical and medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the University Hospital Ambroise Pare, told a conference call with reporters. Belgium became the latest European country to close its borders to contain the coronavirus Friday, shutting them to all but freight and travellers deemed to be on essential business. Interior minister Pieter De Crem said the decision had been taken after “intensive contacts” with Belgium’s neighbours, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Coronavirus can sicken or kill young people, who must also avoid mingling and spreading it to older and more vulnerable people, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, told a virtual press conference: “Today I have a message for young people: You are not invincible, this virus could put you in hospital for weeks or even kill you. Even if you don’t get sick the choices you make about where you go could be the difference between life and death for someone else.” Amid shortages of protective gear for health workers and diagnostic tests, “air bridges” will be needed to bring supplies to countries for vital health workers, the WHO’s top emergency expert Dr Mike Ryan said. The World Health Organization said Friday that the Chinese centre of the coronavirus outbreak at last reporting no new cases gave hope to the rest of the world battling the pandemic. The city of Wuhan registered no new cases of Covid-19 in 24 hours - for the first time since reporting its first case in December in an outbreak that has gone on to infect more than 250,000 people around the world and kill more than 11,000 people. US-Mexico border is closed to non-essential travel as coronavirus outbreak continues. In Greece, the government has announced further restrictions on movement to curb the spread of the novel virus as the death toll from Covid-19 climbed to eight. As of 6am tomorrow, travel to islands will only be allowed by local residents, following mounting evidence of Athenians snapping up ferry bookings for islands en masse. Ships carrying essential provisions will be exempt from the ban. Pleasure boats out at sea will also have to dock permanently – a stringent measure in a country with one of the longest coastlines in Europe. The restrictions came as Greek health authorities said confirmed coronavirus cases had risen to 495, an increase of 31 since yesterday, even if presumptive cases are thought to be higher. Most are in Athens. Announcing the latest figures, infectious diseases professor, Sotiris Tsiodras, the Greek health ministry spokesman on coronavirus, blasted Greeks for also heading to villages from the capital, emphasising the risks posed of transmission to remote areas and reiterating the next few weeks were critical. The centre-right government has stopped short of issuing a country-wide curfew, but has signalled it may well be forced to extend an already draconian lockdown if Greeks continue to flout restrictions. The deputy civil protection minister, Nikos Hardalias, also attending the early evening update on Friday, said the government was considering imposing heavier fines on those caught violating measures. Group gatherings of more than ten are banned with 1,000 euro penalties, per person, for infractions. Italy announces 627 more coronavirus deaths, the biggest day-to-day increase in the country’s four-week epidemic. The total number of deaths was 4,032, with the number of infections reaching 47,021. Italy’s previous one-day record death toll was 475 on Wednesday. UK will close all cafes, bars and restaurants and the government said it would pay 80% of wages of those not working. Trump has invoked new powers to speed up virus supplies. US president Donald Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act to get needed medical supplies on the front lines of the coronavirus outbreak, mobilizing the federal government to marshal the private sector to combat the pandemic. There have now been at least 10,316 deaths from coronavirus since it emerged and more than half of those deaths (5,168) have been in Europe, according to an AFP tally based on official sources. More than a quarter of a million cases have been detected in 161 countries and territories around the world. The Tunisian president, Kais Saied, on Friday ordered a general lockdown, restricting public movement to counter the spread of the coronavirus. Among the other worst-affected countries is Iran with 1,433 deaths and 19,644 cases, Spain, with 1,002 deaths and 19,980 cases, France with 372 deaths and 10,995 cases, and the United States with 205 deaths and 14,250 cases. Dr Maria van Kerkhove, speaking at the WHO briefing, said: “Think of a large gathering, people are close to one another and if you have an infected individual in that cluster... the opportunity for the virus to pass between people is much greater.” She added: “Physical distancing is not enough. It has to be part of a larger package of interventions”. A question is asked about the mortality rate in Europe – with Italy’s tragically higher and Germany’s lower. Dr Maria van Kerkhove said there was no information about how each country is recording deaths. She said: “We spoke about this the other day: the difference in mortality compared by country. You have to be careful about how you compare countries ... First it is about populations that the virus is infecting ... moving in older populations we know can cause more deaths. There are a number of factors in which mortality can vary between different populations. Also discussed was the challenges of describing mortality as an epidemic, or pandemic, unfold ... This is just a snapshot of what true mortality is... There are a number of individuals very severe and still in ICU – some will recover and some will die. We don’t have precise numbers of death.” Italy reported a record 627 new deaths from the novel coronavirus, taking its overall toll past 4,000 as the pandemic gathered pace despite government efforts to halt its spread. The total number of deaths was 4,032, with the number of infections reaching 47,021. Italy’s previous one-day record death toll was 475 on Wednesday. The nation of 60 million now accounts for 36.6% of the world’s coronavirus deaths. Italy has seen more than 1,500 deaths from Covid-19 in the past three days alone. Its current daily death rate is higher than that officially reported by China at the peak of its outbreak around Wuhan’s Hubei province. Dr Maria van Kerkhove, speaking at the WHO briefing, said people can keep connected in many ways without being in the same space. “We are saying physical distance ... we want people to remain connected through the internet and social media because your mental health, when going through this, is just as important as your physical health.” Misinformation is impacting on efforts to quell the coronavirus pandemic as even “very well educated” people share false cures, hoaxes and conspiracy theories online, experts warned as recorded cases continued to climb . The World Health Organization (WHO) has increased its efforts to tackle myths and rumours since it warned in February of a massive “infodemic”, a deluge of information, including false claims that can risk public health. The WHO’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “I have a message for young peopole: you are not invincible. This virus could put you in hospital for weeks or even kill you.” Italy announces 627 more coronavirus deaths, the biggest day-to-day increase in the country’s four-week epidemic. Boris Johnson is telling cafes, bars, and restaurants to close as soon as possible and not to open tomorrow. He said they can provide takeaway services. He also ordered nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres to close. He said: “You may be tempted to go out tonight and I say to you please don’t, you may think that you are invincible - but there is no guarantee that you will get it. “But you can still be a carrier of the disease and pass it on.” He added: “We want you as far as possible to stay at home.” Follow the full briefing from Johnson via our UK live blog. Boris Johnson is now talking to the media, giving his 5pm briefing. You can follow it live via the link below. New measures are expected as he updates the nation on his government’s response. He will be joined by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor and Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer. There is now a World Health Organisation briefing being streamed live from the top of our live blog. Uki Goñi reports from Buenos There was panic on a ferry with 385 passengers doing the one hour crossing from Uruguay to Argentina Thursday night when it was discovered that a 21-year-old male coronavirus patient was on board. Ambulances with health officials in full-body white sanitary suits rushed to greet the ferry’s arrival in Buenos Aires. They boarded the ship and quickly removed the youngster to a private health clinic. Argentina’s security ministry tweeted images of the procedure and said it had arrested the young man as well as two female passengers who refused to be screened upon arrival. Nine persons, including the young man, have been placed in hospitals, while the remaining passengers and crew of 19 have been placed in quarantine. According to press reports, the young Argentinian had recently arrived from Holland. In Uruguay he developed symptoms and was under observation at a a medical facility. Some reports say he escaped the facility, others that he left before receiving his test results. With a group of friends, the teenager is said to have managed to trick the fever inspection at the port of Colonia by taking a paracetamol before boarding. The exact details are still forthcoming. According to one report, Uruguayan authorities alerted the ferry company Buquebus of the situation when the ferry was about to arrive in Buenos Aires. Another report states that the young man started feeling unwell and alerted ship officials that he had been diagnosed with coronavirus. The young man is said to have received an email while on board from the Uruguayan clinic saying he had tested positive. Passengers who had started to disembark were told to return to their original seats to work out who had been sitting in close proximity to the young man, a passenger on the ship said in a WhatsApp audio to his family. “This is total chaos,” the passenger said. Passengers and crew have been distributed among four hotels in downtown Buenos Aires, which have been turned into makeshift quarantine facilities. Some passengers resisted being quarantined and had to be forcibly removed from the ferry, with images of their resistance going viral. Johnny Depp’s UK libel case has been postponed due to coronavirus. A libel case brought by Hollywood actor Johnny Depp against Britain’s the Sun newspaper, over allegations he abused his ex-wife Amber Heard, was suspended Friday due to the coronavirus outbreak. Thanks to those who have been sending me information and please continue to do so. Any news tips or insight from where you are will help us build a picture of what is happening. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com US president Donald Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act to get needed medical supplies on the front lines of the coronavirus outbreak, mobilizing the federal government to marshal the private sector to combat the pandemic. Trump had said earlier in the week he would tap the act as needed. He said Friday he has put that in gear. Trump also announced an effective closure of the US border with Mexico, prohibiting most travel except for trade. That brings it in line with the restriction on the Canadian border earlier this week. The world underestimated the pandemic, says Ian Goldin, an Oxford University professor who predicted it. In 2015, Goldin warned in his book “The Butterfly Defect” about the risks of a global pandemic in a modern, interdependent world. It appears though that not everyone was listening. Governments, Goldin argues, did not truly understand the potentially enormous dangers posed by astonishing events such as those witnessed across the world in the last few weeks. Trump said he did not believe a national lockdown was necessary at this stage, while New York and California have told residents to stay indoors except for essential activities. The president said New York and California are “hotbeds” of coronavirus, but some parts of the country do not have to take the same steps. Read more on the Guardian US live blog, which is now updating on his briefing. A jet carrying 359 people including hundreds of American and Canadian cruise ship passengers home from France landed at Atlanta’s international airport on Friday as emergency responders prepared to screen them for the coronavirus, federal officials said. Three people on the flight have tested positive for COVID-19 but have no symptoms, while 13 others are sick but haven’t been tested, the US Department of Health and Human Services said Friday. Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force response coordinator, said data from Italy indicate the coronavirus fatality rate is twice as high for men across all age groups. Birx reiterated the virus appears to be less deadly for younger people, but she emphasized younger Americans still need to take precautions. “No one is immune,” Birx said. “We know it’s highly contagious to everyone. Do not interpret mild or moderate disease as lack of contagion or that you’re immune. The total number of confirmed coronavirus-related deaths in the UK now stands at 177. There have been 167 in England, six in Scotland, three in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. Brazil declared a state of emergency on Friday, freeing up funds for the federal government to fight the coronavirus pandemic, as President Bolsonaro’s popularity declined over his handling of the crisis. The Senate approved a measure letting the government waive fiscal targets this year, with senators voting remotely after two of them tested positive for the virus causing the COVID-19 respiratory disease. Leyland Cecco in Toronto, Canada Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has announced his government will turn away asylum seekers at the US-Canada border as a temporary measure, meant to further halt the flow of people into Canada amid the coronavirus outbreak. “Canada and the United States are announcing a reciprocal arrangement that we will now be returning irregular migrants that attempt to cross anywhere at the Canada-US border,” Trudeau said Friday. Speaking to reporters from self-isolation for the fifth day in a row, Trudeau said the plan to deny entry into Canada for asylum seekers is part of a broader agreement struck with the United States. The two countries announced plans earlier this week to shutter the 5,500 mile shared border to all non-essential travel. Trudeau stressed the “exceptional measure” to deny asylum seekers was temporary. The federal government had previously weighed placing those seeking to enter Canada into mandatory self-isolation. Canada has received roughly nearly 55,000 asylum claims since February, 2017. The prime minister also announced plans to support manufacturing companies across the country, including large automative companies, as they quickly retool much of their production lines to build much-needed medical equipment, including ventilators and masks. Early indications suggest the virus is hitting the Canadian economy hard as businesses across the country close. Trudeau said the government has received 500,000 employment insurance applications this week— compared to 27,000 from the same period in the prior year. Canada has close to 1,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 11 documented deaths from the virus. The US President, Donald Trump, said on Friday he had put the Defense Production Act into action after saying earlier this week he would invoke the measure but essentially put it on hold until needed. The measure is meant to allow the US government to speed production of masks, respirators, ventilators and other needed equipment to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Trump said he put the measure into action on Thursday evening. There have now been at least 10,316 deaths from coronavirus since it emerged and more than half of those deaths (5,168) have been in Europe, according to an AFP tally based on official sources. More than a quarter of a million cases have been detected in 161 countries and territories around the world. Italy has overtaken China as the worst country with the most virus-linked deaths, with 3,405 as well as 41,035 cases. Among the other worst-affected countries is Iran with 1,433 deaths and 19,644 cases, Spain, with 1,002 deaths and 19,980 cases, France with 372 deaths and 10,995 cases, and the United States with 205 deaths and 14,250 cases. For a second consecutive day China has reports no new domestic cases. But it is now worried about a second wave of infections coming from abroad and on Friday the health commission reports 39 more imported cases. International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach says it is “premature” to postpone the Tokyo Games planned for July-August, but admits the body is “considering different scenarios”. Pharmaceutical industry executives say they expect it will take 12 to 18 months to roll out a vaccine and jointly pledge to make it available worldwide based on need. The Canada-US border is expected to be closed by Saturday for non-essential travel. The same measure is being considered for the US-Mexico border. Trump said US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, would announce restrictions on US-Mexican border travel today. However, the president then appeared to preempt the announcement by saying the southern border was closing to non-essential travel.

Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Britain’s lead negotiator for post-Brexit trade talks with the European Union is self-isolating after showing mild symptoms of coronavirus, a spokesman said Friday – the day after his EU counterpart said he had the virus. British negotiator David Frost “has been showing mild symptoms and so he is following the guidance to self-isolate”, a spokesman for prime minister, Boris Johnson told reporters. Trump has expressed approval of California and New York’s decisions to order all residents to stay home except for essential activities. “I applaud them,” Trump said of New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, and California governor, Gavin Newsom.

Joe Parkin Daniels in Bogotá Bogotá, Colombia’s capital, is the latest Latin American capital to go into city-wide quarantine, albeit for a trial period until Tuesday. The Andean capital, with a population of nearly 8 million, went under a quarantine at midnight local time, shuttering businesses in a bid to slow the spread of Covid-19. The measure is an effort from local authorities to prepare for widespread quarantines, which they say are now inevitable as confirmed cases of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus reached 128 in Colombia on Thursday. “It is an exercise in preparation ahead of an eventual quarantine,” Bogotá’s mayor, Claudia López, said in a press conference, announcing that bus terminals will also be shut down over the long weekend. “We must stay in our homes to avoid what happened in Italy when a quarantine was declared and many travelled and spread the virus around the rest of the country.” Capital cities across Latin America are currently locked down, including Lima in Peru, Buenos Aires in Argentina, and Caracas in Venezuela. The quarantine in Bogotá has been mimicked by other provincial officials in Colombia, with other cities also locking down despite some confusion sowed by the president, Iván Duque, who on Wednesday said that only the national government has the jurisdiction to declare quarantines. Medellín and Cali, Colombia’s two largest cities outside Bogotá, will also go under quarantine on Friday evening. On Thursday, Duque announced that all international flights to Colombia would be suspended from 23 March, and that nationals would be barred from entering after then for a period of 30 days. Land and maritime borders were closed on Tuesday, while gatherings of more than 50 people are banned. The number of coronavirus cases worldwide has just topped a quarter of a million (250,856), according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University. That includes 10,415 deaths and 87,284 who recovered. Some 2,600 US military personnel, including civilians, are in self-isolation in Europe after being identified as people of concern during the coronavirus outbreak, the US military disclosed on Friday. The number is far higher than anything previously reported. “These individuals are not necessarily sick, but may have been exposed and are doing their due diligence following health preventative measures,” the Pentagon said in a statement. The White House is about to hold its daily coronavirus briefing, where the president is expected to announce restrictions on travel at the US-Mexican border. Follow the Guardian US blog here. Spanish authorities said on Friday they would turn a Madrid conference centre into a giant makeshift military hospital for thousands of coronavirus patients, as Europe’s second-worst outbreak claimed another 235 lives. Spain’s worst single-day death toll yet brought the country’s total fatalities above 1,000. Jordan has announced a round-the-clock curfew from Saturday morning until further notice to battle the coronavirus outbreak, the government announced. The exceptional measure, to be applied for an indefinite period, was taken after “citizens did not respect directives” calling on them not to leave their homes except for extreme emergencies, government spokesman Amjad Adayleh said. He warned that lack of compliance with the curfew would result in “immediate imprisonment, which will not exceed one year”. Mexico and the US are set to announce plans on Friday to sharply limit travel over their busy shared border as they try to control the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Mexican foreign secretary, Marcelo Ebrard, said his government and the Trump administration have agreed to a plan that would prohibit recreational and tourist travel, similar to the restrictions put in place earlier this week along the US and Canadian border. New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, has announced all non-essential workers in the state must stay home amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is the most drastic action we can take,” Cuomo said. The announcement comes one day after California governor, Gavin Newsom, announced all of the state’s 40 million residents must stay indoors except for essential activities.

In a message to staff, Northwick Park hospital in Harrow said it has no critical care capacity left and was contacting neighbouring hospitals to discuss transferring patients who need critical care to other sites. The message, sent last night, said: I am writing to let you know that we have this evening declared a ‘critical incident’ in relation to our critical care capacity at Northwick Park hospital. This is due to an increasing number of patients with Covid-19. This means that we currently do not have enough space for patients requiring critical care. As part of our system resilience plans, we have contacted our partners in the North West London sector this evening to assist with the safe transfer of patients off of the Northwick Park site. Tunisian president, Kais Saied, on Friday ordered a general lockdown in the country, restricting public movement to counter the spread of the coronavirus. Speaking in a televised broadcast, Saied said he was asking the majority of people to stay at home and stopping movement between Tunisian cities. The luxury London store Harrods, which stayed open throughout the bombing during the second world war, has announced it is shutting. It will keep open its food halls and pharmacy, but the rest of the department store will close. The welfare of our community of colleagues, customers and partners has been our absolute priority throughout this time of uncertainty,” managing director Michael Ward said in a statement. It will close from 7pm (1900 GMT)on 20 March. At least 5 million people have been designated as “key workers” in the UK whose jobs are essential to keep the country going during the coronavirus crisis – but many are paid well below the national average, Guardian analysis has found. Of this group, at least 1.5 million workers earn below the national median salary of £24,897. The lowest paid key workers were checkout workers and shelf fillers, whose median salaries were £10,000 and £12,000 respectively. There were 13 roles in total earning below average wages, including undertakers, welfare administrators and teaching assistants. The median salary of the occupation groups analysed by the Guardian stood at £31,029. Some of the higher paid roles include air traffic controllers, who earn £94,000 a year on average, and doctors, who earn £61,000. Key workers, who include doctors, nurses, midwives, teachers, nursery staff, police and transport workers, are entitled to send their children to schools and nurseries, which are closed indefinitely for the majority of students. The Guardian analysis found equivalents for job roles mentioned in the government’s list of key workers in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings dataset published by the Office for National Statistics. The list of equivalents found will not include all key workers. Earnings are based on full and part-time workers’s median earnings in 2019. The US Homeland Security Department has said restrictions barring non-essential travel across the US-Canadian land border will begin at 11:59pm (EDT) on Friday and last until 20 April, according to a notice. It said that restrictions do not impact air travel or trade or cargo, but does apply to passenger rail and ferry travel. The restrictions stop tourist trips, but allow US citizens and permanent residents to return to the country. The ban includes exceptions for people travelling for medical purposes, attending school or to work in agriculture, public health purposes or military-related travel. Belgium’s Charleroi airport has announced that it will close to commercial flights for at least two weeks because of travel restrictions imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus. The airport, the country’s second busiest and the main continental European hub for budget airline Ryanair, said it would halt operations on Tuesday night until 5 April at the earliest. Hello everyone. I am taking over the live blog now from my colleague Ben. If you want to share any information with me then please do via any of the channels below. Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist With restrictions being eased across China, the world is getting a glimpse of life after coronavirus. In Shanghai, women walk arm in arm past a reopened shopping district. Narrow pavements are crowded as residents browse food shops. At one entrance to a hospital, a man wore his hazmat suit partly unzipped as he waved in cars. In Beijing, traffic has begun to return and more residents can be seen out on the streets, in parks and in shopping and restaurant districts. Jia Shu’na, 20, travelled to Beijing on Wednesday, a stop along her route back home to Inner Mongolia to resume classes. “Now I feel like things are gradually recovering. Now a lot of transportation has opened up,” she said, sitting in a park with her luggage. Jia said she noticed long lines at the train station when she departed from the southern province of Yunnan, and several people in each train car. “Many people have gone out. It’s much better than before,” she said. More than 80,000 people have been infected by the virus that first appeared in the city of Wuhan, killing more than 3,000, but the number of new infections per day has dropped dramatically. Every major carmaker in the UK and Europe is suspending or cutting production as the disruption from the coronavirus outbreak spreads – with only lower-volume manufacturers such as Aston Martin keeping factories open. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and Bentley Motors have become the latest British carmakers to suspend production at their UK factories. In Sweden, Volvo announced on Friday that it would close its factory, the last remaining high-volume plant in Europe, from 26 March. Europe’s lockdown has disrupted global supply chains, and massively reduced demand in all key markets is thought by most analysts to be all but certain. Opponents of Vladimir Putin’s plans to amend the constitution so that he can run for president again in 2024 have said they had been forced to scale back Russian protests this weekend due to coronavirus, but would press ahead with some demonstrations. Putin’s changes, which have already been approved by both houses of parliament, would overturn a current constitutional ban on him running for president again in 2024, allowing him to potentially stay in power until 2036 Separately, the Kremlin said that Putin has not been tested for coronavirus and does not need to undergo such a test because he is healthy and has no symptoms, Reuters reports. Russia has reported 199 coronavirus cases so far, fewer than in many other European countries. But the figure has risen sharply in recent days and one person diagnosed with the virus has died. A map showing the differing levels of countermeasures has been compiled by Olivier Lejeune, an analyst at the International Energy Agency (IEA). It includes the latest decisions by Argentina and California to impose a full curfew. Lejeune has tried his best to keep it accurate for every country in the world. Bavaria is going to impose curfews from Saturday morning in an attempt to further curb the spread of Corvid-19 in the southernmost German state. From midnight on Friday people in Bavaria will only be allowed to leave their homes if they can show their trip outside is strictly necessary, such as commuting to work, vital shopping, doctors appointments or seeing people who require care. “We’re shutting down public life almost completely,” Bavarian state premier Markus Söder said. The conservative politician justified the further restriction of free movement by pointing to the latest spike in figure: confirmed Covid-19 cases in Bavaria rose by 35% from Thursday to Friday, with number of deaths rising to 15. Söder also said appeals for people to voluntarily curtail their movement had not worked. People would still be allowed outside to go for runs and walks, Söder said, adding “fresh air is good for you”. People are advised to do so on their own or within family groups, with police advised to hand out fines for non-compliance. In what might be the first case of its kind in British territory, a 26-year-old on the Isle of Man has been arrested for allegedly failing to self-isolate against coronavirus. The suspect was held by police on the island on Thursday, two days after the British crown dependency announced strict measures to prevent the illness spreading. Since Tuesday night, anyone arriving on the island is subject to 14 days of self-isolation even if they do not have symptoms of the virus. The man, who has not been named, will appear in court in Douglas, the island’s capital, on Friday. He faces a fine of up to £10,000 and a possible three-month jail sentence. The island’s chief constable tweets: As coronavirus cases in South Africa jumped on Friday to 202, the most in the sub-Saharan region, the continent’s and the country’s busiest airport said foreigners cannot disembark. The Associated Press also reports that South Africa said five of its new cases had attended a church gathering of more than 200 people in central Free State province. All had traveled abroad. Another new South Africa case was a health worker who had been in a number of private hospitals. Johannesburg’s O.R. Tambo International Airport said that aircraft with foreigners will be contained at an isolated bay. This is a tweet from an hour ago: Thanks to a tip from a reader, we’ve looked at how New York City’s department of health has changed its guidance on doctors and nurses who come into direct, prolonged, and unprotected contact with patients who are known to suffer from the coronavirus. In short, unless they are exhibiting symptoms, they need to keep working. We heard from medical staff who are concerned that the new policy is spreading the disease. The authorities on the French Riviera are using a drone fitted with a loudspeaker to instruct people to “stay home”. The drone flew over Nice this morning and has been deployed over Cannes this afternoon. “Remember the instructions regarding the Covid-19 epidemic. All movements outside the home are banned except where there is a derogation,” was the message. “Please respect a safe distance of at least one metre between each other,” it added. The device is being piloted by a local drone business run by former police officer Sabri Ben Hassen. “For the moment, we’ve only one and it’s sending out the message with a 100 decibel speaker. To give some idea, an Airbus produces 120 decibels when it is taking off,” Ben Hassen, 33, told AFP. The operation was commissioned by the local police prefect. Government was today actively discussing a new clampdown on London with pubs, cinemas and gyms being ordered to close to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. An announcement could be made in hours, with concern among crisis planners rising that too many people are continuing to ignore social distancing advice - making the spread of the virus more likely. The British capital is the target of tougher measures because it has the highest rate of infection and deaths so far. Debate within government is continuing about whether non-essential shops - that is those not selling food or medical supplies - would be included in the ban. The Government had been considering a formal ban on Thursday and was braced to announce it - but pulled back.Among senior government figures there is a deep reluctance to issue banning orders. Officials believe they would have the power to order bans even without special emergency laws drafted specifically to battle the pandemic. Crisis planners and government advisers have been looking at various data, such as transport usage in the capital and hospital admissions, to assess if the pleas made on Monday for people to stay home was being heeded. Continuing anecdotal evidence of people, especially younger Londoners, continuing to go to pubs despite repeated pleas has led to government believing it may have no choice but to issue the ban, which may be announced within hours. You can follow the UK coronavirus developments here. The UK government has banned the parallel export of 80 crucial medicines – including adrenaline, insulin, paracetamol and morphine – to protect supplies during the coronavirus outbreak. The government describes parallel exporting as “when companies buy medicines meant for UK patients and sell on for a higher price in another country, potentially causing or aggravating supply problems”. The Department of Health said that any company found to be parallel exporting could face tough action from the country’s drug regulator, including the removal of their trading licence. The full list of medicines is here. Guardian film editor Catherine Shoard has this on the big fall in takings at the US box office. With only around 440 cinemas of 5,600 still open across the US, Wednesday’s midweek box office takings hit a historic low with $300,000 recorded. Most multiplexes, including the AMC, Regal and Cinemark chains, closed earlier this week. It is thought that some drive-ins, whose revenue is not officially recorded, remain open. The same Wednesday in 2019 recorded almost $11m in ticket sales while last Wednesday’s box office was $7.7 million, according to Comscore. The Hollywood Reporter suggests “analysts say $300,000 is no doubt the lowest number in modern history for a single weekday”. The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, has tweeted that the US states of New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are too close all barber shops, nail and hair salons, tattoo shops, and similar services from tomorrow at 8pm. Journalists in Turkey have put together a day-long campaign calling for the immediate release of jailed colleagues because of the threat posed by Covid-19, reports Bethan McKernan, the Guardian’s Turkey and Middle East correspondent. The video says: Injustice during the time of corona. Some journalists defied pressure and reported the truth for years. They were threatened, detained and arrested for defending the truth. Now, behind bars, they are defenceless against the coronavirus. Once the pandemic breaks out in prisons, it will pose a greater threat. Cleaning supplies are limited, living conditions are unhealthy. Isolation has become more merciless after visits were banned, telephone calls are limited. At these gravest of times, we miss them the most. Release the journalists. More than 120 journalists are still being held in Turkey’s jails, a global record. The situation for the media in the country has not improved since state-of-emergency measures were lifted in 2018, two years after a failed coup, according to the International Press Institute. On Thursday night the Turkish health ministry confirmed that cases of coronavirus have almost doubled in 24 hours to 359 infections and four deaths. A total of 64 people have been detained over “provocative and baseless” social media posts about the pandemic, the interior ministry said. Worldwide death toll passes 10,000 There have been more than 10,000 deaths from Covid-19 around the world, roughly two-thirds of which have occurred in China and Italy, and more than 240,000 cases of the virus have been confirmed. There have been 205 deaths in the US, 144 in the UK and seven in Australia, as a result of the outbreak. Spanish death toll passes 1,000 The death toll in Spain has surged to 1,002 – climbing by 235 deaths in the past day – as the country scrambles to contain an epidemic that has spiralled into one of the worst in Europe. The latest statistics from the country’s health ministry showed 19,980 confirmed cases of Covid-19 across the country. More than a third of the documented cases are in Madrid. On Friday army specialists were set to begin entering care homes to help with disinfection after the virus claimed more than 50 lives at elderly care facilities across the region. Concern as large numbers take to the roads for Iranian new year Appeals by the Iranian government for the nation to stay at home at the start of Iranian new year have been widely ignored with more than 1.2 million taking to the roads, according to the Iranian police. Northern towns on the Caspian coast, one of the main holiday destinations, reported tens of thousands of cars trying to reach them. UK Hotspot being investigated in England’s West Midlands The British government is investigating a sharp rise in the number of coronavirus deaths in the West Midlands, with one of the region’s NHS trusts reporting nine deaths from the illness, the highest number for any trust in the country. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, confirmed the government was looking “very, very closely” at why a hotspot seems to have emerged in the region, where 28 deaths have been recorded so far. The majority of deaths have been of elderly and at-risk patients. Governor of California shuts down state The governor of California has ordered all citizens to stay at home as he escalated the attempts of America’s most populous state to combat Covid-19. Gavin Newsom earlier wrote to Donald Trump to warn that 25.5 million people in the state could contract the virus – roughly 56% of the population. EU open to coronavirus Brexit delay – European Commission chief The EU would be open to a possible request from Britain for the delaying of the UK’s departure from the European Union, according to the president of the European Commission. Ursula Von Der Leyen’s offer came against the backdrop of the continuing coronavirus outbreak across Europe, which has now led to the UK’s chief negotiator going into self isolation due to symptoms and his EU counterpart testing positive for Covid-19. Warnings over global economy amid profit warnings and lay-offs A worldwide credit crunch triggered by the coronavirus will set in motion a wave of corporate bankruptcies that will make the global financial crisis look like “child’s play”, investors have warned. With the world’s most advanced economies all entering a shutdown that could last months, companies that have gorged on cheap money for the past decade face going out of business thanks to a huge spike in borrowing costs on international money markets. China reports no new cases for a second day China’s national health commission said earlier on Friday the 39 new cases it confirmed on Thursday were all imported, with 14 in Guangdong, eight in Shanghai, six in Beijing, three in Fujian, and one each in Tianjin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangxi, Sichuan and Gansu. China is among a number of countries where stringent measures appear to have brought the virus under control, but where concerns are now mounting of a fresh wave brought in by travellers. US politicians face demands to resign over reports of stock sell-offs Two Republican senators have faced demands to resign after it was reported they sold off millions of dollars worth of stocks just before the market dropped amid fears of the coronavirus pandemic. Richard Burr of North Carolina, chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, and Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, whose husband is chairman of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), denied that they kept the public in the dark about the scale of the threat. Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has said that he may take a new coronavirus test, Reuters reports. The Brazilian leader said last week that he tested negative for the disease, after reports suggested that he tested positive. Appeals by the Iranian government for the nation to stay at home at the start of Iranian new year have been widely ignored with more than 1.2m taking to the roads, according to the Iranian police. Northern towns on the Caspian coast, one of the main holiday destinations, reported tens of thousands of cars trying to reach them. Latest figures published Friday showed Iran now has 19,644 cases of infection and 1,433 deaths. New infections in the past 24 hours was 1,237 and the number of new deaths 149. The number of new infections is a record for a single day, and the number of deaths, the same as the day before. Every layer of Iranian society, clerical army and national, as well as local government, had urged Iranians to stay at home at New Year, a time when Iranians traditionally travel to see friends and family and celebrate the coming of Spring. Authorities in Mashad, Iran’s second most populous city, and the capital of Khorasan-e Razavi province in the North West said traffic was only 2 % down on the previous year, despite calls by city councillors for people to stay away. Belgium has recorded its biggest daily rise in deaths since the beginning of the epidemic, a spokesman for the Belgian health ministry said on Friday. Authorities recorded 16 new deaths on Thursday because of coronavirus, for a total of 37 in the country, the biggest daily rise since the beginning of the epidemic. Belgian lockdown measures were imposed on Wednesday to contain the spread of coronavirus. In Spain, where new statistics revealed that the death toll in Spain has surged to 1,002, the country is scrambling to contain an epidemic that has spiralled into one of the worst in Europe. More than a third of the documented cases are in Madrid. On Friday, army specialists were set to begin entering care homes to help with disinfection after the virus claimed more than 50 lives at elderly care facilities across the region. While health authorities have warned that the peak of the crisis is still a few days away, those on the frontlines described beleaguered hospitals operating near capacity, their struggles exacerbated by a severe shortage of protective gear such as masks and gloves. “The current situation in hospitals in Madrid is critical,” said Ángela Hernández, of the Association of Doctors and Professionals in Madrid. “The health care system in a state of alarm.” Earlier this week, her association began offering – via telephone or email – free therapy to healthcare professionals in the region in hopes of helping them better cope with the crisis. Aranzazu Loa, whose 68-year-old mother is being treated for pneumonia in a hospital on the outskirts of Madrid, described a chaotic situation. “There are patients with pneumonia who have been left sitting on chairs in the emergency ward for 48 hours, forced to sleep in these chairs as they wait for the results of their Covid-19 tests,” she said. The regional leader of Madrid denied reports that healthcare workers were being forced to decide who gets potential life-saving care. “The healthcare system treats all patients equally,” Isabel Díaz Ayuso told broadcaster Antena 3. “No one is being singled out.” The country’s health minister on Thursday promised reinforcements for the system, announcing plans to recruit from groups such as medical students and recently retired physicians to add as many as 50,000 healthcare workers to the system. With the cruise ships gone and the souvenir stalls closed in Venice, the coronavirus lockdown has been transforming La Serenissima’s waterways, John Brunton reports for the Guardian. He writes: At the world-famous and usually overcrowded Rialto market, most of the fish and vegetable stalls are still open, though customers are few and far between. All markets are allowed to serve customers at a minimum one metre distance. In a queue to buy fish, Franco Fabris, an architect, reminisced: “When I was a kid growing up, there were far less boats in the canals and lots of kids would jump in and go swimming.” “For the moment I am not going out fishing as all the restaurants I supply have closed, so what is the point?” said Franco Folin, a fisherman. “But when this all over, we may well see more fish returning because for the moment pleasure fishing is prohibited – there will be an awful lot of extra marine life in the lagoon.” More than 1,000 people have now died in Spain from coronavirus, according to the Spanish government. Spain’s health ministry released figures on Friday recording that there are 19,980 people infected, with 1,141 admitted to the intensive care units and 1,002 dead. Fernando Simón, the director of the Ministry’s Health Emergency Coordination Centre has warned that “the data is very likely to underestimate reality”. YouTube has followed Netflix’s lead in reducing video quality across Europe, according to a Reuters report, to help the continent’s internet service providers cope with the increased usage as social distancing continues. All YouTube videos will now play in standard definition by default for viewers in the EU, a move which should substantially reduce the bandwidth used by visitors to the Google-owned website. The decision follows Netflix’s announcement that it would reduce the quality of its own streams, lowering its impact by 25% overall. Both companies were asked by the EU’s industry commissioner Thierry Breton to take action, amid concerns that networks could collapse if most people who would have been outside in the evening are instead at home consuming video content. Initial fears about broadband capacity rested on the rise in remote working, which led to speculation that residential broadband networks would not be able to cope. But in practice, daytime peaks have risen, while still remaining well below a typical evening peak. Like Netflix, YouTube’s decision also covers the UK, even though Britain has technically left the EU. The move comes on the day YouTube launched a special section of its site for verified Covid-19 news. Every user’s homepage now features a selection of videos from trusted local sources, including the Guardian, on the outbreak. The company has struggled to control the flow of misinformation around coronavirus, initially responding by “demonetising” any video on the topic to remove the incentive to sensationalise the story, but later reversing course in order to help fund well-made, accurate content. Malaysia will mobilise the army to help enforce curbs on movement aimed at reining in the coronavirus, the government said today as it grapples with the highest number of infections in south-east Asia. Malaysia reported 130 new infections on Friday, taking its total to 1,030, accounting for nearly 40% of those across south-east Asia. Since Wednesday, Malaysia has closed its borders, schools and non-essential businesses and ordered people to limit going outside, warning of a “tsunami” of cases if the curbs are not followed. But people continued to go to restaurants and parks, the defence minister, Ismail Sabri Yaakob, said. “The army will begin mobilising on Sunday,” he told a news briefing, according to the Reuters news agency. “We are confident with the army’s assistance, we would be better able to enforce this order.” Footage of an Irish funeral in which mourners have been respecting social distancing measures has been shared by an RTE journalist, Seán Mac an tSíthigh. Austria will extend its coronavirus restrictions until 13 April, the chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said today. After the country reported more than 2,200 coronavirus cases and six deaths from the global pandemic, he added, however, that the trend towards infections was “encouraging”. Authorities imposed severe restrictions on movement on Monday in response to the developments in Italy and a sharp increase in the number of coronavirus cases in some of its regions. “Hold tight,” Kurz addressed Austrians at a news conference. “We must not slow down. We must stick with the measures we have taken.” A growing number of musicians are heading online as Covid-19 puts live shows on pause. The Brighton band Metronomy were supposed to be playing sold-out dates in Portugal, Spain and France at the start of their European tour when the Covid-19 outbreak meant all their shows were cancelled. This week, instead of taking to the stage in Madrid, Adelekan has started giving online tutorials in bass and music production. This week Neil Young, Chris Martin of Coldplay, Keith Urban and pop-punk act Yungblud have all put on or promised impromptu online performances as most major concerts, festivals and gigs are cancelled until at least after the summer. For once, an entire country is begging for bad weather this weekend, as Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, said the behaviour of the population tomorrow will crucially influence whether her government will have to issue curfews from Monday. “Saturday is a crucial day, and we will keep a close eye on that”, the German chancellor’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, told news magazine Der Spiegel. “While people usually used their weekends to socialise with friends and relatives, “this is currently not an option outside the family core,” the CDU politician added. “If that doesn’t happen, then it could happen that the federal states have to take further measures that we would like to avoid”. Schools, nurseries, bars, nightclubs and non-essential shops have been closed in most parts of Germany since Tuesday, in an attempt to find a “third way” between a full lockdown and the more laissez-faire approach to curbing the spread of Covid-19 taken by the UK or the Netherlands. In Berlin, streets have been noticeably emptier throughout the day, but the measures to curb social interaction also seem to have led to an increase in the number of people going out for a run or a cycle in the park. On Sunday evening, Merkel will hold a phone conference with the premiers of Germany’s 16 federal states in which a full lockdown is expected to be discussed. The cities of Freiburg and Leverkusen have already announced lockdown plans of their own. Freiburg’s two-week ban comes into effect on Saturday, banning citizens from entering public places including streets, squares, public green spaces and parks. The British Museum has seen a surge in the number of online visitors with the top 10 searches including those for the Benin Bronzes, metal plaques and sculptures that decorated the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin, and the Lewis Chessmen, a group of distinctive 12th-century chess pieces. It said the number of online visitors between 1-18 March was 978,548, up from 472,890 in the same period last year. Most of the increase has happened over the last seven days. The largest number of online visitors are from Italy, 203,250 in March so far, followed by the UK (175,734), US (113,741), Spain (111,707), Turkey (54,133), Russia (22,764), Canada (15,610), Australia (15,575). The reasons are obvious. Every UK museum and gallery closed down this week so people self-isolating at home are desperate for a diversion. The top 10 searches are: ‘Egypt’, ‘Virtual tour’, ‘Benin bronzes’, ‘Rosetta stone’, ‘Netsuke franks’, ‘Lewis Chessmen’, ‘Virtual’, ‘Rosetta’, and ‘Vase Exekias.’ The museum’s director, Hartwig Fischer, said: “Culture gives comfort in times of turmoil, it unites us and makes us understand what it means to be human. As the world grapples with this current crisis, I am glad that so many people are coming to the website and online collections of the British Museum.” The UK’s chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, is self-isolating after showing symptoms of coronavirus. The news, which was reported by various sources today and attributed to the UK government comes after Frost’s EU counterpart, Michel Barnier said he had tested positive for the disease on Thursday Details are expected today of plans by the US and Mexico to halt much of cross-border travel without disrupting trade during the coronavirus outbreak. Mexican Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said he proposed steps to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that won’t paralyse economic activity and keep the border open to commerce and work. Pompeo said on Twitter that he was working closely with his Mexican counterpart on travel restrictions. Rail services in Scotland will move to a reduced timetable from Monday 23 March as people follow the extraordinary advice to limit social contact and stay at home. Network Rail Scotland and ScotRail announced they would be operating a reduced service so emergency staff can travel and will prioritise moving goods and emergency supplies such as medicines can be moved around the country. David Simpson, ScotRail operations director, said: “We are facing an unprecedented challenge on Scotland’s Railway and the revised timetable will help to provide a critical service for the key workers across the country. “Our own people are absolutely committed and are working flat out on the frontline to help keep the country moving, while also keeping themselves and customers safe. Scottish transport secretary Michael Matheson said the government is in discussions with rail unions to protect rail staff during unprecedented times. “We are also investigating ways to provide proportionate relief to operators, while also ensuring contractual incentives remain to mitigate the impact of doing so. Any changes to rail franchise contracts, including funding mechanisms, will be made in the best interests of the public and business communities.” Confirmed cases of Covid-19 in South Africa have risen by 52 to 202, according to the country’s health minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize. He is giving a press conference now which is being livestreamed here The virus has multiplied in Africa more slowly than in Asia or Europe, but the number of cases has started to rise more rapidly in South Africa in recent days. Twitter won’t be removing a tweet from Elon Musk that claims that children are “basically immune” to Covid-19, a day after committing to remove misinformation related to the disease, the company says. Musk came under fire on Thursday night for tweeting: The claim isn’t supported by the evidence, which suggests that children can and do catch the virus, with many becoming seriously ill around the world, and many more helping to spread the disease further while suffering mild or no symptoms. While death rates remain low for under-18s, a March paper in the journal Pediatrics concluded “children at all ages were susceptible to COVID-19”. But, in a statement given to tech site The Verge, Twitter said it would not be enforcing its new rules on medical misinformation against Musk. “When reviewing the overall context and conclusion of the Tweet, it does not break our rules”, the company said. “We’ll continue to consult with trusted partners such as health authorities to identify content that is most harmful.” Musk has been talking down the risk of Covid-19 for some time. On March 6, he tweeted: https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1236029449042198528 He has told employees at one of his companies, SpaceX, that “the risk of death from C19 is vastly less than the risk of death from driving your car home.” He did not deploy the same metaphor at another of his companies, which makes cars, but instead told Tesla employees that they should continue working at his Fremont, California, factory unless they were showing symptoms, despite a shelter-in-place order in the San Francisco Bay Area. Musk was eventually overruled by the local sheriff’s office. Britain’s bus operators have called on the government to provide £1bn in immediate help to maintain critical services as passenger numbers fall away with the coronavirus. Operators say passenger numbers have already fallen by more than half outside London, with a loss of £50million per week in revenues, even before the closure of schools. While the government had pledged to deliver £5bn in additional funding over five years to the industry, with the importance of bus services having risen up the political agenda before the coronavirus outbreak, bus firms now say they need a first tranche simply to guarantee income and support staff costs to maintain vital routes. Graham Vidler, chief executive of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents bus companies, said: “Operators are under extreme pressure and facing impossible choices over which routes they have to cut and how many staff may have to go.” Firms collectively employ around 100,000 drivers and 120,000 support staff, whose jobs are at risk. In Britain, BT is to remove all caps on home broadband plans to give customers unlimited data while working from home or self-isolating. The BT Group, which also includes mobile network EE, said it wanted to help people stay connected during periods of isolation because of the coronavirus outbreak. If comes after the firm said it was among networks in talks with the Government over allowing ministers to use anonymised mobile data to monitor whether people are following social distancing measures. An iconic Italian deli which has served London for more than 75 years is raising money so it can supply pasta and sauce to people in need amid the coronavirus crisis, reports London’s Evening Standard. Lina Stores, which has a site in Soho and another in King’s Cross, wants to make provisions for hospitality staff whose jobs have been cut and people in at risk groups. “We want to look after London - the community that has been supporting us for over 75 years,” the store, which opened in the 1940s, said in a Go Fund Me page, which has raised more than £11,000 so far and has an aim of £20,000. It sounds like a plot from the Police Academy films: hundreds of trainee cadets, some just a few weeks into their training, are sworn in and assigned to active duty to deal with a national crisis. A trope that Hollywood screenwriters have long used in various forms but on Friday it’s a deadly serious reality in Ireland where 319 students will be sworn in at the Garda College in Templemore, county Tipperary, to deal with the coronavirus emergency. The Garda commissioner, Drew Harris, and justice minister, Charlie Flanagan will preside over a brief attestation ceremony that will observe social distancing protocols. Some 124 tutors and instructors from the college are also being deployed to frontline policing. The eight-acre campus may be turned into an improvised health facility. On Thursday the parliament passed draconian legislation to allow police detain people who breach self-isolation instructions. It came as the Health Service Executive reported another 191 cases, bringing Ireland’s total to 557. Simon Coveney, the tánaiste and foreign minister said political leadership and people’s actions would determine whether Covid-19 “kills hundreds of people, thousands of people or tens of thousands of people in Ireland”. The Guardian’s Editor-in-chief, Katherine Viner, has written to readers about how we aim to cover the Coronavirus crisis, emphasising the value of expertise, scientific knowledge and careful judgment in our reporting She writes: With you, we are trying to face this unsettling moment with fortitude, and we’re remembering our history – the Guardian and Observer continued to publish throughout the 1918 flu pandemic and both world wars, and we will do our best to do the same during this global coronavirus pandemic. Read on here Sales at the UK chain Wetherspoons have been falling sales after Prime Minister Boris Johnson told members of the public to stay at home and not visit Britain’s pubs. The pub chain said that sales, which had risen by 3.2% in the previous six weeks, started falling by 4.5% in the week ending March 15, as the coronavirus pandemic scared customers off. The decline picked up even further when the Prime Minister told people that it was vital they do not visit pubs in order to slow the spread of the highly infectious disease. “In the early part of the current week ... sales have declined at a significantly higher rate,” Wetherspoons chairman Tim Martin said in a statement to shareholders on Friday. Earlier this week the Guardian reported on how staff at the pub chain had spoken of their fears about having to continue working in busy pub environments without masks, hand gel or other protective equipment. They spoke out as the company announced that its pubs would remain open – but customers will pay by card, avoid standing at the bar and sit at alternate tables. “We’re effectively going to become Petri dishes,” said one worker who said that he and others should be provided with hand gel, gloves and face masks. “We come into contact all day with the general public, we handle money, dirty plates, glasses, sometimes bodily fluids, and the fact we can’t wear a mask/gloves front of house is making people feel on edge. We of course are washing our hands as often as possible but it’s just bizarre we aren’t allowed to protect ourselves.” France has tightened the rules of who can go out by banning sports cycling and demanding runners and walkers limit the distance they take from home to a maximum 1-2km and 20minutes. A statement from a cycling body reads: “Faced with the COVID-9 epidemic the French Federation of Cycling asks all cyclists to show their responsibility and avoid all cycling outside during this period. Remember the rule: “Save lives! Stay at home!” The cycling rule is thought to apply only to those cycling for sport. Those using their bikes for essential shopping or work journeys - and carrying the correct papers - are expected to be allowed to continue, subject to policing. French government spokesperson Sibeth Ndiaye warned the confinement rules were likely to be tightened further. “We see quite irresponsible behaviour, people going to beach to the park. We have to tighten the restrictions. the fines are now 135 and their application is strict; Those who haven’t the right to go out, who don’t have their justification document, who overstep the regulations will be sanctioned,” Ndiaye said. Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo has said he would use “all state power” to tackle the health and economic problems caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Authorities launched rapid testing for the disease today in areas where there have been cases of the virus, Widodo told reporters. A scramble by the UK to produce thousands of ventilators to fight the coronavirus outbreak was achieving results as top companies have already produced a prototype and it should be ready for use in hospitals by the end of next week, according to Britain’s health secretary. “More than half a dozen companies have already made one in prototype, to check with us that we are happy with the quality ,” Matt Hancock told BBC TV. He also said that negotiations were advancing to purchase new equipment in large numbers that would enable home testing. “Frankly I don’t care where it comes from as long as we can get our hands on it,” he told the Today Programme on BBC Radio 4. The tests had only recently been invented and approved by regulators in the past couple of days, he added. Separately, he said that the UK government was looking “very, very closely” at why there is a coronavirus hotspot in England’s Midlands. Asked on Sky News about 28 deaths recorded in the West Midlands, he said: “There is a hotspot, not as big as in London, but there is a hotspot in the Midlands. A critical care nurse in Britain has made a tearful appeal to members of the public to stop stripping supermarket shelves of food after she came off a shift and was unable to buy supplies for her family. “Those people who are stripping the shelves of basic foods. You just need to stop it because it is people like me who will be looking after you when you are at your lowest, so just stop it,” said the nurse, named as Dawn. The recording was played this morning to Britain’s Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who told the BBC’s Today programme that his heart went out to people like Dawn. He said that people should follow the guidance which has aleady been set out but the government “would do whatever it takes” if necessary. Spain is preparing new flights today to Guayaquil, Ecuador, where the local mayor ordered trucks on to the runway yesterday to prevent a plane from landing. That’s according to Spain’s Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez, who was speaking after the European Union asked Ecuador to guarantee access to its airports to ensure it can airlift citizens out of the South American nation. The Iberia flight which was unable to land was planning to repatriate 190 EU citizens. A journalist at TeleSur has tweeted some footage of how the incident unfolded on Thursday. Cirque du Soleil, the world famous entertainment company, has announced it is temporarily laying off 4,679 employees - some 95 percent of its workforce. With schools and universities in the UK now relying on digital services for their switch to remote learning, parents and students are already complaining that residential internet speeds are slowing down dramatically. The Department for Education in England says it is engaging directly with telecommunications providers to try and fix the problem: “The government is having regular calls with the major fixed and mobile operators, and with Ofcom, to monitor the situation and ensure that any problems on the networks are rapidly addressed and rectified. “We fully understand the importance of having reliable internet connectivity at this time, so that people can work from home wherever possible and access critical public services online, including health information.“ A 36-year-old Australian man diagnosed with Covid-19 has died in Iceland, while his wife has been quarantined with the illness. However, doctors said the man’s symptoms were atypical for the novel coronavirus, and although he had the illness they are continuing to investigate the cause of his death, Iceland’s national broadcaster reported. “While he was found to be infected with the coronavirus, it is unlikely to have been the cause of his death,” epidemiologist Dr Thorolfur Gudnason, the chief of the health directorate’s national vaccination program, told public broadcaster RUV. “His symptoms came on very quickly and were not those usually associated with Covid-19 deaths.” France will consider taking additional measures to limit people’s movements if necessary, the country’s foreign minister has said. News about those comments from Jean-Yves Le Drian are just breaking on Reuters now and we’ll bring you more as we hear them. It’s worth nothing however that the French state has implemented some of the strictest rules on movement already in Europe. Following Italy and Spain, France went into lockdown last Tuesday, with people allowed to leave their homes only to buy food and other essential supplies, travel to work if unavoidable, exercise or attend medical appointments. It’s another day of carnage in the business world, with aviation in the firing line. In Finland, the government has said it will guarantee Finnair’s €600m (£550m) pension premium loan to aid the flag carrier hit by coronavirus along with other airlines. Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways will survive the coronavirus epidemic, its chief executive said in a video released today, a day after the industry’s largest body warned that Middle East airlines were in crisis. The EU would be open to a possible request from Britain for the delaying of the UK’s departure from the European Union, according to the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen. She was speaking on German radio. The Guardian reported last week that Britain, which entered an 11-month transition period earlier this year, will have to guarantee “uniform implementation” of Brussels’s state subsidy rules. Good morning from London. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog, which will be bringing you coverage of global developments and also important ones from here in Britain. In the UK, parents are waking up to learn further details of how nursery and school places will be provided for key workers including health service, communications and police staff. After waiting all day yesterday, the UK government last night finally published details setting out whose children would be allowed to continue at their schools and nurseries. We have covered that story here. Parents and young people in the UK are also awaiting further clarity today on how qualifications will be awarded after summer school tests were hit by school closures. Also in Britain, Rishi Sunak, Britain’s chancellor of the exchequer, is to unveil an emergency package aimed at protecting workers’ jobs and wages as they face hardship in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. If you’re just joining us or coming back for updates, these are the main developments: The governor of California has ordered all citizens to stay at home as he escalated attempts to combat Covid-19 in America’s most populous state. Gavin Newsom earlier wrote to Donald Trump to warn that 25.5 million people in the state could contract the virus. Train services in Britain will be wound down to a minimum from Monday. Passenger numbers have dropped 70% in the outbreak. Key workers will be able to keep their children in school when they close on Monday. Researchers at Oxford University are racing to develop a UK vaccine against coronavirus with the hope of making it available by the end of the year. The number of deaths in Italy has passed the total in China to make it the worst-affected country in the world with 3,405 fatalities. Southern and central Italy are braced for a “tsunami” of cases. Three passengers who left a cruise ship in Sydney on Thursday have tested positive. Officials have implored around 2,700 other passengers who left the ship to self-isolate. Australia’s PM has told people to “reconsider” domestic travel. Argentina has gone into lockdown, Haiti has closed its borders and Chile has postponed a constitutional referendum. Thailand, where cases rose sharply again, will require all visitors from abroad to present a health certificate confirming they virus-free. Stock markets in Asia have had a better day and oil prices have risen. The FTSE100 is set to rise 2.25% this morning but some believe a new credit crunch will create a wave of defaults in the corporate world. Donald Trump has cancelled the G7 meeting at Camp David. It will now be carried out by teleconference. It’s been a mixed day on Asia Pacific stock markets so far. Concerns about the economic impact of the outbreak have been soothed slightly by massive stimulus packages in the US, Europe, Asia and Australia. But investors were still cautious in Japan where the Nikkei finished down 1% today. Sydney was up 0.74% despite a very strong start while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index has risen more than 4%. The FTSE100 is set to lift 2.25% at the opening bell and the US benchmark S&amp;P500 is on course to rise 1.5%. Our long read today is a fascinating insight into the coronavirus outbreak as seen from the frontline. Despite the growing death toll and the unprecedented speed at which events are moving, the past few weeks feel like just a prelude of what is to come, writes Gavin Francis, a GP in Scotland. In another sign of the tightening lockdown in Britain, train services will start to be reduced from Monday. Timetables will be progressively thinned out to reflect the 70% drop in passenger numbers since the outbreak started to take hold. The exact number of services will be left for operators to decide but they must maintain enough trains for key workers and for the public to access medical appointments, as well as ensuring the flow of goods by rail. Gwyn Topham, our transport correspondent, has the full story: My colleague Helen Davidson has filed a wrap of the day’s main developments so far. It includes details about the worsening outbreak in the US and how China has reported no new locally transmitted cases for the second day running. Here it is: In the UK, the department of education has issued a list of key workers who will still be able to send their children to school despite them being closed from Monday. They include health workers, nursery care staff and those involved in food production and distribution. Here’s the full list: And more from Japan where Justin McCurry reports that a senior member of the Japan Olympic Committee [JOC] has called for this summer’s Tokyo games to be postponed. She echoed concerns that athletes will not be able to prepare due to the massive disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. “It should be postponed under the current situation, in which athletes can’t be well prepared,” Kaori Yamaguchi, who won a bronze medal in judo at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, told the Nikkei business daily in an interview published on Friday. Yamaguchi, the first JOC board member to call openly Tokyo 2020 to be postponed, criticised the International Olympic Committee [IOC] for insisting that the Games would open as scheduled on 24 July. Yamaguchi said the IOC, which is reportedly “considering different scenarios” for the Games, could put athletes’ health at risk if it decided there was no alternatives to holding them this summer. Yamagushi’s intervention came as the Olympic torch arrived in Japan to begin its journey to the main stadium in Tokyo. The torch relay will begin next Thursday at J-Village, a soccer training centre that served as an operations base for workers who battled triple meltdowns at the nearby Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Organisers have asked people not to line the relay route for the first few days, and similar restrictions may go into effect as the torch continues its 121-day journey through Japan. South Korea and China support Japan holding a “complete” Olympics, the South Korean foreign ministry has said, according to Reuters. The ministers held a video conference to discuss cooperation on the coronavirus pandemic amid growing concerns over the number of infected people arriving in their countries from overseas. Our Africa correspondent, Jason Burke, has been looking at how the continent’s fragile health systems might cope with a sustained outbreak of the virus. He’s spoken to officials in Nigeria where they are scrambling to add isolation beds and provide more specialised medical training and equipment at state hospitals. “Our health system is not as strong as we’d like it to be,” said Chikwe Ihekweazu, the head of Nigeria’s Centre for Disease Control. “It is because we are a bit worried about our capacity to deal with a large outbreak.” Here’s his full story: And on the other side of the world, cases are increasing in New Zealand. From Sunday, Thailand will require all visitors from abroad to present a health certificate confirming that they have been tested and are free from the coronavirus. This is effectively a travel ban in all but name. Given the shortages of tests globally, it will be almost impossible for most people to obtain a certificate. The announcement comes as the Thai government faces pressure to impose tougher measures to stop the virus, which appears to have spread more rapidly over the past week. The government reported 50 new coronavirus cases on Friday, taking the total to 322. Most infections have been recorded in Bangkok.The government has shut down schools, universities across the country, while entertainment venues - such as gyms, cinemas and bars - have been asked to close in the capital. There’s so much going on that I’ll just a quick roundup of some other developments around the world: Malaysia will deploy the army from Sunday to assist police in enforcing a a partial lockdown. Nasa’s planned new moonshot is the latest victim of the virus. The space agency has ordered the temporary closure of two rocket production facilities after an employee tested positive for the illness. It will likely delay plans to return astronauts to the moon in 2024. Iran’s president says that the country can fight the virus “with unity”. Vietnam will temporarily suspend visa-free travel for citizens of Japan, Belarus and Russia from Saturday. An Australian tourist has reportedly died of the disease in Iceland. Thailand has 50 new coronavirus infections, taking its tally to 322, a health official said on Friday. The majority are in Bangkok. A group of 41 new cases is linked to earlier infections, while another, of nine, centres on overseas arrivals and contact with foreigners, Suwannachai Wattanayingcharoenchai, director-general of the disease control department, told a news conference. If you’re just joining us or popping back for updates, these are the main developments in the past few hours: The governor of California has ordered all citizens to stay at home as he escalated the attempts of America’s most populous state to combat Covid-19. Gavin Newsom earlier wrote to Donald Trump to warn that 25.5 million people in the state could contract the virus – roughly 56% of the population. Another eight people have died in the worst-affected US state, Washington. The number of deaths in Italy has passed the total in China to make it the worst-affected country in the world with 3,405 fatalities. Southern and central Italy are braced for a “tsunami” of cases. Three passengers who left a cruise ship in Sydney on Thursday have tested positive. Officials have implored around 2,700 other passengers who left the ship to self-isolate. Australia’s PM has told people to “reconsider” domestic travel and he has delayed the federal budget from May to October. Researchers at Oxford University are racing to develop a UK vaccine against coronavirus with the hope of making it available by the end of the year. British PM Boris Johnson told his daily media conference that the country could turn the tide on the virus in “12 weeks”. Argentina has gone into lockdown, Haiti has closed its borders and Chile has postponed a constitutional referendum. Stock markets in Asia are enjoying a better day and oil prices have risen, helped by massive state intervention around the world. The Bank of England has cut rates to 0.1%, US Republicans propose giving each American $1,200 and Europe is rolling out packages worth 1.7 trillion euros. But some investors believe a new credit crunch will create a wave of defaults in the corporate world. Trump has cancelled the G7 meeting at Camp David. It will now be carried out by teleconference. If you’re wondering about how you might cope with life under social distancing, look no further than our UK podcast. Zoe Williams has spent the week researching tips for life under a new regime of social distancing and self-isolation. She tells Anushka Asthana it is important to give yourself a break amid the hardships. Following on from our earlier post about the Olympic flame’s arrival in Japan, an official from the Japan Olympic Committee has urged a delay of the Tokyo 2020 Games. “It should be postponed under the current situation where athletes can’t be well prepared,” Kaori Yamaguchi, a JOC executive board member, told the Nikkei daily in an interview published on Friday. Yamaguchi, who won a bronze medal for judo at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, is the first JOC board member to call openly for a postponement of the Tokyo Games, which are scheduled to open on 24 July. Organisers have scrapped qualifiers and scaled back test events, while many countries have imposed travel bans. The International Olympic Committee, which will take the final decision on whether to proceed as scheduled, has voiced its commitment to the Games going ahead. Yamaguchi criticised the IOC stance, saying the body “is putting athletes at risk.” “By asking them to train under these conditions, the IOC is opening itself up the criticism that it is not putting athletes first,” Yamaguchi told the newspaper. “Unlike other sporting events, the Olympics symbolise the ideal that sports bring about world peace,” she said. The Olympics should not be held “if people across the world can’t enjoy themselves,” she said. Australia to keep schools open Back to that press conference in Australia and the country’s chief medical office Brendan Murphy has confirmed that schools are still advised to stay open. This has been one of the most contentious elements of the Australian government’s response to the outbreak so far, with many asking why Australia has not followed the lead of other countries, including the UK this week, of shutting down schools. Brendan Murphy is addressing that question now: I think it is really important to recognise that, as we’ve said before, we think the risk to children with this virus is very low. Only 2.4% of all the cases in China in Hubei Province were under 19, and there have been very, very few significant cases. Obviously we do have some concerns that children may have a role in transmission but most children who have seemed to have got the virus have got it from adults as you’ve seen in this case. We think keeping children at home when there is relatively no community spread is probably disproportionate given they probably won’t stay at home anyway. They may be cared for by elderly parents. There may be circumstances where there are outbreaks in an area where we do need to close schools for a period of time. Our strategy is in the for the next six months to keep schools open and we think that risk is appropriate. China has taken the highly unusual move of exonerating a doctor who was reprimanded for warning about the coronavirus outbreak and later died of the disease. The official China News Service late Tuesday said police in the city of Wuhan had revoked its admonishment of Dr Li Wenliang that had included a threat of arrest and issued a “solemn apology” to his family. It said two police officers had been issued disciplinary punishments” for the original handling of the matter, without giving further details. In death, Li became the face of simmering anger at the ruling Communist Party’s controls over information and complaints that officials lie about or hide disease outbreaks, industrial accidents, natural disasters and financial frauds, while punishing whistleblowers and independent journalists. The 33-year-old ophthalmologist died in early February at Wuhan Central Hospital, where he worked and likely contracted the virus while treating patients in the early days of the outbreak. After seeing thousands of new cases daily at the peak of the city’s outbreak a month ago, Wuhan on Friday had its second consecutive day with no new confirmed or suspected cases. The health ministry said all of the 39 new cases recorded nationwide Friday were brought from overseas, showing that rigid travel restrictions and social distancing requirements appear to have had their desired effect. China has loosened some travel restrictions in Hubei, the province surrounding Wuhan, although its provincial border remains closed and Wuhan itself remains under lockdown. Officials say they will only lift the quarantine after Wuhan goes 14 consecutive days with no new cases. Australian PM announces further social restrictions but urges people to ‘keep Australia running’ Australia’s prime minister Scott Morrison has addressed the country, saying that as long as “we continue to work together in the way we are... Australia will bounce back strongly”. There is a way through this. We all need to keep going. I need all of you to keep going. And we are going to keep going to keep Australia running. All Australians have a role to play as we make our way through, and there is a way through. There will be additional cases. This is something we should be continuing to expect. This is anticipated. The presence of additional cases is not something of itself that should cause alarm, because at the end of the day you don’t stop this virus, but you can defeat it by slowing it down. And that is how we save lives. Among the social restrictions announced by Morrison today, are: Any gatherings of up to 100 people (larger gatherings are banned) must allow for four sq metres of space per person. People should avoid “unnecessary travel for the upcoming school holidays. Additional funding to support aged care facilities All non-essential travel into remote indigenous communities banned. Warnings of region-specific shutdowns if community transmission is identified in particular parts of the country. Morrison also announced that the country’s budget – normally announced in May – would be delayed until October. Panama, which is a major regional travel hub for Central America, has announced it is suspending all international flights from Monday. The measure will see no international inbound or outbound flights from Tocumen International Airport, the region’s busiest airport with connecting flights to many other destinations in Central and South America. President Laurentino Cortizo made the announcement on Twitter and said the suspension would last 30 days. Panama has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in Central America, which jumped from 109 to 137 on Thursday. Cargo, humanity and domestic flights will continue as normal, the President Cortizo said. A second dog has tested positive for coronavirus in Hong Kong. Like the first, this one is showing no symptoms and there remains no evidence that a dog can pass the virus back to a human. It too was picked up from a home where its owner had been diagnosed with Covid-19. The German Shepherd was sent for quarantine with another mixed breed dog, which tested negative. The department of agriculture said it would continue to monitor and repeatedly test both dogs. “It strongly advises that mammalian pet animals including dogs and cats from households with people confirmed as infected with Covid-19, or close contacts of Covid-19 infected people, should be put under quarantine in AFCD facilities,” the statement said. “Pet owners are reminded to maintain good hygiene practices and under no circumstances should they abandon their pets.” There’s anger in the US at Republican politicians who sold stocks after receiving classified briefings about the deteriorating public health situation despite giving public assurances that everything was under control. There’s more on this story here. Three passengers on board the Ruby Princess cruise ship in Sydney have tested positive for Covid-19, the health minister of New South Wales says. The tests, done on board, were originally for the flu, but were tested for Covid-19. Of the 13 tested, three tested positive. NSW authorities are now worried the nearly 2700 people who were also on that cruise, may not know Covid-19 was present on the ship. They want all passengers on the Ruby Princess to go into self-isolation. Anyone who shows symptoms should immediately contact their GP The Olympic flame has arrived in Japan, writes Justin McCurry in Tokyo, as uncertainty grows over whether it would reach its destination in Tokyo in July due to the coronavirus pandemic. A chartered plane carrying the torch arrived at an airbase in northeastern Japan on Friday morning amid reports that the International Olympic Committee [IOC] was examining alternatives for the Games, which are currently due to open on 24 July. The New York Times reported that the IOC’s president, Thomas Bach, said the organisation was “considering different scenarios” for Tokyo 2020 [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games-2020] – the first time Bach has publicly suggested that there may be alternatives to holding the Games this summer. The torch relay in Greece was cancelled to avoid drawing crowds and the handover ceremony was open to a small number of officials and journalists. The torch will be displayed in areas of north-east Japan affected by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which killed more than 18,000 people, before beginning the first part of its Japan leg in Fukushima [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/04/japan-lifts-evacuation-order-futaba-town-fukushima-disaster], where the disaster caused a nuclear meltdown, next Thursday. Organisers have urged spectators not to line the route during the opening stages of the relay, and similar restrictions could be put in place as the flame makes its way through Japan’s 47 prefectures in the coming weeks. Runners and staff will have their temperature and health monitored, the organisers said. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, added to speculation that the Tokyo Olympics could be postponed after telling reporters this week that Group of Seven leaders had voiced support for a “complete” Games – an increasingly distant prospect given that athletes in countries severely affected by the outbreak are unable to prepare or qualify for their event. Abe’s deputy, Taro Aso, said holding the Olympics as scheduled made “no sense” if some countries were unable to send athletes. The IOC said earlier this week that only 57% of athletes had so far qualified for the Olympics, after the coronavirus outbreak disrupted qualifying tournaments. Abe reportedly told other G7 leaders during an emergency video conference on Monday that he had yet to decide on whether to support postponing the Games. “We did discuss it,” Trump told reporters on Thursday. “[Abe] has told us that he has not made a decision as to what to do,” Trump said, adding that the Japanese leader faced a “big decision”. Here’s more of what California governor Gavin Newsom told people in the state on Thursday afternoon local time. We direct a statewide order for people to stay at home. That order goes into effect this evening. We are confident the people of California will abide by it. If we meet this moment, we can truly bend the curve to reduce the need to have to go out and to cobble all those assets together. I don’t believe the people of CA need to be told by law enforcement it’s appropriate to home-isolate, go about the essential patterns of life, but do so by socially distancing yourselves from others and using common sense. The state was facing hospitalization rate of 20% — about 19,543 people that would need to be hospitalized, above the existing capacity of the system, he said. We’ve got more on the dramatic escalation in California’s attempts to limit the spread of coronavirus. Shortly before issuing his stay at home order, governor Gavin Newsom said 56% of California residents were expected to contract Covid-19 over the next eight weeks. It would require nearly 20,000 more hospital beds than the state could currently provide. Here’s the story: Newsom had earlier on Thursday asked Donald Trump to send a US Navy hospital ship to Los Angeles “immediately”. The city, the nation’s second-largest city, would likely be “disproportionately impacted” by the pandemic in the coming weeks, he said. And here’s how the order might work: Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro has news of stranded cruise ship passengers being flown home from Brazil. Hundreds of British, European, Australian and New Zealand citizens stranded in the Brazilian port of Recife in the Northeastern state of Pernambuco on a cruise-liner will began flying home on Friday. A chartered Latam flight will take 116 British passengers and crew and 15 Europeans from Recife to Heathrow at 21.30 Friday night. Veejay Rangarajan, the UK’s ambassador in Brazil, tweeted the news on Thursday night. “I’m delighted,” he posted. “Thanks to all the passengers for their patience and resilience.” The passengers have been confined to their cabins on the Silver Shadow cruise liner since it docked in Recife on March 12 and a Canadian male passenger aged 78 felt sick. He later tested positive for Covid-19 and is hospitalised in serious condition, a spokesman for the Pernambuco state government said. His Canadian wife has also since tested positive but has milder symptoms. An Irish woman passenger earlier tested negative. The Australian government did not immediately comment on reports that a separate flight carrying 25 Australians and two New Zealanders will leave Recife at 5pm. There are also 103 Americans on board and the US consulate in Recife said it is continuing to work to “facilitate the return of all U.S. citizen passengers aboard the Silver Shadow to the United States”. California’s governor has issued a statewide “stay at home” order to residents, telling them to leave their homes only when necessary during the coronavirus pandemic. The stock markets have taken a terrible battering in recent weeks but although they are showing signs of recovery today – the Nikkei is down just 1% while stimulus-rich Australia is up 4% – trouble looms in the international credit markets. I’ve been speaking to investors and economists who say that the crisis has exposed deep-seated weaknesses in the global financial system. Angus Coote, of Jamieson Coote Bonds in Melbourne, says the corporate world is heading for a wave of bankruptcies as companies struggle to rollover debt because borrowing costs (as shown by so-called credit spreads) have spiked so much as risk has increased. He says this will make the GFC look like “child’s play”. Here’s the full story: South Korea has reported 87 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total infections to 8,652, the country’s disease control centre said on Friday. As I mentioned in the summary at the top, Argentina has announced a nationwide lockdown until the end of the month. The country has so far recorded 128 cases including three deaths. Our correspondent in Buenos Aires, Uki Goni, has this dispatch: Argentina is going into an obligatory nationwide quarantine until atleast March 31, President Alberto Fernández announced Thursday night, just two and half hours before the measure goes into effect at the stroke of midnight. “This means nobody can move from their place of residence, everybody has to stay home,” the president said in a televised address. Police and other security forces will be patrolling the streets to enforce the measure, Fernández said. Only supermarkets, neighbourhood grocery stores, drugstores and some other shops such as neighbourhood hardware stores will be allowed to remain open. The only permitted outings will be to shop for food, medicine and walk pets. No jogging or outdoor walking will be allowed. Banks, shopping malls, restaurants, entertainment venues and most other stores will remain closed. “We are going to be completely inflexible,” the president said. “This truly is an exceptional measure at an exceptional moment, but it is absolutely within the framework of what democracy allows.” The president left the door open for prolonging the measure should the spread of the disease demand it. Authorities announced the highest daily coronavirus jump Thursday, with 31 new cases, bringing the total to 128 cases since the first cases were made public on March 5. There have been three deaths so far. Of the 31 new cases, 20 correspond to recent arrivals from countries where coronavirus is widespread, five from contacts with some of these persons and six cases whose source of contagion has not yet been determined. Figures released in China on Friday morning say that the country has gone a second successive day without recording any new locally transmitted cases. However, China had 39 new confirmed cases on Thursday, the country’s health commission said, all of which were imported, Reuters reports. Of the new imported infections, 14 were in Guangdong, eight in Shanghai and six in Beijing, the health authority said on Friday. China’s total cases so far is 80,967, with 3,245 deaths. Australian banks have granted small businesses a six-month loan deferral as part of the country’s ongoing economic measures to soften the impact of the outbreak. You can follow all the developments there with our separate Australia-focused blog. On Thursday the central bank cut the main interest rate to zero as the nation faces its first recession for nearly 30 years. A plane will arrive in Japan from Greece today carrying the Olympic torch amid mounting concern about whether the Games will go ahead in Tokyo as planned in late July. The flame will be taken to Japan’s north-western coast which was ravaged by a tsunami, earthquake and nuclear disaster in 2011. The welcome ceremony will have no spectators. Japan’s deputy PM said on Thursday that the Olympics are “cursed” by world events every 40 years. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the main developments: The number of deaths in Italy has passed the total in China to make it the worst-affected country in the world with 3,405 fatalities compared with 3,245. Southern and central Italy are braced for a “tsunami” of cases as the outbreak spreds from the badly hit northern regions. Researchers at Oxford University are racing to develop a UK vaccine against coronavirus with the hope of making it available by the end of the year. Donald Trump claimed a malaria treatment would be ready to help combat Covid-19 in the US before he was contradicted by officials. The governor of California has written to Trump saying that 25.5 million people in the state could contract the virus – roughly 56% of the population. Another eight people have died in the worst-affected state, Washington. Argentina has gone into lockdown, Haiti has closed its borders and Chile has postponed a constitutional referendum Governments and central banks around the world have stepped up their stimulus response. The Bank of England has cut rates to 0.1%, US Republicans propose giving each American $1,200 and Europe is rolling out packages worth 1.7 trillion euros. Trump has cancelled the G7 meeting at Camp David.

The work will lead to vital improvements to sea defences, coastal buildings and evacuation plans, ultimately saving lives. Five major tsunamis have struck coasts around the world since 2004, killing 300,000 people, and the risks are rising as coastal cities expand. But the terrible violence of the giant waves means any scientific instruments present are almost always destroyed. The result is little knowledge of the huge forces with which tsunamis hit coasts. Now researchers have created the world’s most realistic tsunami simulator at the HR Wallingford research centre in Oxfordshire. The 70m-long tank can, for the first time, replicate the shape and long duration of the tsunamis that wrought havoc around the Indian Ocean in 2004 and smashed into Japan in 2011. The simulator is also the first to look at how clusters of buildings affect the destruction caused by a tsunami, by channelling the flowing water. “Tsunamis can be exceptionally destructive when they hit buildings, yet we really don’t know a great deal about how the massive horizontal forces they generate cause damage,” said Prof Tiziana Rossetto, from University College London (UCL), who is leading the research. “The challenge has been to build a testing facility where we can accurately model how the forces change or are magnified by the way buildings are clustered together in coastal towns and cities.” “Our research will have far-reaching implications for both building and urban design in areas at risk of tsunamis and could help mitigate some of the most devastating risks to human lives,” she said. One application will be making better designs for vertical evacuation structures, tall buildings used as refuges in flat coastal areas. The new tsunami simulator is built at 1:50 scale and is 4m wide. In the real world, underwater earthquakes trigger tsunamis, but in the simulator a pump at one end of the tank is used to raise up 70,000 litres of water. Then an air valve is used to let the water flood back into the tank, setting off the tsunami. Crucially, the initial lifting of the water allows, for the first time, the creation of a wave that starts with a trough – the type of tsunami that hit Japan and Thailand. In the real world, this trough manifests as the water on the beach rushing out to sea, before a huge crest races back on to land. “We are the only facility in the world that can generate trough-led waves,” said Rossetto. She visited sites in Sri Lanka and Thailand after the 2004 tsunami: “In some places the buildings completely failed, but in others they stayed standing. However, there was a total lack of understanding of the forces involved.” The second vital feature of the new simulator is the air valve, which allows the wave to be controlled and creates very long duration waves like those seen in the real world. In Japan, the wave continuously poured water on to the land for 28 minutes, while in Thailand the wave lasted for 20 minutes. Earlier simulators, using paddles or dropped concrete blocks, could only produce short waves and did not replicate the punishing duration of the real tsunamis. The researchers also looked at what happens when sea defences break down after being hit by a tsunami. “However big a wall is, you have to consider what happens when it fails,” said Prof William Allsop, technical director at HR Wallingford. The researchers suspect that very high sea walls could actually make the impact of a tsunami worse by effectively creating a dam, against which water builds up, before breaking and releasing an even more violent torrent. “You can see [in the tank] the carnage that occurs when the wall fails,” said Dr David McGovern, part of the UCL team. “We are looking to give engineers who design buildings, defences, nuclear power stations, an idea of what the forces are for a tsunami. We also want to use the data to improve evacuation procedures.” Early results have already shown that in many cases tsunamis can crash further inland than previous estimates suggested and more experiments are still being conducted. “Ultimately, the goal is to protect life and property,” said McGovern."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/mar/31/uk-us-simulate-cyber-attack-nuclear-plants-test-resilience","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-30T23:01:37Z","webTitle":"UK and US to simulate cyber-attack on nuclear plants to test resilience","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/31/uk-us-simulate-cyber-attack-nuclear-plants-test-resilience","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/mar/31/uk-us-simulate-cyber-attack-nuclear-plants-test-resilience","fields":{"headline":"UK and US to simulate cyber-attack on nuclear plants to test resilience","bodyText":"Britain and the US will stage a war-game later this year, simulating a cyber attack on a nuclear power plant, to test the readiness of the government and utility firms. As David Cameron prepares to fly to Washington to attend a nuclear security summit, convened by Barack Obama, government sources said the two countries plan to cooperate on exploring the resilience of nuclear infrastructure to a terrorist attack. Government sources said the exercise was not triggered by any credible intelligence about the threat of such an attack, but that it was “prudent planning,” adding: “It gives us the ability to test these systems, and make sure that we learn any lessons.” The approach will echo a similar exercise last year, which tested how the major banks could withstand a cyber-security attack. Separately, Cameron is also set to announce an exchange deal with the US, which will see the UK ship 700kg (110st) of nuclear waste, most of it currently stored at Dounreay, in Scotland, to be processed in America. In return, the US will send supplies of a different type of uranium to Euratom, the European nuclear agency, to be turned into medical isotopes, that can then be used in diagnosing and treating cancer across Europe. Government sources described the swap as a “landmark deal,” adding: “it’s a win-win: we get rid of waste, and we get back something that helps us to fight cancer”. They said by working together in this way, Washington, London and Brussels hope to set an example to other states of the innovative measures that may need to be taken to deal with nuclear waste products in future. “It’s an opportunity for the UK, the US and Europe who show how countries can work together to deal with nuclear waste. It’s an opportunity for us to show some leadership to the rest of the world”, the source said. The nuclear security summit, the fourth and final one held during Obama’s presidency, is aimed at enhancing the safety of domestic nuclear systems — something the US president first discussed in a speech in Prague in 2009, and which he sees as part of his legacy. Since the first summit in Washington in 2010, the states attending have agreed to reduce their stockpiles of potentially dangerous highly enriched uranium – the by-product of nuclear power generation – and strengthened the role of watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Over that time, 14 countries have committed to removing nuclear materials from their territory altogether, and many others have pledged to step up security and tackle nuclear smuggling, by stepping up checks at ports, for example. But in a statement setting out its hopes for this week’s meeting, the White House said there was more to do. “We all need to do more together to enhance nuclear security performance, to dissuade and apprehend nuclear traffickers, to eliminate excess nuclear weapons and material, to avoid production of materials we cannot use, to make sure our facilities can repel the full range of threats we have already seen in our neighbourhoods, to share experiences and best practices, and to do so in ways that are visible to friends, neighbours, and rivals – and thereby provide assurance that we are effectively executing our sovereign responsibility,” it said. During the summit, the UK will offer to share its expertise on tackling cyber-crime with other countries. Japan, Korea, Turkey and Argentina have already said they would like to cooperate with the UK on this. Cameron will also commit to spend £10bn this year to fund the world of agencies including the IAEA, on improving the security of civil nuclear infrastructure worldwide. Over lunch on Friday, the world leaders will discuss “scenario-planning” for protecting their nuclear facilities, and preventing volatile nuclear materials falling into the wrong hands. While the main focus is civil security, he will also receive an update on progress in implementing the Iran nuclear deal, which was signed in January, and aimed at preventing Tehran acquiring nuclear weapons, in exchange for the lifting of punitive sanctions. While in Washington, Cameron will also hold a series of bilateral meetings with other world leaders. However, the government sources said he would not be meeting with potential candidates for the US presidency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2017/jan/28/drax-power-station-energy-companies-women","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-28T16:00:04Z","webTitle":"Energy sector faces struggle to find the female engineers of the future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/28/drax-power-station-energy-companies-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2017/jan/28/drax-power-station-energy-companies-women","fields":{"headline":"Energy sector faces struggle to find the female engineers of the future","bodyText":"While the lack of female chief executives in the UK is a problem, the lack of female engineers is an even bigger concern, as Dorothy Thompson, chief executive of Drax group, knows only too well. The head of the UK’s largest power station is grappling with the question of how to attract more women into the energy sector. Thompson says the six places available on the Drax apprenticeship scheme this year attracted just two female applicants compared with 76 men. The education is partly to blame, she says, but energy companies also need to do much more to change girls’ perceptions. Thompson has overseen Drax’s conversion of its coal-fired boilers to biomass to secure the future of the plant near Selby in North Yorkshire as environmental rules bite. She is one of a tiny pool of women running big UK companies, and an even smaller number at the top of the energy industry. The proportion of women on the boards of energy companies was 9% in 2014, and exactly the same two years later. The gender imbalance is not much better further down the management chain. “We would like to have more female apprentices, more female engineers. We believe in diversity,” she says. “But it is challenging. In our current [recruitment] process, there’s a real paucity of female candidates. We struggle to get sufficient candidates to increase the percentage [of women].” She says that while schools should do more to encourage girls to study science and subjects that could equip them for a career in energy, much of the responsibility in addressing the imbalance lies with the industry. “Part of it is in education but part of it is perception. We as an industry need to be more proactive in explaining how interesting an opportunity we are [to young women],” she says. Thompson is far from alone in recognising the imbalance or trying to do something about it. “This is a huge cultural issue for the industry,” says Joan MacNaughton, who is on the board of Powerful Women, a group helping females advance their career in the sector. “There are expectations of women that I don’t think are 21st century. It’s a very, very male culture.” MacNaughton, who spent five years at French company Alstom’s energy division and sits on the board of Energy Academy Europe, says even energy companies that like to think of themselves as progressive have a problem. “They’re not Jeremy Clarkson [the men]; they’re cultured, well-mannered people. But the assumption in senior circles is that you can all have a conversation about your yachts. As a woman there who doesn’t have a yacht, you just have to walk away.” EDF, which is building Britain’s first new nuclear power station in two decades, has been running a cinema ad campaign as part of its drive to encourage girls and young women to study disciplines that could lead to energy jobs. “To recruit the numbers needed to fulfil demand for the future, we need more girls to study science subjects at school, further education and higher education,” says the French company’s boss, Vincent de Rivaz, in a foreword to a recent EDF jobs report. Dr Jenifer Baxter, head of energy and environment at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers agrees: “Often women don’t see heavy industry as a likely future career. Maybe it’s because of the way we talk about engineering and the way it’s shown on TV and talked about in schools.” The root of the problem is not just in education but society more widely, she adds. “When you’re a teenager you want to fit in, and society doesn’t say to girls, ‘yay, go out and build power plants’.” Sara Bell, founder of technology company Tempus Energy, says while it is still vital to encourage girls to study Stem subjects – science, technology, engineering and mathematics – the industry has to look at how it presents itself. “I used to work in financial markets, which is a pretty testosterone-fuelled environment. The energy sector makes finance look like an equal opportunities employer,” she says. “A lot of 15-year-old girls will look at the role models – middle-aged men, predominantly white – and not see anything they can relate to.” Drax’s Thompson agrees that the lack of role models is an issue. “It is unfortunate that there are not more senior women in energy, because it would make it appear more accessible to women. I think it’s unfortunate because the industry is in fact perfectly accessible.” Alice Gill should know. As a schoolgirl she was taken on a tour of the power station and now, at 22, after taking biology, maths, chemistry and physics A-levels, she has just completed a four-year apprenticeship scheme with Drax. “A lot of women are, like, girly girls, aren’t they?” she says. “I can’t imagine them coming in in overalls with no makeup on, and getting their hands dirty. It’s not necessarily a problem with the industry [the lack of women]; I think the problem is that people just aren’t interested.” The solution, she thinks, is to expose more women to the sector at young age: “Just educate more people about it.” Other remedies proposed for addressing the energy industry’s gender imbalance include better transparency on promotions inside companies, and much closer scrutiny of hiring practices. “Everyone should have to monitor the [gender] figures, the intake and promotion figures into middle management, and from middle management into board,” says MacNaughton. “When you get the transparency, then people start to see the problem and fix it. There will never be a single bullet for such a complex problem.” The Drax dilemma Dorothy Thompson’s 12-year reign at Drax has seen her dramatically transform what it does and where it’s going. She foresaw the end of coal in the UK long before ministers announced in 2015 their plan to phase out all coal power by 2025. Three of Drax’s coal-fired generators have been converted to burn wood pellets, mostly from North American forests. But the company suffered a setback in 2014 when the government ruled that a fourth unit would not be eligible for subsidies, and another in 2015, when the Treasury ended its carbon tax exemption. Drax is lobbying for a rethink, arguing that the UK needs stable low-carbon power to complement increasing amounts of wind and solar energy, but the prospect of a further subsidy is unlikely. The company signalled a new strategy last year with its acquisition of business energy supplier Opus Energy and four gas power stations, and is also looking to buy more wood pellet plants in the US. “It’s all about diversifying our earnings, strengthening their stability, and using our areas of expertise and our commercial position to make us stronger and more sustainable - in every sense of the word,” Thompson told the Observer. But some analysts are sceptical of how profitable this will be. “Drax’s acquisition of Opus Energy heralded the start of a new strategy focusing on securing earnings beyond 2027,” investment bank Jefferies said in a recent note. “We feel optimism regarding the new strategy is overdone and we continue to believe that long-term power prices will remain low.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/sep/08/mps-should-leave-parliament-for-4bn-refit-says-official-report","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-07T23:41:57Z","webTitle":"MPs should leave parliament for £4bn refit, says official report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/08/mps-should-leave-parliament-for-4bn-refit-says-official-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/sep/08/mps-should-leave-parliament-for-4bn-refit-says-official-report","fields":{"headline":"MPs should leave parliament for £4bn refit, says official report","bodyText":"MPs and peers should abandon the crumbling Houses of Parliament for six years so that a radical refit costing up to £4bn can be carried out, an influential committee is expected to recommend on Thursday. Running repairs are constantly underway at Westminster; but a joint committee of MPs and peers was established last summer to come up with firm proposals on how a more thorough overhaul can take place – including rewiring, and updating some of its Victorian facilities. The restoration and renewal committee, which includes former leader of the house Chris Grayling, now the transport secretary, and the Labour leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith, has taken evidence from scores of witnesses, including architects and conservation experts as well as MPs and peers themselves. The committee is expected to back the findings of a feasibility report carried out by experts including consultants Deloitte last year, which suggested that MPs and peers should leave their familiar home by the Thames for up to six years. Downing Street sources insisted Theresa May had not yet made a firm decision on whether to support the committee’s recommendations, but stressed that she recognised the importance of the Palace of Westminster, which is designated a Unesco world heritage site. The independent options appraisal, published in 2015, suggested moving to alternative premises temporarily would be less costly and ultimately more practical than trying to carry out repairs with MPs and peers still in place – a process it said could take more than three decades. The committee is expected to support the recommendation for a full move. Last year’s report said: “If both houses fully vacated the palace this would take the least time and would avoid disruption to parliament from construction works”. It estimated the cost of such an approach at around £3.9bn, instead of almost £6bn if contractors had to work around parliamentarians. The most likely temporary home for MPs is thought to be the Department of Health’s Richmond House building nearby, though some parliamentarians were alarmed by reports earlier this year of a drinking ban on the premises. The Palace of Westminster has several bars on site. Peers, meanwhile, could be found a home elsewhere in Westminster, with one recent suggestion being the Queen Elizabeth conference centre, also a short walk away. MPs and peers will consider the report and be given the opportunity to vote on its findings: the culmination of a process that began more than a decade ago, as it became increasingly clear that patching up the palace would not be sufficient. As long ago as 2012, MPs and peers decided that “doing nothing was not an option” and “unless significant conservation work were to be undertaken, major, irreversible damage could be done to the building”. However, if the proposals do get the go-ahead, parliamentarians would not pack up and leave until after the 2020 general election; and a detailed budget is not expected to be drawn up until 2018, by which time some parliamentarians fear the cost is likely to rise further. The Westminster estate includes a hotchpotch of buildings from different eras, from the 900-year-old Westminster Hall, to the modern Portcullis House, with its vast glass atrium, which opened in 2001 and would be unaffected by the repairs programme. But much of the Lords and the Commons is Victorian, built after the old Palace of Westminster was ravaged by fire in 1834, and has antiquated plumbing, wiring, heating and other infrastructure. As well as updating the building’s facilities, MPs and peers are keen to make it a more pleasant workplace. The decision about whether to press ahead with the proposals is one of a series of major spending commitments May will have to consider in the coming months. She is due to make an announcement this month on whether to approve the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, after saying she would review the details, and the government is also expected to make its position clear in the drawn-out debate about whether, and where, to increase airport capacity in the south-east. May told MPs at Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions, the first after the summer recess, that the way she works is to carefully consider the details of a policy proposal rather than rush to judgment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2017/jan/12/gerard-coyne-launches-manifesto-in-unite-leadership-contest-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-12T15:48:40Z","webTitle":"Theresa May to give her Brexit speech on Tuesday – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/12/gerard-coyne-launches-manifesto-in-unite-leadership-contest-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/12/gerard-coyne-launches-manifesto-in-unite-leadership-contest-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May to give her Brexit speech on Tuesday – as it happened","bodyText":"Number 10 sources have confirmed that Theresa May is planning to make her much-anticipated speech on Brexit on Tuesday next week. EU law will apply in Britain after Brexit as an essential part of any transition deal, Malta’s prime minister has said. As Jennifer Rankin reports, Joseph Muscat, whose country has just taken over the EU’s rotating presidency, also said it was “quite obvious” the City of London could be in line for a transition deal. But he made clear the writ of the EU court was an essential part of any deal to smooth the path to Brexit. “It is not a transition period where British institutions take over, but it is a transition period where the European court of justice is still in charge of dishing out judgments and points of view.” NHS England has published figures showing waiting time performance getting worse. (See 10.46am.) Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has accused Gerard Coyne, who is challenging him for the Unite leadership, of proposing to act like a “dictator”. (See 12.28pm.) He was speaking after Coyne published his manifesto. (See 11.40am.) Stephen Dorrell, the Conservative former Conservative health secretary, has said it was unfair for Downing Street to hint that the NHS England boss, Simon Stevens, was to blame for the winter crisis gripping the health service.

Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has used Twitter to highlight his own priorities in the Unite leadership contest. Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire has warned that a new election to the Stormont Assembly will be divisive and in danger of driving people further apart. He is co-chairing talks in Belfast today with Irish foreign minister Charles Flanagan in a bid to defuse the crisis caused by Martin McGuinness’ resignation as deputy first minister and first minister Arlene Foster’s refusal to stand aside temporarily from her office. Brokenshire admitted that elections are still “highly likely” despite last ditch efforts to try and bring the two ruling parties in the power sharing coalition, Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists, back together in government. Speaking at Stormont House, the Northern Ireland Secretary said: It is important for the parties to talk together and anything that indicates a move to encourage that type of discussion I take as helpful, albeit that position does remain serious and stark. We are still looking at an election but we are doing everything we can as the two governments to work with the political parties to see if there is a way forward that can be found. The 11th hour intervention of the British and Irish cabinet ministers into this crisis is an indication that both governments fear that the chances of piecing together a new power-sharing executive after the second set of elections in under a year may be remote given the bad blood that currently exists between Sinn Fein and the DUP. Here are some tributes to Prof Anthony King, the political scientist and BBC elections expert who has died at the age of 82. (See 9.34am.)

The DUP suddenly found the money today - £50,000 to be precise - for an Irish language bursary the party’s culture minister Paul Givan cut from his budget just before Christmas. (See 9.44am.) Refunding the scheme which enables children from poorer backgrounds to attend summer courses in Gaeltacht (Irish speaking) regions of Ireland won’t persuade Sinn Fein to return to government and avoid what first minister Arlene Foster has predicted is going to be a “brutal” election. Minister Givan tweeted this morning that he had “identified the necessary funding to advance” the scheme repeating his earlier insistence that he was not hostile to the Irish language. But Sinn Fein insist elections are going ahead after its deputy first minister of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness resigned from his post earlier this week. Although the party cited the withdrawal of the Liofa scheme as one example of DUP bad faith in the power-sharing government, the principal reason for the pull out has been first minister Foster’s refusal to step aside temporarily while a public inquiry takes place into the botched green energy heating programme whose costs have spiralled out of control. Doubts continue over McGuinness’ health with reports that he is suffering form a rare condition of amyloidosis, a rare disease that affects the central nervous system, the heart and other vital organs. However, McGuinness penned a column in today’s Belfast Telegraph in which he emphasised that his resignation and the entire crisis was “not an Orange and Green issue, despite attempts to paint it as such.” The outgoing deputy first minister said the controversy over the Renewable Heat Incentive was rather was about allegations of “corruption” and the need for “the highest standards of governance.” On these questions McGuinness said the people must have their say and election has to be called. In today’s article he makes no reference though to his illness or indicate if he will stand for election in the Derry constituency of Foyle in that forthcoming contest. As my colleague Alan Travis reports, police have confirmed that the speech given by Amber Rudd, the home secretary, at the Tory party conference in October has been officially recorded as a hate incident. Joshua Silver, an Oxford physics professor, complained because he thought the speech was anti-foreigner. Prof Silver told the Daily Politics that he did not actually watch Rudd deliver the speech. I didn’t actually see the speech but I’ve read the draft. And I’ve looked at all the feedback that there was to the speech. I’ve read the speech carefully and I’ve looked at all the feedback. It’s discriminating against foreigners, you pick on them and say we want to give jobs to British people and not to foreigners. It was interpreted that way. Michael Howard, the former Conservative leader and former home secretary, was also on the programme. He said Silver should he ashamed of himself. Of course it wasn’t a hate incident. What Amber Rudd said was no different from Gordon Brown when he said there should be British jobs for British workers. I think Mr Silver should be thoroughly ashamed of himself because what he’s doing is to bring a well-intentioned piece of legislation into disrepute. The meaning behind the legislation is very important, it’s meant to deal with hate crimes, and Mr Silver has been totally unable to justify what he’s done in the face of your questioning and is bringing that legislation into disrepute. You can read all today’s Guardian political stories here. As for the rest of the papers, here is the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must reads and here is the ConservativeHome round-up of today’s political stories. And here are two stories I found interesting. Christopher Hope in the Telegraph (paywall) says Philip Hammond, the chancellor, took a personal stake in a food technology company just months before it won a share of a £560,000 government grant. Mr Hammond, when he was Foreign Secretary, took the 15 per cent stake in Cambridgeshire-based Hydramach in October 2015, according to records at Companies House. Months later – in April 2016 – Hydramach was one of eight companies which won the grant to develop low fat and low sugar soups, ready meals and sauces from Innovate UK, a tech start up quango run by the Department for Business. Last night a former standards watchdog said Mr Hammond’s failure to make public his shareholding was “a serious failure” because “there is clearly a potential conflict of interest” ... Last night Mr Hammond’s friends said Hydramach had pulled out of the consortium after winning the contract. A source said Mr Hammond “didn’t know that the company had entered the assessment stage as part of this consortium, until after the assessment phase was complete. “Mr Hammond has no involvement in his capacity as Chancellor in the process of awarding Innovate UK grants.” Michael Savage in the Times (paywall) says the Tories are exploiting Jeremy Corybn’s opposition to new nuclear power in the Copeland byelection. Jeremy Corbyn’s opposition to nuclear power is being exploited by the Conservatives as they fight to win a crucial seat for the first time in 80 years. The Tories are taking advantage of the fact that election spending limits do not yet apply in the marginal seat of Copeland in Cumbria, which is home to the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant. It will also be the site of a new nuclear power station that could be in place by 2024. Parties can spend no more than £100,000 in any by-election, but the rules only kick in when the sitting MP resigns. While Copeland’s Labour MP James Reed has already announced that he is standing down, he will not officially do so until the end of the month, leaving parties free to spend as much as they wish until then. The Tories have been campaigning hard since Christmas with dozens of MPs visiting the constituency. About 100 activists and ten MPs recently gathered to deliver leaflets there. The Times story highlights these leaflets. Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, has dismissed Gerard Coyne’s claims about the need to “clean up” the union (see 11.40am) as “nonsense”. He also accused Coyne of devaluing the union’s achievements and of proposing to act as a “dictator” if he wins. Here is the statement McCluskey issued about Coyne’s manifesto. Yet again Gerard Coyne appears unaware of Unite’s rules and procedures. The matter of subscription rates is for the elected executive council who will make any decision one way or another. Members are electing a general secretary, not a dictator. I also regret that Gerard continues to talk down Unite and its achievements. He is denying all that has been accomplished since Unite came together, doing a disservice to our lay membership and rank and file activists. Given the challenges we have met, and are to meet, this is unworthy, especially as he knows his claims are nonsense. Unite is an open, democratic and financially well-managed union. I am proud of the many victories that have been secured in industrial disputes during my time in office and proud of the many landmark legal wins we have achieved against bad bosses, including those who have blacklisted our members or refused them holiday pay. I am clear that my vision is the right one for the future of our union and for our members’ jobs. I again urge Gerard Coyne to raise the tone of his campaign and focus on the workplace issues which Unite members care about and that he ditch his party political campaign managers who clearly understand little of Unite’s rules, role and record. The Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn says Theresa May is expected to deliver her Brexit speech on Tuesday next week - and that the supreme court could deliver its article 50 judgment on the same day. Labour is urging the government to build a tidal lagoon power plant in Swansea Bay. Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, backed the idea following the publication of a government review, headed by the former energy minister Charles Hendry, saying the government should press ahead with a tidal energy scheme. Here is the Guardian’s story about the Hendry report. Referring to the proposed project in Swansea Bay, Lewis said: We have high hopes that tidal energy will get cheaper fast, as we’ve seen in other renewable technologies. The government has repeatedly delayed this project, despite Labour backing it months ago. It’s time to stop dithering and get it built. Gerard Coyne does not seem to have generate huge media interest in his manifesto launch. But here goes anyway. Coyne’s manifesto is here (pdf). And it contains five main proposals. 1 - Focusing on strengthening the union, not “playing Westminster politics”. Our current leader spends too much of his time – and your money – playing at Westminster politics. I will never try to be the puppet master of the Labour Party. The most important job is standing up for you the members, wherever you live and work in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland or Gibraltar. He says he would try to recruit more women, younger members and BME members and improve support for union reps. 2 - Freezing membership subscriptions He says he would freeze membership subscriptions for two years , introduce a family membership and reintroduce honorary membership for long-serving retired members. 3 - Making skills, training and apprenticeships a priority. He says he would invite companies Unite works with to a Backing Britain Skills and Investment Summit, and introducing Unite-endorsed apprenticeships. 4 - Cleaning up Unite He says he would “clean up Unite and put power back in your hands”. Your union takes more than £150m of subscription money from members every year. I do not believe there is enough openness about how your money is spent, so I will introduce proper transparency to Unite’s finances. At the moment members of the union cannot see what their money is being spent on. If elected as general secretary I will set up a new value for money and audit committee, directly elected from the lay membership, to ensure you get the best value for your subscriptions. 5 - Promoting equality and openness He says he would ensure the union has a zero-tolerance approach to bullying and discrimination. The Scottish government has urged the UK government not to implement section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act, the provision that would mean newspapers who do not sign up to a government-approved regulator having to pay the costs of people who sue them for libel even if the newspapers win. In a statement Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish culture secretary, said: We are committed to ensuring the practices which led to the Leveson Inquiry in the first place do not happen again and we believe that all individuals should have the ability to seek redress when they feel they have been the victim of press malpractice. However, the context of press regulation in Scotland is quite distinct from that in England and Wales and section 40 of the crime and courts act does not apply under Scots law. We have not introduced statutory measures to incentivise participation in the regulatory system, as has happened in Westminster, and I can confirm we have no plans to do so. Despite press regulation being devolved, Scottish local and national media could be impacted by any decision to enact section 40 in England and Wales, and it is my view that the measures consulted on by the UK government would put at risk the viability of much of our independent media, particularly local newspapers, and pose a potential threat to freedom of the press. Here is the NHS England bulletin out today (pdf) with the performance statistics for November 2016. And here are some of the key points. Only 88.4% of patients were dealt with at A&amp;E within four hours, below the 95% target. The 95% target was last hit in July 2015. There is a table here that shows the figures for previous months. Here they are. Jul 15 - 95% Aug 15 - 94.3% Sep 15 - 93.4% Oct 15 - 92.3% Nov 15 - 91.3% Dec 15 - 91% Jan 16 - 88.7% Feb 16 - 87.8% Mar 16 - 87.3% Apr 16 - 90% May 16 - 90.3% Jun 16 - 90.6% Jul 16 - 90.3% Aug 16 - 91% Sept 16 - 90.6% Oct 16 - 89% Nov - 88.4% Some 1.1% of patients had to wait more than six weeks for one of 15 key diagnostic tests. The target, 1%, was last met in November 2013. 90.5% of patients were waiting less than 18 weeks for an operation, below the 92% target. Seven out of eight cancer standards were met, but only 82.3% of patients started treatment within 62 days of a referral from a GP - less than the 85% target. The NHS England bulletin also points out that hospitals are dealing with an increasing number of patients. The long-term trend is one of greater volumes of both urgent and emergency care and elective activity, with A&amp;E attendances up 4.5% [the 12 months to November compared with the previous 12-month period], emergency admissions up 3.5%, diagnostic tests up 4.8% and consultant-led treatment up 4.4%. The latest figures from NHS England show that only 88.4% of A&amp;E patients in November were dealt with within four hours, Sky News reports. The target is 95%. I will post more on this when I have looked in detail at the figures. A Democratic Unionist minister has reversed his controversial decision to cut an Irish language initiative in the midst of Stormont’s eco-boiler scandal, the Press Association reports. Communities minister Paul Givan’s decision to cut a £50,000 bursary to pay for children to visit gaelic speaking communities - the Gaeltacht - infuriated Sinn Fein and has been seen as a key factor in the republican party’s decision to pull the plug on the power-sharing institutions. In a tweet on Thursday morning, Givan said: “My decision on the Liofa Bursary Scheme was not a political decision. I have now identified the necessary funding to advance this scheme.” The Press Association report goes on. The shock development has been interpreted by some as a DUP olive branch to Sinn Fein as devolution teeters on the brink. While the looming collapse of the ruling executive was triggered by the renewable heat incentive (RHI) affair - a green heating scandal that has left Stormont with a £490m bill - other disputes between the two main parties have been reignited by the furore. One was the Irish language. Sinn Fein cited DUP “disrespect” toward the language as one of the main reasons they had walked away. Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams branded Givan an “ignoramus” for his original decision to cut the bursary. Professor Anthony King, one of the undisputed giants of postwar British political science and a familiar face in the BBC’s live coverage of general election night results, has died aged 82. Born in Canada, and arriving in Britain as a Rhodes scholar in the 1950s, King taught at the school of government at the University of Essex for half a century and never officially retired. After early collaborations on studies of the 1964 and 1966 general elections with David Butler, King replaced Butler as a fixture in BBC television’s coverage of UK general elections from 1983 to 2005. A born populariser and teacher, King reported and analysed Gallup opinion polls for the Daily Telegraph for many years, though his private political sympathies, though catholic and always carefully hidden, were never those of his employers. King’s many books included the semi-official history of the Social Democratic Party, which split from Labour in 1981, in which he collaborated with his close friend and later Essex vice-chancellor Ivor Crewe. The two joined forces more recently in the best-selling 2013 study The Blunders of Our Governments. King was a member of several significant public bodies, including the Nolan committee on standards in public life in 1994 and the Wakeham commission on the future of the House of Lords in 1999. In 2005 he chaired an inquiry on drugs policy for the Royal Society of Arts. Gerard Coyne has been tweeting about his manifesto launch. Union leadership elections tend to receive little or no attention in the mainstream press but this year’s Unite contest is different. Len McCluskey, the leftwing former docker, was first elected Unite general secretary in 2010 and he was re-elected comfortably in 2013. He is up for re-election again but this time he is facing a more serious challenge, from Gerard Coyne, Unite’s West Midlands regional secretary, who is launching his campaign manifesto this morning. Unite is one of Britain two 1m-plus member super unions (the other is Unison) and it plays an important role in the British workplace. But Unite is also a very powerful player in Labour party politics, bankrolling the party, filling key seats on the national executive committee and exerting influence over candidate selection, and this leadership contest has become, at least in party, a proxy battle about Jeremy Corbyn. McCluskey is one of Corbyn’s strongest supporters. Coyne is arguing that McCluskey has been wrong to spend so much time dabbling in Labour’s internal politics, but he himself is seen as the candidate of the anti-Corbynites and a Coyne victory would be a significant defeat for the Corbyn project. We will get Coyne’s manifesto later, when he launches it with a speech in Birmingham at 10.30am, but he set out his approach yesterday in an article in the Times (paywall). One of my main criticisms of Unite’s leadership is that with these huge challenges in front of him, Len McCluskey prefers to spend his time in office using the union’s money and resources to intervene in the running of the Labour Party. I have no doubt that Unite members, and the workers Unite ought to be representing, would be better off under a Labour government, but it is not up to the General Secretary of Unite to act as Labour’s puppet master. Tomorrow I will be launching the manifesto on which I am running to be Unite’s next General Secretary. It will promise a sharper focus on the issues that matter to the membership, including a strong emphasis on the skills that the workforce will need to fill the gaps when Brexit limits the supply of skilled labour imported from the EU. It will also promise more transparency in how Unite, the UK’s biggest union, uses the £150 million a year that its members contribute through their subscriptions, an end to the misuse of funds, and zero tolerance of bullying. I will cover this in more detail when the launch happens. Otherwise, it seems a relatively quiet day. But I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

Around 40GW of solar power was installed last year, meaning there is now a total of 178GW to meet world electricity demand, prompting renewable energy associations to claim that a tipping point has been reached that will allow rapid acceleration of the technology. “For the first time ever in Europe, renewables produced more power than nuclear – and solar power was key in achieving this remarkable achievement,” said Michael Schmela, executive adviser to trade body SolarPower Europe, which compiled the statistics published on Tuesday. Britain led the European solar expansion, with government incentives helping to add 2.4GW of solar resources to the domestic market, and a third to Europe’s overall 7GW of growth. Unofficial sources estimated the British numbers even higher – at up to 3GW – based on an analysis of solar module shipments. “The success of the UK, set to be the largest European market again in 2015, reinforces the evidence that solar power is a versatile and cost-efficient energy source in any climate,” said James Watson, the CEO of SolarPower Europe, formerly known as the European Photovoltaic Industry Association. SolarPower Europe argues that to nudge Europe away from fossil fuels, better market access will be crucial for solar in a new EU energy market design proposal expected next year. Although global growth was impressive, the European pace of development last year slowed to its lowest since 2009, as incentives known as feed-in tariffs were removed across Europe in 2014. Even Germany, the continent’s largest solar market, saw a slight decline in annual installed capacity to 1.9GW, as incentives were cut and market uncertainties increased. There are fears in Brussels of another solar trade spat with China in the offing, with tough import duties slapped on three Chinese firms last week for violating minimum pricing agreements. Some German solar panel manufacturers have suffered from state-subsidised Chinese competition. Industry sources though say that the removal of minimum pricing agreements would lower costs in Europe and boost growth across the sector. China (10.6GW), Japan (9.7GW) and the US (6.5GW) were the three biggest global solar markets last year, with feed-in tariffs, self-consumption measures, tax breaks and net-metering policies all nourishing growth. One unexpected byproduct of the boom has been that the scale of solar panel distribution between utilities and consumer rooftops has started to balance out. In Europe, the report found that around 40% of solar energy in Europe now comes from utilities, while the amount generated by rooftops has fallen to 60%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/apr/04/french-elections-all-you-need-to-know","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-21T10:53:56Z","webTitle":"French elections: all you need to know","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/04/french-elections-all-you-need-to-know","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/apr/04/french-elections-all-you-need-to-know","fields":{"headline":"French elections: all you need to know","bodyText":"What’s the story and why is it important? France elects a new president in two rounds of voting on 23 April and 7 May. Polls have forecast for more than two years that the populist, nationalist, authoritarian Marine Le Pen will advance to the run-off. The polls also suggest Le Pen, who has promised to take France out of the euro and hold a referendum on France’s EU membership, would then lose to Emmanuel Macron, a former Socialist economy minister running as an independent centrist. But the race is very tight. Both François Fillon, a former rightwing prime minister hit by an alleged corruption scandal, and Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a far-left veteran with a radical economic programme, could also make the final two. In fact, with an estimated one-third of voters yet to make up their minds, polling inconsistencies and margins of error make it impossible to predict with certainty which two of the top four will face off in the final round. After Britain’s Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump in the US, a President Le Pen would deal a heavy symbolic blow to Europe, send markets into turmoil, and be seen as the next step in a populist, nativist insurgency. A victory for the Eurosceptic Mélenchon would also seriously shake the establishment, while a Macron win could – after the defeat of Geert Wilders in March’s Dutch elections – point to a future for centrist, pro-European politics. What’s the political landscape and how does the system work? Eleven candidates, each backed by at least 500 mayors, MPs, MEPs or senators, have qualified for the first round. Assuming none wins a majority, the two highest scorers face off two weeks later. The winner needs more than 50% of the vote. The two-round system, also used in parliamentary, local and regional polls, was introduced in 1962 by Charles de Gaulle and has proved effective at keeping extremists out of power: you vote first with your heart, the French say, then with your head. Whoever wins, this is already an exceptional election: there is a very real possibility that neither of the traditional centre-right and centre-left parties that have governed France since the 1950s will be represented in the run-off. Le Pen’s far-right Front National has been advancing steadily; it controls 14 town halls and has two MPs. In 2015’s regional polls it won 28% of the vote, its highest ever score. But France’s two-round system has so far kept it from power. This year, with the leftwing Socialist party (PS) in disarray after the disastrous five-year term of the outgoing president, François Hollande, former prime minister Alain Juppé from the rightwing Les Républicains party was the early favourite. But after unexpectedly defeating Juppé in the party’s primaries and taking over the mantle of frontrunner, Fillon, a self-styled “clean hands” candidate, was accused of giving his wife and children taxpayer-funded fake jobs. After slipping badly in the polls, Fillon appears to have stabilised – while Mélenchon, helped by strong performances in two televised debates and a slick campaign, has surged. Who are Macron and Le Pen and what do they want? After studying at the elite Sciences Po and École Nationale d’Administration, Emmanuel Macron, 39, was briefly a civil servant before becoming a Rothschild’s banker and then an adviser and economy minister in Hollande’s government. He has never held elected office and says he wants to break the “complacency and vacuity” of French politics. An energetic optimist who claims to be neither left nor right but “pragmatic and fair”, he is economically liberal and pro-business but a progressive on social issues. Marine Le Pen, 48, is the third daughter of FN founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, who made the run-off in 2002. A lawyer, she has both detoxified the party and distanced herself from it since taking over in a bitter power struggle in 2011. Le Pen – who is also embroiled in a fake jobs scandal, but at the European parliament – wants to end immigration, slash crime, eradicate Islamism, pull France out of Europe and save it from globalisation. Her “economic nationalism” will favour French business, she promises, while “France-first” social policies in housing, health, education and employment will favour French people. Who are Fillon and Mélenchon and what do they want? Fillon, 63, was former president Nicolas Sarkozy’s prime minister for five years. An archetypal provincial French conservative, he appeals particularly to France’s Catholic right – still loyal, despite his legal woes – and its desire to preserve traditional family values. Economically he is way more radical, promising shock Thatcherite reforms including cutting taxes and public spending, slashing public sector jobs, raising the retirement age, freeing up labour laws and breaking trade union power. Mélenchon, 65, was a junior Socialist minister from 2000 to 2002. As the caustic, impassioned head of La France Insoumise (Untamed France), his policies include shortening the working week, lowering the retirement age, raising the minimum wage and social security benefits, and taxing top earners at 90%. He also wants to abandon nuclear power, abolish the presidential regime of the Fifth Republic, and in foreign affairs withdraw from Nato, develop warmer ties with Russia, and renegotiate the terms of France’s EU membership – with the promise of an in-out referendum afterwards. The official Socialist party candidate, leftwing rebel and former education minister Benoît Hamon, 49, has slumped as Mélenchon has risen. Aiming to move his party firmly to the left after Hollande’s dismal, muddled presidency, his most eye-catching policy is the introduction of a universal basic income. What are the issues? The Paris and Nice terror attacks that claimed nearly 230 lives in 2015 and 2016 weigh heavily on this election and have helped Le Pen drag the agenda onto her preferred ground of security, immigration, Islam and national identity. She said after the shooting dead of a police officer on the Champs Élysées in the days before the vote that the time had come for France to be “less naive” and called for all foreigners identified as Islamist radicals to be deported. To this she and Mélenchon have added the questions of Europe – from whose yoke Le Pen argues France must free itself before it can flourish – and of an immoral, out-of-touch governing elite and sclerotic political system. But this election is also, and perhaps mostly, about the persistent malaise of a country whose economy has stagnated for years now and where unemployment is stuck stubbornly above 10%. Labour laws, job creation, taxation and social and welfare provision are all key campaign themes. Who will win? Polls currently show Le Pen and Macron neck-and-neck in the first round, with Fillon and Mélenchon nipping at their heels between three and six points behind. In the second round, Macron would beat Le Pen by 20 points or more, and also defeat Fillon and Mélenchon. Fillon would beat Le Pen but lose to either of the other two, while Mélenchon would beat Le Pen and Fillon but lose to Macron. Most observers doubt Le Pen can win more than 50% of the second-round vote. But there are caveats. Her support is more solid: in surveys, Le Pen’s voters mostly say they are certain to support their chosen candidate; Macron’s tend not to be so sure. There is no precedent for a Macron victory: no centrist has ever occupied the Elysée palace, nor any candidate running without the political and logistical backing of one of the traditional left or rightwing parties. In past elections, the two-round system has allowed voters from both left and right to form a united “Republican front” against any FN candidate who makes it to the second round. So far, that pact has largely held. But some observers worry it is now vulnerable. They say voters are so disaffected, and consider politicians so corrupt and ineffective, that the pact could be seen more as the political class saving its skin rather than a bulwark against extremism. One recent survey showed 89% of French voters believe politicians do not listen to them. How angry, demoralised people vote will be decisive. And an unforeseen event, such as another major terrorist attack, could yet change the whole dynamic of the race. What happens after the new president is elected? Without a majority in parliament, a French president’s powers are limited. Critically, a month after the second round of the presidential poll, France holds legislative elections, also over two rounds, on 11 and 18 June. How those turn out will determine whether the new president can actually govern. Macron, who will field candidates from his youthful En Marche! movement, would need to build a new kind of majority from however many of his own candidates win seats, plus centrist MPs from both sides of the political divide. The FN, which currently has only two MPs, would be extremely unlikely to get anywhere near the 289 Le Pen would need for a majority in the assembly, effectively leaving her unable to run the country – a problem Mélenchon would also face. Both may find it hard to implement their more radical proposals. For example, article 88-1 of the French constitution states that France is part of the EU. Constitutional change requires the backing of both the lower house and the senate, plus in some cases a referendum. And while presidents can in principle call a referendum without parliamentary support, they need the approval of the constitutional court to do so. In practice, a plebiscite on leaving the EU may be difficult, if not impossible, for either to call."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/20/chernobyl-disaster-30-years-on-what-do-you-remember","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-20T11:00:28Z","webTitle":"Chernobyl disaster 30 years on: what do you remember?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/20/chernobyl-disaster-30-years-on-what-do-you-remember","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/20/chernobyl-disaster-30-years-on-what-do-you-remember","fields":{"headline":"Chernobyl disaster 30 years on: what do you remember?","bodyText":"On 26 April 1986 one of the four reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded. It was the biggest accident of its kind in history – a human and environmental disaster that triggered a political storm that has lasted for decades. Acute radiation sickness killed 31 people in the first three months, but the leak was blamed for thousands of cancer cases that developed across swathes of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus, with figures on predicted deaths ranging from 4,000 to half a million. Tens of thousands of residents were forced to flee towns such as Pripyat, two miles from the plant, never to return, as the impact of the disaster ricocheted across the continent. Farms across Europe, as far west as Wales, faced restrictions for decades due to worries that their livestock might be contaminated. And charities still invite children who live in Chernobyl’s exclusion zone to parts of Europe for rest, recuperation and clean air. What do you remember? As the anniversary approaches we’d like to hear your memories of what happened when the disaster hit – and the fallout that ensued. If you live in the region, or other affected parts of Europe, we want hear from you. What do you remember about the disaster? If you were in the region at the time were you forced to flee? Or stay indoors for weeks on end? How did the disaster change your country in the 30 years that followed?

But the two sources of renewable energy are far from getting equal love from corporate America. Wind energy has long been the favorite. Businesses, not counting power companies, signed 2,000 megawatts of it in 2015, a jump from 100 megawatts in 2009, according to the American Wind Energy Association. Wind energy is enabling Google, the largest corporate buyer of renewable electricity in the world, to hit the 100% renewable energy goal, which it expects to achieve next year. The company has inked 2,548 megawatts of wind contracts and 141 megawatts of solar from projects around the world. Interest in solar energy is growing, but at a slower rate. Solar contracts shot up to 1,070 megawatts in 2015 from 339 megawatts in 2010, said the Solar Energy Industries Association. Wind energy has historically been much cheaper than solar, making it a more attractive option, especially when energy can be a major expense for a company. As more businesses come under pressure from their customers, investors or government regulators to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and help rein in global warming, they will be looking for low-carbon energy that can compete with the price of coal and natural gas. Wind and solar are not the only sources of electricity with lower carbon footprints than coal and natural gas. Hydropower and nuclear are too, and, unlike solar and wind, are able to produce electricity any time. But hydropower plants require access to ample sources of surface water. A nuclear power plant can take longer to secure permits and cost more than building other types of power plants. “Corporate participation (in buying solar and wind) is still relatively new,” said Brian Janous, director of energy strategy at Microsoft, which recently announced the biggest wind energy contract, at 178 megawatts, in its renewable energy portfolio. “It’s only within the last few years that we’ve seen an uptick, and we’ve yet to fully address the challenges in expanding this market.” A head start America pioneered early research and development of commercial turbines, installing the world’s first wind farm in 1980 and leading the amount of installations, in megawatts, until the late 1990s, when Germany and eventually China began to catch up and then slowly push ahead. Solar hasn’t experienced the same long term and consistent investments and construction, which help to lower cost. Wind power costs cratered 66% in the last six years, said the American Wind Energy Association. The lowest price for a wind contract is around $0.02 per kilowatt-hour while it’s $0.03 for solar, said Ryan Wiser, a renewable energy market researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, part of the US Department of Energy. That minor difference in price can add up to a hefty bill for heavy users of electricity, such as data centers that require an around-the-clock electricity supply. More than half of the 4,000 megawatts of new wind energy contracts last year, and 3,440 megawatts this year, were signed by companies across industries from tech to grocery chains, according to the wind trade association and the Rocky Mountain Institute. Utilities bought the rest. Amazon, for example, has invested more in wind and solar in the past two years. It’s paying for power from a 150-megawatt wind farm in Indiana and waiting for a 208-megawatt wind project in North Carolina to come online soon. It’s also signed agreements for several hundred megawatts of new wind energy that are scheduled to start delivery in 2017. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Dow Chemical and 3M are buying five times more wind than solar, said Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Why solar is playing catch-up Solar has become an increasingly attractive option following a massive construction of factories to build solar panels, mostly notably in China. Prices for solar contracts have dived 63% over the last five years, said the solar trade association. In the 2016 ranking of top corporate solar energy buyers, Target gets the top spot with 147.5 megawatts of installed capacity, according to the solar trade association. The retailer is followed by industrial real estate developer Prologis (107.8 megawatts), Apple (93.9 megawatts), Costco (50.7 megawatts) and Kohl’s (50.2 megawatts). Businesses looking to sign renewable energy contracts or even develop their own solar or wind projects often find themselves on a steep learning curve about borrowing money, structuring contracts and understanding the complex rules that govern the electric industry. Getting rid of these road blocks will encourage more companies to lower their use of fossil fuel energy, business leaders said. For a company that operates in many states or even countries, figuring out a way to standardize renewable energy contracts helps it to save money and time, Janous said. “How do we make deals more attainable for not just Microsoft but smaller companies? There has to be some simplification,” he added. In cities where the local power companies don’t offer much, if any, wind or solar energy for sale, businesses could install their own solar panels or wind turbines on their properties. The cost of this do-it-yourself model has historically been higher than paying for electricity supplied by the local utilities, noted Herve Touati, managing director of Rocky Mountain Institute’s Business Renewable Center. But that cost is coming down and, in some cases, lower than the electricity from the grid. “It’s cheaper for Microsoft to use onsite generation than ask utilities to double their existing grids,” Touati said. Companies with renewable energy contracts or a stake in a solar or wind farm typically don’t use that low-carbon electricity directly – electricity from power plants of all types usually enters the transmission lines and gets mixed up. As a result, businesses would count the amount of solar or wind they pay for against their overall electricity use to calculate their carbon footprint reduction. Despite uncertainties about the impact of a Trump administration on renewable energy – the president-elect has criticized regulations that pressure businesses to address climate change – businesses and market analysts said the prices for renewable energy have fallen steep enough to make them a more feasible option. “Certainly, there are many policy questions yet to be answered, but I don’t see the US election having a significant impact on our commitments,” Janous said.

The new British prime minister will have her first face-to-face meeting with Xi Jinping, the Chinese premier, at the summit on Sunday or Monday, amid continuing tensions over Hinkley Point in Somerset. May angered Beijing by deciding in July that approval of the French- and Chinese-backed £18bn nuclear plant would be delayed, apparently as a result of security concerns over Chinese involvement. The Chinese government has been publicly making its clear it wants the project to go ahead, but May and her ministers have stuck to the position that the government is “considering all the component parts of the project before making its decision in the early autumn”. It is understood Chinese officials raised the issue of Hinkley last week when Baroness Lucy Neville-Rolfe, the new energy and intellectual property minister, made a low-profile trip to China. The Chinese National Energy Administration said on its website that Neville-Rolfe met one of its top officials in Beijing to discuss Hinkley Point. However, British government sources insisted that Neville-Rolfe had only made the trip to China to discuss intellectual property and would have rebuffed attempts to discuss the issue. With three days to go before the summit in Hangzhou, the Chinese ambassador to London also urged May to make “wise” choices that help write “a new chapter” of UK-China relations. In a comment piece for the state-run China Daily, Liu Xiaoming wrote: “In times of change, wise strategic choices and strong, far-sighted leadership are needed more than anything. “China always takes a strategic and long-term perspective toward its relationship with the UK. I hope the UK will do the same and our two countries will join hands to write a new chapter for China-UK relations.” He also urged Britain to “continue to be pragmatic and stay open to Chinese businesses” after the Brexit vote. Liu made no direct reference to Hinkley, but said “a number of steps need to be taken in order to maintain the momentum in the relationship” between London and Beijing. However, anti-nuclear groups urged the prime minister to stand firm against Chinese and French lobbying for the Hinkley Point power station to go ahead. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said May had a “delicate diplomatic job awaiting her at the G20, and she will no doubt come under renewed pressure to give Hinkley the go-ahead.” “But the prime minister has shown before that she won’t be bullied into signing up to a deal that doesn’t serve the interests of the British public,” he added. “This is a hugely controversial deal that will see families in the UK paying through the nose for a nuclear power station that, to date, despite three attempts, doesn’t yet work. Compared with alternative energy sources, such as offshore wind and solar, backed up by interconnectors and battery storage, Theresa May should see better ways to keep the lights on, prices fair and carbon emissions down.” The so-called “golden era” of UK-China ties – sealed under May’s predecessor, David Cameron – has threatened to unravel since she took power in July. A decision is expected in the autumn following speculation the prime minister is concerned about the involvement of Chinese state-owned CGN in the project and any further agreement for China to build reactors in Bradwell, Essex. Ahead of the summit, May said she would tell world leaders in Hangzhou that Britain was “open for business”. “This country has always been one of the greatest trading nations, and as we leave the European Union we will have the opportunity to embrace new markets and opportunities as we export British innovation and expertise to the world,” she said. “I am determined to make the most of the opportunities Brexit presents – delivering the change that people want and striking the right deal for British businesses at home and abroad.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/jul/23/trident-steroid-hp-sauce-nuclear-submarines","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-23T05:00:31Z","webTitle":"It doesn't make us independent, but Trident's the steroid we reach for | Ian Jack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/23/trident-steroid-hp-sauce-nuclear-submarines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/23/trident-steroid-hp-sauce-nuclear-submarines","fields":{"headline":"It doesn't make us independent, but Trident is the steroid we reach for","bodyText":"Railway locomotives, cruise liners, oil tankers, cotton cloth, airliners, container ships, model trains, heavy-lift cranes: these are a few of the items that the United Kingdom used to make in profusion and now doesn’t. Here are a few more: Bendicks Bittermints, machine tools, television sets, nuclear power stations, HP sauce, sewing thread. Britain’s decline as a manufacturing economy has been remorseless – the future of its very foundation, steelmaking, is uncertain – and those industries that do survive tend to be owned elsewhere. And yet, remarkably, a British company employing British workers is set to build some of the most complex, expensive and hazardous machines in the world – the four Successor class nuclear submarines, approved by parliamentary vote this week, which with their armament of Trident missiles will ensure that the United Kingdom remains a nuclear power into the second half of the century. At least, that’s the plan. It used to be said of the Soviet Union that though it could make superb nuclear missiles it never managed to make a decent fridge. Fighting the cold war absorbed so much Soviet money and technology that eventually it became unsustainable in the face of an unhappy population of citizens-consumers who yearned as much for a good fridge as for greater civil rights. The British situation is different. Imports and reckless trade deficits have – for most people, for now – taken care of the fridge side of things. But in the maelstrom of de-industrialisation has Britain actually retained the ability to build a new generation of that cold war creature, the ballistic missile submarine? The portents aren’t encouraging. British warship construction is now entirely in the hands of BAE Systems, which builds surface ships on the Clyde and submarines at Barrow-in-Furness. The careers of vessels from both yards have recently been blighted by mechanical failures and accidents that go beyond the description “teething troubles”, to leave the navy, already shrunk by the 2010 defence cuts, with a tiny operational fleet: 17 usable frigates and destroyers by the latest count, compared to 60 similar ships at the time of the Falklands war. Six of them – the Type 45 destroyers, each costing £1bn and among the most sophisticated warships ever built – will need to be expensively re-engineered to cure them of the engine breakdowns and electrical blackouts that after only a few years in service have left them suddenly powerless and vulnerable at sea. The Astute-class attack submarines have also had a difficult history. The first in a fleet of seven was ordered in 1997, but nearly 20 years later only three are in service with the Royal Navy. (This week the second to be launched, HMS Ambush, collided with an oil tanker off Gibraltar.) In their recently published history of the submarine service, The Silent Deep, the writers Peter Hennessy and James Jinks award part of the blame to a well-known feature of modern Britain, the hollowing-out of public institutions. Traditionally, the Ministry of Defence supervised warship design via its own naval architects in the office of the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors. But by the time the Astute class came along a lot of this responsibility had been transferred to the builder. The MoD, in the words of a US industry report, had lost its “ability to be an informed and intelligent customer”. But the builder was also in trouble. Throughout the late 80s and early 90s, the Barrow yard was building the four Vanguard-class submarines that comprise the present Trident fleet; at its peak, the project employed 13,000 workers. A few years later, that number had fallen to 3,000. A gap in the order book forced many skilled engineers and technicians to look for work elsewhere, taking their expertise with them. The Astute programme was running three years late and several hundred million pounds over budget by 2002, when the MoD requested the intervention of the US submarine builder General Dynamics Electric Boat. It saved the day by lending the services of 200 technicians and sending over a senior member of its staff to manage the project. The same is happening with the Successor submarines. Engineers from Electric Boat in Connecticut have been involved from the beginning – about 40 of them are now believed to be working at Barrow on the challenging project of marrying still-untested pieces of British and US machinery. From its inception as a submarine system in the 1960s, Britain’s independent nuclear deterrent has depended on US technology, and that dependence is increasing. The missiles have always been US-built, but now the submarines themselves will have a greater US input. Rough estimates suggest that a third of the costs of the present Trident system can be ascribed to US companies; if the Tory MP Crispin Blunt is right and the total build and running costs of its successor reach £179bn over a 32-year life, then by this reckoning around £60bn of that will end up in the US. Why not, then, go for broke and simply buy everything – submarines as well as missiles – from the US? As it happens, the US navy is replacing its Ohio-class Trident submarines at roughly the same time as Britain is disposing of its Vanguards, with the first of the new US class (the Ohio Replacement) due to enter service in 2031. A total of 12 are planned at an estimated cost (in 2010 dollars) of $6.2bn each. Add another four and you reduce the unit cost. There are many variables and unknowns here, and I am no economist, but the official estimate for Britain’s Successor submarines puts them somewhere between £7.5bn and £10bn each, which even at dollar-pound parity makes the US vessels a bargain. Surprisingly, for a government so committed to the principle of free trade, this has never been an option. Chocolate, sewing thread, railway engines, merchant ships, machine tools: these things can go the way of all flesh. (“There is a lot of steel in Successor submarines, so will the prime minister commit to using UK steel for these developments?” the member for Scunthorpe asked the prime minister on Monday. “Obviously, where British steel is good value, we would want it to be used,” Theresa May replied carefully.) But Trident submarines live on a higher plane, protected from vulgar competition. To build them in the US would take another big bite out of the notion of Britain’s nuclear independence, which isn’t quite a fiction – a British prime minister has command and control – but given our absolute reliance on US goodwill and technology certainly amounts to an impracticality. Then there are the jobs. Apart from the unknowable future, jobs were the most popular reason at Monday’s debate for building more submarines. Defence was one of the few industries “reliably and consistently creating sustainable, highly skilled and well-paid jobs outside London,” said the pro-Trident Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, and sadly this is true. He had figures: 26,000 jobs, including 13,000 in advanced manufacturing. The apparently insurmountable problem of what would happen should Scotland become independent was never properly addressed. ‘“We would love to have all the jobs that would come with [a relocation]. We would be more than happy to have it,” said the Tory member for Plymouth Moor View, and it may yet to come to that. In the past, Wales has been mentioned as a possible site, but now the Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts said that if Trident left Faslane, “the Westminster government will need to find a base in England, because we are not so poor in spirit as to accept the toxic status symbol of Britain’s imagined standing on the world stage”. Brexit made many on the Tory benches keener. It seemed as though they saw a reduced country and reached to the top shelf of the medicine cabinet to find a steroid. Trident can always be relied on to puff us up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2016/oct/25/renewables-made-up-half-of-net-electricity-capacity-added-last-year","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-25T08:00:17Z","webTitle":"Renewables made up half of net electricity capacity added last year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/25/renewables-made-up-half-of-net-electricity-capacity-added-last-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/oct/25/renewables-made-up-half-of-net-electricity-capacity-added-last-year","fields":{"headline":"Renewables made up half of net electricity capacity added last year","bodyText":"Green energy accounted for more than half of net electricity generation capacity added around the world last year for the first time, leading energy experts have found. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said the milestone was evidence of a rapid transformation in energy taking place, and predicted capacity from renewable sources will grow faster than oil, gas, coal or nuclear power in the next five years. But the analysts said the outlook in the UK has deteriorated since the Conservative government took power last year and cut support for wind and solar power. The agency’s chief said Britain had huge renewable energy potential and ministers needed to design stronger policies to exploit it. “What I see is we are witnessing the transformation of energy system markets led by renewables and this is happening very quickly,” said Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA. “This transformation and the growth of renewables is led by the emerging countries in the years to come, rather than the industrialised countries.” China will lead the world for growth in renewable power, followed by the US and Europe, a new report by the agency found. The IEA said the EU was relinquishing its position as a renewable energy pioneer due to weak electricity demand and policy uncertainty, which Birol warned could see European renewable energy manufacturers lose out to international rivals. “If you think of running a marathon, Europe started with a big advance, more than half of the marathon they are leading by far. They are now getting a bit tired, and some others are overtaking Europe slowly but surely,” he told the Guardian. The IEA said Asia will be the “engine of growth”, led by China and India. “China is a completely separate chapter,” said Birol. “China alone is responsible for about 40% of growth in the next five years. When people talk about China, they think about coal, but it is changing.” A total of 153GW of net renewable electricity capacity was installed globally in 2015, a record high, equivalent to Canada’s capacity and up 15% on the year before. Net capacity is new capacity minus retired capacity, such as old hydro being taken offline. China is expected to add a further 305GW over the next five years, followed by India with 76GW. Onshore windfarms and solar power led the charge last year, with 63GW and 49GW of new global capacity respectively. The two technologies are also forecast to take the lion’s share of growth, with electricity generation from solar tripling and wind doubling. Their costs are expected to continue the dramatic and unprecedented reductions in recent years, with onshore wind coming down a further 15% and big solar 25% by 2021. “The cost of wind dropped by about one third in the last five to six years, and that of solar dropped by 80%,” said Birol, adding that while the cost of gas had also fallen recently, it was not at the same speed that green energy had become cheaper. “The decline in renewables [cost] was very sharp and in a very short period of time. This is unprecedented.” While renewables now account for more than 50% of net capacity additions and are expected by the IEA to reach around 60% by 2021, they still provide a relatively small share of the world’s electricity. Green sources are only expected to provide 28% of electricity generation by 2021, up from 23% in 2015, and much of that will be from existing hydropower dams. Renewable energy is seen by scores of countries as a key way to meet climate targets that they pledged under the Paris agreement, which comes into force in November. But even with the huge growth expected in coming years, the IEA said it will not be sufficient to meet the Paris deal’s target of keeping temperatures below 2C, the threshold for dangerous warming. “No, it’s by far not enough [the trajectory of growth],” said Birol. The agency painted a gloomy picture of solar and onshore wind’s prospects in the UK, echoing recent warnings from other respected energy authorities. “The policy landscape for renewables has become more challenging since the 2015 general election,” the report said. Since coming to power, the Conservatives have drastically cut or ended subsidies for wind and solar power, begun the privatisation of the green bank which supports clean energy, and enthusiastically backed fracking for shale gas and new nuclear. “While government support for new gas and nuclear capacity is evident, recent policy changes indicate that the role envisioned for renewables is uncertain,” the IEA said. “There is need in the UK to invest in stronger renewable policies,” said Birol. “The potential is huge compared to what we are expecting.” The agency’s chief said that contrary to what renewable energy critics argued, the biggest threat to the technologies was not their intermittent nature but the intermittency of governments’ support. “The issue is not the predictability of solar and wind, it is the predictability of government policies because investors need to see what their prospects are. This is the main challenge I see in the renewable energy sector.” Imke Lübbeke, head of climate and energy at WWF’s European policy office, said: “The IEA report clearly shows that president [Jean-Claude] Juncker’s promise to make the EU ‘the world leader in renewables’ remains empty rhetoric. Instead, the European Union is losing its leadership role to the US and China.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/jan/15/energy-tidal-lagoon-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-15T00:04:01Z","webTitle":"Two cheers for Swansea’s tidal lagoon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/15/energy-tidal-lagoon-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jan/15/energy-tidal-lagoon-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Two cheers for Swansea’s tidal lagoon","bodyText":"Britain’s west coast is facing a revolutionary change. If renewable energy advocates get their way, swaths of shoreline will soon be peppered with giant barrages designed to turn the power of the sea into electricity for our homes and factories. These tidal lagoons could supply more than 10% of the nation’s electricity, it is claimed. Last week former energy minister Charles Hendry published a review that strongly backed the construction of a £1.3 billion prototype lagoon in Swansea Bay. The trial project was a “no regrets option”, Hendry concluded. Not everyone is happy, however. Critics say the price tag is massive and compares with the huge cost of the highly controversial Hinkley C nuclear power station that was recently approved by Theresa May’s government. It would be better to wait for technological improvements in other renewable energy sources – in particular solar and wind – to be achieved and to use these as the backbone of Britain’s renewable energy generation, they argued. For their part, renewable energy experts say the Swansea Bay project should only be considered as the forerunner of a set of tidal lagoons whose individual costs would plummet as economies of scale kicked in. As Professor Paul Ekins, at University College London, put it: “One tidal lagoon is neither here nor there. They only make sense if they come as a fleet.” The differing views underline the stark dilemma that Britain now faces. Thanks to the 2008 Climate Change Act, the nation is now committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by the year 2050: an enormous task. Old coal, gas and oil power stations will have to be closed and replaced with renewable plants capable of generating billions of watts of electricity. The trouble is that very little has been done in the past decade to trigger changes that might wean us of our fossil fuel addiction. And time is running out. As Chris Binnie, a visiting professor of engineering at Exeter University, put it: “None of the governments we have had since 2008 have had a coherent policy on how to meet our requirement to make such cuts in emissions by 2050.” Hence the excitement about tidal lagoons. These generate electricity from the natural ebb and flow of the tides. Rising water flows into dams many miles in length, driving turbines. It is then held back behind walls as the tide recedes before being released to drive the turbines again, generating thousands of megawatts of power. For good measure, they would emit little carbon dioxide and offer the prospect of creating thousands of new jobs in Wales and west England. The problem is that, as Ekins points out, their go-ahead only makes sense if the government commits to building half a dozen – and in recent years, ministers have proved to be woefully inconsistent in their approach to backing renewable power projects. Take the decision by David Cameron’s government last year to axe a range of measures designed to boost the sector. These included subsidies for solar power and support of energy efficient house building. The scrapping of the latter – the UK zero-carbon homes scheme – was especially egregious, said Ekins. Established in 2006, the scheme would have ensured dwellings, built from 2016 onwards, would generate as much energy on-site – through renewable sources, such as wind or solar power – as they would use in heating, hot water, lighting and ventilation. Then, in 2015, it was scrapped. “The government gave a 10-year signal to investors and then pulled the plug after nine years,” said Ekins. “How can you expect to be taken seriously in your next policy pronouncement in the same area?” Another example of fickle government policy has been the stalled development of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) schemes that would collect carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power plants, liquify them and store them underground. The technology would prevent carbon dioxide reaching the atmosphere but could also help reduce existing levels, said Bob Ward of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, London. “Wood and other biological material normally rots and return their carbon dioxide content to the air. But if you burned this biomass and used CCS to capture the carbon dioxide you would be preventing it from reaching the atmosphere. You would be creating negative emission – which could be extremely useful for there may be some emissions from industry and agriculture for which we can find no substitutes. We could use CCS to create negative emissions to compensate.” Last year, however, all support for work on CCS was axed by the government. It remains to be seen if tidal lagoons suffer a similar fate. As Robert Gross, director of policy at Energy Futures Lab, Imperial College London, put it: “Private investors welcome secure and long-term investments in energy infrastructure but only if, and it’s a big if, government really thinks long term.” Question marks over commitment are not the only problem facing the government’s energy policy, however. There is also the issue of energy storage. Renewable power sources suffer because their outputs are often intermittent. Solar panels are fairly useless on a gloomy winter’s day in Glasgow while wind turbines cannot turn when the weather is calm. Methods to store energy are going to be vital if the UK generates most of its electricity from renewable sources. New generations of lithium-iron batteries have had encouraging results though their capacities remain limited. By contrast, pump storage projects already have a strong track record. These schemes involve pumping water up to reservoirs in hills using electricity generated when conditions are optimal - for example when it is windy or sunny - but demand is low. Then, when generation becomes difficult and demand increases, the water is released and passed into turbines to generate power. At present Britain has a handful of such pump-storage schemes, including a major facility at Ben Cruachan, near Oban. Several more will be needed as our reliance on renewable energy increases. “Both the Peak District and the Exmoor National Park have been pinpointed as possible sites,” said Binnie. However, creating reservoirs there would be highly controversial. “It’s another aspect of the difficult choices we will have to make but which we do not seem to be considering at all at present,” Binnie added. These issues mostly focus on relatively remote areas. However, Professor AbuBakr Bahaj, head of the energy and climate change group at Southampton University, believes that approach is misplaced. An urban response to climate change mitigation is what is required. “Most of the nation’s energy is consumed in cities and that is where we should be thinking of generating it,” he said. Bahaj envisages UK cities having the roofs of buildings, offices and homes covered with cheap but highly efficient solar panels. “I have done an analysis of Southampton and if you fitted all its roofs with solar power panels you could supply the city with 25% of its electricity. You could fit a panel to your home that supplied you with 3 to 4 kilowatts of power and which you could connect to the grid. If you took this approach, you could get a very good return for your money.” Whatever approach is taken, one thing is clear, say energy experts: the kind of nation – both in its cities and in the countryside – that our children live in will be very different one from the country we currently inhabit. Radical changes to our infrastructure lie ahead. The sooner these are accepted, the better will be our chances of meeting our climate change obligation. This article was amended on 15 January 2017.

He looked round to check that the chamber and the press gallery was nearly empty. Just as he had hoped. The Speaker then invited him to make a personal statement. “I wish to make an unreserved apology,” he mumbled. “I completely accept the committee’s report and I am truly sorry. My only mistake, though, was one of naivety. Everything I did was designed to strengthen regulations into payday lending and was not motivated by financial gain. All I can say is that I am so, so sorry.” Having done the full three-minute Uriah Heep, the Conservative former benefits minister scuttled straight back out of the House, still surrounded by loyal friends, patting his shoulder and feeling his pain. All their old mucker had done was to leak a draft of a public accounts committee report on the credit industry to someone he knew who worked for payday lender Wonga. And when his mate emailed four suggested amendments back, he had forwarded them virtually word for word on to the committee as if they were his own. As you do. It had just been a silly, silly little mistake. Hardly worth bothering with. Nothing to see here, move along. As Tomlinson just had. The poor man had been punished enough by being asked to give a statement and serve a two-day suspension. Saturday and Sunday should cover it. At times like these, it’s noticeable how much more forgiving MPs sometimes are of each other’s shortcomings than they are of anyone else’s. One small misstep and a career can be in tatters. “I’d like to offer my personal thanks to Rona Fairhead, who has stepped down as chair of the BBC Trust,” said the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, sounding anything but grateful in a later statement on the BBC. That’s “stepped down” as in being given the choice to jump before being pushed. Three more times Bradley went out of her way to pay tribute to Fairhead – it was almost like a Pavlovian response whenever she had forgotten what else she was meant to be saying – without ever bothering to list a single of her achievements. Perhaps she couldn’t think of any. Rona hadn’t been brilliant at her job, but she hadn’t been that bad either. Fairhead’s real crime was that the prime minister had decided her face no longer fitted – too cozy with Dave – and what Theresa wants, Theresa gets. Out of sight, out of mind. Bradley was merely a high-paid functionary keeping her boss sweet. When the BBC is forced to reveal who earns more than £150K, it might care to point out that the not-very-talented culture secretary is on £141.5K. It will make some of the Beeb’s stars look like a bargain. Still, at least there was an honesty to Bradley’s artless dismissal of Fairhead. For the very highest levels of parliamentary self-forgiveness, we had to wait for the business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, to give his statement on the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. Having originally delayed the decision to proceed back in July in order to double-check both the security implications and the cost, Clark was happy to pronounce that, thanks to his and the chancellor’s incisive eye for detail – Philip Hammond was by his side to nod vigorously at this – the country now had the best deal ever. The fact that he had neither negotiated a drop in the price nor any extra security safeguards, as the ones in place were already sufficient, was irrelevant. He and the government had just done Britain a massive favour. By looking the French and the Chinese in the eye and blinking. “The British people will not have to pay a penny until and unless the power station is built,” he declared. The “unless” was a curious choice of word for a minister claiming to have safeguarded Britain’s electricity supply for the next 60 years. “And the fact that consumers will pay up to £30bn over the odds if the power station is built is only fair because the project is bound to overrun and it wouldn’t be right to expect the French and the Chinese to take the hit.” Several MPs pointed out that the FT, the Economist and the National Audit Office had all described the deal as dreadful for consumers. Clark merely smiled. The people would come to see what a great deal it was in 2025. And if they didn’t, so much time would have passed no one would remember he was the one to blame. Least of all him. In fact, he’d forgiven himself and forgotten already."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2017/apr/06/trump-syria-missiles-assad-chemical-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-07T17:58:05Z","webTitle":"Syria missile strikes: US launches first direct military action against Assad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/06/trump-syria-missiles-assad-chemical-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2017/apr/06/trump-syria-missiles-assad-chemical-weapons","fields":{"headline":"Syria missile strikes: US launches first direct military action against Assad","bodyText":"The US military has launched a cruise missile attack on a Syrian airfield in response to Bashar al-Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons this week, marking the first time the US has become a direct combatant against the Syrian regime. The US move drew an angry response from Russia, which described the strike as an “aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law”. The Russian foreign ministry has since announced that it was suspending a deal with the US to exchange information about military flights to avoid incidents in the crowded skies over Syria. Moscow has also called for a meeting of the UN security council to discuss the strikes. Syrian officials said at least seven people were killed and nine wounded in US missile attack. Russia’s foreign minister said no Russian service personnel were hurt in the strike. Speaking during a trip to Uzbekistan, Sergei Lavrov said the strike was launched on an “absolutely made-up pretext”, adding: “It reminds me of the situation in 2003 when the United States and Britain, along with some of their allies, attacked Iraq.” He said Russia would demand Washington explain why it conducted the strikes. “I hope this provocation will not lead to irreparable damage [to US-Russian ties],” Lavrov said. Donald Trump, who for years signalled he was comfortable with Assad remaining in power, abruptly switched course after seeing images of children gassed to death in Idlib province after Assad used chemical weapons against Syrian civilians. The US strike saw 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from the guided-missile destroyers USS Ross and USS Porter in the eastern Mediterranean. An airbase at Shayrat, near Homs, was targeted, signalling a limited initial engagement on a target the military said was used to launch the chemical attack. Although the US targeted some of Syria’s air defenses, it did not do so largely beyond Shayrat or in a sustained barrage, as it would typically do before launching a concerted air campaign. Instead, the Pentagon said, it attacked “aircraft, hardened aircraft shelters, petroleum and logistical storage, ammunition supply bunkers, air defense systems, and radars” at the airfield. Russian state TV aired footage claiming to show the damage from the US strikes at the Syrian airbase. It showed craters and pockmarks left by explosions and said nine Syrian air force jets had been destroyed. Though Trump lacked congressional and international authorisation for the strike, prominent US politicians immediately gave him political cover. The president said on Thursday night at his Mar-a-Lago resort that he had ordered a “targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched”. After a frantic day of consultation with his military advisers, including the defense secretary, James Mattis, and the national security adviser, HR McMaster, Trump said it was a “vital national security interest” of the US to prevent “the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons” after previous efforts to change Assad’s behavior “had failed, and failed very dramatically”. Trump also called on the international community to “join us in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types”, leaving it unclear whether the US objective was retaliation for the chemical assault, destruction of Assad’s chemical stockpiles or a push to oust Assad from power. For its part, the Pentagon said the strike “was intended to deter the regime from using chemical weapons again”. Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies that the president believed the US had carried out the strikes under a “far-fetched pretext”. Russia has argued that the death of civilians in Khan Sheikhun resulted from Syrian forces hitting a rebel chemical arsenal there, but the Guardian visited the attack site and found no evidence for this claim. Dozens of civilians, including 10 children, were killed, apparently by a chemical attack on Khan Sheikhun, in a region held by rebels who oppose Assad’s regime. On Friday, sources told the Guardian US intelligence officials believed Russian personnel were at Shayrat airbase when the chemical agent was loaded on to a Syrian jet. They have not established whether the Russians knew it was happening. The base covers an area of more than 8 sq km (3 sq miles) and has two runways and dozens of buildings, silos and storage facilities. The sources said on both occasions a Russian Sukhoi aircraft was monitored by ground radar and aerial reconnaissance flying over the town. Flashes had been detected on the ground indicating that ordnance had been dropped. Trump had already warned that his view had been changed by the shocking images of children. The attack happened at 8.40pm eastern standard time (4.40am in Syria) while Trump was hosting his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. In 2013, Assad’s forces used chemical weapons, including sarin and chlorine, killing more than 1,000 people. President Barack Obama threatened military action over Assad’s use of sarin, an illegal weapon, but the US Congress balked and Russia intervened to make a deal in which Assad would hand over stockpiles of weapons. The Tomahawks used on Friday are sophisticated missiles that can be retargeted while in the air. Syria’s formidable, Russian-supplied air defences, largely along the Mediterranean coast, have long prompted US military officials to warn against attacking Assad. Since Russia sent aircraft, troops and personnel to bolster Assad in late 2015, the Syrian president’s fortunes have improved dramatically, and he has retaken territory from the beleaguered and fractious armed opposition. The Russian presence has raised the stakes dramatically for US military planners, as the prospect of accidentally killing Russian personnel and sparking a larger war with a nuclear power reduces the US room for manoeuvre. However, according to the Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis, the US military notified Russian forces before the strike, using a communications channel set up to ensure US pilots who attacked Islamic State targets in eastern Syria did not accidentally come into conflict with their Russian counterparts. It is likely Russia would have passed the warning on to its Syrian allies. The US has roughly 1,000 troops in Syria, who may be at risk as a result of the strike. “We are assessing the results of the strike,” Davis said. “Initial indications are that this strike has severely damaged or destroyed Syrian aircraft and support infrastructure and equipment at Shayrat airfield, reducing the Syrian government’s ability to deliver chemical weapons.” Davis said the airbase had been used to store chemical weapons used by the regime until 2013, when a deal was struck with the US and Russia to remove its declared arsenal. He said it was used to deliver the chemical weapons dropped on Khan Sheikhun, but could not confirm whether any chemical weapons were still at the site. However, he stressed that the targets were chosen carefully to avoid the risk of hitting those weapons. “The places we targeted were the things that made the airfield operate. It’s the petroleum facilities, it’s the aircraft radar, what they use for takeoff and landing, as well as air-defense radar,” Davis said. “It’s the sites that are specific to making it operate, as well as hangars and aircraft themselves.” For years, defense analysts have warned the US against attacking Assad without a plan for what it seeks to achieve or what a post-Assad Syria might look like. Davis said precautions were taken to avoid killing Russian personnel on their compound at Shayrat, citing the timing of the attack and the choice of targets unlikely to have people inside. All the aircraft attacked were Syrian, he said. Neither the US Congress nor the UN have authorized war against Assad. Mary Ellen O’Connell, an international law scholar at the University of Notre Dame, said Trump did not have a legal basis for military action. “Under international law, he has zero right to attack Assad. It would be a reprisal attack. You won’t find any international law specialists who will find a legal right to carry out a reprisal,” O’Connell said. For years, Trump rejected any attack on Assad as a strategic folly, despite repeated chemical assaults of the sort that prompted Thursday’s missile strikes. After Russia’s intervention in the conflict, Trump said rival Hillary Clinton’s openness to strikes against Assad’s forces were inviting conflict with Russia. Just days ago, his secretary of state and UN ambassador made statements indicating Trump was prepared to let Assad – who in November called Trump a “natural ally” – remain in power. But earlier on Thursday, after Trump’s public anger at Assad for the chemical assault, the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, said there was “no role for [Assad] to govern the Syrian people” and called on Russia, where Tillerson will travel next week, to “consider carefully” its sponsorship of the Syrian dictator. Tillerson suggested “steps are under way” to rally an international coalition to remove Assad diplomatically, a position long thwarted by Moscow and Beijing. Longtime Syria hawks – and Trump critics – John McCain and Lindsey Graham rallied behind Trump in the pursuit of an attack they have urged for years. Trump and the military “sent an important message the United States will no longer stand idly by as Assad, aided and abetted by Putin’s Russia, slaughters innocent Syrians with chemical weapons and barrel bombs”, the two Republican senators said in a joint statement. The senior Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, Ben Cardin, joined in support, but said: “Any longer-term or larger military operation in Syria by the Trump administration will need to be done in consultation with the Congress. “Furthermore, it is the president’s responsibility to inform the legislative branch and the American people about his larger policy in Syria, as well as the legal basis for this action and any additional military activities in that country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2015/oct/05/george-osborne-conservative-conference-speech-we-are-the-builders","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-05T16:42:19Z","webTitle":"George the Builder and the big Tory plan to fix Britain brick by brick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/05/george-osborne-conservative-conference-speech-we-are-the-builders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/oct/05/george-osborne-conservative-conference-speech-we-are-the-builders","fields":{"headline":"George the Builder and the big Tory plan to fix Britain brick by brick","bodyText":"Everywhere you looked, there were ghosts. In the 45-minute queue snaking its way round Manchester city centre as delegates were given the Ryanair treatment, there was the ghost of the Conservatives’ 1979 Labour isn’t working election poster. Neither is the Tory conference. There wasn’t even a VIP entrance for tax non-doms or party donors, but as Lord Ashcroft has decided to make himself scarce during the week his Dave hatchet job is published, perhaps there was no need. In the choice of Andrea Jenkyns, the Tory MP who took Ed Balls’ seat at the general election, to introduce George Osborne, there was the ghost of the shadow chancellor. Indeed, the ghost of Balls remained on stage throughout, as the chancellor claimed two of his former adversary’s policies, the creation of a national infrastructure committee and the changes in business rates, as his own. “I am thy father’s spirit, Doom’d for a certain term to walk the night ... ”, as Hamlet’s father’s ghost said. But then Osborne also appears doomed to walk the night. Seldom has the chancellor looked more spectral. You would have thought by now that the Tories could find a makeup artist capable of making George look less nocturnal, but maybe some faces are immune to rouge. Osborne’s speech had come billed as an early marker for a leadership bid and some of his initial remarks insisting on his deep Dave-love suggested his mind was partly fixed on a post-Dave world. Just so long as he can keep his hands off Sam Cam: boasting of his past form for nicking his supposed best friend’s girlfriends in a Sunday newspaper interview is likely to have put Dave on high alert. Retaining Dave’s trust may be rather easier than gaining that of the electorate. What the minimum voters generally require of their politicians is that they are visibly alive; George struggled to look better than half-dead during his 45 minutes under the lights, and even his attempts to put some distance between himself and Dave’s silver spoon fell victim to his whiteout. After talking of his hand-to-mouth upbringing in the badlands of central London – Notting Hill – he went on to say he had become aware that there was a world outside the capital when he drew the short straw of a northern constituency. Albeit one with a safe Tory majority. And as a result, he was determined to build a northern powerhouse. “We are the builders,” said George the Builder, as the ghost of Nye Bevan, who first used that phrase in 1945, span in its grave. But could he fix it? George wasn’t too bothered one way or another, just so long as he built something. Poor old Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, whose brief had been limited to filling in potholes in marginal constituencies under the previous government, now found himself completely upstaged as George the Builder promised to single-handedly construct a new runway at Heathrow, several high-speed rail links, a dozen nuclear power stations, a new car park outside the Asda in Taunton and several million houses. Albeit with a little help from the Chinese, who had been given first option on buying some Lloyds bank shares the government was selling off cheap. George the Builder was a little vaguer on who was going to be buying all these houses, other than to suggest that everyone’s pockets were going to be overflowing with cash once the government had stopped handing out tax credits. Before one or two of the sharper financial pencils in the audience had time to think through the maths, George the Builder launched his coup de théâtre. It is a very brave or very dim chancellor that ends their keynote speech talking about local government finance, as most people understand next to nothing about it and care even less. You can make your own mind up about which category George the Builder falls into. Perhaps the rules of the game have changed now Labour and the Conservatives are under the impression that anyone who didn’t vote for Jeremy Corbyn is in fact a Tory. For how long is another matter, as George the Builder declared that local councils would be allowed to keep every penny they raise in business rates. The race to the bottom was now on. For London, it would be full steam ahead, and the northern powerhouse might shine on like a crazy diamond in those pockets where wealth was being generated. But huge areas of the country would be turned into industrial and rural ghostlands. Places to which George could happily retire and listen to NWA, recently cited as one of his favourite live acts. “Cause I’m tha type o’ nigga that’s built ta last/If ya fuck wit me I’ll put a foot in ya ass.” That’s George the Builder for you. Keeping it real, right to the last."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/07/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-indian-point-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-07T17:20:28Z","webTitle":"New York nuclear plant's future further divides Sanders and Clinton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/07/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-indian-point-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/07/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-indian-point-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"New York nuclear plant's future further divides Sanders and Clinton","bodyText":"The Indian Point Energy Center, a controversial and ageing nuclear plant near New York City, has split the Democratic presidential candidates . As campaigning continued before the New York primary on 19 April, Bernie Sanders called the facility “a catastrophe waiting to happen”. Hillary Clinton said only that it needed more oversight. A senior member of the Union of Concerned Scientists told the Guardian “the whole New York metropolitan area is potentially imperiled by an accident at Indian Point”. Last week, the company that runs Indian Point revealed that 227 bolts holding the interior of a nuclear reactor at the site have “degraded” or gone missing. In February, the plant reported that a radioactive material, tritium, had leaked into groundwater. The plant, about 40 miles north of midtown Manhattan on the eastern bank of the Hudson river, has a 40-year history of accidents, fires and complaints. Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered an investigation into February’s “unacceptable” leak. He has called for the plant to close. “In my view, we cannot sit idly by and hope that the unthinkable will never happen,” Sanders said in a statement. “It makes no sense to me to continue to operate a decaying nuclear reactor within 25 miles of New York City where nearly 10 million people live.” The Vermont senator elaborated on his stance, calling for the US to phase out nuclear plants along with more polluting resources such as fossil fuels. “Nuclear power is and always has been a dangerous idea because there is no good way to store nuclear waste,” he said. Clinton, a former New York senator, accused Sanders of tardiness in his attention to the controversial plant. “I’m glad he discovered Indian Point,” she told a local talkshow, Capital Tonight. “We also have to be realistic and say, ‘You get 25% of the electricity in the greater New York City area from Indian Point.’ “I don’t want middle-class taxpayers to see a huge rate increase. So this needs to be done in a careful, thoughtful way.” The former secretary of state said the plant needed greater regulation, and cited a continuing review by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Indian Point is in the midst of a license renewal process that will last at least through September. Edwin Lyman, a senior nuclear scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that while the non-partisan group did not have “a general position on nuclear power per se, we believe that every nuclear plant has to be operated to a very high level of safety and security”. “Some plants deserve greater scrutiny and protection than others based on the potential consequences of a catastrophic accident or terrorist attack,” he said. Indian Point, Lyman told the Guardian, “should be a top candidate” for such scrutiny, given that 16 million people live within 50 miles of the facility. Referring to events caused by a tsunami in Japan in 2011, Lyman said a “Fukushima-type accident could cause either the melting of the reactor core or severe damage to the spent fuel pool that would cause a fire and large release” of radioactive material. In the case of Fukushima, radiation traveled as far as 25 miles into populated areas where people were not immediately evacuated. “The whole New York metropolitan area is potentially imperiled by an accident at Indian Point,” Lyman said. The plant is one of the few employers in the small town of Buchanan, but it is also the target of local protests. Nuclear scientists and pipeline experts have warned that the risks of running the plant are high, especially given the large amount of waste that is stored at the site. The office of the governor did not immediately reply to a query about whether Cuomo, who has endorsed Clinton, would urge her to change her position. According to Entergy, the company that runs Indian Point, the February leak which caused a nearly 65,000% increase in radiation levels in affected groundwater “has not migrated off site and as such does not pose an immediate threat to public health”. Jerry Nappi, a spokesman for the company, told New York public radio the plant was “reliable” and “verified as safe by inspectors who come to the plant each day from the federal government”. “Indian Point, when it’s online, emits virtually zero greenhouse gases so it’s an important component to New York state trying to meet its clean energy and clean air goals,” Nappi said. The disagreement between Sanders and Clinton mirrors their stances on fracking for natural gas. The senator has called for a ban, citing growing evidence that drilling causes earthquakes. The former secretary of state has called for intense regulation of the industry. “I want the federal government to regulate much more toughly than we have in the past,” she said on Monday. In 2014 Cuomo signed a law that banned fracking in New York."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/13/poundlands-bid-decision-is-fine-but-please-dont-use-brexit-as-the-excuse","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-13T18:35:10Z","webTitle":"Poundland's bid decision is fine – but please don't use Brexit as the excuse | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/13/poundlands-bid-decision-is-fine-but-please-dont-use-brexit-as-the-excuse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/13/poundlands-bid-decision-is-fine-but-please-dont-use-brexit-as-the-excuse","fields":{"headline":"Poundland's bid decision is fine – but please don't use Brexit as the excuse","bodyText":"Darren Shapland, chairman of Poundland, offered two reasons for submitting to Steinhoff’s £597m bid. The first was par for the course and legitimate. The South African outfit is a decent employer and is offering a price that Poundland, even with its freshly minted turnaround plan, might not be able to achieve for ages under its own steam. A take-out price of 220p compares with 150p before the action started. That’s an honourable premium to accept, even if Poundland was trading above 350p last year before its messy purchase of 99p Stores. Then came the other explanation. “In addition, the UK’s decision to leave the EU has increased short-term uncertainty,” said the company. Too feeble. OK, at a push, one can believe that a 10% fall in the pound against the dollar will weaken Poundland’s buying clout on imported goods. But it seems equally possible that discount stores such as Poundland could be beneficiaries of Brexit if shoppers feel poorer. The punters may look to recoup the pounds they lose on pricier petrol by topping up on Poundland’s cheap toothpaste and tat. The precise on-the-ground impact of Brexit on retailers is hard to predict. In any case, “short-term” worries are rarely a good basis on which to sell a company. If Poundland was really so risk-averse, it should never have bought 99p Stores. In doing so, it put itself at the mercy of a competition inquiry, which duly proved disruptive. Perhaps we will have to get used to company chairmen citing Brexit to support any decision under the sun. It is not compulsory to share Wetherspoons publican Tim Martin’s upbeat view that exit from the EU is a “Magna Carta moment” that will bring greater democracy and prosperity to the UK. But, please, if you’re going to play the Brexit card and warble airily about “increased uncertainties”, explain why your business is too rigid to adapt. A good time to drop Hinkley Point C If Theresa May is looking for an excuse to ditch Hinkley Point C, here it is: a stinging report from the National Audit Office on the potential cost of the proposed nuclear power station in Somerset. Energy consumers could end up paying £29.7bn in top-up payments under the contract granted to EDF, Hinkley’s French state-backed developer. That compares with £6.1bn in October 2013 when the strike-price for the 35-year contract was agreed. The difference, as the NAO states, is a function of the movement in wholesale energy prices. The more wholesale prices fall, the bigger the subsidy appears. Over 35 years, the Department of Energy and Climate Change might counter, anything could happen. Well, yes, but a difference of £20bn-plus is hard to dismiss as mere theoretical modelling or the inevitable price to be paid for the certainty of nuclear-generated electricity. It would be rational for a government presented with a report like the NAO’s to re-examine the financial logic of Hinkley. Legally, it may be too late and the ball may already be in EDF’s court. But, given the months of procrastination on the French side, the company may also want an excuse to drop Hinkley. Go for it, Mrs May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/may/27/francois-hollande-vows-to-stand-firm-on-labour-reforms-amid-strife","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-27T16:33:43Z","webTitle":"François Hollande resists union pressure to abandon labour reforms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/27/francois-hollande-vows-to-stand-firm-on-labour-reforms-amid-strife","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/may/27/francois-hollande-vows-to-stand-firm-on-labour-reforms-amid-strife","fields":{"headline":"François Hollande resists union pressure to abandon labour reforms","bodyText":"The French president François Hollande has promised to stand firm over controversial labour reforms as the hardline CGT union urged workers to step up fuel and energy strikes to force him to abandon his proposed law. After days of strike blockades at oil refineries and fuel depots forced France to dip into its strategic fuel supplies to counter petrol shortages, Hollande told reporters at the G7 summit in Japan: “I will stand firm because I think it is a good reform.” He said the government’s priority was to ensure the “normal functioning of the economy” in the face of some of most severe industrial action in decades, which has resulted in scores of pumps running dry and violent clashes in Paris. As France prepares to host 2 million people for the Euro 2016 football championships from 10 June, the CGT union leading the strikes has called on workers to intensify their action. The employers’ federation, Medef, said the strikes would have a negative effect on France’s fragile economic growth. its head, Pierre Gattaz, said the government should resist “blackmail”, calling the strikers “thugs”. The government is under increasing pressure to find a way out of the standoff, but neither president nor unions have indicated they are prepared to budge. While there were still long queues at petrol stations in some parts of the country on Friday, the situation eased slightly in some areas as union blockades of fuel depots were lifted. But six of France’s eight oil refineries were still shut down or operating at reduced capacity as a result of the union action. Strikes continued at nuclear power stations – which provide three quarters of the country’s electricity – but have not affected supply. Polls have shown that a majority of French people blame the government for the crisis, saying it mishandled the reforms. An Opinionway poll found 66% of French people think the government should abandon their plans. “The ball is in the government’s court,” the CGT union leader Philippe Martinez told Reuters, insisting the law should be shelved. The government argues its measures are a much-needed loosening of France’s famously rigid labour protections, cutting red tape and tweaking some of the more cumbersome rules that deter employers from hiring. The Elysée argues they would make France more competitive and help tackle stubborn mass unemployment, that tops 10% of the workforce. But after more than two months of street demonstrations, the CGT has radically upped its strategy and is now trying to choke off the nation’s fuel supply to force Hollande to abandon what it sees as a betrayal of workers’ rights."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/nov/06/call-me-emotional-if-you-like-but-my-anti-nuclear-arguments-are-based-on-evidence","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-06T01:05:25Z","webTitle":"Call me emotional, but my anti-nuclear arguments are based on evidence | Scott Ludlam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/06/call-me-emotional-if-you-like-but-my-anti-nuclear-arguments-are-based-on-evidence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/06/call-me-emotional-if-you-like-but-my-anti-nuclear-arguments-are-based-on-evidence","fields":{"headline":"Call me emotional, but my anti-nuclear arguments are based on evidence","bodyText":"Nuclear power has hit the headlines again. The South Australian royal commission into the nuclear fuel cycle has rebooted the conversation around international spent fuel dumping at the same time the new chief scientist has thrown nuclear into the mix as part of the solution to climate change. The question of whether to “value add” our uranium exports with an enrichment and fuel fabrication industry is being considered from the prime minister’s office on down. As climate change emerges from future predictions into present reality, a new generation is querying whether opposition to the nuclear industry might be an ideological hangover that we can no longer afford. The most common accusation levelled at opponents of the nuclear fuel chain is that our arguments are “emotional”, or that we’re trying to silence rational debate through unspecified means. I’ve done three Reddit AMAs in the past two years, and on all three, the question has been put forcefully by young and technically literate Redditors: we love the Greens’ respect for science when it comes to climate change or vaccination, so why the hell do you turn your backs on science when it comes to nuclear power? Here’s the thing: we have no argument with the science of nuclear fission whatsoever. A 50-year research arc stretching from Curie and Rutherford to Einstein and Szilard was validated when Enrico Fermi’s team confirmed the neutron radiation beaming invisibly from a pile of uranium on a squash court at the University of Chicago in 1942. The first real-world application lit up the desert at the Trinity Test Site in 1945; the second, less dramatically, was packed into the hull of the USS Nautilus nuclear submarine in 1954. The problem is not with the science; that argument is long done. The problem is with the applications of the science. I would respectfully ask anyone who believes nuclear energy can play a constructive role in decarbonising the world’s energy systems to try some science of your own. Test your theory against the data, and see how it stacks up. The World Nuclear Industry Status Report (WMISR) is an independent, painstaking statistical record of the world’s reactor fleet, its age profile, economic performance and near-term prospects, broken out country by country and updated annually. Based on this available data, I have a number of theories to offer about the future of nuclear power. The decline to obsolescence has begun Here is one: that the first and second generations of light water and Candu (Canada Deuterium Uranium) reactors are entering a twilight from which they will not recover, and that nobody, not even China, is building new plants anywhere near fast enough to prevent a steep decline in the number and output of nuclear generators. This theory is supported in the WNISR 2015, which demonstrates that “peak nuclear” was as long ago as 2002, that the long decline to obsolescence is well under way, and that the average age of an operating reactor is now 29 years. The most expensive electricity ever generated Here is another theory: that a new generation of 21st century light water reactors will produce the most expensive electricity ever generated, in the unlikely event that they proceed all the way to completion. In 2008, the UK government announced that they would build 10 new reactors, with the first power being produced in 2018. Seven years on, that has been reduced to just one proposed new reactor at Hinkley Point. Construction is yet to begin, and even the previously optimistic projections suggesting the first electricity wouldn’t be generated until 2023 are now out of date, with the developer now refusing to provide a new estimate. The cost, originally proposed to be less than £10bn, then £14bn, then £18bn – at which point brokers suggested that investors should sell their shares in EDF – has now been estimated to be as high as £24.5bn. That’s nearly AUD $53bn. Flagship projects in Finland and France are now so catastrophically over budget that there is a real possibility they won’t ever be switched on. No new reactor type is feasible How about this theory: that a new generation of small-scale fission plants burning thorium or mixed oxide plutonium fuel, or advanced fusion technologies cooking hydrogen into helium will be so costly, unmanageable or simply unbuildable that they will play no meaningful role in the transition to a zero carbon world. How is this prediction going to survive contact with the real world? The Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor in the south of France – a prototype fusion plant – was expected to cost $5bn. Following chronic delays and management turmoil that estimate has blown out by billions. The prototype will most likely not be operational by 2020. Even the proponents have stopped making confident estimates of when actual power stations might be able to begin making a contribution to decarbonising the world’s energy systems. Nuclear plants using low-grade uranium take almost half their operational life “paying back” the energy it took to build them. Thorium technology is frequently pitched as the front-runner to replace uranium fission plants, but there are sound reasons why nobody has ever been able to get an industry on its feet, despite a global abundance of the raw material. Almost anything is possible if you hurl enough money at it, but because the thorium fuel chain is not as intrinsically tied to nuclear weapons production as uranium technology, the technology has never benefitted from the impossibly deep pockets of the weapons developers. Not so the plutonium sector: the dreamers of infinite energy took the reprocessing technology used to build the Nagasaki bomb and envisioned a “closed loop” nuclear economy which would recycle fissionable uranium and alchemic traces of plutonium into mixed oxide fuel for feeding back into reactors. It is hard to gauge how much has been spent on this vision of a nuclear perpetual motion machine, but we’re fortunate in that it’s been a total failure, because the environmental, public health and security consequences of a globally distributed plutonium economy at scale are almost too hideous to contemplate. Whether or not a commercial fusion/thorium/plutonium power industry emerges in the next 20 or 30 years would be irrelevant to the climate debate if not for the huge commitment of resources, expertise and time that are going into these new reactor types, and that is cash that’s not being spent on scalable, decentralised clean energy networks. Clean energy is already more efficient than nuclear So here’s another theory: that clean energy technologies, principally solar, wind, energy efficiency and distributed storage are rapidly out-competing nuclear energy on cost, speed of installation and community acceptance. This is my favourite theory of all, but I’m trying to keep emotion out of this for the moment. The June 2015 BP Statistical Review of World Energy showed that nuclear now contributes just 4.4% of the global energy mix. Renewable energy, without the military-industrial head start, now contributes 6% with an annual growth rate of 12%. BP concludes that, “Consumption increased for all fuels, reaching record levels for every fuel type except nuclear power.” As part of the Greens’ negotiations with Labor in 2010, Christine Milne requested that the Australian Energy Market Operator conduct detailed modelling on a 100% renewable energy plan for Australia. The various scenarios demonstrated it was entirely possible to have this in place by 2030. The study itself is already cheerfully obsolete, having overestimated the demand for grid-sourced energy, and massively underestimated the rapid growth in rooftop solar. This is consistent with the Beyond Zero Emissions Stationary Energy Plan dating back to 2010, and it’s consistent with independent modelling commissioned by the Western Australian Greens for the more localised Energy 2029 project which showed that going to 100% renewable energy would be cheaper than building the next generation of fossil plants and upgrades out to the year 2029. If this new nuclear push is really about climate, it should engage with the real question: what is the fastest, cheapest, safest way to decarbonise the global stationary energy sector? The evidence shows that nuclear is neither fast, cheap, nor safe. We’re being softened up to accept a nuclear fuel dump The final theory, harder to test against the evidence, is that this new nuclear push in Australia isn’t about climate change at all, but that in fact we’re being softened up for a sustained campaign to build one or more spent nuclear fuel dumps in outback Australia. As has been the case time and again around the world, Aboriginal people will be asked to sacrifice country to a cargo that will still be carcinogenic in tens of thousands of years. There is a reason the nuclear industry seeks stable, high isolation sites with deep groundwater and low seismic activity: because they know, and occasionally they even admit, that there is no form of engineered containment that this material won’t burn its way out of. They want remote sites because the dumps are guaranteed to eventually come apart at the seams. To many, this is an argument for keeping the fuel in hardened, dry, above-ground or near-surface storage under continual monitoring while the research community set about developing waste isolation technologies that aren’t guaranteed to fail within a few decades. This work may be years in the making, or it may be centuries: nobody really knows. Principally, it is an argument against producing any more of this material, which brings us back to the core of the argument: maybe we no longer actually need the nuclear industry, or its intergenerational liabilities, if ever we did. That’s a theory shared by the global anti-nuclear community. We believe it tests well against the evidence, and it has allowed us to make some pretty gloomy predictions over the last few decades that have in turn tested well against reality. One final word on the subject of emotion It is reasonably easy to run emotionless arguments about the merits of nuclear power when you live a long way from the impact area of the industry. I’ve been fortunate enough to spend time with a small number of the 130,000 radiation refugees permanently displaced by the triple meltdowns at Fukushima. I’ve met with Jharkhand villagers inside the plant footprint of the Indian uranium mining complex at Jadugoda who are nursing two generations of deformed children. I’ve stood with Aboriginal people defying new waves of uranium dispossession in the Goldfields and Top End. I have heard first-hand from Japanese elders what it is like to be under a nuclear weapons strike. If these experiences hadn’t provoked emotional responses, I’d be deeply worried about my humanity. I strongly believe the theories that the anti-nuclear movement bring to these questions are sound, evidence-based and tested through three generations of bitter experience, but I’ve come to realise that attempting to eliminate emotional responses or basic compassion from arguments about industrial energy systems is a major part of the problem. Either way, if we’re to have this argument yet again, bring it on. All we ask is that both sides of the argument work from a common understanding of what the evidence actually says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2016/feb/13/nuclear-waste-protection-thousands-years","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-13T20:27:45Z","webTitle":"Britain leads race to make nuclear waste safe for 100,000 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/13/nuclear-waste-protection-thousands-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/feb/13/nuclear-waste-protection-thousands-years","fields":{"headline":"Britain leads race to make nuclear waste safe for 100,000 years","bodyText":"British scientists are designing a revolutionary cement that could withstand the impact of intense radiation for thousands of years. The project could prove vital in dealing with the challenges of Britain’s proposed expansion of its nuclear industry. The government has announced plans to build several nuclear power stations over the next decade to provide power previously generated by coal, oil and gas stations. These are now likely to be phased out as part of the UK’s climate change commitments. However, a move towards more nuclear power will lead to the generation of extra nuclear waste. It is estimated that about 300,000 cubic metres of highly radioactive intermediate waste – including old fuel rods and irradiated reactor components – will have accumulated in the UK by 2030 as a result of this expansion. At present, these swelling stocks are stored above ground, near reactors. However, their growing risk to the environment has forced the government to pledge to dispose of the material underground in a major depository. However, before its location is agreed, planners will have to ensure that the waste will remain safe for at least 100,000 years, the time needed to allow their radioactivity to decay to a safe level. A key part of that effort will include the design of cement that can withstand intense radiation levels so that it can be used to cover nuclear waste once it has been placed in pits deep underground. “To work out how materials – in this case cement – are going to behave for tens of thousands of years is quite mind-boggling, but that is exactly what we are now doing,” said the project’s leader, Claire Corkhill of Sheffield University. She is due to present details of the project at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington on Sunday. The key to her team’s project is the UK’s Diamond Light Source, near Oxford. The facility accelerates electrons almost to the speed of light, so that they give off a light 10 billion times brighter than the sun. These bright beams are then directed off into laboratories, where they are used to study the properties of many different types of material: ice, viruses, cancer drugs – and cement. “Many of the technological problems that affect society today are ones that take place at a very slow rate: melting ice in the Arctic or the decay of batteries,” said Professor Trevor Rayment, head of physical sciences at Diamond. “By using our machine to measure very accurately changes taking place in the materials we are studying, we can discover how those changes might affect them in hundreds or thousands of years.” In the case of the cement being studied, Corkhill and her team have examined how it reacts with water over the long term. “That interaction between water and cement granules can go on for decades,” added Corkhill. “We are using Diamond to predict what cement will be like thousands of years in the future. No one has ever done that before.” From this work, the group has designed a new form of cement which could then be used to cover nuclear waste inside underground stores. “That cement will be able to capture all of the radioactive elements that might be released from the waste over time,” added Corkhill. “Cements that are currently in use do not do this. Our cement will therefore make nuclear waste disposal even safer.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/nov/04/oil-firms-announce-1bn-green-fund-as-paris-climate-deal-comes-into-force","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-04T12:10:06Z","webTitle":"Oil firms announce $1bn climate fund to clean up gas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/04/oil-firms-announce-1bn-green-fund-as-paris-climate-deal-comes-into-force","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/nov/04/oil-firms-announce-1bn-green-fund-as-paris-climate-deal-comes-into-force","fields":{"headline":"Oil firms announce $1bn climate fund to clean up gas","bodyText":"A $1bn fund for cutting the climate change impact of oil and gas has been announced by 10 of the world’s biggest oil companies, aimed at keeping the firms in business and cutting the burning of coal. Global action to cut carbon emissions threaten the future of the oil industry and the fund was revealed on the day the global Paris climate change agreement came into force. But analysts called the sum a “drop in the ocean” which showed the companies were not serious in tackling global warming. The new fund will focus on reducing leaks of natural gas – a powerful greenhouse agent – and technology to capture and store carbon emissions when gas is burned to produce electricity, as well as increasing the fuel efficiency of vehicles. But it will not support the renewable energy, smart grid and storage technologies which are revolutionising the electricity industry. Sustainable investment and climate change campaigners dismissed the initiative as ‘greenwash’, noting that, with the fund to be deployed over the next decade, the $100m annual investment represents just 0.1% of the companies’ current level of yearly capital expenditure. Scientists have calculated that half of all known gas reserves and a third of oil reserves cannot be burned if the world is to meet the Paris limit of 2C of warming. This makes the oil companies’ current business model of continuing exploration for new reserves nonsensical, say the campaigners. The 10 companies that comprise the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) produce 20% of the world’s oil and gas. Bob Dudley, chief executive of BP and OGCI chairman, said: “We all absolutely realise the world will move to a low-carbon world. Don’t worry, we got it. The technology to monitor and reduce fugitive methane [gas] emissions, that is an essential licence for us to advocate for natural gas.” Dudley, whose own pay is higher than BP’s contributions to the fund, said gas produced half the emissions of coal, the use of which is increasing in Asia. “The price of coal is low and people are choosing affordable energy not clean energy. It’s going to make gas miss the opportunity.” Patrick Pouyanné, CEO of Total, said the technologies the new fund would back were vital: “It is a matter for us of being able to maintain our business in the future.” The OGCI see carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology as a way to prolong the continued use of fossil fuels. Scientists agree CCS is vital as without it the cost of tackling climate change will hugely increase, according to the the UN’s climate science panel. But developing commercial scale CCS is likely to require many billions of dollars. Oil and gas contribute about 37% of global carbon emissions, with transport a major user of oil. The OGCI said it will work with auto manufacturers to develop more efficient vehicles but this will compete with the fast growth of electric cars. Defending the relatively small size of the fund, Josu Jon Imaz, CEO of Repsol, said: “The target of this fund is to be a seed, a catalyst.” The new fund was not investing in renewable energy as it wanted to focus on where oil companies could have the most impact, he said. But Danni Paffard, at climate campaign group 350.org said: ‘This announcement is outrageous filibustering from an industry with no future. Forget their smoke and mirrors offerings, the fossil fuel industry’s basic business plan doesn’t stack up with global climate goals. Real climate action means leaving oil, coal and gas reserves in the ground, and until they do that nobody will be falling for this cynical PR spin.” Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a UK-based thinktank, said: “Investing $1bn over 10 years averages to just $10m per year per company involved. This figure is a drop in the ocean,” he said. Bill Gates alone is contributing $1bn to the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, Marshall noted. “The business models of these companies are fundamentally incompatible with the Paris climate commitments,” he said. “This announcement shows that oil and gas companies are contemplating no real deviation from their traditional business models.” Juliet Philips, at sustainable investment NGO ShareAction, said: “Until initiatives like those announced by the OGCI are backed up by long-term corporate strategies that are consistent with achieving the Paris treaty, scepticism of their sincerity is inevitable.” Managers of investments totalling more than $2.6tn have already committed to pulling out of fossil fuel companies. Shell CEO, Ben van Beurden, said: “We cannot burn all the hydrocarbons on the planet in an unmitigated way but there is also another truism that there is no alternative to using some hydrocarbons for a very long time to come.” He said economics would determine which fossil fuels are left in the ground. Amin Nasser, chief executive of Saudi Aramco, said: “Oil will continue to be part of the energy mix for decades to come.” Oil companies are under increasing pressure from both climate change policy and the rise of renewable energy. In October, the International Energy Agency said the rollout of renewables was accelerating and predicted capacity from renewable sources will grow faster than oil, gas, coal or nuclear power in the next five years. On Wednesday, OGCI-member Shell, said oil demand could peak as soon as five years from now, a moment that would herald the end of oil production growth. The OGCI members are BP, CNPC, Eni, Pemex, Reliance Industries, Repsol, Saudi Aramco, Shell, Statoil and Total, but no US oil companies have joined."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2016/sep/29/zorya-luhansk-manchester-united-europa-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-29T09:00:38Z","webTitle":"Zorya Luhansk excel in exile to earn dream trip to Manchester United","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/29/zorya-luhansk-manchester-united-europa-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2016/sep/29/zorya-luhansk-manchester-united-europa-league","fields":{"headline":"Zorya Luhansk excel in exile to earn dream trip to Manchester United","bodyText":"“I’m very pleased with the fact that United sent their scout to watch our game against Vorskla,” the Zorya Luhansk coach, Yuriy Vernydub, said this week, which makes a change from those managers who try desperately to hide themselves away from future opponents. “Before, they used to say that no one knew about Zorya, whereas now scouts are watching our boys. It means that the players deserve that.” Zorya have particular reason to want to be known: their very existence in European competition feels like a triumph. In June 2014, the Ukrainian club were forced to flee Luhansk because of the conflict with pro-Russia separatists who founded the Luhansk People’s Republic. Zorya’s home ground, the Avangard Stadium, suffered heavy shelling. They moved to Zaporizhzhya, 400km to the south-west, where they play home games at the Slavutych Arena. Its address, just over the road from the Museum of the History of Warfare on Bulvar Lobanovskoho, gives an indication of Zaporizhzhya’s main place in Ukrainian football history: it was there in May 2002, leading his Dynamo Kyiv side against Metalurh, that Valeriy Lobanovskyi collapsed in the dug-out, dying a few days later in hospital. Vernydub’s spirit of openness also makes a significant change from how things used to be in Zaporizhzhya. In Soviet times it was a closed town because of its role in the energy industry, the site of both Europe’s largest nuclear power plant and a huge hydroelectric dam (Zaporizhzhya means “beyond the rapids”). Zorya have thrived in adversity. Their players have reportedly not been paid in six months – not an uncommon story in modern Ukraine – but despite that and despite playing away from home they finished fourth in the league last season, their highest placing since surprisingly lifting the Soviet title in 1972. They have continued their form this season, Saturday’s 2-1 win over Vorskla leaving them second in the table. “I hope we will put on a decent performance in Manchester, although it will be very difficult,” said Vernydub. “It’s hard to compare our clubs in terms of anything, be it squads or finances. But that will make our match-up even more interesting. Am I nervous? Not yet. “Nervousness comes on the day of the match and during the opening five to 10 minutes of the game. We respect our opponents a lot and understand that we will face a very strong club. But we are ready for that. United have weaknesses too. We must take to the pitch and fight.” Nobody doubts that Vernydub is the real star of Zorya. The 50-year-old had a journeyman career in the 80s and 90s as a defender or midfielder, playing 112 games for Metalurh Zaporizhzhya and 76 for Torpedo, the other club in the city, before a late-career flourish at Zenit St Petersburg, with whom he won the Russian Cup in 1999. He returned to Zaporizhzhya and worked as a coach at Metalurh before becoming the assistant manager of Zorya in 2009. When Anatoly Chantsev was sacked in 2011, Vernydub was placed in temporary control, taking the job permanently after a 0-0 draw with Dynamo. His reputation has grown to the extent that when Mircea Lucescu left Shakhtar Donetsk last summer, he was considered a serious candidate before Paulo Fonseca got the job. Relations between the two displaced clubs remain strong, though, and at Old Trafford Zorya may feature as many as six players on loan from Shakhtar. Verydub tends to prefer a 4‑2‑1‑3 shape, with a gameplan based on diligence, teamwork and high tempo. They perhaps lack a little guile and can struggle against teams who set out to frustrate them, and are at their best when they can sit deep and attack the space behind an opponent. They have pace in wide areas, with the rapid full-backs, Yevhen Opanasenko and Nikita Kamenyuka, always looking to get forward and join a counterattack. Recent results against Ukraine’s big clubs suggest how dangerous they can be: in the past two years Zorya have beaten Shakhtar 1-0 away and 3-2 at home, as well as achieving a 2-2 draw and a 1-0 win at Dynamo. Even after a 1-1 home draw against Fenerbahce in their opening Europa League group game, no one is thinking quite in those terms about the trip to Manchester. Most players, in fact, seem vaguely bewildered the match is happening at all. “United are not just serious opponents, but very serious ones,” said the midfielder Dmytro Hrechyshkin, one of those on loan from Shakhtar. “As for them underestimating us, I doubt it will be the case. In light of our recent results, I think United will take us seriously. Every player dreams of playing against such clubs as United. Apart from on a computer game, it was difficult to envisage a game between United and Zorya a few years ago. To be honest, I haven’t even dreamt of playing at Old Trafford, but I hope that I will.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2016/jun/07/solar-sets-british-record-for-may-producing-more-electricity-than-coal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-07T16:42:11Z","webTitle":"UK solar eclipses coal power over month for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/07/solar-sets-british-record-for-may-producing-more-electricity-than-coal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jun/07/solar-sets-british-record-for-may-producing-more-electricity-than-coal","fields":{"headline":"UK solar eclipses coal power over month for first time","bodyText":"Solar power in the UK produced more electricity than coal across the whole of May, the first ever month to pass the milestone, according to research by analysts at Carbon Brief. Solar panels generated 50% more electricity than the fossil fuel across the month, as days lengthened and coal use fell. Solar generated an estimated 1,336 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity in May, compared to 893GWh output from coal. Coal was once the mainstay of the nation’s power system but the rapid rise of solar panels and of climate change concerns has seen its use plummet, leading to a series of milestones in recent weeks. Solar surpassed coal over a whole day for the first time on 9 April, while the electricity produced by coal fell to zero several times in early May, thought to be the first time this had happened since the late 19th century. Coal power stations are running less often due to age and restrictions on the pollution they produce and a series have closed down in recent months, including Ferrybridge and Eggborough in Yorkshire, Fiddlers Ferry plant in Cheshire and Longannet in Scotland. The government has pledged to phase out all coal-fired electricity by 2025, but on Tuesday a Conservative thinktank called for the shutdown to come at least two years earlier. Former Tory energy minister Lord Greg Barker said: “The government should give investors [building greener energy projects] even greater certainty and with that, put UK plc firmly at the forefront of the global drive for clean and smart energy technologies.” The cost of renewable energy, particularly solar panels, has plummeted in recent years. However, the government has cut solar power subsidies and blocked onshore wind farms, while backing fracking and new nuclear power stations. Earlier in May, a report from Ernst &amp; Young found the attractions of the UK to investors in renewable energy projects was at an all-time low. The UK had routinely topped the annual league table in the mid-2000s but slid to 13th in the global rankings in 2016. EY’s Ben Warren, said the UK government’s policies were “putting the attractiveness of the UK’s renewable energy sector on a landslide. The current approach is going against the grain of almost universal global support for renewables.” Renewable energy records are also being set in other countries, with Portugal running for four days straight on green energy alone in early May. In 2015, 42% of all Denmark’s electricity was produced by wind turbines. Investment in renewable energy around the world now far outstrips that in coal and gas plants. In 2015, $286bn (£196bn) was invested in renewable energy, more than double that invested in fossil fuel power stations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2016/jan/29/jane-fonda-five-best-moments-youth","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-29T15:37:45Z","webTitle":"Jane Fonda: five best moments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/29/jane-fonda-five-best-moments-youth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2016/jan/29/jane-fonda-five-best-moments-youth","fields":{"headline":"Jane Fonda: five best moments","bodyText":"In the early 90s, finding work harder to come by, Jane Fonda announced her retirement from the film industry. This was after a career that included two Oscar wins and five nominations, as well as an Emmy, two Baftas and supplementary success as a fitness guru. Recently she’s found herself back in the spotlight, with a role in Netflix comedy series Grace and Frankie alongside Lily Tomlin, and providing a brutal Golden Globe-nominated cameo in Paolo Sorrentino’s Youth. Here’s a look back at her best moments: Cat Ballou The 60s was a busy time for Fonda, with 17 films to her name in the decade. While the productions’ quality wasn’t consistent, she proved a versatile screen presence, adept at both comedy and drama. Her light touch was on show in this comedy western, which proved she was also a bankable star. The film itself may have been patchy, but Fonda’s star potential was never brighter. Klute Fonda developed an admirably selective attitude to the films she picked after breaking out, turning down leads in Rosemary’s Baby and Bonnie and Clyde. Holding out served her well, with her first role of the 70s winning her an Oscar for best actress. As the cynical prostitute who finds herself embroiled in the search for a killer, she’s tough, at times fascinatingly unemotional and yet ultimately vulnerable, dominating the film with a complex performance. Coming Home As the 70s drew to a close (an era when the actor believed her options were limited because of her political views), Fonda won her second Oscar for a film that was closely tied to her stance on Vietnam. In a drama she developed herself, she played a woman who starts an affair with a paralysed veteran while her husband is away at war. Fonda gives a deeply felt and restrained turn, refusing to present her performance or the film as anything resembling a lecture. The China Syndrome Fonda’s insistence that she would only star in films that focused on “important” issues led her to this unsettling thriller about a cover-up at a nuclear power plant. While the film’s plot was rubbished by the nuclear power industry, the release was swiftly followed by a real-life accident at a facility in Pennsylvania. Fonda’s Oscar-nominated portrayal of a light-news reporter dealing with serious issues for the first time utilised her comic touch as well as her dramatic abilities. On Golden Pond Fonda had a difficult relationship with her father, Henry, and in a bid to bring them closer together she bought the screen rights to Ernest Thompson’s play, with the two of them set to star. In the drama, their estranged father-daughter dynamic worked wonderfully, thanks largely to the uncomfortable truths that lay behind it, and Fonda’s performance as a woman trying to repair a damaged relationship was nominated for an Oscar."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2016/dec/10/turnbull-was-right-in-2009-ruling-out-emissions-trading-is-bullshit","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2016-12-09T22:04:49Z","webTitle":"Turnbull was right in 2009: ruling out emissions trading is 'bullshit' | Lenore Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/10/turnbull-was-right-in-2009-ruling-out-emissions-trading-is-bullshit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2016/dec/10/turnbull-was-right-in-2009-ruling-out-emissions-trading-is-bullshit","fields":{"headline":"Turnbull was right in 2009: ruling out emissions trading is 'bullshit'","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull’s climate policy stance is “bullshit” according to his own searing assessment when Tony Abbott advanced similar ideas. That was back in the days when Turnbull let facts interfere with his decisions. In 2009, just after he was dumped from the Liberal leadership, Turnbull wrote a blog in which he provided some frank and forceful thoughts about the climate change position of the man who had beaten him. Like a ghost from a more principled past, his old arguments now apply to his own position. “First, let’s get this straight. You cannot cut emissions without a cost. To replace dirty coal-fired power stations with cleaner gas-fired ones or renewables like wind, let alone nuclear power or even coal-fired power with carbon capture and storage, is all going to cost money ... So any suggestion that you can dramatically cut emissions without any cost is, to use a favourite term of Mr Abbott, ‘bullshit’. Moreover, he knows it,” Turnbull the backbencher-with-convictions wrote. “The whole argument for an emissions trading scheme, as opposed to cutting emissions via a carbon tax or simply by regulation, is that it is cheaper – in other words electricity prices will rise by less to achieve the same level of emission reductions …”. But when Turnbull minister Josh Frydenberg said a review of Abbott’s Direct Action policy – which the Coalition had retained all those years – would at least consider a low-cost form of emissions trading for the electricity sector, it took Prime Minister Turnbull just 36 hours to can it. Whether or not Abbott understood the limitations of his Direct Action policy, we know for sure that Turnbull is right across those limitations now. He ruled out the so-called baseline and credit trading scheme even though it was what the policy had been designed to possibly morph into, what the government had been privately assuring stakeholders it would consider, had broad support from opposition parties, industry and the environment movement, and had the prospect of finally ending the stupid barren years of climate wars and delivering business the policy certainty it has been pleading for for years. He ruled it out even though – true to his own 2009 argument – it was also far cheaper for the government and for consumers. Cheaper according to the Australian Energy Market Commission and the Australian Energy Market Operator and the electricity transmission sector – based on modelling done by CSIRO – and the independent Climate Change Authority. It has been tacitly endorsed by the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, in his review of the electricity sector and the experts say it is the policy most likely to avoid disruption in the electricity sector because it would provide some certainty for investment. And he ruled it out before the review had even considered it. Why would a leader rule out what seemed like such a logical option? Why would he rule out all carbon pricing options? 2009 Malcolm had a pretty good take on that too. “The fact is that Tony [Abbott] and the people who put him in his job do not want to do anything about climate change. They do not believe in human-caused global warming. As Tony observed on one occasion, ‘climate change is crap’,” he wrote. Those same climate sceptics in the Coalition still don’t want to do anything about climate change, and even though Abbott is no longer prime minister they still seem to be calling the shots. At least Kevin Rudd tried to legislate his climate policy – an emissions trading scheme – in the face of a hysterical scare campaign, before finally abandoning it without an alternative. After a couple of stern words from backbenchers Abbott and Cory Bernardi, Turnbull decided not to even try to make the argument. Perhaps the review will come up with other means to meet Australia’s climate change obligations. But the only obvious alternatives are more Direct Action-style direct government funding for abatement, which Turnbull has previously observed is “a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale” and “a very expensive charge on the budget in the years ahead”. Then there is change forced through government regulation, which, as he said in his blog, is also more expensive (and goodness me, what would the Coalition conservatives say about big government and red tape?). Which leaves us back in the “bullshit”: the insistence that existing policy is fit for purpose and that some kind of carbon pricing scheme will be more expensive and result in a less reliable electricity system. All the available evidence says the exact reverse, unless of course you are comparing the cost of the scheme with the cost of doing virtually nothing to reduce emissions. In 2009 Turnbull described the only kind of climate policy that could win the favour of the climate sceptics in his party. “Any policy that is announced will simply be a con, an environmental figleaf to cover a determination to do nothing.” First we got fake news – made-up stories that get shared so often that people start to believe them. Now that we have governments ignoring available evidence, we risk fact-free fake public policy. If Barnaby Joyce keeps saying a carbon price will force us all to live in the dark in caves, people might be persuaded to ignore the experts and believe that he’s right. After all he got a long way with that great $100 lamb roast line. And at least he looks like he means it. When the prime minister delivers the old lines about a carbon price pushing electricity bills up – like when he was getting called out by the premiers at Coag on Friday – he sounds like he’s reading from someone else’s script. Perhaps that is because he still dimly remembers his assessment – again in his 2009 blog – about politicians who refuse to act in line with their convictions and the available facts. “Politics is about conviction and a commitment to carry out those convictions. Many Liberals are rightly dismayed that on this vital issue of climate change we are not simply without a policy, without any prospect of having a credible policy, but we are now without integrity. We have given our opponents the irrefutable, undeniable evidence that we cannot be trusted,” he wrote. It’s hard to put it better than that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2016/sep/15/may-approves-hinkley-point-but-with-new-safeguards-over-foreign-nuclear-investment-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-15T15:08:49Z","webTitle":"Corbyn says vote to leave EU was 'decisive rejection of failed economic model' – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/15/may-approves-hinkley-point-but-with-new-safeguards-over-foreign-nuclear-investment-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2016/sep/15/may-approves-hinkley-point-but-with-new-safeguards-over-foreign-nuclear-investment-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn says vote to leave EU was 'decisive rejection of failed economic model' – as it happened","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has claimed that the Brexit vote showed the need for a new, interventionist approach to running the economy. In one of the most detailed speeches he has given on the economy since becoming Labour leader, he linked the vote in the EU referendum with his longstanding belief that neoliberal economics are failing by claiming that the leave vote was a “decisive rejection” of the status quo. The current system meant “poverty pay, zero-hours contracts and lives ruined by a shortage of affordable homes”. Corbyn said that people could no longer rely on free trade and free markets alone to deliver prosperity. Our heavily-indebted societies are more vulnerable to financial shocks than they were. All of this presents a deep challenge to the social democratic and socialist tradition that Labour, New or Old, has always been a part of. It punctures the old belief that it was possible simply to redistribute the proceeds a growing economy to pay for public services. It can no longer credibly be argued, for the majority of people, that free trade and free markets alone will deliver increased prosperity. Corbyn said that governments all over the world were becoming more interventionist and he said it was “unpardonable folly” for the Tories to press ahead with cuts. Giving several examples of how this might happen, he said Labour would focus on investment. This would involve a new approach to enforcing free market rules, he went on, singling out EU state aid rules as a particular issue. Any deal with the EU must recognise that the old state aid rules are no longer valid. When governments across the world are intervening, it makes no sense to tie a government’s hands here. Later, in response to a question, Corbyn said that he was not saying Britain should reject a trade deal with the EU after Brexit if it involved accepting state aid rules; he just wanted Britain to be able to adopt a flexible approach to state aid, as Germany, France and Italy seem to be allowed to do, he said. But he did say that under Labour the government would insist on using British steel for infrastructure projects. John McDonnell has said the Corbyn team has apologised for the release of the list of anti-Corbyn MPs. (See 2.46pm.) Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, has announced that “supported accommodation” will be exempt from housing benefit cuts. The exemption will last until 2019, at which point a new funding model will ensure that the sector continues to be funded at current levels, he said. “Supported accommodation” is housing for vulnerable people with particular needs, like people with learning disabilities or addiction problems or women seeking refuge from domestic violence, and campaigners have been arguing for months that, without an exemption from the housing benefit cuts, many of these establishments could be forced to close. That’s all from me for today. Tomorrow I will be blogging from the Ukip conference in Bournemouth. Anna Turley, one of the Labour MPs named on the list of anti-Corbyn MPs released by the Corbyn camp, has just told Sky News that she appreciates John McDonnell’s apology. Here are the key Labour-related points from the Q&amp;A. I will post a separate summary from the speech later, taking in replies to the speech-related questions. Jeremy Corbyn said he was confident he would have a “full team” of shadow ministers in place after the leadership election. At the moment dozens of shadow ministerial posts remain unfilled because so many MPs resigned, but Corbyn said that the party was now “coming together” and he implied that shadow frontbenchers who resigned would come back. I’m very keen on providing olive branches, and indeed a number of olive branches have been offered to me. As a practical start for this I’m growing an olive tree on the balcony of my office and it’s doing very, very well. It’s thriving. So I’m very confident we are as a party coming together. And I’m obviously having discussions with lots of colleagues. And there will be a full team in place to take on this government and provide very effective opposition. John McDonnell said the Corbyn team has apologised for the release of the list of anti-Corbyn MPs. Asked if it was right to release it, he said: We will be meeting with all our MPs on any of the issues of concern to them, of course we will. That release came from the campaign. It didn’t come from Jeremy. And we’ve apologised. It was just inappropriate. One of our researchers saw a bit of incoming flak and then did a list of all the statements that have been made by other MPs, some of which were not particularly kind, let’s put it that way. It was a briefing note. It shouldn’t have gone out. And we apologised for that. It certainly was not a list in any way to attack anyone. It was just a factual report. McDonnell said that he was “absolutely furious” about the release of the list because the Corbyn team are “rebuilding relations” with Corbyn’s critics. He says almost the whole PLP (parliamentary Labour party) backed Corbyn’s stance in PMQs yesterday on grammar schools. He said: The thing about last night, that going out, it just set us back. And I was furious about that, to be frank, absolutely furious. And just at a time when we were rebuilding relations. I hope it hasn’t set us back. And we will certainly have a conversation with all those involved. Corbyn said he never resorted to using abusive comments himself. I, as you know, never abuse anybody, tempting as it sometimes is. And I don’t respond to unkind remarks that I understand are sometimes thrown in my direction because I believe politics is far too important for that. McDonnell insisted that a comment he was recorded making in 2013 saying that as Marxist he approved of the financial crash was a joke. It was a joke. I think I also said the bankers have done more to undermine capitalism than anything the SWP have done in the last 40 years. I think it was taken as a joke and, if you listen to the tape, people fell about laughing as a result. Q: What are your Brexit plans? Do you want full EEA membership? Corbyn says he has been clear that environmental and worker protection issues are very important. They should be included in UK law. He is also very clear that the UK has a very close economic relationship with Europe. There has to be an agreement on market access, he says. Hopefully that will be part of a single market? He says Emily Thornberry has meetings in Europe on this. And he is meeting Martin Shulz, the president of the European parliament, next week, he says. Q: Are you happy with the Hinkley Point decision? And what do you think of the preferential share idea? McDonnell says he has not seen the detail. He says Labour think the finances are disappointing. But they also want to maximise the chances of getting British jobs. And that’s it. I will post a summary shortly. Q: You say any single market deal must recognise state intervention. Does that mean Labour MPs would veto a Brexit deal if it maintained state aid rules? Corbyn says this government has used state aid rules defensively. But other EU governments have not felt themselves constrained by state aid rules. Whatever relationship we have with the EU, we must not sign up to something that constrains governments, he says. He wants the UK to be able to have a strong manufacturing base like Germany and France. McDonnell says this would not be a deal breaker. He says Labour just wants the same flexibilities that other countries have exercised. Q: Are you confident that Labour MPs will return to the front bench if you win the leadership? Corbyn says he is very keen to offer olive branches. He is growing an olive tree on the balcony of his office. It is thriving, he says. He is confident the party is coming together. A full team will be in place. Corbyn says he never abuses anyone. He thinks it is important to be positive. We have a week left of the campaign, he says. In every event he does, he will say the Labour party must come together to oppose austerity, build homes and promote investment. Q: Neil Coyle said he would like to sue you about the list of supposedly abusive MPs. Was it right to release it? McDonnell says he and Corbyn will be meeting with MPs. We apologise, he says. He says someone on the press team saw criticism coming in. They drew up a list to make the point that Corbyn’s opponents have been harsh too. He says he wants the party to come together. He says he was “furious” about the list because it set the Corbyn team back. McDonnell apologises for the release of the list of anti-Corbyn MPs. Q: [To McDonnell] You said as a Marxist you welcomed the crash. Do you stand by that? It was a joke, says McDonnell. Corbyn is now taking questions. Q: Would you take BT Openreach into the public sector? John McDonnell, who is with Corbyn, answers. He says his priority would be to get investment into broadband. Corbyn confirms his interest in a universal basic income. And he proposed a right to own for workers. Labour will look to create a “Right to Own”, giving workers facing a change of ownership or closure of a firm the first refusal in putting together a worker-owned alternative. The regional development banks will be given the task … alongside assisting small businesses generally … of providing the finance to make worker ownership and co-operative ownership a reality across our economy. I want to see local councils building on the example of Preston, where a focus on using local government procurement … has helped support the local economy with real investment and sustain co-operative local enterprises. But we can go further than this … I want to see a new, co-operatively owned ‘British Mittelstand’ created: high-investment, high-productivity smaller firms that provide high-quality employment in those sectors where we have the greatest potential: digital technology, healthcare, high-value added manufacturing. Corbyn says the rich need to pay more tax. Senior members of my party used to say they were, and I quote: “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes”. The problem was that while those in my party were relaxing many of those “filthy rich” were not paying the taxes they should have been. Instead, I want to be relaxed in the knowledge that our fellow citizens are living rich lives, and for our economy to be working for people. And not working against them. And he says he would look at measures to curb executive pay. Oxfam has raised the issue of pay ratios this week and should not be ignored by politicians. This is something I am extremely interested in and we’ll be looking at ways to address the huge disparity in executive pay compared to ordinary workers. Corbyn says he would tighten up the takeover code. We’ll tighten up the Takeover Code … so that it takes better account of the impact on current employees and pensions … We want to see clear plans to support both, before takeovers can be allowed through. Corbyn says Labour would tighten up the takeover code. Corbyn says he would extend and strengthen collective bargaining, and abolish employment tribunal fees. And he proposes a “Philip Green law”. I’ve called for a “Philip Green Law” that would bar asset-strippers like Green from loading companies up with excessive debt, and paying excessive dividends. Corbyn proposes a “Philip Green” law to counter asset-stripping. Corbyn says Labour would insist on the use of British steel in infrastructure projects. We will insist, as part of our infrastructure investment programme, that high-quality British-sourced steel is used. And we will make sure that all suppliers pay at least the Living Wage and recognise trade unions One recent study suggested that even a 1 percent increase in UK government procurement … in essential industries like steel and chemical can produce a 19,000 jobs boost. Corbyn says Labour would introduce a comprehensive industrial strategy. We cannot be afraid of intervening directly to support supply chains and new industries. Any deal with the EU must recognise that the old state aid rules are no longer valid. When governments across the world are intervening, it makes no sense to tie a government’s hands here. The evidence is clear that strategic, careful interventions can make a difference. Corbyn says old state aid rules “are no longer valid”. Corbyn says he is delighted London has a Labour mayor. He says he has often agreed with him, but sometimes hasn’t. (That seems to be a reference to Sadiq Khan backing Owen Smith.) But Corbyn says he will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Khan in protecting London from Brexit. Corbyn says he would create a national education service. And Labour would invest more in scientific research. I want to see this country move towards the OECD target of 3% of GDP spent on scientific research, from all sources. We can start by doubling energy research, in line with the recommendations of Nicholas Stern and others, overturning what has been a 95% decline in energy research spending since the 1970s. Corbyn says the UK economy needs higher skills, and better digital infrastructure. Labour would deliver superfast broadband to every part of the country, he says. The turnover of Cornwall’s digital sector grew 153% in the last year, well ahead of London. The local press have started saying Cornwall can be “Britain’s Silicon Valley”. This is on the back of a £136m EU-funded scheme to introduce high-speed broadband. That’s how we can start to turn around those parts of our country that have suffered underinvestment for too long. Corbyn says governments across the world are becoming more interventionist. Governments across the world are breaking with the old model, and choosing to intervene in their economies. When the steel crisis broke, as cheap steel - mainly from China - flooded the world market and undermined their domestic industries … major governments chose to intervene. The US pushed up tariffs on imported steel to 266% in some cases. Italy moved to nationalise a steel producer. Germany increased its subsidies. The EU as a whole attempted to introduce sharp tariff increases. They were, however, held back by our own government, which clung to the old free-market dogma ... The lesson here is simple: Successful economies need governments prepared to back them up. Good business needs good government, not no government. Corbyn says governments around the world are becoming more interventionist. Corbyn says the old rules of globalisation are being rewritten. After years of plant closures and steady employment decline, one in six UK manufacturers report bringing some production back into the UK. This is “re-shoring”, driven by the need for sophisticated manufacturers to locate close to their markets and draw on highly-skilled labour. The economies that are navigating this switch successfully … are not the ones where governments are taking the hands-off approach. Corbyn says, if we want high-quality public services, we must have a high-quality economy. We’ll use record low capital costs for government to make that happen. Delivered through public capital spend … and the new National Investment Bank and regional development banks … this investment programme will be on a scale that will transform how our economy operates. Corbyn says it can no longer be argued that free markets alone benefit everyone. It can no longer credibly be argued, for the majority of people, that free trade and free markets alone will deliver increased prosperity. A future Labour government will have to do more than redistribute income and wealth … It will have to focus on how we earn that income and wealth in the first place. Corbyn says automation is now starting to threaten middle-class jobs. Up to 15m jobs are at risk from automation over the next decade the Bank of England has estimated, he says. Corbyn says the economy has suffered from a lack of investment. The pattern since the crash of 2008 has been very clear. Investment has fallen, and it has been too easy to substitute cheap, expendable labour for investment in machinery, new technology and infrastructure. The result is that our economy has become very good at generating poor-quality jobs – so that over half of those in poverty are now also in work. Deindustrialisation has helped kill off many of the relatively secure, relatively well-paid jobs that manufacturing industries support. For too many the alternative now on offer, especially for the young, is low pay and insecurity. As a result of this, the tax base is eroding, he says. If the super rich are opting out of taxes on one side … and too many people are too insecure and too poorly-paid to carry a tax burden on the other … we cannot continue to fund the high-quality public services we need and want. Corbyn says Labour must present an alternative vision of an economy that can work for all. I agree entirely with Len McCluskey, speaking at TUC Congress earlier this week, who said that we take the Leave vote as an opportunity to … “start the debate as to what sort of country we want Britain to be.” Corbyn says the Brexit vote was a vote to reject a failed economic model. This is the failure of an entire economic model to provide the chances and opportunities to a generation of our people. It is an economic model that has discarded good jobs and stripped whole communities of their pride. Promoted for decades this model argued that if taxes were slashed taxes for big business and the mega-rich … then everyone would benefit. But it has too often meant poverty pay, zero-hours contracts, and lives ruined by a shortage of affordable homes. Corbyn says the govenrment’s complexity over the Brexit negotiations is “extraordinary”. We will be pressing for full access to the European single market for goods and services as part of those negotiations. We should not be falling back on a World Trade Organisation-only trade deal with Europe as that would potentially risk damage to the public finances and significant job losses. But there are directives and obligations linked to the single market … such as state aid rules and requirements to liberalise and privatize public services … which we would not want to see as part of a post-Brexit relationship. What is essential is that the government brings forward its own agenda for those negotiations to parliament as soon as possible. Corbyn says government must produce a Brexit agenda “as soon as possible”. Corbyn criticises the government for wanting to bring back grammar schools. He says ministers are “retreating into a 1950s fantasy world that is totally out of touch with modern Britain”. Corbyn attacks the Tories for not being willing to invest. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has all but shut up shop … Philip Hammond is refusing to clarify the government’s own fiscal position … when assurances are needed in the wake of the leave vote. Even as it is becoming clear that monetary policy is reaching the limit of its capacity … the Chancellor is seemingly still content …. to stick to George Osborne’s plans for spending cuts. With capital costs for government the lowest in our history … it simply beggars belief that any responsible government … would actually be seeking to cut public investment. But that is what appears to be happening … For Philip Hammond to carry on cutting investment … is an act of unpardonable folly. Corbyn says Tory plan to press on with cuts is “an act of unpardonable folly”. Corbyn says there are other firms like Sports Direct. He is not just making a point about one firm, he says. The number of workers on zero hour contracts leapt by 20 percent in the last year. Real hourly pay has fallen 10% since the crash …. the worst performance of any developed country, bar Greece. He says the Conservatives have a “mean-spirited vision” of the future. They are building this sort of economy because it is “the path of least resistance”. Corbyn says the economy stands poised between two alternative futures. There are talented people in the country, he says. But we have an economy … and a set of institutions …. that has let people down badly. We can already see one future that’s being laid out in front of us. You can see it in microcosm in Shirebrook, in Derbyshire. This is a once proud mining community that was devastated by pit closures. Good, secure jobs were lost, when the colliery closed in 1993. For a decade, the town was left to stagnate …. And then, directly on the site of the old colliery …. SportsDirect opened its huge warehouse in the early 2000s. There were jobs on offer … but they were the worst of the worst … Zero hour contracts … and wages below even the abysmal legal minimum. Health and safety on site was cut to the bone … In just two years, ambulances were called to the site 76 times … One woman was forced to give birth in the toilets, she was so terrified of losing her job. These were conditions that would shame a Victorian mill-owner, right here in twenty-first century Britain. Corbyn says this is his 55th leadership event. All the policies he is proposing are for debate, he says. He says he has been amazed at the response he has received. Recently they asked people to contribute on social media. They soon got 12,000 responses, some of which were very detailed. Jeremy Corbyn starts by praising John McDonnell, his shadow chancellor. He says McDonnell has changed the parameters of the economic debate in this country. He looks forward to him being in Number 11. And he praises Rebecca Long-Bailey too. She took over as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the summer reshuffle and mastered her brief immediately, he says. There is a live feed of the Jeremy Corbyn speech here. The Labour MP Rebecca Long-Bailey is introducing him now. In his speech Jeremy Corbyn will also confirm that Labour is looking at the viability of a universal basic income. Here’s a preview story from Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot. In his speech, according to excerpts released in advance, Jeremy Corbyn will say that the vote to leave the EU was a vote for a new economic model. He will say: There are talented people across the whole country … The millions who want a decent job, or to set up in business… or use their skills for the wider social good. But we have an economy and a set of institutions that let them down badly ... The leave vote, for all those in left-behind Britain, was a decisive rejection of all of this failed economic model ... There is an alternative to the drift and decay of the Tories. An economy that works for all, across every part of our country. Jeremy Corbyn is giving his speech at the Bloomberg HQ in London. My colleague Peter Walker is there. The Labour MP Neil Coyle has accused Jeremy Corbyn of encouraging “trolls” to abuse MPs online. (See 10.56am.) Coyle was responding angrily to the inclusion of his name in a list of MPs who have supposedly abused Corbyn and his allies that was released to journalists by Corbyn’s team. Corbyn will shortly be giving a speech on the economy, and is expected to be asked about the row. Theresa May has given the £18bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power station the go-ahead with “significant new safeguards” to make sure Chinese involvement does not threaten national security. Culture secretary Karen Bradley justified the government’s decision to look for a new chair of the BBC as she moved to head off criticism that the corporation’s independence was under attack. As Jane Martinson reports, unveiling a draft charter set to govern the BBC for the next 11 years, Bradley confirmed that the corporation would appoint a majority of the new unitary board. The government is to directly appoint five of the 14-strong board, including a new chair and the four national directors for England, Wales, Scotland and northern Ireland. The Conservative MP Justin Tomlinson faces a two day suspension from the Commons and has had to apologise for leaking details of a report on consumer credit to the payday loans company Wonga. The Evening Standard has published some new polling figures from Ipsos MORI. The headline start-of-the-parties figures could be a lot worse for Labour. They give the Tories a six-point lead (Conservatives 40%, Labour 34%, Ukip 9% and Lib Dems 6%), which is bad for Jeremy Corbyn’s party, but a lot better than recent ICM poll findings. But Corbyn’s personal ratings are dire. This is from the Standard’s story. His ratings have sunk for being a “capable leader” and having “lots of personality”, while fewer than one in five think he would be “good in a crisis”, the Ipsos MORI research reveals. Fewer than a quarter of voters (24 per cent) think he is a capable leader, compared with 68 per cent who say the same of Theresa May. Damningly, more Labour supporters see the Tory leader as capable (58 per cent) compared with him (46 per cent) and fewer than half are satisfied with his performance. This chart sets out the figures in more detail. The good news for Corbyn is that he is seen as more patriotic than he was last year. The bad news is that, on the other nine of the 10 leadership criteria featured in the poll, Corbyn’s ratings have got worse since last year - in some cases (capable leader/lots of personality/clear vision for Britain) by quite a lot. Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly denied condoning the abuse of MPs online. When asked about this, he says that he does not indulge in personal abuse himself, that he does not approve of others abusing MPs and that action has been taken against members who have been found to have been engaged in this. In the Sky debate last night Corbyn was asked about the way his supporters had been booing his opponent, in last night’s debate and in others. Corbyn replied: I don’t do hate, I don’t do booing. When it was put to him that some of his supporters did, he went on: Well, I ask people to be kind. In some cases it takes longer than others. Owen Smith accused him of laughing it off. In the Commons Justin Tomlinson has just made an apology for leaking the public accounts committee report. (See 11.23am.) He sounded particularly contrite. This is from the Mirror’s Jack Blanchard. The Labour MP Ben Bradshaw has made a formal complaint to Jeremy Corbyn and others in the party about his inclusion in the list of MPs who have supposedly abused Corbyn and his allies, my colleague Rowena Mason reports. A Conservative MP, Justin Tomlinson, faces being suspended from the Commons for two days for leaking a draft select committee report about regulating payday lending to an employee of Wonga. In evidence to the parliamentary commission for standards, Kathryn Hudson, who investigated on behalf of the Commons privileges committee, Tomlinson said that he wanted input from Wonga because he wanted to strengthen the proposed regulations for consumer credit. Hudson accepted that this was Tomlinson’s intention and that he had an interest in this issue. But leaking draft select committee reports is seen as a serious offence in the Commons. The privileges committee report on Tomlinson says: We conclude that Mr Tomlinson committed a contempt in disclosing a draft committee report to a third party and that his actions constituted substantial interference in the work of that committee. The committee said that Tomlinson should be suspended from the Commons for two days and that he should make a statement to MPs apologising. Neil Coyle is another MP on the list of Jeremy Corbyn’s opponents released by Corbyn’s team yesterday. Corbyn’s team say the list was sent out inadvertently by a junior member of staff, but Corbyn defended it on the Sky debate last night, saying it was just a factual account of what some MPs have said in public. Coyle has been giving interviews this morning to Sky News and to the BBC. Here are the key points Coyle accused Corbyn of “defamation” and said he was “livid” about being singled out in this way. All I know is that the leader of my party has gone out of his way to issue a statement accusing my of abuse with no detail, no forewarning, no explanation of what I’m accused of. I won a seat back for Labour last year after 30 years. I should be out this morning with the CWU in my constituency campaigning to keep a post office. And instead I’m trying to work out what I’m accused of and how to defend myself from defamation by my own party leader. He accused Corbyn and his allies of effectively encouraging people to abuse MPs on line. Labour members should respond by voting for Owen Smith in the leadership contest, he said. He claimed that a third of members have yet to vote. The release of this list, and the victim culture it is trying to perpetuate, is an example of how nervous [Corbyn] is, and his team are, about the result. I think a third of members are yet to even vote in this. And Jeremy and his team know they have put a lot of people off through their incompetence over the last year who do not want to vote for them again this time around. For those members who have not voted yet, this is another demonstration of the kind of lack of leadership, the kind of division, that Jeremy and John McDonnell want to perpetuate if they win again. And look at the permissive culture they have created of abuse against Labour MPs, and especially women MPs. Jess Phillips has had months and months of abuse, a torrent of abuse, from Corbynistas and the like. And she has been put on this list again. That is a dereliction of duty. That is not leadership. That is Jeremy telling his trolls online to carry on. He is giving them a green light to continue their abuse. If Labour members don’t want that abuse to continue, they really need to choose Owen [Smith] while they’ve still got a chance in this leadership election. He said he would be talking to a lawyer about possible legal action. I’ve already asked for an explanation from Jeremy, I’ve already been in touch with the chief whip’s office, I have already been in touch with the party chair and the general secretary of the party. I do want an answer and I will be speaking to a lawyer tomorrow. He called for a written apology from Corbyn. That would help resolve the matter, he said. He strongly rejected the claim that he had been abusive towards Corbyn. He said the only thing he could think of that led to his being included on the list was the fact that he wrote a joint article for the Guardian after the May elections with Jo Cox, the Labour MP killed in the summer, saying Labour needed to do much better. If that is an attack on the leader, then he’s really in desperate times. Coyle also said that he did not engage in anonymous briefing. If he had something to say, he said it openly, he said. He claimed it was hypocritical of Corbyn to refuse to accept criticism given his own record as a backbencher. Jeremy was the most rebellious backbencher for 30 years and yet somehow - it’s utter hypocrisy really - does not like it when his own backbenchers disagree with him. Instead of challenges, instead of having a debate with us, he goes out and issues a silly little list like they did in January instead of having a debate and building that policy platform that we need to win. He particularly criticised the decision to include Ben Bradshaw on the list. Bradshaw was the only Labour MP in the south west, he said. Corbyn should be “working with Ben to work out why Ben has been so successful in Exeter, why Ben has been a good MP for that constituency” instead of putting him on the list, Coyle said. On Twitter, in response to a question about the threat she has received (see 9.40am), Jess Phillips says she is not even Jewish. Herman van Rompuy, the former president of the European council, gave an interview to the Today programme this morning. And it was not good news for those hoping the Brexit process will start soon. Van Rompuy said serious Brexit talks would not be able to start for another year, until after the German elections. The German elections are expected in September next year (the exact date has not been fixed) but normally it then takes a while for a coalition government to be established. Van Rompuy said: Before the German elections and before there is a new German government, no serious negotiations will take place. You can always start with more technical matters but the hard core - the difficult topics - will be tackled after the constitution of the new German government. That will be October-November. He said that insisting that the UK must allow free movement if it wants to remain part of the single market would be a “red line”. Of course we want an agreement that represents some sort of mutual benefit. There are huge economic interests but there are also red lines. It is very well known that freedom of movement is one of those red lines. “It is very difficult for the European Union to do something else vis a vis Britain compared to what we agreed upon with Norway and Switzerland. The big question is, even if there is some room for manoeuvre, is this sufficient for the British negotiators? It needs two to tango. He said EU leaders would not want a deal that might encourage other member states to leave. There is not a feeling that we have to punish, but on the other hand most leaders don’t want to encourage other exits. Britain had not many friends any more. I saw this clearly when I was in office when we had to vote on candidacy of Jean-Claude Juncker for the presidency of the commission. Britain was isolated. He said Brexit amounted to “a political amputation of the first degree”. We consider the Brexit a political amputation of the first degree. That image of a strong Europe, that is tarnished a lot after Brexit. Yesterday the Labour MP Jess Phillips was named on a list of MPs who have been abusive towards Jeremy Corbyn or his allies released by the Corbyn camp. It highlighted the fact that she once told Diane Abbott, a leading Corbyn supporter, to “fuck off”. Today Phillips says she has received a threat as a result of her name being on the list. But Greenpeace has criticised the decision. This is from John Sauven, its executive director. This decision is unlikely to be the grand finale to this summer’s political soap opera. There are still huge outstanding financial, legal and technical obstacles that can’t be brushed under the carpet. There might be months or even years of wrangling over these issues. That’s why the government should start supporting renewable power that can come online quickly for a competitive price. Today’s decision hasn’t been made on the cold, hard facts that show Hinkley will not deliver competitively priced, low carbon energy any time soon. Instead it seems that Hinkley became too big to fail. The potential for political embarrassment for the new prime minister was too high. The new arrangement for a government special share changes almost nothing on the Hinkley deal and time will tell what it means for Bradwell in Essex, which is due to use Chinese technology. Unions and business groups continue to welcome the Hinkley Point announcement. UCATT, the construction union, says the construction industry “desperately needed the confirmation of such a major project following a slowdown in the industry caused by the Brexit vote.” The Institution of Civil Engineers says the decision is “a major step forward for the future of UK energy security”. And the British Chambers of Commerce says it hopes Hinkley Point C will usher in “a new era of sustained investment in energy generation and transmission”. The announcement has also been welcomed by the TUC and the CBI. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: We are pleased ministers have ended the uncertainty over Hinkley Point. This project will create thousands of quality jobs and apprenticeships and bring much-needed investment to the South West. But the government must not stop here. It is time to get the shovels out for a third runway at Heathrow, high-speed rail and new affordable homes. And Josh Hardie, the CBI’s deputy director general, said: The final green light for Hinkley Point is good news for the UK’s energy future as well as supporting jobs and growth across the South West and the country. New nuclear energy will play an important role in supporting a diverse, low-carbon and secure energy supply, so it’s now time to push on with this key project. The EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, has welcomed the announcement. “With Hinkley C being such a major part of the government’s energy strategy it is a relief to finally see the project given the green light after months of delays and uncertainty,” it said. Unite has welcomed the announcement, saying 25,000 jobs will be created by the Hinkley Point C project. This is from Unite’s national officer for energy, Kevin Coyne. Our members are shovel ready and dead keen to start work on the country’s first nuclear power station for a generation. It is excellent news that that the uncertainty caused by Theresa May’s decision to put Hinkley Point ‘on hold’ has now been dispelled and that the Government recognises the role of nuclear in a mixed energy economy. It means that the lights will remain on in the UK in the decades ahead and it heralds an economic renaissance for the West Country, with the accompanying creation of thousands of skilled jobs and the positive ripple effects to the supply chain across the UK. Finally we’ve got the confirmation that the government is giving the Hinkley Point C power station the go-ahead. Theresa May halted it in July, just before contracts were due to be signed because she wanted to review it, but this morning the government has announced that it will go ahead - but with new rules governing future foreign investment in British nuclear power stations. This is crucial because in some respects the the concerns about Hinkley are not really about Hinkley at all, but about Bradwell. China is a minority investor in Hinkley Point, but it is investing as part of a deal that will also see it play a minority role in building a new nuclear power station at Sizewell, in Suffolk, and that will also see it take the lead in building a new nuclear plant at Bradwell, in Essex. For the Chinese Bradwell is the real prize because they believe that establishing successful Chinese-designed nuclear power station in the UK will lead to them breaking into many other markets in the West. May was concerned about giving control of a nuclear power station to a potentially hostile foreign power. Quite what the the “new legal framework for future foreign investment in Britain’s critical infrastructure” that the government is announcing this morning will mean in practice remains to be seen. Here is the Guardian’s story. Here is the full text of the government’s announcement. And here is a statement from Greg Clark, the business and energy secretary. Having thoroughly reviewed the proposal for Hinkley Point C, we will introduce a series of measures to enhance security and will ensure Hinkley cannot change hands without the government’s agreement. Consequently, we have decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation. Britain needs to upgrade its supplies of energy and we have always been clear that nuclear is an important part of ensuring our future low-carbon energy security. I will post reaction as it comes in. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.30am: The OECD publishes its Education at a Glance 2016 report on the state of education around the world. Morning: Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, makes a statement in the Commons on the new BBC charter. 12.30pm: Guto Bebb, the Wales minister, gives a speech on the UK government’s work with the Welsh government. 1pm: Jeremy Corbyn gives a speech at Bloomberg on the economy. As usual, I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/nov/16/paris-climate-deal-at-risk-unless-countries-step-up-plans-says-watchdog","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-16T08:00:13Z","webTitle":"Paris climate deal at risk unless countries step up plans, says watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/16/paris-climate-deal-at-risk-unless-countries-step-up-plans-says-watchdog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/nov/16/paris-climate-deal-at-risk-unless-countries-step-up-plans-says-watchdog","fields":{"headline":"Paris climate deal at risk unless countries step up plans, says watchdog","bodyText":"The Paris agreement on climate change risks failure unless countries come forward with more ambitious and detailed plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the world’s energy watchdog has warned. The agreement, reached almost a year ago, is only a “framework”, said the International Energy Agency on Wednesday, and requires sweeping policy changes among governments around the world to put its aims into force. “Government policies will determine where we go from here,” said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the agency. Current national pledges on greenhouse gas emissions, though “an achievement”, are inadequate and most governments have yet to indicate what further reductions they could make. Governments are meeting this week in Marrakech to flesh out some of the legal and technical details of the Paris accord. But their talks have been overshadowed by the election of Donald Trump as US president because he has vowed repeatedly to cancel the agreement, or at least the US’s participation in it. This risks returning the world to the stalemate that characterised the decade of climate talks from the 1997 Kyoto protocol to the 2008 accession of Barack Obama, during which the US barely took part in the negotiations or, in some cases, actively obstructed them. Birol urged caution: “Governments come and go around the world. This is a perfectly normal thing, and energy policies change with changes in administration. We may well see a change in US policy and, given the size of the US economy, these changes may have global implications. If there are such changes, we will include them in our analysis. But for now, it would be premature to speculate on what these policies might be.” Under the Paris agreement, which came into force this month, nations have pledged to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an “aspiration” not to exceed 1.5C. However, the accompanying national pledges made by each government on curbs to their emissions are not legally binding. Although those national pledges are likely to be met, according to the IEA’s World Energy Outlook, widely regarded as the gold standard on energy research, this will only slow down the projected rise in carbon emissions from energy from an annual average of about 650m tonnes a year since 2000 to about 150m tonnes in 2040. While a significant change, that would still leave the world exceeding the 2C goal by about 0.7C by the end of the century. Policies to bring the world on to a 2C trajectory must be implemented as a matter of urgency if the Paris pledge is to be fulfilled, the IEA said, as emissions must peak in the next few years to avoid adding too much to the stock of carbon in the atmosphere. Once carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere, it tends to stay there for at least a century, unless absorbed by the planet’s “carbon sinks”, such as forests and oceans. However, our emissions have long outstripped the ability of the world’s carbon sinks to absorb them. It is the carbon in the atmosphere that determines what happens to climate change, and as yet there is no viable technology – and no realistic prospect of it – to suck carbon from the air. These physical realities make early action on reducing emissions vital, because actions taken later will be less effective. The IEA highlighted the growing role of renewable energy, predicting that nearly 60% of all new power generation capacity by 2040 would be from renewable sources. The pace of growth has outstripped previous forecasts, as costs have come down faster than expected and governments have shifted policies. China’s reliance on coal – it is the largest consumer and producer – peaked in 2013, according to the data, and its falling coal consumption and increasing renewable generation capacity will “transform the global outlook”. Even as more of global generation comes from renewable sources, demand will rise by about 30% by 2040, according to the projections, with all of the increase coming from developing countries. But even as they develop, hundreds of millions of their populations will be left behind. More than half a billion people are forecast to still be without electricity in 2040. While this is less than half of current levels, it represents a failure to meet global pledges to rescue the poorest from their lack of access to modern energy, which results in millions of deaths from indoor air pollution as they use other sources of fuel, and limits development and education. Separately, in the UK, ministers were warned that without urgent action during the current parliament, the UK would fail to meet its emissions targets, and investor confidence in the energy sector would plunge. The UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) urged the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to include commitments on reforming energy policy in his autumn statement next week. In a review of the UK’s energy policy, published on Wednesday, leading academics called for a clearer focus on energy in the government’s forthcoming industrial strategy, as well as new strategies on heat and energy efficiency, progress on which has been stalled by the scrapping of the “green deal” on home improvements. They also called for “a new approach” to carbon capture and storage, in response to a recent report by Lord Oxburgh, which criticised the abandonment of taxpayer support for the fledgling technology. Jim Watson, UKERC’s director, said: “There are problems with the government’s approach [to energy]. The cheaper options for renewable energy [in the form of onshore wind and solar, support for which has been slashed] have been taken off the agenda. And Hinkley Point [nuclear power station] is likely to be very expensive.” He also pointed to energy efficiency as a problem area, as “retrofitting buildings has really slowed down because of the policy environment”. The UK could still meet its carbon targets, he concluded, but it would require action now, because current policies were inadequate and the progress on emissions reductions made in the past few years had been the result of policy decisions taken well over a decade ago."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/oct/11/uk-loses-top-10-spot-in-global-energy-ranking-for-the-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-11T11:07:50Z","webTitle":"UK loses top 10 spot in global energy ranking for the first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/11/uk-loses-top-10-spot-in-global-energy-ranking-for-the-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/oct/11/uk-loses-top-10-spot-in-global-energy-ranking-for-the-first-time","fields":{"headline":"UK loses top 10 spot in global energy ranking for the first time","bodyText":"The UK has fallen out of the top 10 of a respected international league table of countries’ energy sectors for the first time. The World Energy Council blamed the government’s lack of clarity and myriad changes which it said have left the country facing a potential gap in energy supply. The UK has previously been one of the top performers in the council’s “Trillema Index”, which has ranked countries on energy security, costs and decarbonisation efforts for the last six years. But the Brexit vote, cuts to renewable energy subsidies and planned changes on foreign ownership have created investment uncertainty and significant challenges for the UK, according to the latest edition of the index for the London-headquartered agency, whose members include energy companies across the world. The UK was also added to a watchlist of countries where negative changes are expected imminently, alongside the US, Germany and Japan. Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland took the top three positive slots in the ranking, with the UK now 11th. Despite the recent decision to go ahead with new nuclear reactors at Hinkley in Somerset, the UK had a “distinct lack of policy direction”, the council’s chief said. “Challenges in terms of improving affordability, and delivering security of supply as North Sea assets deplete, coupled with the rundown of worn-out legacy infrastructure, including coal-fired generation, has left the UK with a potential energy gap,” said Joan MacNaughton, executive chair of the council. “Renewables are increasing as a percentage of the UK energy mix but their output is not yet at a level where energy security can be guaranteed.” She added that ministers had not helped by making “myriad different changes” since 2013. It was not clear if Theresa May’s new government would back the “dash for gas” approach pushed by the former chancellor George Osborne under the last administration, said MacNaughton, adding that no alternative to gas had been made clear either. Gas has come to supply around half of the UK’s electricity generation this year, up from around a third in 2015, as several major coal plants shut. The result of the EU referendum vote in July has also cast a cloud over the government’s pledge last year to phase out coal power by 2025, as leaving the single market as part of a hard Brexit “could significantly increase the cost of its energy imports”. Imports via interconnectors to the continent accounted for around 6% of the UK’s electricity supply last year. Planned changes to rules on foreign ownership of energy infrastructure, announced during May’s review of Hinkley Point C contract, added to the investment uncertainty, the report said. The council also highlighted government cuts to onshore wind and solar subsidies since it took power, which Office for National Statistics figures showed last week had led solar power installations to crash. The changes could hinder investments in those sectors, the council said. The longer term future of support for low-carbon energy was unclear too, said MacNaughton. “The market knows some of what to expect until 2020 but after this point there are no answers to how the country will finance the low-carbon transition.” Dr Colin Brown, director of engineering at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, said: “This report confirms that the UK government’s lack of clear energy policy is threatening the country’s future energy security.” He added: “The recent approval of the Hinkley Point C nuclear, while promising, is only part of the solution to the UK securing its low carbon energy requirements for the future.” Former Green party leader, Natalie Bennett, tweeted that the report showed the UK was a case study in “how not to run an energy policy.” A spokesman for the government said: “Keeping the lights on is non-negotiable and an absolute priority. We do not leave this up to chance, and the measures we have put in place through the capacity market, mean that homes and businesses will continue to have the supplies they need as we build an energy infrastructure fit for the 21st century. “The UK is a global leader in attracting investment and we are already seeing the fruits from this in our energy infrastructure with more offshore wind, solar energy and nuclear capacity being developed across the country. We will continue to work with industry and other key stakeholders to ensure that our future energy supplies remain clean, secure and affordable.” In a speech on Monday, the energy minister Baroness Neville-Rolfe, said that new nuclear would have a key role to play for the UK in ensuring security of supply, affordability and decarbonising the sector. “What might this look like in practice [meeting those criteria]? Where better to start than with Hinkley and nuclear new-build. Britain has a 60-year history as a global leader in nuclear power. Yet after the completion of the last new nuclear plant, Sizewell B in 1995, which I remember seeing while it was under construction, the nuclear industry was regrettably left to atrophy,” she told a summit in London. Offshore windfarms could also play a role if the industry drives down costs, and the safe extraction of shale gas could help on affordability and supply, she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/sep/07/fracking-corbyn-pledges-to-ban-as-part-of-labours-new-green-agenda","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-07T16:00:53Z","webTitle":"Corbyn pledges to ban fracking as part of Labour's new green agenda","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/07/fracking-corbyn-pledges-to-ban-as-part-of-labours-new-green-agenda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/sep/07/fracking-corbyn-pledges-to-ban-as-part-of-labours-new-green-agenda","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn pledges to ban fracking as part of Labour's new green agenda","bodyText":"A Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn would ban fracking, ditch all coal-fired power stations and massively increase renewable energy, his leadership campaign has announced. In the clearest signal yet that the party intends to embrace an ambitious environmental agenda and break its traditional strong links to mining and fossil fuel extraction, he pledged to phase out all coal power stations by the “early 2020s” and invest heavily in energy-saving to avoid building many new power stations. But rival leadership candidate Owen Smith said the plan was unambitious and accused the Labour leader of backtracking. Corbyn’s environment and energy manifesto, launched on Wednesday in Nottingham, a former centre of the mining industry and a potential future site of fracking, states that the controversial technique for extracting shale gas “is not compatible with climate change prevention”. He said in Nottingham: “Research shows that as much as 80% of known fossil fuel reserves must remain unburned if the world is to keep global temperature rises to 2C [above pre-industrial levels]”. “When Labour gets back into power, Britain will lead the world in action on climate change. We will act to protect the future of our planet, with social justice at the heart of our environment policies, and take our fair share of action to meet the Paris climate agreement – starting by getting on track with our climate change act goals. “We want Britain to be the world’s leading producer of renewables technology. To achieve this we will accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy, and drive the expansion of the green industries and jobs of the future.” The manifesto includes a commitment to create over 300,000 renewable energy jobs and to set a target of 65% of UK electricity from renewable sources by 2030. In addition, Labour would invest heavily in energy saving, making building insulation a national infrastructure priority. “We will launch a publicly funded National Home Insulation programme that would see at least 4m homes insulated. This would create tens of thousands of jobs across every community, reducing the need for expensive new energy generation, and helping millions of people to save money on their bills,” Corbyn said. But Smith, who is challenging Corbyn, was critical of the manifesto. “It’s impossible for Jeremy Corbyn to speak with credibility on environmental policy. He’s called for the reintroduction of deeply damaging opencast coal mining, only had one meeting with his shadow environment team in nine months as leader, and didn’t utter a word of protest when Theresa May scrapped the Department for Energy and Climate Change,” said a spokesperson for Smith. “Corbyn does not even mention Hinkley point and nuclear power, despite the fact that nuclear stations currently provide almost a quarter of UK electricity and there are contentious plans for new nuclear stations.” Friends of the Earth welcomed his commitment to ban fracking. Liz Hutchins, senior political strategist, said: “He is right to commit to ban fracking and Smith should make the same clear commitment. The Liberal Democrats and the Green party have called for a ban because of threats to health and the environment. It is now banned or halted in Scotland, Wales, France, Germany and New York state.” Corbyn responded to growing calls for government to commit to matching all existing EU environmental directives if Britain leaves the EU. He said he would safeguard all existing protection laws including the birds and habitats directives, and air pollution standards, and added that he would refuse to agree to any Brexit deal that reduced nature protection of nature. Environmental lawyers ClientEarth welcomed this but called on the Labour leader to go further. The group’s CEO, James Thornton, said: “We need to keep the EU protections we have now. They have served our country well. Once they are secure, we can start strengthening protections for wildlife and the environment. “But if Corbyn is fully signed up to protecting the environment and tackling the UK’s air pollution crisis then we also would urge him to back our calls for a new Clean Air Act. Other initiatives pledged include reinstating the energy and climate change department, which was abolished in July, and supporting a proposal to mobilise schools and communities to help plant 64 million trees in 10 years to help to tackle the UK’s air pollution crisis. In addition to promoting the growth of over 200 “local energy companies” and making public, not-for-profit companies and co-ops the centrepiece of a new energy economics, the Labour manifesto intends to support the development of 1,000 community energy co-operatives, with rights to sell energy directly to the localities they serve."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/oct/11/energy-first-as-uk-successfully-transmits-data-via-national-electricity-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-11T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"An energy first as UK successfully transmits data via national electricity grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/11/energy-first-as-uk-successfully-transmits-data-via-national-electricity-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/oct/11/energy-first-as-uk-successfully-transmits-data-via-national-electricity-grid","fields":{"headline":"An energy first as UK successfully transmits data via national electricity grid","bodyText":"Data has been transmitted across a national electricity grid for the first time, in what could be a significant step towards the creation of virtual power stations, where many thousands of homes and businesses combine to manage electricity use more smartly. The new technology could lead to lower energy bills for consumers who allow small variations in the energy consumption of their appliances, such as water heaters or freezers. The flexibility provided by thousands of appliances combined could reduce peaks in energy use and remove the need for some large new gas or nuclear power stations or polluting diesel generator farms that are started up in times of short supply. The new data system, created using telecoms technology by Reactive Technologies (RT) and now successfully tested on the UK’s National Grid, could also allow the optimum use of intermittent renewable energy, an important feature given the fast-rising proportion of green energy on the grid. Unlike the smart meters being rolled out by the UK government, the new system is anonymous, with no data on household energy use being collected and therefore avoiding concerns about privacy. The system uses new technology to send messages through national electricity cables to any appliances with a smart plug connected to the mains, asking it to adjust its energy use. In the home, this could mean allowing the temperature of a freezer to increase by 0.5C to cut demand or turning up a water heater at 1am to utilise spare renewable energy. In the commercial sector, where the technology will be first rolled out, it could mean water company pumps are used at specific times or an office air-conditioning system is adjusted. The development is part of a wholesale change taking place in the energy industry, in which large, centralised fossil-fuel power stations are being replaced by decentralised renewable energy and smart grids. The government’s own National Infrastructure Commission (NIC), the National Grid and industry group Energy UK have all said an energy “revolution” is taking place, delivering a low-carbon system that is more secure, cheaper and faster to build. The NIC recently estimated that UK consumers could save £8bn a year by 2030 by adopting smart power technology, while also helping the nation meet its climate change targets. Numerous companies are working on smart grid concepts. “The old mindset would be, we need to build more power stations,” said Jens Madrian, at RT and former CFO at “big six” utility RWE npower. “We disagree with that. There are other ways of managing electricity, one of which is carrying knowledge from the telecommunications and software engineering side into the energy sector.” Marc Borrett, RT’s CEO said: “What is better? Building a Hinkley, which if it goes down you have lost 7% of the national electricity generation, or building up capacity from many hundreds of thousands of smaller devices around the UK? It needs quite a cultural shift: smaller is better, distributed is better.” Cordi O’Hara, at National Grid, said: “We are keen to support innovative products like this one that can bring a real benefit for customers. It represents another step forward in the development of the smart grid technologies that are going to play an increasingly important role in the energy systems of the future.” A spokesman for big six energy company SSE, which was also involved in the trial, said: “Innovation milestones, such as this, will help keep the lights on and offer significant cost savings.” Electricity wires have previously been used to transmit information within homes and local networks, such as rows of street lights, by sending very high frequency data alongside the standard 50Hz signal. But sending messages across the country means going through sub-station transformers, which contain an air gap that cannot pass on the high-frequency data. Instead, using technology developed by former Nokia engineers in Finland, the RT system inserts the data as small changes in the 50Hz signal itself, which does jump the air gap. When electricity demand needs to be ramped up or down, the system broadcasts a message through the grid which is received by the connected appliances. One advantage of the system over the internet and mobile phone networks is that the grid already reaches all electrical devices, even those in remote locations. To test the new technology, RT set up a handful of electrical devices - truck-sized resistors - across the UK to generate the messages and then installed 20 listening receivers in other places, connected only via the National Grid.

Here are the key points of the Brexit white paper, which essentially builds and expands on May’s Lancaster House speech last month. It amounts to a list of objectives, many of which will not necessarily be easy to achieve. Sovereignty, great repeal bill and control of UK laws The paper says the British parliament has been sovereign throughout the UK’s EU membership, “but it has not always felt like that” – a striking comment. It says the government will bring forward a separate white paper on the great repeal bill, which was first announced by May in her Conservative party conference speech last year to remove the European Communities Act of 1972 from the UK statute book and convert the body of existing EU law into domestic law. The paper confirms that “wherever practical and appropriate” the same rules and laws will apply in the UK on the day after it leaves the EU as did before. It also confirms that the government intends to “take control of our own laws”, which will mean “bringing to an end the jurisdiction of the European court of justice in the UK” and establishing a new mechanism for resolving future disputes between the UK and the EU. The union and Ireland The paper says the government will “work with the devolved administrations on an approach to returning powers from the EU that works for the whole of the UK and reflects the interests of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales” but does not go into specifics. It also promises that no decisions currently taken by the devolved administrations will be taken away from them, and indeed that more decisions will be devolved (it does not say which). And it says it will pay particular attention to the Isle of Man, Channel Islands and Gibraltar, all of which have unique relationships with the EU. On the island of Ireland and the common travel area with the UK, the paper notes the UK and Irish economies are “deeply integrated” and says the government will work to “develop and strengthen” those ties after Brexit. It says it aims to retain “as seamless and frictionless a border as possible” between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and wants Irish and UK citizens to be able to continue to move freely north-south and east-west, “while protecting the integrity of the UK’s immigration system”. Again, it does not say how. Immigration and reciprocal citizens’ rights On the rights of EU nationals living in the UK and vice versa, the white paper goes no further than May’s speech. It says securing their status is “one of this government’s early priorities for the forthcoming negotiations” and reiterates that “the UK remains ready to give people the certainty they want … at the earliest opportunity”. (The EU-27 have always seen this as part of article 50 negotiations). It says it is consulting with expatriate groups abroad and EU businesses and other groups “to ensure we understand their priorities”, and “recognises the priority placed on easy access to healthcare by UK nationals living in the EU” – a key concern of many, particularly pensioners. On controlling immigration, the paper offers no clarity. It says the government is “considering very carefully” the options open to it and working to “understand the impacts on the different sectors of the economy and the labour market”. Businesses and communities will be able to contribute their views, it says, and suggests – for the first time with regard to immigration – that “there may be a phased process of implementation”, to give companies and individuals time to plan and prepare. It says EU students can continue to come and study, in the short term at least, but says nothing about future access for EU workers. It also says workers’ rights under EU law will be preserved after Brexit. EU trade, single market, customs union and budget The white paper reiterates that the government aims to secure “the freest and most frictionless trade possible in goods and services” with the EU outside the single market and via “an ambitious and comprehensive free trade agreement”. It also wants to be outside the customs union, so it can negotiate its own trade deals, but would like “a new customs agreement”, which should be theoretically possible thanks to new technology. Again, this does not go further than May’s speech. We are told once more that the UK will not seek to adopt an existing model used by other countries, but try to “take in elements” of the single market in certain areas – in other words, bespoke deals for important business sectors. From the EU perspective, all this is ambitious: it sounds suspiciously like cherry-picking. The paper plays up the financial services card, which the government plainly considers a strong one: the EU has a clear interest in “mutual cooperation arrangements”, it says, describing the City as Europe’s only global hub for money, trading and investment on which the EU will continue to rely. It confirms the UK will leave the Euratom treaty, the legal framework for nuclear power, but says a new relationship will be negotiated, and it says the UK’s future status with EU agencies regulating areas such as medicines, aviation, food safety and financial services will also be part of discussions. And there will be no more “vast contributions” to the EU budget, as May already said. Trade with other countries; research The paper repeats May’s pledge to make the UK a “champion of free trade” and says it will seek bilateral free trade agreements and participate in multilateral negotiations through the World Trade Organisation. It acknowledges Britain “cannot agree new trade deals until after we have left the EU” – a possible bone of contention with the EU27 – but says there is “much we can do to prepare and to achieve now while respecting our obligations as members”. It also says work is already under way on establishing Britain’s own schedules covering trade in goods and services at the WTO, aimed as far as possible at replicating those it currently has as an EU member. The paper also says Britain aims to “continue to collaborate with EU partners” on a key part of its new industrial strategy: science, research and technology. Many academics expect this to become considerably more difficult after Brexit. Security and crime cooperation As May has already said, the UK will seek to continue working with the EU “to preserve UK and European security and to fight terrorism and uphold justice across Europe”, the paper says. It says the government will aim to retain and develop existing cooperation in initiatives like Europol, the European arrest warrant, the Schengen information system, the new EU passenger name records, and the European criminal records information system. In terms of security and defence, it also promises to “remain committed to European security and add value to EU foreign and security policy” – an offer that may well prove valuable in the exit negotiations. Orderly exit The white paper says the government aims to deliver “a smooth, mutually beneficial exit” but says this will require “a coherent and coordinated approach on both sides”. Article 50 will be triggered no later than the end of March, it repeats. It acknowledges it is “in no one’s interests for there to be a cliff-edge for business or a threat to stability”, saying the government would like “to have reached an agreement about our future partnership” by the end of the article 50 process and repeating May’s suggestion of variable “phased processes of implementation” to give everyone time to plan and prepare for the new arrangements. The paper also reiterates the prime minister’s remarks that “no deal for the UK is better than a bad deal for the UK” – and suggests that, to mitigate against the impact of not getting the deal it wants from the EU, the government will prepare legislation “to ensure our economic and other functions van continue”. It does not say what the legislation will contain, or what future economic model the government might envisage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2016/nov/13/save-brutalist-buildings-warns-simon-thurley","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-13T00:05:03Z","webTitle":"Save our brutalist masterpieces, says top heritage expert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/13/save-brutalist-buildings-warns-simon-thurley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/13/save-brutalist-buildings-warns-simon-thurley","fields":{"headline":"Save our brutalist masterpieces, says top heritage expert","bodyText":"A former head of English Heritage has warned that the country’s modernist legacy is being betrayed by a wrong-headed approach to 20th-century architecture. Simon Thurley, who stepped down as chief executive in May 2015 after a 13-year stint, says landmark buildings are uniquely vulnerable to demolition, in part because modernist architecture tends to be unpopular with the public and politicians. The problem is compounded by an unimaginative approach by conservationists. “At the moment, there’s a ‘one-size-fits-all’ philosophy of conservation,” Thurley told the Observer, “which is based on [keeping] the original fabric. For 20th-century buildings, the whole listed-building system, the legislation and everything based around keeping the fabric, is not relevant. “These buildings are about ideas and other things. For the 20th century, you’ve got to have a different system. People don’t like 20th-century buildings. Politicians also think that, once a building’s listed, you can’t do anything about it. There’s a huge disincentive among the political classes to save them.” The loss of some of the most innovative buildings of the postwar period would create a black hole in architectural history, he added. “The danger is that everything will be just got rid of and the next generation will have absolutely no idea about that extraordinary period of incredible optimism and determination to use architecture to transform society. We’ve got the whole thing muddled up … Everybody gets furious about it, but it’s not being handled properly. Saving the late 20th century is the most controversial and difficult area of modern conservation practice and debate.” Modernist architecture, with its brutalist concrete forms and experimental designs, has inspired extremes of emotion. For example, Sir Denys Lasdun’s concrete National Theatre, on the South Bank in London, has been applauded as an icon of postwar architecture and mocked for resembling a nuclear power station. When such buildings are listed or receive public money for conservation, there is a storm of protest from those who see them as “ghastly”, Thurley said. The solution, he argues, lies in radical revamps to improve them for contemporary use: “You need to justify greater intervention than you might in other types of historic building.” Speaking after delivering the first of a series of public lectures on the theme at Gresham College, London, he said: “Having left English Heritage, I decided that I could politely say all the things I was bursting to say for 10 years about what’s wrong with the system.” Under the current system, changes to listed buildings are dependent on local conservation officers and Historic England (formerly English Heritage). “If their attitude is that historic fabric must be saved at all cost, you’re not going to get that permission. They’ve got to adopt a new attitude, which is to protect the overall idea and significance.” He cited the case of the Commonwealth Institute, the formerly derelict 1960s building in London, as an example of how listed modernist architecture can be improved: “When that building was being sold by the Commonwealth Institute, the trustees tried to get an act of parliament to have it delisted … It was all because the conservationists had been far too precious about what to do with these buildings. In 2007 it was sold to a development consortium who knew what they were doing.” This month the building reopens as the new Design Museum. Thurley said: “Here’s an example of a very contentious case, which has come to a successful conclusion. If they make drastic interventions in 20th-century buildings, it gives them new life. I bet you, when people go into it, they will love it.” He added: “You have got to put different standards on these 20th-century buildings. You cannot treat them like 18th-century houses. If you are too precious with them, you can actually prevent them from getting new uses. Some people say that the Design Museum conversion has destroyed this wonderful building and should never have been allowed. If it hadn’t been allowed, we wouldn’t still have the building.” By contrast, Thurley criticised the demolition of the Grade II-listed Southside Halls of Residence, built in the 1960s for Imperial College London and admired for its fusion of “Oxbridge planning with great slab blocks of reinforced concrete”. He said the decision by English Heritage to support demolition when the building could have been repaired for a total of £40m, was extraordinary. “This is a problem faced by hundreds of highly graded buildings each year – the fact that the repair costs are greater than the eventual value of a building. “But what about a Grade I-listed medieval church in the middle of nowhere? It has a £1m repair bill. Even if permission could be granted for its conversion to a house, it would only be worth £100,000 at most. So do we say, ‘Well, let’s demolish it’? No, of course we don’t.” A similar fate is in prospect for Robin Hood Gardens, a public housing scheme in Poplar, east London, with large blocks arranged with deck access. The estate has been described as the embodiment of British brutalism but, in 2008, a listing application was rejected because there were other listed schemes of higher quality. “The building still stands but, with its certificate of immunity from listing, will soon be demolished,” Thurley said. He acknowledged that “many of the most interesting and innovative” buildings have suffered because they were built quickly and cheaply, and some pushed technical capabilities of materials to their limits, such as the cladding on the Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King in Liverpool. Commenting on the perceived ugliness of so many 20th-century buildings, he recalled becoming director of the Museum of London in the 1990s and dismissing its then 1970s home as “a white-tiled lavatory built on a roundabout”. Over time, he said, he began to appreciate it. “The problem is that [modernist architecture] does take greater understanding – almost philosophical understanding – to get it than historic architecture, which immediately appeals to the aesthetic eye.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2016/jul/22/pokemon-go-launches-in-japan-amid-safety-warnings","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-22T04:02:52Z","webTitle":"Pokémon Go launches in Japan amid safety warnings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/22/pokemon-go-launches-in-japan-amid-safety-warnings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2016/jul/22/pokemon-go-launches-in-japan-amid-safety-warnings","fields":{"headline":"Pokémon Go launches in Japan amid safety warnings","bodyText":"Pikachu has finally come home. After one abruptly cancelled launch, concerns about server capacity and government warnings about security, Pokémon Go was launched in Japan on Friday. The hit augmented reality game’s release in Japan – long after It appeared in dozens of other countries – sparked a flood of celebratory messages on social media. One Twitter user noted that players had already started congregating in front of one of the stages at the Fuji Rock Festival. “PokemonGO releeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaased,” tweeted @skri0709 minutes after it hit Google Play. Another user simply said: “Finally.” Niantic, the US firm that developed the app along with Japanese video game maker Nintendo and the Pokémon Company, confirmed that the long wait in Japan was over. “We are truly happy that we have been able to bring this to Japan, where Pokémon was born,” Niantic said on its blog. One of the Japanese creators of the game apologised for the delay. “To everyone in Japan: I am sorry to make you wait for so long,” said Jyunichi Masuda, the head of development at Game Freak, the developer of the original Pokemon game. “Pokémon Go can now be played in Japan.” Friday’s launch comes more than two weeks after the mobile app was released in Australia, New Zealand and the US, before hooking gamers in more than 20 other countries. It is now available on more than 40 countries. The app is expected to repeat its success in Japan, although some have questioned the practicality of hunting for hundreds of virtual pocket monsters in crowded urban centres such as Tokyo. Reports of Pokémon Go-fuelled crimes, accidents and mishaps overseas prompted Japan’s government to launch a public awareness campaign on Thursday, a day after the game’s scheduled release was delayed following leaked reports of a commercial tie-up between Nintendo and its two co-developers, and McDonald’s Japan. The fast-food chain’s involvement is expected to add to the revenues the app is already accruing from in-app purchases. Reports said 400 McDonalds outlets in Japan had been designated as Pokémon Go “gyms”, where players can battle on their smartphones. While the launch will be greeted with relief by Nintendo, whose share price more than doubled to 4.5 trillion yen (£32bn) in the days after its debut. But Japan’s National Centre for Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity urged gamers not to play while walking or riding a bicycle, and to ensure that their hunt for monsters does end with them being arrested for trespassing. The centre issued nine safety tips that also cautioned gamers over the risk of heat stroke during Japan’s hot and humid summer months. Niantic’s chief executive, John Hanke, said: “When you go out to play, keep your head up, look around, enjoy the world around you and be safe,” . Even the government’s top spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, was moved to comment on the public safety implications of millions of people fixated on their smartphone screens. “Looking at what’s happened overseas, people need to use their smartphones safely,” Suga told reporters, according to Kyodo News, adding that the government was “pleased that content from our country has become well-known overseas”. In the US, where Pokémon Go saw 10m downloads in just a few days after its release, some players have walked into obstacles and injuring themselves. In Ohio, three teenagers reportedly stumbled on to the premises of a nuclear power plant, while in California two men fell off of cliff while hunting for characters. Japanese railway companies implored passengers not to use the app while waiting for trains at busy stations. “We’ve been repeatedly asking them not to use smartphones while walking on platforms,” said Tatsuo Kijima, president of West Japan Railway."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2014/jun/17/china-stake-british-nuclear-power-li-keqiang-hinkley-beijing","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-06-17T19:52:51Z","webTitle":"China wins stake in British nuclear power and high-speed rail","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/17/china-stake-british-nuclear-power-li-keqiang-hinkley-beijing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/jun/17/china-stake-british-nuclear-power-li-keqiang-hinkley-beijing","fields":{"headline":"China wins stake in British nuclear power and high-speed rail","bodyText":"China has been given the chance to take a decisive stake in the next stage of Britain's energy and transport infrastructure as Chinese companies won the right to own and operate a nuclear power station and to help build high-speed rail lines. The agreements were among trade deals worth £14bn agreed with Beijing during the visit of the Chinese premier Li Keqiang, which prompted David Cameron to declare Britain is playing a part in the rise of China – which he called a defining event of the 21st century. The two most controversial aspects of the deals will allow Chinese firms to own and operate a Chinese-designed nuclear power station and to build and operate rail lines in Britain. The Chinese have a mixed safety record on high-speed rail. The prime minister said: \"Ours is truly a partnership for growth, reform and innovation. Our partnership goes well beyond the economic field. The UK recognises that the rise of China is one of the defining events of our century. \"We welcome the fact that China's economic growth is lifting millions out of poverty. As premier Li noted yesterday, as China grows in economic power that brings greater responsibilities on the world stage.\" The government moved to stem criticism of co-operation in the highly sensitive area of civil nuclear power by saying it is part of an overall agreement to tackle climate change. China and Britain also signed a joint statement on climate change. In a Guardian article, the energy and climate change secretary Ed Davey writes: \"Given the boost to low carbon electricity, to energy security and to jobs, the Chinese interest in taking forward investment at Hinkley Point C – the UK's first nuclear station in a generation – is hugely welcome. \"But equally important is that both China and the UK recognise that climate change is one of the greatest global challenges we face, and for the first time ever, the UK and China have released a joint statement, committing our governments to work even more closely together on a response to climate change. \"It's important because it is only the second time China has done this. The only other country with which China has agreed a statement on climate change is the US. This statement reflects the strength of our cooperation with China on climate change and low carbon.\" In a joint statement about high-speed rail, the two governments said: \"Both sides agree to promote substantive cooperation between the UK-China on rail, including high-speed rail in areas including design, engineering, construction, supply operation and maintenance on projects in China and the UK.\" There were also major deals in energy. An £11.8bn BP gas supply contract was one of a series of deals unveiled by major UK firms during Li's visit. The deal will provide state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) with liquefied natural gas (LNG) for 20 years. Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell extended an agreement with CNOOC to work on energy projects around the world, including LNG. The deals were signed at talks in Downing Streeti. Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said the partnership with CNOOC has been fruitful so far and the firms were \"committed to growing the business together\". Meanwhile, engineering company Rolls-Royce signed a memorandum of understanding with Chinese nuclear reactor manufacturer SNPTC to cooperate on civil nuclear power projects in the UK and other markets. The UK-based firm currently supplies emergency diesel generators to almost 40% of all nuclear reactors in China that are in operation or under construction and more than 70% of the safety-critical equipment. Jason Smith, Rolls-Royce's president of nuclear, said: \"China represents one of the world's largest civil nuclear markets in which Rolls-Royce has been supplying safety-critical technology solutions for 20 years.\" The company employs 55,000 staff in 45 countries, including almost 2,000 in China. The London Stock Exchange also signed agreements with the Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China to strengthen the Chinese renminbi offshore market in the UK and to provide access to cash for Chinese companies. LSE chairman Chris Gibson Smith said: \"London is the world's most international financial market and a natural partner to China in its ambitious global development.\" In a personal touch, Cameron gave Li a copy of the shooting script for the first episode of Downton Abbey signed by the show's creator. Li had expressed interest in visiting Highclere Castle where the drama is shot. Cameron also gave Li a special £10 lunar gold coin – made by the Royal Mint and designed by the artist Wuon-Gean Ho – celebrating the Chinese year of the horse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/aug/10/fracking-bribes-raise-problematic-questions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-10T18:51:18Z","webTitle":"Fracking ‘bribes’ raise problematic questions | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/10/fracking-bribes-raise-problematic-questions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/aug/10/fracking-bribes-raise-problematic-questions","fields":{"headline":"Fracking ‘bribes’ raise problematic questions","bodyText":"The latest “community support” offer from the Treasury (Fracking payouts condemned as ‘bribes’, 8 August) for those areas having fracking rigs installed is truly a Russian roulette gamble for local people. An article in the Washington Post on 10 April last year, headlined “Rise of deadly radon gas in Pennsylvania buildings linked to fracking industry”, reported on a detailed study in the journal Environmental Health Perspective that revealed a “disturbing correlation” between unusually high levels of radon gas in mostly residences and fracking that has become the industry standard over the past decade. Moreover, this is what Public Health England (the health watchdog) stated in October 2013: “If the natural gas delivery point were to be close to the extraction point with a short transit time, radon present in the natural gas would have little time to decay … there is therefore the potential for radon gas to be present in natural gas extracted from UK shale.” This health trade-off for money is what this offer really asks residents to accept. In light of this clear precautionary approach, it is odd that all ministers seem to be uncritically cheerleading for expanded fracking, despite its possible radon risk. Dr David Lowry Institute for Resource and Security Studies, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA • Who will be eligible for the compensation payments in fracked areas? Landlords, tenants? If it’s to cover the inevitable drop in house values, it’s not enough. If it applies to tenants, can I move into an affected area, take the money, then move on or will there be a length of residency requirement? Will each adult in a household get the payment or will it only apply to council tax payers? For those worried about future environmental issues, can they get extra if they have children? Will sick and disabled residents with less chance of moving away from the area be given priority when the timescale is worked out? What will be the radius of the area attracting payment? Will the scheme be extended to those living near proposed telecom base stations, nuclear power plants etc? Will beneficiaries be obliged to sign an undertaking that they will never take any legal action against the government or fracking companies relating to future pollution problems or other detrimental impacts? Given that we apparently don’t have enough civil servants to cope with Brexit negotiations, will the assessments be farmed out to an Atos-type organisation? If so, is this another scheme designed to transfer public money to private companies? Karen Barratt Winchester, Hampshire • Rather than compensating communities for fracking, it would be perverse if individual households who might be completely oblivious about fracking over a mile underneath their property were compensated, unlike those living alongside local back roads who could suffer serious disturbance. Local highways budgets are tightly stretched enough without proposals with little idea of the impact on different transport corridors depending on the subsurface geology, which in some cases has not been properly mapped since the 1880s. A prime example is Holderness in East Yorkshire, recently covered by an Environment Agency-commissioned British Geological Survey report to gain a better understanding of shallow groundwater movements and flood risk without fresh 1:10,000 geological mapping. Based on random borehole data, the composite geological map shows hitherto unmapped superficial deposits, including gravel in Beverly adjacent to some chalk rather than glacial till still shown on the bowdlerized online Geology of Britain viewer, which promptly contracts itself when you pick though the borehole records. There is a wealth of difference between 21st century scientific methods and hand watercoloured Victorian geological maps. And yet in its wisdom the BGS has ended systematic geological mapping, without which it is impossible to maintain enough staff with a detailed knowledge of regional ground conditions with which to advise the public and local planners. It would probably only cost around £50m to complete the third of Britain without high quality coverage compared to potentially squandering a £1bn compensating the wrong people.

EDF has almost completed the project’s preparatory earthworks, drainage, welfare facilities and roadworks, but is yet to decide on the investment to mark the beginning of the construction the plant in Somerset. The company said a decision would be reached in the coming months, and it has already launched a 45-day redundancies consultation, said the unions. Phil Whitehurst, the GMB union’s national officer, described the news as devastating. “The problem seems to be the stalled final investment decision. This should now be a wakeup call for the next UK government to take charge and manage the failing energy policy we have in place,” he said. “We cannot tolerate our energy new-build destiny being managed by companies who are in such disarray on funding when so deep into a project’s development. If we do, then the lights will surely go out,.” It is the first new new nuclear plant in the UK in decades and is scheduled to start producing electricity in 2023. EDF, however, is still negotiating with UK authorities about government debt guarantees for the project, along with decommissioning costs and other details. It is also negotiating with two Chinese utilities about their role in Hinkley Point and possible future UK nuclear projects with EDF. EDF said it had made good progress on work to finalise agreements which will enable a final investment decision. The company said it had invested significantly in preparing the site , with these works nearing completion. “The next phase of work on the site and in the associated developments will require a substantial increase in spending levels, and will begin as soon as the final investment decision has been made,” it said. Kevin Coyne of the Unite union said: “The growing energy needs of the UK demand a clear and coherent strategy to provide enough capacity for industry and consumers. “It is important, therefore, that the final investment decision is made as soon as possible and the announcement today of a delay in that process is disappointing, not least to those who are working on-site preparing the ground.” There will still be around 250 workers on the Hinkley Point C site after any layoffs, and EDF said work to ensure the project’s readiness will continue, including project planning, engineering design and supply chain activities."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/aug/10/hinkley-point-c-mandelson-government-china-backed-project","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-10T08:58:21Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point: Mandelson urges government to support China-backed project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/hinkley-point-c-mandelson-government-china-backed-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/aug/10/hinkley-point-c-mandelson-government-china-backed-project","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point: Mandelson urges government to support China-backed project","bodyText":"Peter Mandelson, the former business secretary, has urged the government to go ahead with the controversial, Chinese-backed Hinkley Point nuclear project, saying that after Brexit “we can’t be too fussy about who we do trade with”. Lord Mandelson, an architect of New Labour who served in several key positions under the Blair and Brown governments, said security fears over Chinese involvement in the project were unfounded, and Britain should foster a relationship with the country as a “prized trading partner”. His intervention in the debate comes after China expressed apparent annoyance at a delay ordered by Theresa May, whose chief of staff last October wrote about how security experts were worried about giving the Chinese a role in Britain’s energy security. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mandelson, whose post-politics jobs include the presidency of the Great Britain China Centre, said he was not surprised that security agencies had made such conclusions, since “that’s their job”. But he added: “The government has to consider China’s motivation for wanting to finance projects like this and, in my view and I guess in their view too, they judge that it would be commercial global suicide for China if they were to invest on the one hand and then try to mess around with other countries security on the next. “I mean, nobody would trust China ever again; nobody would want to do business with Chinese investors ever again. The truth is that China would have far, far too much to lose if it were to start compromising other countries’ national security.” Moreover, Britain’s vote to leave the European Union had put the country in a difficult position regarding trade, where we needed China more than it needed us, Mandelson said in comments that suggested that Britain could not afford to alienate Asia’s rising power. He said: “We are in a slightly invidious position in trade vis-a-vis China, despite the size of our market we are probably less relevant to China out of the European Union because we would be unable to influence that huge bloc’s future trade policies anymore and out of the EU we are probably more dependent on China’s goodwill because we will need to replace trade lost in Europe. “So we are not in the happiest of positions, but this is the reality and we have got to adopt a pragmatic approach to this. We can’t be too fussy about who we do trade with, whilst at the same time trying not to be a pushover and become supplicants in world trade.” Mandelson’s comments came after China’s ambassador warned on Monday that relations with the UK could be jeopardised if the government chose to cancel Chinese investment in the £18bn Hinkley Point C reactor in Somerset. Liu Xiaoming wrote in an article for the Financial Times: “Right now, the China-UK relationship is at a crucial historical juncture. Mutual trust should be treasured even more. I hope the UK will keep its door open to China and that the British government will continue to support Hinkley Point – and come to a decision as soon as possible so that the project can proceed smoothly.” A government spokesman later said the delays did not signal a cooling of enthusiasm for trade with China. Treasury sources added that Philip Hammond, who travelled to China last month for the G20 finance ministers’ meeting in his first overseas visit as chancellor, was no less committed to securing Chinese investment into Britain than his predecessor, George Osborne, who had promised to inaugurate a “golden decade” of cooperation between the two countries. EDF, the French state energy company which is due to build Hinkley point C, brought China General Nuclear Power Corporation on board help spread the financial load by taking a 33% stake in the project. China is also expected to have a significant role in future reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex. The project is heavily subsidised by the UK taxpayer, and the government has promised to pay well over the current market rates for electricity generated by the new reactor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/apr/24/chernobyl-arch-faces-265m-funding-gap-ahead-of-disasters-29th-anniversary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-24T10:28:58Z","webTitle":"Chernobyl arch faces €265m funding gap ahead of disaster's 29th anniversary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/24/chernobyl-arch-faces-265m-funding-gap-ahead-of-disasters-29th-anniversary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/apr/24/chernobyl-arch-faces-265m-funding-gap-ahead-of-disasters-29th-anniversary","fields":{"headline":"Chernobyl arch faces €265m funding gap ahead of disaster's 29th anniversary","bodyText":"A massive engineering project to make the Chernobyl nuclear power plant safe is facing a €265m (£190m) funding shortfall. Next week a conference held by Germany in London will call on countries to make up the gap, but the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has said it may have to ask its shareholders to make up the shortfall if donations dry up. This Sunday marks the 29th anniversary of the world’s worst nuclear disaster, when a power surge blew the roof off a reactor, spewing radioactive clouds across Russia, and eastern Europe. A makeshift sarcophagus built in the explosion’s aftermath was supposed to protect the environment from radiation for at least 30 years. But it has since developed cracks. The project to build a new radiation container had been due for completion this year but the deadline slipped to November 2017, as costs mushroomed from an initial estimate of €800m (£572m) to more than €2.15bn today. Over 40 governments and the European commission have committed to help a Chernobyl Shelter Fund tasked with sealing off the 100 tonnes of uranium and one tonne of plutonium that remain within the site. “If countries recognise the nature of the problem in Chernobyl and its importance for human security in Ukraine and ecological security in Europe, there is a hope that the gap could be closed at the donor conference on April 29,” Anton Usov, an EBRD spokesman told the Guardian. “Verbally the donors are committed to contribute more funds.” The bank believes there is a broad understanding among nations of the threat that radioactive dust on the site still poses to Kiev, around 70km away. But “if there is a shortfall, then we will speak to the bank’s management and shareholders and it may be funded by EBRD reserves,” Usov added. “Theoretically, that is something we could do.” The 31,000 tonne protective steel arch is an engineering project of staggering dimensions – 100m high, 165m long, with a span of 260m. When finished, it will be slid across teflon pads to entomb the burned out reactor, and is intended to remain effective for a century. “The are no parallels in the history of world engineering,” Usov said. “No-one has even undertaken a project like this before.” Construction of the stainless steel arch has been hampered by factors ranging from optimistic early architectural designs to heavy snows in the winter of 2013/14, which caved in part of a roof near the stricken Unit 4 reactor shelter. Workers were evacuated from nearby sites, as radiation levels surged. The reactor itself is still too contaminated for workers to approach. Removal of radioactive materials there will only begin once the new confinement structure has been finished."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/aug/06/nuclear-safety-fears-edf-sizewell-b","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-06T19:35:25Z","webTitle":"Nuclear safety fears grow as France snubs UK watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/06/nuclear-safety-fears-edf-sizewell-b","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/aug/06/nuclear-safety-fears-edf-sizewell-b","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear safety fears grow as France snubs UK watchdog","bodyText":"Britain’s nuclear watchdog was made to wait more than a fortnight for key files from energy giant EDF confirming that components recently revealed to be suspect had not been used in one of Britain’s largest nuclear power stations. Emails released under the Freedom of Information Act show that in early May, France’s EDF Group initially rebuffed requests from the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) to hand over files about a foundry in France that made specialist parts for EDF’s reactors. The request followed a shock announcement by the foundry’s owner, Areva, on 2 May that quality control reports could have been falsified. The email trail shows the ONR was still making requests for a components list on 18 May, 16 days after the safety fears were first aired. Dr David Lowry of the Institute for Resource and Security Studies, who obtained the emails, said they raised questions about the regulator’s powers. “ONR has run into so many difficulties in obtaining safety documentation from the French nuclear industry. How will it obtain key documents from the notoriously secretive Chinese nuclear industry, if they get permission to build their own reactors at Bradwell, on the Blackwater Estuary in Essex?” The UK regulator feared that the suspect Areva components might have been used in the construction of Suffolk’s Sizewell B power station and that others were destined for the proposed Hinkley Point C in Somerset. Greenpeace France claimed that “the potential falsifications and anomalies” constituted “a major safety risk because the parts involved are large components which are essential to operating the reactors”. When the concerns emerged, an ONR spokesman said: “ONR is aware of the reports of possible falsification of manufacturing and quality control at Areva’s reactor vessel plant at Le Creusot. We have been in contact with the licensee and are looking into any applicability in the UK.” But emails suggest that the watchdog struggled to obtain information from the French company’s UK subsidiary, EDF Energy, to enable it to make an urgent safety assessment. An email from the ONR dated 13 May states: “We have been in contact with EDF Group and while they do have access to the Areva component files, they are not able to release them to EDF Energy.” The watchdog said EDF had informally advised it that none of the components in Sizewell B posed a safety risk. But, without access to the files, it had to rely on the French firm’s assurances. The ONR’s chief nuclear inspector wrote in desperation on 18 May to his counterpart at ASN, France’s nuclear watchdog,. “I am concerned that without sight of the full list of implicated components supplied to the UK it is not possible for ONR to independently verify the UK position,” he wrote. The ONR was left having to ask its French counterpart for a list of the suspect components or to “facilitate Areva sending the list directly to ONR”. It continued: “As you will appreciate, there is significant public interest in the UK and as a respected regulator it is important that we have sight of the source information without which the robustness of our public responses and our safety assurances are diminished.” EDF Energy insists it was ultimately able to access all the relevant files from its parent company, EDF Group, and shared these with the regulator. Eventually, in June, EDF stated that it was able to independently confirm that Sizewell B was not affected by issues under investigation at Areva’s Creusot Forge in France. France’s energy minister, Ségolène Royal, said tests confirmed there were no mechanical problems associated with the suspect components. The regulator’s ability to oversee foreign energy companies operating in the UK has been thrown into sharp relief by the planned £18bn construction of Hinkley Point C, which is awaiting approval from the government. A spokeswoman said ONR “had no trouble” accessing files it needed in the necessary timescales. As published documents show, we engaged closely with the licensee, but also with Areva and the French regulator, ASN.”She said an independent review had confirmed “no deficiencies were identified”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/sep/15/japanese-opposition-party-elects-first-female-leader","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-15T09:40:15Z","webTitle":"Japanese opposition party elects first female leader","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/15/japanese-opposition-party-elects-first-female-leader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/sep/15/japanese-opposition-party-elects-first-female-leader","fields":{"headline":"Japanese opposition party elects first female leader","bodyText":"A former news anchor has struck a rare blow for Japanese women in public life by becoming the first female leader of the country’s biggest opposition party. Renho Murata easily defeated her two rivals for the leadership of the left-of-centre Democratic party on Thursday, hours after she sparked a minor controversy by revealing she still held dual Japanese and Taiwanese nationality despite insisting earlier that she had renounced the latter while in her teens. The 48-year-old, who was born in Japan to a Taiwanese father and Japanese mother, is expected to give her party a temporary boost, following a run of poor election results. Murata – known simply as Renho – said the party’s priority was to re-establish itself as a serious alternative to the Liberal Democratic party (LDP), which together with its junior coalition partner dominates both houses of parliament. “From here on, we face a giant ruling party,” she said after the vote. “I’d like to call on everyone to join me in creating a party that does not criticise but makes proposals ... so that one day we will become Japan’s choice.” Murata is the third woman to attain high political office in Japan in the past two months, although women are still woefully under-represented in the country’s parliament. In July, Yuriko Koike was elected governor of Tokyo, and immediately confronted the city’s bureaucracy by postponing the relocation of Tsukiji market – the world’s biggest fish market – due to concerns over soil contamination at the new site. Last month, Tomomi Inada, a rightwinger who has been tipped as a future prime minister, became Japan’s second defence minister. Their appointments were made against a background of gender imbalance. According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, women make up less than 10% of MPs in the lower house of Japan’s parliament, and 20% of those in the upper house. Inada is one of only three women in the 20-strong cabinet of the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, whose mission to fill 30% of public and private sector leadership positions with women by 2020 has got off to a disappointing start. Murata, a former swimsuit model who worked as a journalist before being elected to parliament in 2004, seized the opportunity to lead the Democrats after the former leader, Katsuya Okada, said he was stepping down in the wake of the party’s poor performance in July’s upper house elections. During its three years in government from 2009, the party was criticised for mishandling the planned relocation of a US marine base on the southern island of Okinawa and for its response to the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011. The party, whose MPs include an uneasy mix of liberal and conservative defectors from other parties, has never recovered from its heavy general election defeat in late 2012. A poll by the Asahi Shimbun this week showed support for the LDP at 40%, with the Democrats on just 7%. Murata’s attempts to rebuild the party’s credibility got off to a shaky start, just hours before her expected victory was confirmed on Thursday. Questioned by reporters, she acknowledged that she still held Taiwanese nationality, despite earlier claiming that she had become a naturalised citizen of Japan in 1985 at the age of 17. “I would like to apologise for the confusion caused by my inaccurate recollection of what happened and the contradictions in my recent remarks,” she said, before confirming that she identified herself as Japanese. “I’ve always worked for the good of this, my own country, and I’ll continue to do so,” she said. Japanese law requires people with dual nationality to choose one or the other before they reach the age of 22, although failure to do so is not a crime. Many retain dual nationality under a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. The nationality debacle is likely to be seized on by her opponents, however. The conservative Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper described Murata’s confusion over her nationality as a “sorry state of affairs”. Despite her assurances this week that she had taken steps to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship, the newspaper said in an editorial: “It is out of the question for a legislator – who is supposed to serve the interests of the nation, including in foreign affairs and national security – to leave their own nationality obscure.” The Yomiuri suggested that some might question her loyalty to Japan, particularly over foreign policy issues where it is in disagreement with Taiwan. “Although Taiwan is friendly towards Japan, it is in conflict with the Japanese standpoint regarding some issues, for instance, its ownership claims on the Senkaku islands,” the paper said. “If Renho retains her Taiwan citizenship, she could become the target of undesirable suspicions regarding her relations with Taiwan.” The Senkakus are administered by Japan but also claimed by China and Taiwan. During her leadership campaign, Murata vowed to protect the war-renouncing article of Japan’s postwar constitution, as speculation mounts that Abe will use his party’s big parliamentary majority to trigger changes that would end the military’s strictly defensive role."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2019/jul/30/spotlight-on-newstart-after-survey-reveals-poverty-rise-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-07-30T07:44:24Z","webTitle":"Coalition defends robodebt process as Labor applies pressure – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/jul/30/spotlight-on-newstart-after-survey-reveals-poverty-rise-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2019/jul/30/spotlight-on-newstart-after-survey-reveals-poverty-rise-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Coalition defends robodebt process as Labor applies pressure – as it happened","bodyText":"We are going to wrap Politics Live up for the night, but we will be back early tomorrow for the second last sitting day ahead of the winter break.

Over on Sky, Pat Dodson is telling David Speers that the hopes of Indigenous Australians will be dashed if Scott Morrison doesn’t come out and support his minister, Ken Wyatt, in both constitutional recognition and a voice to parliament. Meanwhile, Adam Bandt isn’t letting the Crown issue drop either: “Yesterday the PM said he had no information his ministers had done anything wrong, despite reports two ministers pressured the home affairs department on behalf of Crown. “This morning the attorney general referred the Crown visa scandal to the ACLEI, but that body can’t investigate ministers and former ministers, especially regarding the prime minister’s statement of ministerial standards. “This afternoon in question time the prime minister refused to answer my questions about whether he had satisfied himself his ministers had done nothing wrong, handballing it to the attorney general. “What has the prime minister got to hide? Only the prime minister can enforce his ministerial standards, but it appears his approach is ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’. “Meanwhile the Labor opposition is missing in action, not asking one question about the scandal and joining with the government to vote down a parliamentary inquiry which could have investigated ministers and former ministers. “Liberal and Labor are running a protection racket for ministers and former ministers with connections to Crown casino.” Brendan O’Connor has just put out this statement: Reports today expose the government’s failure to ensure the safe management of radiation, with close to 600 incidents of nuclear radiation exposure occurring in Australia in 2017, as recorded by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. It is incumbent on the federal government to explain what measures it has in place to ensure the safe use, handling and storage of nuclear substances in Australia. Currently it is not doing enough, with examples of skin exposure, contamination, spillages, and double doses. Australians depend on nuclear technology for medicines used in the diagnosis of heart disease, skeletal injuries as well as a range of cancers. The community must be assured nuclear substances and waste is handled safely and with care. An independent review by Professor Andrew Hopkins, which reported in October 2018, was commissioned to look at safety at ANSTO. Despite recommending the federal government commit to a replacement facility for Building 23, as soon as practicable, the government has no plans to do anything. The government must stop with its cuts to science, research and innovation. Instead of keeping an “open mind” about establishing a nuclear power plant in Australia, the government must fix the issues it already faces at ANSTO and the many other locations around the country where radioactive waste is currently managed. Wilson: You just said there was no process. Husic: He does not want to hear the end of the sentence. The reality is, people tried to find somebody desperately when they were concerned about the size of a debt that had been alleged they owed and they couldn’t get through, the frustration and the number of cases where this occurred is already on the public record. The government last year ... nearly 40 people lost their jobs last year, the last line of defence on this, because the government was so confident the automated system would work the way it would and it didn’t. But if Tim reckons it is working fine and dandy, let us see how he reacts when people respond to his comments. Wilson: I have to respond to that. He started the answer by saying there was no process and people should contact the ... office to ask for one, he went through every criticism he had of the process existing. This is the dishonesty sitting at the heart of the debate – people have an issue they should contact the department, raise the fact that they believe they have been incorrectly sent a notice and work towards a pathway to resolution, not deceive national television. The main argument was on robodebt, after Stuart Robert apologised in parliament for the department pursuing a $7,000 debt against a woman’s deceased son. Tim Wilson: This is the same process the minister outlined under the previous government, the one before that, because when there is a discrepancy between somebody’s tax return and the amount of money provided through welfare or benefit from the taxpayer, we have to go through a process of recouping. We can do that more accurately and most distinctly, the main thing is we are doing everything we can to get that right, because if not we are forgoing $1.9bn of revenue the opposition thinks we should not follow up. Ed Husic: I just need to jump in, we had Stuart Robert attempt this today – the system has been around for ages. What has been around is to collect money if it has been improperly extended to someone. What has happened under the Coalition with robodebt is the automation of this. The Coalition is looking to automate, looking to automate a number of processes and the way in which they have done this process has gone off the rails. No one is disputing the need to recover money if it has been received by somebody who has not validly received that benefit. In this case, the automated system, a seven-year program of automation under this government announced, in particular respect of robodebt, has gone off the rails, people were sent notices because they were not being double checked by a human pair of eyes, this was just sent out, and people were getting debt notices or debts they did not owe. Wilson: This point is dishonest – the idea that a human pair of eyes is happy to go through every single debt collection notice and every single history of somebody’s tax payments and welfare payments, and make sure everything occurs, is verging on impossible, especially when talking on scale. That is why we have automated systems to compare to make sure there isn’t anybody doing the wrong thing. As soon as a problem is identified, there is a pathway for people to raise it and respond. I’m not trying to pretend that there may not be shock when people receive a notice – that is why we have a pathway to make sure that when there is evidence to the contrary they can take appropriate action. Husic: It is not. Frankly, Tim, you are the gift that keeps on giving when you just told viewers that there would be a system in place to be able to correct these things quickly. There is. The reality is anybody who watched you then pick up the phone to your office to set you straight, the experience of people was contrary. My point was that on the system, when it was seen. People have said, Tim, experience of people has been they could not get through quickly to have the resolution. Tim Wilson and Ed Husic have had to stop arguing on Patricia Karvela’s Afternoon Briefing, because a division has been called in the House. It also looks like Scott Morrison used the “unfunded empathy” line in 2015, in relation to Gillian Triggs, the former human rights commissioner. Mike Bowers was in the chamber: Bob Katter, on Sky, says it is one of the terrible things about this country that we like to bring down tall poppies. He then says he loves bringing down tall poppies. But he is a bit sad in this case. Because the tall poppies here are the Packer family and he says the Packers have done great things for the country. Adam Bandt has responded to this: Labor and Liberal are on a unity ticket on coal. We are in a climate emergency and governments around the world are recognising it. Thermal coal exports need to be phased out by 2030 and we need to urgently support coal workers and communities during the transition. Parliament should be supporting a transition plan for coal workers as we phase out thermal coal exports. If Anthony Albanese is serious about fighting climate change and supporting coal communities, he should instruct his party room to boycott this group. Richard Marles was right when he said the global market for thermal coal has collapsed. Labor should be focusing on a plan to phase out coalmining in Australia so the industry can transition in an orderly and just way, rather than teaming up with climate-denying Craig Kelly on political stunts.” It’s been pointed out to me that the phrase Scott Morrison used yesterday in regards to Labor’s question on Newstart, “unfunded empathy”, has turned up before. One of those places is the 2017 book Retaking America: Crushing political correctness, by Nick Adams. A quick perusal finds it: In my world, traditional American masculinity, predicted on masculine toughness and stoicism with doing the right thing, has no peer. It’s erosion is one of the most untold tragedies of the last half-century. Unfortunately, this trend has extended to our national politics, too. Many of these people are afraid of their own shadow, incapable of leadership, dispensing tough love, and enacting painful reform, for fear of offending groups considered ‘victim groups’ by politically correct elitists. Economic reform, for example, is almost impossible, when one side of politics is all about unfunded empathy. And Scott Morrison calls time on question time. Andrew Wallace gets the next dixer, reminding me of his existence. Tony Smith again has to address members of the government not jumping when it is their question: “The call is going to alternate. I say to the House very briefly, there’s people jumping – I’m trying to alternate the call. There’s – it’s not secret there’s arrangements with an independent question early on in question time. If the government’s decided not to jump, that doesn’t mandate who I call. I did call – I did call the leader of the opposition immediately after the member for Maribyrnong. I did that on the basis that I thought he was first getting to this feet ahead of the member for Melbourne, but I do point out in any event, given the position of the leader of the opposition, if it was a contest, I would have called the leader of the opposition anyway. It obviously presents a difficulty with me. “But we had two questions from that side, and one from the government. We now had one from this side. All I can do is ensure that in allocating the call I alternate. And if members wish to have things run more smoothly with respect to the independents, it’s something they have to sort out with the processes. It’s not up to me to simply pick an independent because the government hasn’t jumped. So, and what I have tried to do now is allocate the call as fairly as I can. The member for Melbourne had sought the call after being denied it as well. I thought that was the fair thing to do. So we’ll now go back to the regular alternating of the call.” Christian Porter, with the nod: There’s two matters that we can provide in response. And perhaps the first is with respect to the statement that I made earlier today, and that is that all of the matters that have been raised in recent days in the media have now been referred by me to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, pursuant to section 18 of that act. And I noted for the members’ benefit this morning, in making that referral, I’m simply saying there are sufficient concerns that have been raised to allow for that precautionary refer to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. They may decide to take further action. They may report back to me there’s not enough in it to warrant a full investigation, but that’s the body that is best placed to investigate the matters raised in the media. As to the broad nature of the issue that you raise, I can say that with respect to the idea that there is some kind of favouritism or fast-tracking, there’s systems in place, where a variety of passport holders, particularly referenced in the white paper on developing Northern Australia, are able to access and facilitate quick visa processing. There’s nothing new in that. That occurred on both sides of the House, but if there’s any specific allegations the member wants to make, then perhaps he needs to make them. Adam Bandt to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister and it’s about his statement of ministerial standards. You said there was nothing before you to warrant taking action on Crown. Today you and Labor opposed a parliamentary inquiry into ministers and former ministers. The attorney general has referred some of the allegations to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity commissioner, but it won’t look into if your ministers have acted inappropriately. Given the stench from allegations regarding the matters, can you ensure the House you have fully investigated and none of your ministers lobbied home affairs on behalf of Crown, or is it a case of don’t ask, don’t tell, with the government running a protection racket for ministers with ties to Crown Casino? Christian Porter: With respect to standing order 90 and reflections on members, that is a reflection on all ministers here without identifying particularly which minister he is reflecting on, and indeed, there were no allegations of the type he raised in the media specifically or otherwise. I think it’s clearly out of order. Tony Smith: It’s not up for me to judge what is in or out of the media. With respect to this point of order, the practice makes very clear on reflections. They generally have to be direct reflections on particular members of the parliament. You would find a precedent for questions of this nature have been asked before. Obviously, it was a long question. And the full 45 seconds worth. So I will allow the question and obviously the prime minister has given – I just say to the member for Melbourne, given the amount of preamble commentary, and the nature of the 45-second contribution, that wasn’t all the question. The prime minister has extreme latitude in how he wishes to answer it. And I call the attorney general. I give the attorney the same latitude. We go to a dixer, and then we are going to Adam Bandt. Someone missed the jump, because Anthony Albanese calls Stuart Robert back to the box with this question: “When will the government finally admit that its robodebt experiment has failed?” Robert does not answer the question, and instead goes to the government having a lawful responsibility to recover outstanding debts. Which was not the question. Bill Shorten to Stuart Robert: “In May ... Anastacia McCardel was told her son owed a debt of almost $7,000. She has said, and I quote, ‘I wanted to know how they thought Bruce would have worked his way through his paperwork when he was actually dead.’ What advice can the minister give Ms McCardel?” Robert: Let me first of all pass on my sincere condolences to Mrs McCardel. In many cases when the department raises a debt against someone who is deceased, and the knowingly know about it, if the debt is big enough, they will seek to recover it from the estate. In the vast majority of times, the debt will be wiped. Because of the size of the debt being uneconomical to recover and the length of time, the department should have simply waived the debt. They didn’t, my department was wrong. I apologise for it.” It’s amazing how MPs can slam a billion-dollar industry though, just to own inner-city lefties. From an Ibis world report on Australia’s coffee and cafe industry: Revenue for the cafes and coffee shops industry has grown moderately over the past five years, supported by Australia’s vibrant coffee culture. Industry revenue is expected to grow at an annualised 2.5% over the five years through 2018-19, to $9.9bn.” Obviously quaffing coffees is good for the economy. No matter where you are. Mike Kelly to Stuart Robert: “I refer to the minister’s previous answer. Can the minister explain why a 74-year-old widower was sent a letter this week claiming a debt from 21 years ago?” Robert: “Let me thank the member for his question. In relation to the specific case he mentioned, my understanding is the gentleman is a former public servant [who was] incorrectly sent a letter dealing with income stream issue, not a compliance. The department has recognised the error and apologised profusely in the media.” Someone from the government benches yells “that was a wasted question” and guffaws loud enough for the broadcast to pick it up. Bill Shorten to Stuart Robert: “Last night he told the ABC and I quote, ‘Bank records, of course, are always available for seven years. And the department won’t be going back after seven years in terms of recovering that.’ Does the minister stand by that statement?” Robert: “I thank the member for this question. I do stand by that statement, as at today, the Department of Human Services forward letters will say ... they will be starting at the 2013-14 financial year. There may well be some outstanding notices from previous financial years, but forward letters going out to ask about a discrepancy will be from 2013-14 financial year and onwards.” Darren Chester is delivering a dixer and proving that you can be a National MP and minister and not actually be a complete dunderhead while answering a question your office has written. Bill Shorten to Stuart Roberts: “How many debt notices issued under the government’s robodebt program have turned out to be wrong?” (He seemed a little nervous, but that is to be expected, I suppose.) Robert: “Under the income compliance checking process, checking and updating the past income process, we have since 1 July recovered $1.9bn. Of the 800,000, 80% have resulted in a debt being collected. 80%. 80%. “To give some ... [context] ... right now across Australia ... there’s $1.54m outstanding debts. “This government, like all governments, has a lawful responsibility to collect, where citizens have mismatched what they said they earned, versus what through their tax return they have been shown to earn. “Now that mutual obligation is something that has been around for decades and decades. “Governments of all persuasions over the last 20-plus years have sought to recover debts that have arisen because citizens have put forward an assessment of their income and when their tax return came through, that was different. And that difference has to be accounted for. “That’s the mutual obligation that citizens have with their government. So can I say to all citizens who are receiving income support, or indeed, family assistance payments, regularly update through either the myGov application, through a telephone service, or through a service centre, update the assessment of your income. Because when your tax return is returned, they’ll be matched, they’ll be checked and if there’s any discrepancy at all, we have a legal obligation to contact the citizen concerned and seek to explain the deficit. “This has been a process that governments have done for well over 20 years, not just this government, but many members of the frontbench over there have been part of that. “From 2010, the member for McMahon was the minister for DHS. That member did this process. The member for McMahon was the member for Sydney, following the member for Sydney, was the member for Gorton. He also followed that process. As will subsequent members. We seek to do it compassionately and sensibly, but there’s a lawful requirement to ensure the right people get the right funds at the right time.” Kevin Andrews gets ANOTHER dixer. That’s like the third day in a row or something. It’s been a while since he has seen this much action during question time. But I guess he’s still coming to terms with Tony Abbott’s absence and they do say it is best to keep busy. Anthony Albanese to Stuart Robert: My question is addressed to the Minister for Government Services. Have any victims of the Townsville flood received debt notices under the government’s robodebt program? Robert: I thank the leader of the opposition for his question. And let me say at present under the income compliance program, no victims in the four postcodes around Townsville have received a debt notice. That was quick. From Chris Bowen’s office: “Minister Hunt must respond in detail as to why he awarded a Medicare MRI licence to a clinic operated by the vice president of the Liberal party South Australia, Cara Miller. “In April this year the government granted a Medicare MRI licence to Sound Radiology in Parkside, Adelaide, overlooking 443 other applications. This is despite Sound Radiology operating within 5km of nine other partially or fully Medicare-eligible MRI machines. “In a response to a question on notice on the MRI licence from the April budget estimates, the department responded claiming that the final decision was taken by the government. ‘The successful applications were decided by the government, taking into account the assessment information provided by the department.’ “The department also denied any knowledge that the clinic was operated by Ms Miller. ‘The department was not aware that the CEO of Sound Radiology holds a position in the South Australian Liberal party.” “The Liberals awarded just five Medicare MRI licences in their first five years of power. “The minister must not hide the truth about which clinics he is awarding MRI licences to and why, because under his watch out-of-pocket health costs have never been higher, and waiting lists have never been longer.” Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: When today’s median household income datas proves that Australians are going backwards, why is this government always banging on about Labor instead of coming up with an economic policy to increase wages and living standards? Frydenberg: “Mr Speaker, we won’t be lectured by Sir Tax-a-Lot over there, Sir Tax-a-lot. He’s quite pleased and proud of Labor’s housing tax and retirees tax.” Ooooh sick burn. Frydenberg is really pleased about this line, because he shouts it again. “Well, Mr Speaker, we won’t be lectured by Sir Tax-a-Lot over there, Sir Tax-a-Lot. He’s quite pleased and proud of Labor’s housing tax and retirees tax. The co-architect with the member for McMahon over there, and the member for Maribyrnong will never forgive them, Mr Speaker. “The reality is this Hilda survey you refer to today, oh, he’s very chirpy now, Sir Tax-a-lot is up and again. “This is a quote from the report that you just cited: ‘Employment growth picked up in 2017, particularly for women who saw their employment rate rise from 69.5% in 2016, to 71.4% in 2017.’ “The highest it’s been in the history of the survey, Mr Speaker. We on this side of House, we’re in favour of 1.4 million new jobs, Mr Speaker. We on this side of the House are in favour of lower taxes, Mr Speaker. We’re in favour of $100bn of new infrastructure spending, and we on this side of House are in favour of record spending on schools, hospitals, and aged care. But we’re not in favour of Labor’s $387bn of higher taxes.” In Senate question time, Michaelia Cash, representing home affairs minister Peter Dutton, was asked about our report just 11 people had access to the medevac briefing that was leaked to the Australian, despite the AFP’s claims that there were too many people to investigate. The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, asked Cash whether the investigation would be reopened. Cash responded the AFP considered the matter finalised. So that’s a “no” then. The Greens are taking up the attack on the ACLEI referral of the allegations about fast-tracking visas for Crown casino. Greens leader Richard Di Natale asks if the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has inquired into the report that two federal ministers and one federal MP lobbied the department of home affairs to allow high rollers to bring cash from the airport. Mathias Cormann, representing the PM, warned Di Natale against “what appears to be a desire to be both police officer charging, judge, jury and executioner all at the same time”. He notes his answer yesterday that departmental officials have no discretion to waive visa character requirements. Di Natale asks if the ACLEI referral was made “because they can’t investigate politicians”. Cormann rejected the premise of the question. He added that the department of home affairs has “no evidence” visa requirements were waived and says the “same legal criteria are applied to all applications”. Crown’s share price has taken a 3% tumble as a result of Andrew Wilkie’s speech in parliament detailing new whistleblower allegations against it. The company’s share price is off 38c today, to $11.88 as of about 2.25pm. This follows a 3.24% fall yesterday as the market digested allegations in Nine newspapers and on its flagship TV current affairs show, 60 Minutes. Anthony Albanese to Josh Frydenberg: Does the Hilda survey released today show that Australians are better off or worse off than in 2013? Frydenberg: They’re certainly better off. When he refers to the Hilda survey, they’re better off since 2013, and when he refers to the Hilda survey, that was conducted to December 2017. Since then the unemployment rate has come down from 5.6 to 5.2%, the wage price index has increased from 2.1 to 2.3%. Real wages has increased. The participation rate has increased. And the ABS household income and wealth survey released earlier this month, that takes into account the full 2017-18 year, shows real median household disposable incomes has increased by over $2,000 per year compared to 2007-08. The other point about the Hilda survey – when it comes to poverty line it’s fluctuated over time, but the broad trend has been downwards. This is especially true since 2007, when 12.4% of the population was in relative poverty. In 2016, the proportion had fallen to 9.6%. The bottom line is this government, this side of the House, has been responsible for helping to create the conditions where more than 1.4 million new jobs have been created, Mr Speaker. And lower taxes, lower taxes have ensured that Australians can earn more, and keep more of what they earn.” It continues, but honestly, I am too busy quaffing coffees to pay attention. The minister for originality, Michael McCormack, delivers us the very original attack of slagging off city dwellers for *gasp* drinking coffee. “While the warriors from Newtown and Marrickville sat ... about quaffing their piccolos ...” HOW FRICKING DARE THEY? Personally, whenever I go to regional and rural Australia, I join the locals in a bracing cup of concrete, because according to our deputy prime minister, no one drinks coffee beyond the goat cheese curtain. Michael McCormack: we really need to unite the city and country and improve the discourse. Also Michael McCormack; look at those city dwellers quaffing their tiny coffees! FFS. Siri: what is the definition of “a punish”? David Gillespie saddles the despatch box, and therefore us, with Michael McCormack, which gives me the permission I needed to go make a cup of tea. “All politics is local, as it should be,” says Sliced White. And I’ve just added a bathroom visit to that break. Andrew Wilkie has the first independent’s question. It’s on what is being done to wipe Tasmania’s debt to the federal government for its social housing – or at least the interest bill – as well as what is being done to address the issue of social housing in Tasmania. You may remember that Jacqui Lambie negotiated with the government to have something done on that debt, or social housing, in return for her vote on tax cuts. Michael Sukkar: (On the debt: it has been discussed.) Sukkar concludes with this: Through the agreement with Tasmania, we’re contributing $33.7m, $3m of which is permanent, where it wasn’t previously, and that is solely dedicated to homelessness. In addition, across the country the Coalition has announced a $78m commitment to support women and children escaping domestic violence, of which I know there are projects under way in Tasmania already, and this includes $60m to build emergency accommodation.” Chris Bowen to Greg Hunt: Can the minister confirm that the Department of Health has advised Senate estimates that, and I quote, ‘Successive applications were decided by the government.’ Can the minister confirm the CEO of sound radiology is also the vice president of the South Australian branch of the Liberal party? There you go. Hunt: In relation to the latter item, I can’t confirm. That matter isn’t known to me, and to the best of my knowledge, has never been known to me. We receive submissions from the department, and the submissions are signed off in the ministerial office ... I would note in relation to fully eligible MRI units per 1,000 population, in the electorate of Adelaide, an opposition electorate, the rate of 100,000 people is 0.7. That is significantly lower than in south-east Melbourne, in Perth south, and east Melbourne, in the Australian Capital Territory, with 0.5, in western Sydney with 0.5, in Nepean-Blue Mountains, in Central Coast and Hunter with 0.6. These things are determined on a basis of need. What that does is it sets out the fact that area is significantly lower in MRI concentration than all those other regions of Australia.” If Christian Porter is writing these dixers, it is just indicative of how busy he is, because OMG it might just be easier to put a microphone on the prime minister when he delivers his joint party room rah rah than put up with this. Put it in a press release. Let backbenchers ask questions that actually matter to their communities. #Deathtodixers Chris Bowen to Greg Hunt: Can the minister confirm that Sound Radiology in Adelaide is situated within 5km of nine other MRI machines with existing MRI Medicare licences? Hunt: I’m very happy to check the details on that. But let me run through the criteria for this process. I understand the ALP ran a parallel process, but there was no identification of the grounds, there was no identification of the basis for ... for applications, and there was no identification of a formal process. In particular, I can indicate that on 4 February 2019 the government announced further investment in the MRI program, bringing the total units to over 50. On 23 September 2018, the government announced an invitation to apply an ITA process, to allocate Medicare eligibility to up to 20 additional MRI units comprising a mix of fully eligible units and partial units in metropolitan and regional areas. The closing time for lodging applications was 2 September 2018. In terms of the streams through which applications were available, they included the upgrade of partially eligible MRI equipment to full eligibility. Stream two is full Medicare eligibility for MRI equipment applicants with either an operational MRI unit at the practice, or will have one at the location by 31 December 2020. The grounds are set out in those terms and that’s the process that’s been followed. Chris Bowen is about to get back up – which means there is more to that MRI licence he just asked about . The prosecution of whistleblower Witness K – who revealed Australia spied on East Timor – and his lawyer Bernard Collaery was in the ACT magistrates court this morning. The hearing revealed that Collaery wants his case to be resolved in the supreme court on indictment but Witness K is still in negotiations with commonwealth prosecutors to deal with his case summarily. This morning Collaery and Witness K asked for hearing dates next week to determine the scope of national security information in the case to be vacated because what’s the point in the magistrates court ruling if the supreme court will determine that point anyway? And as negotiations could fail, the substantive Witness K matter could end up in the supreme court as well. Counsel for the attorney general said the commonwealth would prefer the hearings were not vacated until it’s clear that is necessary, and even if Collaery is off to the supreme court it wouldn’t bind chief magistrate Lorraine Walker in the Witness K matter. “They’re trying to split us,” Collaery was overheard to say in the courtroom, although he later declined to give a statement. Walker: “It seems to me that it’s important that the [Collaery matter] is committed as soon as is sensibly achievable. But I note there is some desire that that should go alongside that of Witness K in the event [his case is determined in the supreme court]. It is also desirable that any time that has been allocated for a hearing be utilised for a hearing should a hearing be necessary. There has already been considerable delay ... If there are to be conversations between representatives of Witness K and the commonwealth they should take place expeditiously.” Walker adjourned both matters for mention at 9.30am on 6 August. So the procedural can has been kicked down the road, and it depends how negotiations go. The first dixer is straight out of the joint party room meeting about “demonstrating” that the government is “on the side of local communities”. #deathtodixers Chris Bowen to Greg Hunt: My question is to the minister for health. Can the minister confirm that the government has granted an MRI medical licence to Sound Radiology in Parkside, Adelaide, while overlooking 443 other applications? Hunt: The government has granted 53 licences and 43 have already commenced. The process was done through an independent process where applications were called and assessed by the department. But very interestingly, 53 announced, 43 already commenced. Two of them them have not commenced. In Kalgoorlie, in Western Australia, where we’re waiting on the West Australian government to purchase the machines. And in Queensland, in relation to one of their own hospitals to deliver and do that. That is the situation. 53 announced, 43 already under way, and we’re awaiting on the governments of Queensland and Western Australia as exemplars to deliver the final part. Speaking before Andrew Wilkie made his fresh set of allegations against Crown in parliament this afternoon, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, defended the state’s under-fire gaming regulator against allegations it has failed to properly supervise the company’s Melbourne casino. “No, I think the regulator is particularly well resourced; they’ve been provided with additional money in this year’s budget; they’ve got the powers that they need,” Andrews said. Wilkie has long slated the Victorian commission for gambling and liquor regulation as an inadequate regulator, today calling it and Victoria police “incapable or unwilling” to enforce the law against Crown. There was a “peculiar power Crown has over VCGLR and Victoria police,” Wilkie told parliament. The VCGLR has had little to say about the series of allegations aired against Crown over the past few days – a stance that is consistent with its general reluctance to discuss its activities. Its chief executive, Catherine Myers, doesn’t appear to have given a single interview since she took on the role in 2015 (the Guardian has asked for one). “Anyone who’s got concerns about Crown or any other operator within our gaming industry should with confidence go forward to Victoria police if they think it’s a criminal matter or go to the VCGLR,” Andrews said. “I know that they take issues of probity and integrity across the industry very seriously and I’m very confident that they have everything they need to guarantee that probity and integrity as we look to the future.” He denied that Crown, which is one of Melbourne’s single biggest employers, was too big to fail: “No one gets a pass on integrity and probity when it comes to this industry or any industry.” That was quite the hour! It’s question time, time and given the amount of running around in the last bit, I won’t make it to the chamber in time, so I’ll be reporting from the broadcast. And why is the crossbench pissed? Mostly because the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement and Integrity doesn’t have the powers to investigate ministers and former ministers. Hence no one involved in the parliament will be part of any potential commission inquiry. And Christian Porter finished with: I would say though that I think the member for Mayo’s comments that anything other than support for the motion before the House reveals that the major parties are somehow beholden to the gambling industry is a frankly absurd contention to put. This has now been referred to ACLEI as I have noted. I think that is the appropriate course of action. I might also note for the benefit of the House, Mr Deputy Speaker, l did advise the member for Denison of the fact that I have already sent this mater to ACLEI as I am able to under section 18 of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act. My observation is that it was probably the better course to withdraw the motion in those circumstances but of course it is up the member for Denison to determine what he considers is the appropriate course. But having had the matter referred to ACLEI, which is the body appropriately place to investigate it, pursuing a motion to set up a parallel parliamentary committee inquiry is wrong-headed; it would actually discourage and withdraw efficacy from the ACLEI investigation. But if the motion is not going to be withdrawn it would be the government’s view that it should be opposed and we will oppose it on the basis that this has already been referred through to the appropriate authority.” Continued: ACLEI is I might say to Members who have supported this motion and spoken in favour of it is a very appropriate and in fact the most appropriate body to consider these allegations. They have very significant investigatory powers; very significantly stronger than those of a parliamentary committee, obviously including the ability to apply for search warrants, issue notices that attract a criminal penalty if not complied with. I would note that ACLEI also has the ability to hold hearings, exercise coercive powers and seize evidence. It is highly experienced in these types of investigations and indeed in considering prima facie allegations to determine whether or not a full investigation is necessary. And it’s obviously better resourced to quickly and effectively consider the need for an investigation and to conduct that investigation into any alleged corruption if that is required. I might say that in addition to the observation that ACLEI is clearly the best placed body to consider these allegations I would also offer the observation that a Parliamentary Committee of the type that you now seek to have formed is totally ill-equipped to deal with an inquiry of the nature that your envisage or that may be required in a matter of this type. And I’d also offer the observation that it would be significantly detrimental to have some form of Parliamentary inquiry running parallel to a potential ACLEI inquiry. There would be very likely significant legal issues and risks that could arise for any witnesses called before both hearings. And in fact a Parliamentary Committee inquiry would likely cause enormous difficulties to the efficacious running of ACLEI’S inquiry if they determined to undertake one. I would also note that if ACLEI uncovered conduct by any other public service officers outside those determined in its remit as law enforcement officers or indeed civilians or employees of a commercial organisation who do not fall within ACLEI’s jurisdiction, ACLEI can of course refer that information, and further allegations, to the AFP for further investigation. Now I just note as these allegations have now earlier today already been referred to ACLEI under the section of Act that I have nominated, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage. Here is Christian Porter’s official statement on why the government is not supporting the cross bench push for a parliamentary inquiry into Crown: The Government is not intending to support the motion and I will explain in detail. Obviously it is the case Mr Deputy Speaker that the Australian Government takes all allegations of illegal activity very seriously. Everyone must abide by the Australian law and that is particularly the case for any members of our law enforcement, our immigration or our customs authorities. They, of course, as part of the broader Australian law enforcement community hold very privileged positions and as such are expected to uphold the highest standards of integrity and professionalism at all times. A strong integrity and professional standards culture is fundamental to public confidence in our work and the Australian Government’s work. I have considered the allegations that have been raised in media reporting and particularly as they touch upon allegations which are either directly relatable to, or tangentially relatable to, Commonwealth officers. It is my view that there are sufficient concerns raised at least to warrant further investigations. Now I might note for the benefit of Members that were speaking to this motion that saying that there are sufficient concerns to warrant me as Attorney-General to refer this matter for consideration under section 18 of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006, is not to say that I have before me, or that there is any obvious evidence otherwise available that supports allegations against law enforcement, immigration or customs authorities. Rather it is the case that s18 of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act might be called a precautionary referral provision and I have already enacted that provision earlier today. So i can inform the House that I have already referred this matter, these allegations, to the Australian Commissioner for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI), under section 18 of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006. And under that referral provision it would now become open for ACLEI to decide whether or not to launch an investigation or indeed if they determined not to, that would be a matter which they would need to inform me as to what it was that they considered was appropriate and if it was no further action they would need to advise me of that and obviously that is advice that I would relay publicly. Kim Carr is unhappy. Pretty interesting ructions in today’s Labor caucus meeting, particularly in light of the podcast interview we published at the weekend, which involved Anthony Albanese outlining Labor’s strategy in this parliament (a strategy that has been dubbed “bitch and fold” in our office). The former Labor frontbencher Kim Carr expressed strong objections during today’s meeting about the potential for Labor to vote against its own platform when considering an upcoming piece of legislation which gives effect to some of the recommendations from the royal commission set up by the former Labor prime minister, Julia Gillard. The bill deals with combating child sexual exploitation and includes mandatory sentencing for some offences, including (I gather), possession of child-like sex dolls. The recommendation to today’s caucus meeting was the legislation be not opposed in the House, and the shadow cabinet to determine a final position after a Senate inquiry reports back. According to people at today’s meeting, the relevant shadow minister, Kristina Keneally, telegraphed to colleagues that Labor might end up supporting the proposal, despite it containing mandatory sentencing provisions. Labor opposes mandatory sentencing in its federal policy platform. At that point, Carr rose in high dudgeon. He asked why Labor would support legislation contrary to the party’s platform. He also wanted to know what the argument was for folding on the legislation if Labor proposed amendments that were ultimately unsuccessful. A lively conversation ensued. Various shadow ministers spoke in favour of the recommendation, including, I’m told, Joel Fitzgibbon, who said Labor shouldn’t be guided exclusively by the platform. Again, according to the accounts I’ve been given, the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, spoke in favour of the recommendation, but also expressed opposition to mandatory sentencing as a principle. Separately to that, Albanese took caucus members through a very similar conversation to the one he and I had in the podcast. He told MPs Labor was in a very similar position to where it washed up after the 2004 election (when John Howard gained control of the Senate after Mark Latham crashed out in the contest). He told colleagues there was now a conservative majority in the Senate, and the government would succeed in getting most of its agenda through. He said it would be a regular event in this parliament – situations like the tax package, where Labor tried to amend the package but ultimately did not vote against it because the government already had the numbers. It’s fair to say Carr’s objections today were both objections of principle and a proxy for disquiet within Labor about the post-election repositioning under way. Andrew Probyn: Do you take personal responsibility for the loss? Bill Shorten: That’s why I stood down, absolutely. You have to take some responsibility. But I came here to talk about robodebt ... AP: Before we move on, can I just ask, now that you have referenced the fact that Labor is going through a review. Do you acknowledge that there is a difference between the merit of policies that you took to the election and perhaps the mistakes made in the messaging? BS: Oh, listen, I think you are a formidable interviewer, but what I am not going to do is preempt the review. AP: Are you in politics for the long haul? BS: I love being in politics; it’s a chance to make a difference. I love being part of a united team. I am very grateful to the voters in my electorate for giving me another term. AP: Is a really credible to ditch policies you have held for so long? BS: The party is reviewing the whole election and what I am going to do is give time for that process to happen. While I am a very staunch defender of the ABC, I am very alarmed with the cuts that have happened to the ABC. [But I will not be pre-empting the review.] AP: Do you have any resentments, finally? BS: No. I am very privileged to be very fortunate. On Labor’s election loss, Bill Shorten says he takes responsibility and that is why he stood down as leader: Andrew Probyn: You haven’t done much media since the election, so thank you for joining us today. The Coalition thought you would win on 18 May. What sort of grieving process do you go through when you experience something so deeply personal like that? Bill Shorten: Well, it was very disappointing. Very, very disappointing. AP: It was more than that, wasn’t it? BS: Very disappointing for the nation, for the people who voted for Labor, and very disappointing personally, but I have had some time off with the family, I am still in parliament and I have had the chance to hold the government to account and work for the opposition. You have got to move on; the party is going to have a review and we will see what comes out of that, but in the meantime I am very grateful to the united team who supported me for the success and the millions of people who voted for Labor. We will learn the lessons and be a very diligent and united opposition. AP: On the personal shock, though, what sort of grief process do you go through when there is such a grand expectation that you are going to be the next prime minister? BS: Oh, listen, it’s happened. What I have been able to do is reconnect with my family, and that is a silver lining. And to the millions of Australians who voted Labor, Labor will still be a very determined opposition and we will still keep advocating our values that plenty of people wanted to vote for us, and we will have to learn our lessons which is why the party is engaging in a very extensive review. AP: Did you find any comfort in the fact that the election was relatively close? BS: It was very disappointing. Just plainly, very disappointing, and disappointing for me, and I think disappointing for a lot of people, but nonetheless it has happened, that’s the democracy, as I said on the night. The people have expressed their view so we need to move on and be the best possible opposition. It’s a privilege to serve in parliament. I understand that and I have still got the fire for parliament and making sure that a work as a united team. Bill Shorten is prosecuting the robodebt issue in his interview with Andrew Probyn on the ABC: The robodebt system is causing untold hardship. It’s seriously malfunctioning. Did you know that over 100,000 of our fellow Australians have received incorrect demands to pay debts to government that they didn’t owe? It is causing unnecessary distress, and the government needs to go back to the drawing board. It’s not that people shouldn’t pay money they owe the government, but just relying on algorithms and automated systems, taking up the human factor, just giving people a number without asking how it has been arrived at. Asking people to find financial records [from] 20 years ago, it’s causing too much hardship and unfairness.” How to recoup over payments? If you make 100,000 mistakes, I think time is up, isn’t it? One of the social institutes who researches this matter has an alarming statistic, that 429 people under the age of 35 after getting robodebts have died. This is a problem, and it is not the job of government to intimidate and harass its own citizens, especially when they won’t even explain, when people get this letter of demand from the government, how the number has been arrived at.” I think, given this, you can also expect to see Bill Shorten make his 46th parliament question time debut. It sounds like the joint party room was very much about everyone in the government needing to demonstrate that “they are on your side”. Zali Steggall is also speaking in favour of the parliament launching its own inquiry. If the government and Labor are opposing this in the House, there is a stronger chance than me drinking all of the mimosas a drag queen can hand me this weekend (which is a very strong chance) that both will oppose this in the Senate as well, meaning a parliamentary inquiry will be dead in the water – for the moment. Witness K was in court today Adam Bandt is on his feet and he is QUITE cranky over the government and Labor refusal to back the parliamentary inquiry. He says the parliament is running “a protection racket for ministers and former ministers with connections to Crown casino”. Mark Dreyfus says Labor will also oppose the parliamentary inquiry, given the referral to the law enforcement integrity commissioner. Christian Porter is responding to crossbench calls for an inquiry. He says he has referred the allegations to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, which he says is the correct place for the inquiry to take place. The government will not support a parliamentary inquiry. The commission will look at the referral and decide whether to hold an inquiry or not. Porter says it would be counterproductive and potentially damaging to any ACLEI investigation. Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie is seconding the motion Andrew Wilkie has put forward. Andrew Wilkie is detailing whistleblower claims, told to his staff in interviews, which level further allegations against Crown casino. Given the content, I’ll wait until I have a proper transcript of what he has said, but it is hard to see how there won’t be an inquiry into this. Christian Porter’s office has just sent out an alert saying the attorney general will make a statement on the Crown issue in the House as soon as Andrew Wilkie has finished speaking. He is in the chamber having a chat to Tony Burke from the looks of things. This follows the Nine network and newspapers reporting into Crown and its dealings. The Greens are trying for one in the Senate, but Andrew Wilkie is trying to get an inquiry into Crown in the House. Just on that last post: if only there was some form of mechanism – almost like a national energy guarantee – which could potentially take the best of both worlds and set this country up with an energy policy for the first time in a decade. You could even give it some naff name, like “the Neg” to make it easy to talk about. And if only there was some sort of minister who could lead the way in talking to the states about energy ... but that would take the federal energy minister actually calling the other energy ministers in the council of Australian governments together for a meeting in some sort of energy Coag, and he seems a bit busy at the moment. The energy Coag, which is meant to meet twice a year, has been delayed, and there is no word on when it will be held. Because Angus Taylor wasn’t facing enough pressure elsewhere: the New South Wales energy minister, Matt Kean, has again raised the spectre of the national energy guarantee, the policy the federal Coalition dumped along with Malcolm Turnbull’s prime ministership. In a speech to the Clean Energy Council summit in Sydney, Kean said the Berejiklian government still hoped for a national climate and energy policy but may take matters into its own hands if its federal counterparts refused to take action. The NSW government still supports the national energy guarantee and will continue to support a national mechanism that integrates climate and energy policy. As I’ve said before, if the commonwealth won’t get on board NSW will consider going it alone.” Acknowledging competition in clean energy development is global, Kean said NSW wanted to be the easiest jurisdiction in the OECD for energy construction. He said the state had $26bn in renewable plants at various stages of development. It has doubled its large-scale clean energy capacity in just 14 months. The Greens will hold a press conference at 1pm as the MPs attempt to get support for an inquiry into Crown casino’s dealings. All this press release from Catherine King means is that we will all have more Michael McCormack “congestion-busting” mangling to endure in question time. Don’t say you haven’t been warned. Australians are spending on average 4.5 hours a week getting to and from work, a rise of 23% since 2002. The data revealed in the latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey, shows that average weekly travel times to and from work rose from 3.7 hours to 4.5 hours. While Australians are struggling with ever-increasing commute times the Morrison government refuses to bring forward infrastructure investment needed to bust congestion. Commuters in Sydney are experiencing a massive 71-minute average journey to and from work each day, while Melburnians are spending an average of 65 minutes. Australians living outside our capital cities fare no better, with huge blowouts in average daily commute times across the regions. More Australians are facing longer commutes, with one in six Australians travelling more than two hours to and from work, up from one in eight in 2002.” One of my side gigs is being ever vigilant to the ways of the emu, given they did in fact, defeat our army. I regret to inform you that the scouts are back. When will our politicians deal with the *real* issues? * *Yes, we will return to regular auspol programming immediately The bells are ringing, meaning the parliamentary day is officially about to get under way. In the Senate today, the Greens will be aiming to get a motion up to get an inquiry into the Crown issue, raised by the Nine network and newspapers, through the legal and constitutional affairs committee. No word on whether Labor or the crossbench will be supporting it as yet, but the Greens are “hopeful”. Remember how Andrew Colvin said the AFP didn’t even start the investigation into who leaked the medevac security advice to Simon Benson at the Oz because there was not a huge chance of success given how many people had access to the advice? Well, Josh Taylor reports, yeah, nah: More than 200 public servants were suspected of being the source of a Department of Home Affairs leak on apparent security risks in the medevac legislation, documents obtained by Guardian Australia reveal. The legislation, which passed parliament this year, facilitates the transfer of refugees from Manus and Nauru to Australia for medical treatment. While parliament was debating the bill in February, the Australian’s Simon Benson reported a classified ministerial briefing from Asio and Border Force that warned the bill would “undermine regional processing” and would “compromise Australia’s strong border protection regime”. The Department of Home Affairs asked Australian federal police to investigate the leak as a potential breach of the Crimes Act. Case notes for the referral to the AFP, obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws, reveal that the department was focused on two documents: a classified briefing prepared in December and an unclassified version of the briefing requested by the immigration minister, David Coleman. It looks like the MPs are starting to emerge from their party room meetings. Well that makes everything OK then. From Stuart Robert’s office: The first round of National Disability Insurance Scheme data has been released as part of the Morrison government’s commitment to demonstrate full transparency of the NDIS. Today the minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, Stuart Robert, released data collected directly from participants, their families and carers and providers. ‘The outcomes data collected by the National Disability Insurance Agency represents one of the largest surveys of those within the disability sector that has ever been conducted in Australia,’ Robert said. ‘Data on participant outcomes shows improvements across various domains including children’s development, community participation, personal relationships, and choice and control for people with disability since the NDIS began. ‘We will continue to release further data and I am committed to open information sharing which both guides and measures the progress of the NDIS, a world first and the largest social reform since Medicare. ‘As demonstrated with today’s release, the data will build a clear and accurate picture of what is working in the NDIS and what challenges we need to overcome to ensure long term outcomes for participants.’ All data released as part of the transparency agenda can be found on the NDIS website: https://www.ndis.gov.au/about-us/data-and-insights/. All of the shared data is subject to strict privacy controls so that individuals cannot be identified. The MPs are in their various party room meetings, which is why it has gone quiet. We’ll let you know what was discussed when they break. Kristina Keneally and Mark Dreyfus are picking up the attack on Peter Dutton. Ed Husic started this – he has been a rallying cry within the party room since the election to take the fight up to the home affairs minister, who, given his powers, is the most powerful minister in the government, outside the prime minister. And for a few days there – he was more powerful than the prime minister. Dutton is in the UK, talking all things Five Eyes, and so hasn’t been here to do the usual LABOR IS SOFT ON BORDERS routine, despite Labor having voted with the government on every single piece of national security legislation for years. But now, with a raft of new national security bills before the parliament, Labor seems to be speaking up about its concerns with legislation which largely has received a tick and flick the moment “national security” is mentioned. That hasn’t gone so great, as we have seen with the metadata consequences, raids on journalists and tech companies questioning their business in Australia. Keneally and Dreyfus though, are focused on Dutton: For the second week in a row, home affairs minister Peter Dutton has been caught out failing to have legislation in place to keep Australians safe. Last week we learned 40 so-called ‘jihadis’ were able to return to Australia unmanaged because Mr Dutton failed for four years to introduce a temporary exclusion order (TEO) scheme to control the return of foreign fighters. Now, Mr Dutton continues his pattern of mismanagement as the government seeks to resume debate in the House of Representatives on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Amendment (Sunsetting of Special Powers Relating to Terrorism Offences) Bill 2019. The home affairs minister’s embarrassing legislation seeks to extend Asio’s ‘questioning and detention warrant’ (QDW) power and ‘questioning warrant’ (QW) power which are both due to ‘sunset’ on 7 September 2019. This legislation can only be characterised as Mr Dutton admitting he has not done his job. Over the past three years, Asio itself, three independent national security legislation monitors, and the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security (PJCIS) have all said these powers are in need of reform. Mr Dutton has done nothing to reform these powers and now wants another year to do the work. This is especially concerning as Asio themselves have said the QW power needs to be reformed so that they can better protect Australia against espionage and foreign interference – something the head of Asio, Duncan Lewis, revealed over the weekend is at ‘an unprecedented level of activity’. Given Mr Dutton’s failure to do his work, Labor will seek to amend the government’s bill to give Mr Dutton three more months – rather than the additional 12 months he is asking for – to get on with the job. Labor’s amendments will also mean the QDW power, which has never been used since it was introduced in 2003, will sunset on 7 September 2019. Australia would be safer if Mr Dutton had spent more time working on national security and less time plotting to become prime minister.” The other issue ticking along today is the government’s request that the Asio powers, which allow the security agency to detain suspects for up to a week, and question them for up to 24 hours, without charge, be extended for another year. These powers have been in place since 9/11 now, so I think we can give up the pretence these are “temporary” powers now. The parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, which we just ignore now when we want, said last year it was time, once again, to review those powers. You will be shocked to learn that has not happened. So Labor, in its latest round of “we have concerns” about national security bills, wants the powers extended for just three months. This was Richard Marles this morning, on ABC radio: Well we’re going to be moving amendments today to reflect what has been put forward by the parliamentary joint committee. I mean, it’s not good enough that the minister essentially comes into the parliament looking at his shoes and announces that the dogs eaten his homework. We actually need the minister to come forward with a more modern regime in respect of Asio’s questioning powers ... The three months is an extension, so what we’re saying is we’ll give you an extension of three months not 12 – but, actually, do your job. Don’t come in here saying the dog ate your homework, actually do your job and come up with what should be a modern regime fit for purpose in 2019, rather than having Asio rely on a set of powers which date back to 2001 and have been significantly criticised by a whole range of parties since then.” If the government says no, will we see another #bitchnfold? Stay tuned. And given that we are talking about Stuart Robert again, just your semi-regular reminder that he has written a book called In the Footsteps of Jesus and his Amazon “about the author” is a book in itself. Stuart currently serves his nation as a member of the Australian parliament representing the northern Gold Coast electorate of Fadden in the House of Representatives, a seat he has held since 2007. He has been a minister of state, serving at different times as the assistant minister for defence, the minister for veterans’ affairs, minister for human services and the minister assisting the prime minister for the centenary of Anzac. Prior to entering parliament, he co-owned a medium-sized information technology company that was twice named as one of the fastest growing 100 companies in Australia. He previously served in the Australian army for 12 years as an infantry and intelligence corps officer and is a graduate of the Australian Defence Force Academy and a top 10 graduate of the Royal Military College Duntroon. He saw operational service in 1998 on the PNG island of Bougainville following the devastating civil war. He was a founding director of Watoto Australia and a member of the Watoto International board. Based in Uganda, Watoto operates the world’s largest non-institutional orphan care program and is now exporting this program globally. He holds a masters in business administration, masters in information technology and a bachelor of arts (hons). Stuart’s previous books include Hope the Watoto Journey and The trial of Lieutenant General Hiroshi Tamura: a question of command responsibility. He is married to his beautiful wife Chantelle and has three sons. He loves four-wheel driving with his family, paragliding, learning Chinese, playing the piano and serving in his local church. Anthony Albanese also says Labor won’t be letting the Angus Taylor matter dropped. Asked why the opposition didn’t pursue the Nine Crown revelations in question time yesterday, the Labor leader had this to say: We’ll set our own priorities for question time, and yesterday we had the ongoing scandal around Angus Taylor that we’ve concentrated on. I mean, Angus Taylor’s circumstances just don’t add up. You have circumstances whereby he says he made representations on behalf of local farmers, but he can’t produce a single letter or a single email. All he can say is: he ran into a bloke in Yass and had a chat. This is absurd. We know, also, from the documents that have been produced, that they were concerned about land clearing on one particular farm being a breach of the EPBC Act. So that’s why we asked: “Was that farm the one connected with Jam Land?” Angus Taylor has so many questions to answer. He stood up in parliament yesterday and gave a statement that was incomplete, that didn’t satisfy anyone. And no wonder, he sits on the frontbench there with his colleagues inching away from him, further and further, so they’re not in the shot. The person who is in the gun on this issue is Angus Taylor. He has real questions to answer and we’ll continue to pursue these issues. This is a very serious abuse of power by a minister in a government that abuses power all the time. Bill Shorten isn’t speaking on it, on camera. At least not yet. I think you can probably guess why. So instead Jim Chalmers was sent out to doors this morning, to push Labor’s case on why it should go: The system is ruining people’s lives. Robodebt has been a shambles from the beginning. The Morrison government needs to take responsibility for the fact that we’ve seen revelations about the woeful, shameful pursuit of some of the most vulnerable people in our community. This government has form when it comes to cracking down on the most vulnerable people in Australia. Robodebt hasn’t worked. It isn’t working. And the government’s incompetence is ruining people’s lives when they’re at their most vulnerable. Anthony Albanese also had some things to say about it this morning: The government’s ongoing robodebt scandal means that this system should be scrapped. You now have circumstances whereby they’re sending debt notices to the families of dead people. This is not on. One hundred per cent of my local constituency [who] came to my office with robodebt concerns and had their debts either fully scrapped, or reduced. One hundred per cent were mistakes. The fact is, that this is a scam from the government in order to try to get money from people who don’t actually owe that money. I’ve got an idea for the government: why don’t they actually employ some humans to relate to other humans on Human Services, on service delivery? Instead, they have attacked people – set up a system of robodebt which is having disastrous consequences. It’s putting real pressure on families. Shorten’s statement continues: It is not just Bruce McCardel’s mum Anastasia. Every day brings another robodebt horror story. There is Norm Austwick, a recently widowed 79-year-old who was hounded for $67.55 from last century (1998) that he never actually owed. We have a government minister contradicting a member of her department and the Townsville Community Legal Centre in denying robodebt has been unleashed in flood-ravaged Townsville. There is that disturbing statistic from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare where at least 429 Australians under 35 have died after receiving a robodebt notice. Lawyers for the Department of Human Services admitted in court on Friday the government agency got it “wrong” as the legality of the whole robodebt scheme faces scrutiny in two federal court actions. Robodebt is inaccurate, harsh and unfair. It is a system that is malfunctioning and the minister needs to go back to the drawing board. He should no longer ignore the trail of human heartache that is occurring in robodebt’s wake. But ... Labor has spoken out, for the first time, against robodebt. Bill Shorten, who heads up the shadow portfolio which takes it in, says it has so “seriously malfunctioned” it “must be scrapped”. Bill Shorten’s statement: Revelations from a mourning mother that her disability pensioner son continued to be hounded over an alleged debt even after his death should shame government services minister Stuart Robert to finally act and address the problems at the heart of this scheme. We recognise the right of government to recoup legitimate debts that are owed. But robodebt is not that, it is a mess: • It is inaccurate: the computerised calculation is claiming false debts that when challenged have led to more than 100,000 claims being changed. (The inaccuracies not only relate to the amount of money owed but have extended to clients’ student histories.) • The operation of that computerised calculation has little to no human oversight. Centrelink officers act to enforce the debt number but apparently do not check that it is correct. • Recipients of debt notices are given no evidence or detail of how the figure claimed is arrived at. • The onus of proof is reversed meaning recipients must prove they do not owe the amount of money being claimed. (With many of the debts claimed several years old this can be a painstaking and torturous process of trying to obtain historical statements from banks.) The minister will not concede any of this is a problem. Yet robodebt is not just inaccurate. It is being enforced in a harsh and cruel way and we now know it is being driven from above. The ABC’s 7.30 Report has revealed Centrelink compliance officers are being pushed on their “daily targets” and “individual and team performance”. It is increasingly clear that this government intends to balance the books on the backs of some of our most needy and vulnerable people. This, last night, did not go well for Stuart Robert. Robert is not the strongest media performer on his best day. Put him against someone with Laura Tingle’s experience and, well, it’s sort of like watching a reality TV star go up against Beyoncé. That shiz is never going to end well. Labor, after their shellacking in coal country – Queensland and the Hunter region included – are partway through the “we should have spoken up more in defence of coal” stage, led by Joel Fitzgibbon, who has done many a mea culpa on the issue. In the Parliamentary Friends of Australian Coal Exports, both Craig Kelly and his co-chair want to celebrate the $68bn in export revenue in the last financial year – which is 208m tonnes of thermal coal and 179m tonnes of metallurgical coal. In terms of jobs though, coalmining is not the mecca it is often held up as – the latest Labour Force Survey showed that in the four quarters to February this year 52,600 people were employed by the coal industry. In coalmining, for the last financial year, it was just over 38,000. Remember this? It’s happening. Craig Kelly has sent out an email invite to colleagues, inviting “all senators and members to join and celebrate the invaluable contribution that Australian coal exports make to our nation” with co-chair, Joel Fitzgibbon. Those wanting to join, just have to email Kelly “and simply say ‘I’m in’.” Cool beans. As the government, led by Christian Porter, begins whirring up to get the ensuring integrity bill up (short title: unions are terrible), the union movement is starting to speak up against the bill – louder. The ACTU president, Michele O’Neil, told ABC radio this morning that John Setka, the government’s poster child for why this bill is necessary (even though it is is not retrospective and wouldn’t actually impact him), is not representative of the entire union movement: This bill is not about one person and not about one union as much as the government wants to hammer that issue ... It’s like ... anything when we find anything that’s wrong with the behaviour of one company or one individual, that every company or individual should be treated the same. Centre Alliance wants the bill expanded to cover private organisations as well, not just the union movement. Jacqui Lambie has said she wants Setka out, but has some concerns about the legislation. So Porter, who now seems to be the busiest person in the government, has some work to do. Bet he is THRILLED. Less than 24 hours after Jim Chalmers asked Josh Frydenberg in question time how many recommendations from the banking royal commission had been legislated (spoiler: not many) we get this from Frydenberg’s office: The Coalition government has today released exposure draft legislation that extends the unfair contract term (UCT) regime to insurance contracts. Recommendation 4.7 of the royal commission into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry recommended extending the application of the unfair contract terms regime to insurance contracts. In the government’s response to the royal commission it agreed to implement this recommendation. Consumer law currently protects consumers against unfair contract terms that: • would cause a significant imbalance in their rights and obligations under a contract • are not reasonably necessary to protect the business, and • would cause detriment (financial or otherwise) to a consumer. In his final report, commissioner Hayne observed the considerations that render a UCT regime appropriate for other contracts of financial products and services apply equally to insurance contracts, and there was no reason for the current exemption for insurance contracts to continue. Removing the exemption for insurance contracts from the UCT regime will ensure consumers and small businesses have the same protections regardless of which financial service or product they are purchasing. The government is taking action on all 76 recommendations contained in the final report of the royal commission and will continue to take the necessary steps to restore trust in Australia’s financial system. Just a day after the prime minister declared he would not engage in “unfunded empathy” the latest Hilda survey finds poverty in Australia has continued to increase – and welfare is a pretty big factor. As Luke Henriques-Gomes reports: Poverty in Australia is increasing again after several years of decline, a respected University of Melbourne study has found, with changes to welfare policies cited as a possible contributor. The annual Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey, released on Tuesday, found the proportion of people living below the relative poverty line – 50% of the median income – increased in 2017, from 9.6% to 10.4%. Poverty rates also rose using the lower “anchored” measure in both 2016 and 2017. Researchers said the trend was likely caused by the “tightening of the screws” of the welfare system, which has seen many Australians moved off higher pension benefits and on to the Newstart allowance. But it is not in the government’s plan to raise Newstart. Even with, Barnaby Joyce’s motivations aside, pressure is mounting within the Coalition. So the deputy prime minister wants you to just “move”. Others, in some of the richest electorates, like Wentworth, are asking you to consider the cost to the budget. But like climate change, so often the cost of not doing anything is even worse. The Hilda survey will see the focus stay on Newstart – and for the reasons it should – not because a politician’s six-figure salary is less than their previous six-figure salary, but because it is too low to live on. It’s cruel. We’ll bring you that and everything else which happens today. It’s party room and caucus day, so you’ll have that as well. Mike Bowers will be making his way through the hallways, and you’ll have access to Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp as well. Someone needs to bring me a coffee. Ready? Let’s get into it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/may/10/barack-obama-nuclear-weapons-enola-gay-hiroshima","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-10T19:42:41Z","webTitle":"Enola Gay is a museum piece, unlike the nuclear arms Obama hoped to eradicate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/10/barack-obama-nuclear-weapons-enola-gay-hiroshima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/may/10/barack-obama-nuclear-weapons-enola-gay-hiroshima","fields":{"headline":"Enola Gay is a museum piece, unlike the nuclear arms Obama hoped to eradicate","bodyText":"In a quiet hangar outside Washington, the Enola Gay still gleams as if the B-29 Superfortress that dropped the first atomic bomb in anger rolled off the production line yesterday. Despite his announcing a historic visit to the site that its payload devastated in Japan, Barack Obama’s legacy as the president who would consign all such weapons to the museum looks rather more tarnished. The White House hopes that his trip to Hiroshima – the first by a serving US president – will reaffirm a “personal commitment to pursue the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons”. “The United States has a special responsibility to continue to lead in pursuit of that objective as we are the only nation to have used a nuclear weapon,” wrote his national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, on Tuesday in a statement accompanying news of Obama’s May visit. But the most remarkable thing about such language is how closely it echoes the unmet promises of a fresher-faced Obama seven years ago in Prague when he first announced that his presidency would demonstrate “America’s commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons”. “As the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon, the United States has a moral responsibility to act. We cannot succeed in this endeavor alone, but we can lead it, we can start it,” he said, six months before receiving the Nobel peace prize, in part for the promise of disarmament. Presidential aides may hope that the visits to Prague and Hiroshima – at either end of his time in office – will look like bookends of a consistent, if admittedly so far inconclusive, strategy. Critics may wonder what happened to all the chapters in between. Perhaps the clearest sign of how little progress has been made toward the promises of Prague came last month when the White House concluded its fourth and final nuclear security summit in Washington without the attendance of Russia, which is thought to have the world’s largest stockpile of such weapons. Though some 50 countries attended, little meaningful progress was possible without the two former cold war enemies in control of 90% of the world’s arsenal agreeing to lead the way. The deterioration of relations between Moscow and Washington over the course of Vladimir Putin and Obama’s presidencies has also complicated efforts to persuade other countries to abandon their own nuclear ambitions. One of the few countries to have voluntarily relinquished its nuclear power status, Ukraine, received a rude awakening when the US and its western allies were unable to act on promises to guarantee its security in return after Russian-backed land seizures in Crimea and eastern border regions. Similarly, Obama’s efforts to deter the use of other weapons of mass destruction arguably went backwards rather than forwards when Syria’s use of chemical weapons crossed a White House-designated “red line” without punishment. US officials point to progress too, of course. With Russian help, Syria was later encouraged to give up its chemical weapons stockpile. Iran also agreed to a US- and Russian-led plan to limits its potential to develop nuclear weapons. But for every step forward over the past seven years, there have been at least as many back, with North Korea setting the most extreme example of a country willing to flout all international pressure to curtail its nuclear weapons capability. Donald Trump recently alarmed observers around the world by stressing America’s willingness to use its own arsenal if necessary and suggesting Japan and South Korea might be encouraged to handle their own nuclear defense in the future rather than sheltering beneath a US-led military umbrella. The belligerence of Putin and Trump represent developments hard to imagine in 2009 and Obama never claimed it was going to be easy; merely that there was a moral imperative to try. “Some argue that the spread of these weapons cannot be stopped, cannot be checked – that we are destined to live in a world where more nations and more people possess the ultimate tools of destruction,” he told the audience in Prague. “Such fatalism is a deadly adversary, for if we believe that the spread of nuclear weapons is inevitable, then in some way we are admitting to ourselves that the use of nuclear weapons is inevitable.” But the notable thing about ending his presidency with a trip to Hiroshima is that the president is already ruling out any sort of apology for dropping Little Boy, the 15 kiloton weapon dropped on 6 August 1945, killing an estimated 135,000 people. “The United States will be eternally proud of our civilian leaders and the men and women of our armed forces who served in World War II for their sacrifice at a time of maximum peril to our country and our world,” stressed Rhodes. “Their cause was just, and we owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude.” Even this visit to pay respects was far from certain either. For weeks now, the White House has refused to comment on speculation about whether it would be part of Obama’s trip to Japan – ducking questions during recent trips to London and Havana. The decision to stress that there will be no apology for the tactics of the second world war suggests sensitivity to Republican jibes that Obama apologises for America too much. It certainly fits in with the agreed narrative that surrounds the Enola Gay, in its final resting place at the National Air and Space Museum. The immaculately maintained B-29 sits surrounded by some of America’s most triumphant engineering accomplishments, from the space shuttle to the jumbo jet, in a hangar on the outskirts of Dulles airport. But on the morning of the White House Hiroshima announcement, few seemed aware of its contemporary resonance and the exhibit was all but deserted. “Unfortunately, in wars bad things happen,” explained a passing docent to a party of young schoolchildren. “At least this plane stopped more bad things happening,” he added, before spending more time explaining how the plane was named after the mother of its captain than what it did. Others gawping up at the giant plane were surprised that the symbolic healing of a presidential visit to Hiroshima hadn’t already happened. “It seems the right thing to do,” concluded Brandon Wilson, a 19-year-old student visiting from California. “It’s been a long time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jan/11/drones-terrorist-attacks-security-thinktank","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-11T00:01:32Z","webTitle":"UK should prepare for use of drones in terrorist attacks, says thinktank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/11/drones-terrorist-attacks-security-thinktank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jan/11/drones-terrorist-attacks-security-thinktank","fields":{"headline":"UK should prepare for use of drones in terrorist attacks, says thinktank","bodyText":"Commercially available drones have the potential to be converted into flying bombs capable of hitting targets such as nuclear power stations or the prime minister’s car, a report by a security thinktank has warned. “Drones are a game changer in the wrong hands,” warns the lead author of the report by the Oxford Research Group’s Remote Control project. The report, The Hostile Use of Drones by Non-State Actors Against British Targets, highlights concerns that “drones will be used as simple, affordable and effective airborne improvised explosive devices”. It lists a range of potential targets including foreign embassies, nuclear power stations, a G7 summit or the prime minister’s car. “The UK government, police, military and security services will need to introduce countermeasures to reduce or mitigate the risk of commercially available drones being used for attack,” it reads. Recommended countermeasures include licensing drones, laser systems to protect targets, radio-frequency jammers, and clear guidance for the police and the army to shoot down hostile drones. The study analysed more than 200 drones available to buy on the high street or on the internet and warns many are capable of being converted to deliver an explosive payload. It also warns that the dangerous capabilities of drones are increasing and yet they are already being used by terrorists and activists. “The technology of remote-control warfare is impossible to control,” the report says. It notes: “Islamic State [Isis] is reportedly obsessed with launching a synchronised multi-drone attack on large numbers of people in order to recreate the horrors of 9/11.” The report points out that Isis is already using drones for reconnaissance in Iraq and Syria. It also cites a number of recent examples of unauthorised use of drones that “suggest scenarios for future lone wolf attacks”. These include: Anti-nuclear activist landing a drone containing radioactive sand on the Japanese prime minister’s office in April 2015. Albanian activists disrupting an international football match against Serbia by flying a drone with an Albanian flag over the match. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah violating Israeli airspace with drones, part of a fleet of an estimated 200 unmanned aerial vehicles. Chris Abbott, the lead author of the report and visiting research fellow at Bradford University’s School of Social and International Studies, said: “The use of drones for surveillance and attack is no longer the purview of state militaries alone. A range of terrorist, insurgent, criminal, corporate and activist groups have already shown their desire and ability to use drones against British targets.” He added: “Drones are a game changer in the wrong hands. The government needs to take this threat seriously and commit to a range of countermeasures that still allow for legitimate commercial and personal use.” • The headline on this article was amended on 11 January 2016 .

Washington also pulled out military personnel who had been dispatched to work with their Russian counterparts to mount joint bombing operations against Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS, formerly Nusra Front) extremist groups. A few hours earlier, Moscow declared military contacts with the US had also stopped and Vladimir Putin suspended a six-year agreement with Washington on the reduction of military stocks of plutonium, as the bitter differences over Syria and Ukraine continued to drive a downward spiral in the US-Russian relationship. Two waves of airstrikes struck eastern Aleppo’s M10 hospital, one of the last three functioning major hospitals in the east of the city. The first strike hit the hospital on Monday morning, killing seven people and leaving a large hole near the entrance. It was still reported to be functioning until a second strike in the early evening, when rescue workers were still at the scene. The hospital had already been struck from the air on Saturday and workmen were repairing the damage at the time of the first strike on Monday. On Sunday, Syrian or Russian aircraft targeted an underground hospital in an opposition area north of Hama. Reports from the city said that no one had been killed in the attack on the hospital which is tunnelled into the side of a mountain, but powerful bombs, possibly bunker-busters designed to destroy buried or hardened targets, wrecked the emergency ward, brought down interior ceilings, crumbled cement walls and destroyed generators. “The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. This is not a decision that was taken lightly,” the state department spokesman, John Kirby, said, referring to the truce agreed by the US and Russia on 9 September which collapsed in less than a week, after Bashar al-Assad’s government forces declared they were no longer bound by it. Kirby said Russia had “failed to live up to its own commitments” and failed to rein in its ally, Assad’s regime in Damascus. “Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course, inconsistent with the cessation of hostilities, as demonstrated by their intensified attacks against civilian areas, targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need,” Kirby added, and singled out a 19 September attack on a UN aid convoy to a rebel-held area in the Aleppo countryside, in which British and US officials have alleged Russian aircraft took part. Under the 9 September truce deal, Russian and US diplomats in Geneva would have coordinated implementation. The American diplomats have now been recalled. The US also declared it was calling back military officials who had been deployed to take part in a “joint implementation centre”. If the ceasefire had lasted a week, the US-Russian centre would have planned and coordinated an air campaign targeting Isis and JFS, which both countries agree are terrorist groups. However, Kirby said that military coordination with Russia would continue, “to ensure the safety of our respective military personnel and enable the fight against Daesh [Isis]”. Before the state department announcement on Monday, a Russian deputy foreign minister, Gennady Gatilov, said even those military exchanges had dried up. “All contacts between the military have been stopped of late, there has been no exchange of information,” Gatilov said. Moscow has blamed US-backed Syrian opposition groups for failing to separate themselves from JFS on frontlines and for flouting the truce with attacks on Syrian army positions. France circulated a draft security council resolution expressing outrage at the bombing of the 275,000-strong population of eastern Aleppo and calling for a restoration of the ceasefire “including an end to all aerial bombardments as well as the provision of immediate, safe and unhindered humanitarian access”, according to the draft text seen by the Guardian. Russia has agreed to consider the resolution but says it has reservations about parts of it. Western diplomats say they expect a very tough battle over the resolution but argue the alternative is security council silence on the horrors of Syria. The French ambassador to the UN, François Delattre, said: “We of course don’t give up, you will not be surprised. We considered that this is our responsibility to do absolutely everything we can, everything humanly possible, to try to unite the security council behind our efforts to end the martyrdom in Aleppo.” Also on Monday, Vladimir Putin announced that Moscow was pulling out of a 2000 arms control deal with the US under which both countries were supposed to reduce their stocks of weapons-grade plutonium. Putin had complained earlier this year that the US had not been keeping its end of the bargain, after work fell behind on a plant that had been designed to convert US plutonium to fuel for nuclear power stations. However, announcing his decision yesterday, the Kremlin blamed “unfriendly acts” by the US. As conditions for returning to the treaty, Moscow said the US would have to lift sanctions imposed on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine, pay compensation for those sanctions, and to reduce US troop presence in eastern Europe to its level in 2000."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/27/british-windfarms-boom-dong-energy-danish-firm","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-27T16:04:16Z","webTitle":"British windfarms a boom for Danish firm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/27/british-windfarms-boom-dong-energy-danish-firm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/27/british-windfarms-boom-dong-energy-danish-firm","fields":{"headline":"British windfarms prove a boom for Danish firm","bodyText":"Booming profits from British windfarms have more than made up for declining oil and gas revenues at Dong Energy, a state-owned Danish utility which says it is transforming itself from a high to low-carbon power producer. Dong, the biggest single investor in UK offshore wind projects, including the huge London Array windfarm off Kent, reported first-quarter profits of Kr 8bn (£836m), a sum that was up 35% on the same period last year. Henrik Poulsen, Dong’s chief executive, said the move from fossil fuels to renewable energy was gathering speed with no more spending planned for new oil projects not already begun. “The world will continue to need fossil fuels for a quite a time yet but the bigger trend is towards renewables and this is probably accelerating,” he said. “We see ourselves as a leader in offshore wind and bioenergy.” Dong’s profits from renewables were Kr3bn, with Kr2bn from oil and gas, plus Kr1bn from the electricity grid system it operates in Denmark, the company reported. Earnings from renewables, mainly offshore wind, had risen by more than 50% but the group profits were also bolstered by almost Kr2bn of disposals. The group, which is 76% owned by the Danish state, promised to be listed on the stock market in Copenhagen within 12 months. JP Morgan and other investment banks have been hired to sell the stock. Dong, which employs 900 staff in Britain, has installed 2.2GW of its 5.1GW offshore windfarm capacity. The company has just taken a final investment decision on the Hornsea 1 facility off the coast of Yorkshire, which will be the largest offshore windfarm in the world when it is completed in 2020 at a cost, some analysts believe, of up to £3bn. Poulsen said he was confident that his company could reach UK government goals of bringing down costs, to survive comfortably on 15-year contracts at £85 per MW-hour by the mid 2020s. That would make it significantly cheaper to obtain power from new offshore windfarms than from the controversial new nuclear power station, Hinkley Point C, for which subsidies of £92.50 for 35 years had been promised. “I am sceptical of new nuclear,” said Poulsen. “The track record of new reactor projects in Finland and France is massive delays and budget overruns. The economics are doubtful and then there is the moral hazard of leaving nuclear waste for future generations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2015/jan/27/new-england-bears-brunt-snowstorm-thousands-without-power","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-27T14:54:34Z","webTitle":"New England bears brunt of snowstorm as thousands left without power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/27/new-england-bears-brunt-snowstorm-thousands-without-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2015/jan/27/new-england-bears-brunt-snowstorm-thousands-without-power","fields":{"headline":"New England bears brunt of snowstorm as thousands left without power","bodyText":"Snow drifts and whiteout conditions battered New England on Monday night and into Tuesday, especially parts of Massachusetts, where thousands were left without power and a high tide threatened coastal flooding. By Tuesday morning, thousands of people and a nuclear plant in Massachusetts reported power losses, according to Boston media. There were nearly 22,000 reported outages in the state, with South Shore, Cape Cod and Nantucket hit hardest, the Boston Globe reported. The National Weather Service measured 11.8in of snow at Boston’s Logan international airport, which will remain shut down through Wednesday. CBS Boston reported up to 24in of snowfall in Oxford and more than 29in in Shrewsbury. High winds were reported, including a gust of 78mph on Nantucket. A blizzard warning remained in effect in the area through Wednesday morning. And the Weather Channel is reporting that an additional 12in to 18in of snowfall is possible in parts of New England, especially Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. Massachusetts’ Emergency Management Agency (Mema) shut down the Pilgrim nuclear power plant in Plymouth “due to loss of offsite power”. On Twitter, officials from the plan assured residents, writing in all caps: “No public safety hazard.” The Massachusetts governor, Charlie Baker, declared a state of emergency on Monday and ordered a statewide travel ban beginning at midnight. The Boston public transport system and commuter rail lines were also closed at midnight and remained shut down on Tuesday. Boston’s public schools cancelled classes for Tuesday and Wednesday, the city announced. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Baker said despite the heavy snowfall, the night was relatively without incident in terms of accidents and injuries. “So far so good,” said Baker, who was managing his first snowstorm since being sworn in earlier this month. Meanwhile, New York and New Jersey groaned back to life after travel bans. Despite dire warnings of record-breaking blizzards, New York City saw just 4in to 6in of snow; La Guardia airport saw 11.5in. Long Island took the brunt of the snowfall, with 16in. Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, ordered all but the most essential government workers in his state home from Monday afternoon until Wednesday at the earliest. “Please stay home,” he said on Monday. New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, banned travel from 11pm on Monday for all but emergency vehicles on roads in 13 counties, including New York City, suburban Westchester and Long Island, with the threat of a $300 fine for violators. He also made the controversial decision to close the city’s subway system. On Tuesday morning, the governors lifted most of the travel bans in their states, with residents of only one county still under an emergency ban. Speaking at a press conference, Cuomo defended his decision to shut down the train service. “You act on the information that you had at the time … Obviously in this region there was less snow than anticipated,” he said. In all, the governors in six states had declared emergencies, but early on Tuesday weather forecasters began to speculate that they had got it badly wrong. “My deepest apologies to many key decision-makers and so many members of the general public,” tweeted Gary Szatkowski, a meteorologist in Mount Holly, New Jersey."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jul/09/trident-vote-to-be-held-in-parliament-announces-cameron","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-09T13:39:17Z","webTitle":"Trident vote to be held before the end of July, Cameron confirms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/09/trident-vote-to-be-held-in-parliament-announces-cameron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/09/trident-vote-to-be-held-in-parliament-announces-cameron","fields":{"headline":"Trident vote to be held before the end of July, Cameron confirms","bodyText":"David Cameron has announced a parliamentary vote on the renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent in just over a week, as he seeks to unite the feuding Conservative party and exploit divisions in Labour. The outgoing prime minister said the vote on replacing four ageing Vanguard submarines will take place on Monday 18 July before parliament breaks up for summer recess. He is pressing ahead even though his Conservative successor has not yet been chosen, as there is broad agreement within his party about renewal of Trident at a time of bitter infighting over Europe. The timing of the vote will also be seen as an attempt to highlight Labour’s split on the issue, as Jeremy Corbyn is against maintaining the nuclear deterrent while most of his party is in favour. It is certain to inflame tensions as Corbyn faces the prospect of a leadership challenge on Monday by Angela Eagle, the former shadow business secretary, who is in favour of renewing Trident. Speaking at a Nato summit in Warsaw, Poland, Cameron said: “Today, I can announce we will hold a parliamentary vote on 18 July to confirm members of parliament’s support for the renewal of four nuclear submarines capable of providing around-the-clock cover. “The nuclear deterrent remains essential in my view, not just to Britain’s security but as our allies have acknowledged here today the overall security of the Nato alliance. “While Britain may be leaving the EU, we are not withdrawing from the world. Nor are we turning our back on Europe or European security.” Asked about the timing, Cameron denied that he was holding it now to cause maximum pain to Labour. He stressed that holding the vote was a Conservative election manifesto pledge that the whole party could agree on. “We need to get on with that, we need certainty about it so investment decisions can go ahead,” he said. “So I think it makes sense to hold this vote, to hold this vote now, to put it beyond doubt so our military planners and investors can get on the investment that is needed. “That’s the reason for holding the vote. Obviously the whole Conservative party supports it, we stood on that manifesto, so I don’t think it would in any way get caught up in the leadership election.” Labour’s policy has in recent years been in favour of renewing Trident, as confirmed by its party conference. However, that stance was put under review by Corbyn, who appointed Emily Thornberry, who was the shadow defence secretary and is now the shadow foreign secretary, to look into the policy. This has led the Labour leadership to argue it no longer has a pro-Trident position, which may mean it allows a free vote on 18 July. Much of Corbyn’s new shadow cabinet, including the shadow defence secretary, Clive Lewis, are thought to be against Trident but many others in the parliamentary party are in favour. Reports on Friday suggested Labour’s defence review would ultimately leave open the option of retaining the UK’s nuclear deterrent despite Corbyn’s support for unilateral disarmament. BBC Newsnight said the review is expected to set five tests for the UK’s continued status as a nuclear power, including whether it makes a “demonstrable contribution” to the defence of the country and if it represents value for money. Corbyn told Sky News on Saturday: “We are having a look at all the issues surrounding it. I believe security in the world is achieved through peace, through democracy, through justice, through human rights. “I do not believe that nuclear weapons actually enhance security, I support the nuclear non-proliferation treaty – which we are signed up to – which is trying to bring together collective disarmament. Those are the views that I will be putting forward.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/jun/17/edf-senior-managers-hinkley-point-postpone-letter-mps-energy-committee","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-17T17:11:10Z","webTitle":"EDF’s top managers tell MPs that Hinkley Point should be postponed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/17/edf-senior-managers-hinkley-point-postpone-letter-mps-energy-committee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/jun/17/edf-senior-managers-hinkley-point-postpone-letter-mps-energy-committee","fields":{"headline":"EDF’s top managers tell MPs that Hinkley Point should be postponed","bodyText":"Senior managers at EDF have told MPs that they remain convinced that the French state-controlled group should postpone the Hinkley Point project until it has solved a litany of problems, including the reactor design and multibillion-euro lawsuits over delays on similar schemes. The letter from EDF managers to the UK parliament’s energy and climate change committee is the latest setback for the proposed £18bn nuclear plant, a flagship government energy policy that is intended to provide 7% of Britain’s electricity from about 2025, at a time when old coal and atomic plants are closing down. In April, the French company said it was delaying a final investment decision (FID) until September while it consulted with trade unions, but engineers and other middle managers appear to remain implacably opposed. A letter addressed to Angus MacNeil, the chairman of the committee, from the Fédération Nationale des Cadres Supérieurs de l’Énergie (FNCS) union “advises to delay the FID until better upfront industrial visibility is evidenced”. Outstanding problems highlighted by the senior managers at EDF include: Areva NP, the designer of the European pressurised reactor (EPR) planned for Somerset, “is currently facing a difficult situation”. The French nuclear safety authority (ASN) may not give the green light to the EPR being constructed at Flamanville in north-west France due to various anomalies. There may be “identical flaws” in an Areva EPR being built at Taishan 1 in China. The scandal over falsification of parts from Areva’s Le Creusot that potentially put safety checks at risk. Multibillion-euro litigation between Areva and the Finnish energy group TVO over delays to an EPR scheme at Olkiluoto remains unsettled. An EDF offer to purchase Areva expired on 31 March, leaving “governance uncertainties upon the implementation of the Hinkley Point C project”. Many of the problems have been raised by other unions inside EDF, such as the CGT, which are worried that EDF’s soaring debts and growing financial commitments are a danger to its future stability. But the letter from Norbert Tangy, the president of the FNCS, to MacNeil highlights once again the huge list of problems. Among others is concern expressed by the ASN at a hearing on 25 May that any resolution of EDF and Areva’s twin financial problems could take considerable time. The energy and climate change committee is investigating the financing of new nuclear plants and has twice called Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF’s British subsidiary, EDF Energy, to explain the delays at Hinkley. Earlier this week, Areva said it was splitting itself into three parts and isolating the financial commitments to its much-delayed and over-budget EPR project in Finland. Areva previously held a 10% equity stake in Hinkley, but this was relinquished last year, and the project is now owned by EDF and its Chinese partner, China General Nuclear Power Corporation. A spokeswoman for Areva, asked about the latest internal restructuring, was unable to say exactly when EDF will take over the Areva NP arm of the business, which oversees reactor designs. EDF Energy declined to comment on the letter to MacNeil, saying it would not be appropriate while a consultation of staff was under way. But De Rivaz told the committee in May: “The current position of some of the French trade unions is to postpone the project for two to three years. Our position is that there is no need for a delay because the project is ready.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2016/mar/14/science-and-democracy-a-peculiarly-british-disease","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-14T07:55:20Z","webTitle":"Science and democracy: a peculiarly British disease?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2016/mar/14/science-and-democracy-a-peculiarly-british-disease","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2016/mar/14/science-and-democracy-a-peculiarly-british-disease","fields":{"headline":"Science and democracy: a peculiarly British disease?","bodyText":"A couple of experiences with BBC radio last week gave me a bleak impression of the current state of UK politics around research and technology. On Wednesday, I was invited to appear on Radio 4’s Moral Maze. Recent calls by the Science Council for greater responsibility by scientists were framed as some kind of extremist effort to “choke off” science. The focus for the debate was that science is inherently morally and politically neutral – and so, effectively separate from democracy. I pointed out it is simply a reality that science is steered by social and political forces. I mentioned the military, as the largest single area for public investment in research. I referred to the general bias towards reductionist kinds of science yielding intellectual property. This profoundly shapes research in health and agriculture. These are moral and social issues deep inside science. I argued that denial of these ethical and political dimensions, leaves science vulnerable to whatever happen to be the strongest interests in any given field. Surely science is better steered in open and democratic ways, rather than covertly or unaccountably? Yet the reaction to this reasoned defence of pluralism, was that “people like you” are simply out to “choke off” “whatever you don’t approve of”. It seems that democracy itself is seen as the threat. This sinister implication chimed curiously with the second episode. This time, I was a listener to Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs – featuring the distinguished nuclear engineer and successful high-level lobbyist: Dame Sue Ion. Dame Sue is a great choice. The BBC should do all it can to remedy the marginal profile and abysmally poor gender balance within UK engineering. Nor is there any problem or surprise in engineers being strongly partisan about their favoured technologies. Passionate and pugnacious, Dame Sue was rightly introduced as an “evangelist” for nuclear power. Good luck to her! But what is going on when someone is introduced as an “evangelist” for their own technology, but then turned to as an arbiter of what the interviewer calls “stark scientific facts” about this same technology, in order to correct criticisms that are dismissed merely as “peoples’ prejudices”? This contradictory conjunction of professed evangelism and attributed disinterestedness is odd indeed. Would the BBC so easily grant this double accolade to an advocate of renewable energy…or non-GM farming? It seems only incumbent forms of science are afforded this privilege. The queries here go beyond the BBC. Fair coverage of energy issues can be rebalanced over a range of programmes. But what was the decision process by which a passionate nuclear evangelist was chosen for a flagship biographical programme specifically for the week of the fifth anniversary of Fukushima? The result seemed less a celebration of a personal life, and more a political rebuttal on a sensitive issue. And the manifest bias did not stop there. Dame Sue was asked in this supposedly biographical programme, how to correct mistaken criticisms of her evangelised technology. The cue was met with alacrity: enthusiastically denigrating alternatives. Questioning whether wind would be viable on her desert island, Dame Sue asserted emphatically “the facts” that “you can’t have all the electricity you need in the UK, by only having renewables.” Here, partisanship crosses a line – especially when presented as so authoritative. Pros and cons of nuclear and renewables can be viewed in various ways. But decades of academic, industry and government analysis are very clear. It is plain wrong to assert that UK renewable energy does not even offer a possible alternative. If so wished, a fully renewable UK energy future is entirely viable. Of course, such a transition would not be easy. There’s plenty of scope for legitimate debate over what is desirable, let alone best. But what jars is when this kind of airtime is used with such contrived timing, to deny even the possibility of choice. In similar emergent ways, both BBC programmes this week reflected a strongly anti-democratic bias in discussion of science and technology. Similar syndromes are not absent elsewhere. But it does seem the UK is peculiarly susceptible. We need only look to a country as self-confident in science and engineering as Germany, for instance, to see how things could be different. There seems much less of a problem there, in contemplating alternative technological trajectories in areas like GM or nuclear power, without allowing incumbent interests such totalitarian opportunities to deny that science encompasses social choices. It is clear how democracy suffers from this kind of pathology. But it is ironic that science itself is also under threat. And particular national vulnerabilities to entrenchment by obsolete vested interests, may be part of the problem for UK engineering. In the end, authoritarian dragooning of “science as doctrine”, seriously undermines the aspirations of “science as process”. In reality, the robustness equally of research, innovation and democracy rest on similar foundations of openness, scepticism, challenge and egalitarianism. It is the intensity and frequency with which these qualities are compromised in current UK debates on science and technology that deserves to be identified as sinister."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/sep/05/the-guardian-view-on-eu-migration-after-brexit-may-must-tell-us-what-she-wants","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-05T18:46:07Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on EU migration after Brexit: May must tell us what she wants | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/05/the-guardian-view-on-eu-migration-after-brexit-may-must-tell-us-what-she-wants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/05/the-guardian-view-on-eu-migration-after-brexit-may-must-tell-us-what-she-wants","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on EU migration after Brexit: May must tell us what she wants","bodyText":"There are plenty of reasons why Theresa May’s press conference in Hangzhou, while perfectly competent in most ways, was not the most assured performance of her two-month premiership. She was, after all, attending her first top-level international summit with a group of more practised peers. She had arrived to find many of the G20 leaders in hostile and sceptical mood over Britain’s Brexit vote. She was about to have a sticky encounter over nuclear power with China’s president, Xi Jinping. She had not faced the British press since becoming prime minister. It would have taken someone with the rhinoceros hide of a Keith Vaz not to display a few nerves in such circumstances. Yet the main reason why Mrs May found herself on the back foot on Monday was wholly political not personal. On her way to China she had told the travelling press that the points-based immigration system promoted by the Vote Leave campaign during the EU referendum might not work. On Monday in Hangzhou, speaking from bitter experience from her time as home secretary, she amplified her sceptical view, saying that the trouble with points-based systems is that they take away migration control from governments by allowing people who meet the criteria to have automatic rights of entry. This stance was important for two reasons. First, it marked a clear break from the position adopted by the Vote Leave campaign, which had put a points-based system at the core of its immigration argument. This therefore puts Mrs May potentially at odds with Leavers in her own cabinet and party, including the trade secretary, Liam Fox, and Brexit secretary, David Davis, who campaigned for such a system. It also drew Nigel Farage back in front of the radio microphones and TV cameras – hasn’t he retired to get his life back? – to accuse her of betraying Brexit voters. Second, it marked the conclusive arrival in the Brexit argument of a phrase that will soon start to haunt Mrs May unless and until she can deliver on it. The electorate voted to leave the EU, she said, because they wanted “some control” over migration from within the EU into the UK. Later, she varied it a little: “an element of control” which could be delivered in “various ways”. Faraway in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Davis, in a generally anodyne statement on Brexit, confirmed it yet again. If politics was a respectful process in which voters allowed a government the luxury of honing its positions on big issues over time, a phrase like this might not matter too much. Since politics does not work like that, however, and since immigration is a toxic issue, the phrase matters. By rejecting the points system Mrs May puts pressure on herself to define the alternative. This will matter to Brexit voters, many of whom cast their votes because of immigration, real and imaginary. Their wish was for a lot of control, not some. And it will matter to pro-Brexit press campaigners, full of self-confidence now, who know weasel words when they hear them. They will press the issue until Mrs May reveals how much control is some. Mrs May has made her own luck this year, with spectacular rewards. She had another piece of luck on Monday, when junior doctors called off the first of their new waves of industrial action, in a dispute on which Mrs May has been unbending. But she will need to tell a lot of people very soon what she means by “some control” if she is not to become a hostage to the ambiguity of the phrase. Mrs May said she would look at all forms of immigration, presumably including non-EU, before reaching a decision, while Mr Davis hinted that existing EU nationals in the UK would be able to stay. Nevertheless, a government that has staked its credibility on delivering Brexit, and that has put migration control at the top of its Brexit goals, is running a serious political risk if it does not come up pretty quickly with a solution that will satisfy its voters and activists. Important though it is, immigration is not the only issue here. Brexit is not a tactical issue. It is as large a strategic issue for the country as can be imagined in peacetime. As Mr Davis told MPs on Monday, even remain supporters have an interest in the government doing as good a job as circumstances permit. The increasing worry now, from both sides of the Brexit argument, is that Mrs May doesn’t actually have a plan at all, and that she is pressing forward into the fog without a clear enough idea of her detailed goals. “You don’t know what you’re doing” is a chant from the political terraces that would spell bad news for Mrs May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/19/steel-rods-missing-at-chinese-nuclear-firm-seeking-to-invest-in-uk-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-19T07:40:19Z","webTitle":"Errors revealed at Chinese nuclear firm seeking to invest in UK plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/19/steel-rods-missing-at-chinese-nuclear-firm-seeking-to-invest-in-uk-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/19/steel-rods-missing-at-chinese-nuclear-firm-seeking-to-invest-in-uk-plants","fields":{"headline":"Errors revealed at Chinese nuclear firm seeking to invest in UK plants","bodyText":"One of the Chinese nuclear power firms pushing for a stake in the UK’s energy industry left out hundreds of critical steel rods when building its first reactor near Hong Kong in 1987 because workers misread the blueprint. The missing parts were added in a higher layer of the foundation, with extra steel to reinforce them, after the extraordinary mistake was discovered. The plant has now been operating safely for more than two decades. But the nature and scale of the error raises serious questions about the rigour of Chinese nuclear firms and the country’s oversight regime, experts say. “[This a prospective] partner who, when they built the first nuclear power station in China, forgot to put in a large percentage of the protective steel,” said Professor Steve Tsang, senior fellow of the China Policy Institute at Nottingham University. “Potentially we are putting ourselves in a very difficult situation.” China General Nuclear Corp built and runs Daya Bay nuclear plant in Shenzhen. It is one of two Chinese power firms expected to invest in the UK’s Hinkley Point power station and potentially build and operate a future nuclear plant, along with China National Nuclear Corporation and French firm EDF. Chancellor George Osborne, on a trade mission to China last month, said the government would provide £2bn in initial financing for the much-delayed project, which EDF has struggled to fund. Industry observers believe the Chinese cash for Hinkley is conditional on allowing Chinese firms to build their own plant at Bradwell in Essex. That project would function as a showcase for Chinese technology. “I understand what the Chinese want, which is to have a demonstration plant, to show they can build inexpensively, quickly and reliably,” said Theresa Fallon, senior associate at the European Institute of Asian Studies. “But it’s at a time when energy is relatively inexpensive, and this plant is a bit untried technology. I understand there are rules, but there were rules in Hong Kong too when you had the problems in Daya Bay. You are not building a gazebo, it’s really dangerous, serious stuff.” News of the problems at one of China’s first commercial nuclear power plants only reached neighbouring Hong Kong weeks after the mistake was discovered on 14 September 1987. “Construction was temporarily halted in September 1987 after it was revealed that workers laying down reactor building No.1’s concrete foundation had misread the blueprints,” the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists reported in 1991. “But it was not until 9 October, after news of the mislaid rods reached Hong Kong, that Hong Kong investors admitted that construction had been stopped.” Quality control inspectors examining the first layer of reinforced concrete poured for the building’s foundation discovered that 316 steel reinforcing rods were missing, CGN spokesman Hu Guangyao said. That was more than half of the 576 planned for the plant. “The investigation found that the civil construction contractor misread construction drawings,” Hu said, adding that the firms had been selected by a public tender process and included French, German and Chinese companies. Construction started again nearly two months later, on 9 November, after discussion with experts and operating partners on how to remedy the mistake given that the first layer of concrete had already set. The power plant design includes five layers of reinforced concrete in its foundation, and so the company added the 316 L-shaped 40 mm steel rods in the second layer of the foundation “as per the original design”, Hu said. They also added more than 300 thinner rods “to form an even stronger steel net”. Eventually the Chinese nuclear safety watchdog approved restarting construction, The plant has now been operating for more than 21 years, and Hu said the early error transformed the company’s safety culture. “This incident was a critical lesson to every single one of us at CGN and a reminder that ‘safety is our top priority’,” Hu said. “This has become a guiding principle for CGN’s production and operation as well as CGN employees’ code of conduct ever since.” Opponents of nuclear power in Hong Kong were also concerned that a seismic survey of the reactor site had not been properly carried out or had been manipulated. In 1987, a newly recorded fault line, less than five miles from the Daya Bay site, was added to maps even though authorities said there had been an extensive geological survey. Hu said the company carried out three years of seismology studies over a 300 sq km area before settling on the site. He did not directly address whether the nearby fault line had been overlooked. “The Daya Bay nuclear power plant is located on a stable plate. No deep fractures exist within a 50km radius of the plant, nor has there been an earthquake greater than magnitude 6 within this radius,” he said. A leading Chinese scientist told the Guardian this year that China’s nuclear power expansion plans are “insane” because the country’s safety controls are not rigorous enough. “China currently does not have enough experience to make sound judgments on whether there could be accidents,” said 88-year-old He Zuoxiu, who worked on China’s nuclear weapons programme. “The number of reactors and the amount of time they have been operating safely both matter.” Chinese government officials argue that nuclear technology has improved since the Chernobyl and Three Mile Island accidents, but that ignores the role that human error and flawed safety regimes played in both cases. The operator of Japan’s Fukushima plant has admitted that the company failed to take stronger disaster prevention measures ahead of the earthquake and tsunami, for fear of lawsuits and protests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/mar/19/what-happens-next-after-iran-nuclear-talks-climax","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-19T12:04:23Z","webTitle":"Deal or no deal?

Despite the involvement of two state-owned companies – France’s EDF and China’s CGN – British energy users will have to make a substantial contribution too for what is claimed to be the most expensive power station of all time. Who will build Hinkley Point? The project will be a joint venture between EDF and China General Nuclear Power Group, with the latter taking a 33.5% stake as well as covering a third of the construction cost. EDF will lead the project and obtain the initial upfront financing from banks and other investors. How will the £18bn cost affect British energy users? The final cost for a site that will produce produce 7% of Britain’s electricity needs – or 3,200 megawatts of nuclear power – will come back to energy consumers. Under the subsidy regime promised by George Osborne to the plant’s backers, householders and businesses will need to pay £92.50 per MW hour for Hinkley electricity compared to a current wholesale price of £40. Adding to the effect on households, the £92.50 will rise in line with the consumer price index (CPI) rate of inflation, meaning that, by 2030, the guaranteed price could be as high as £150. Is £92.50 per MW hour a rip-off? EDF supporters will argue it is misleading to compare a £92.50 guaranteed price for nuclear with current wholesale power prices because the latter are artificially low owing to the depressed value of coal – which still supplies much of our power needs. They would point out that wholesale power prices were double their current level in 2008 – at £80 per MWh – and could rise to this level when Britain’s coal-fired power stations are phased out because of age and greenhouse gas regulations. How does it compare with renewable energy? A key issue for critics of renewables – wind, solar, marine – is reliability as well as cost. Renewables are currently unable to guarantee constant energy production, unlike nuclear although expected improvements in battery technology may change this shortly. Nuclear advocates add that gas, a relatively low-carbon power source, is a fossil fuel that is more damaging in terms of global warming. And they insist that some wind projects backed by the government – under a scheme running till 2021 – could cost £137 per MWh although other experts say onshore wind is close to being cost competitive with even fossil fuels. What do financial experts think? One of the most vocal critics of the Hinkley deal is Peter Atherton, an analyst for investment bank Jefferies. He calculates that Hinkley will be producing annual pre-tax profits for Edf and CGN of £2bn, rising to £5bn by the end of the 35-year contract. He believes Osborne is gambling that world oil and gas prices – the benchmark for alternative power sources – will more than double by 2025. “If they don’t, its going to look like financial insanity,” Atherton said this year. How will Hinkley benefit the UK economy? The government claims that the two new reactors at Hinkley will create between 20,000 and 25,000 jobs during construction and 900 permanent jobs once in operation. A government study from Oxford Economics and Atkins found the UK supply chain could capture 44% of the total value of a new nuclear reactor but EDF claimed on Wednesday that it would be 60%. Ministers also hope that Hinkley will also kickstart a next-generation nuclear power industry, amid fears that the current generation of nuclear power professionals in the UK will retire without a replacement wave of British employees. EDF and the Chinese are already planning joint ventures for new reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex, the latter controversially using Chinese engineering designs and operatorship. When does building work start and when will it finish? Preparatory work has begun on the Hinkley Point C site – next to an existing nuclear site – and £2bn has been spent already. But work is due to begin in earnest during November with EDF’s final investment decision – a point of no return on Hinkley – due at the same time. The plant is due to open in 2025 compared to an original date of 2017. However, the financial aid agreement with the government allows EDF and CGN to complete the plant by 2033 at the latest. Is there a question mark over the technology? Hinkley Point C will use the French-designed European Pressurised Reactor [EPR] technology, which has yet to enter full service elsewhere. Two plants being built in Finland and France are due to use EPRs too but have been hit by major cost overruns and construction delays. EDF said it has learned its lessons from those schemes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/mar/24/what-if-scotland-had-voted-yes-independence","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-24T06:00:11Z","webTitle":"What if Scotland had voted yes?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/24/what-if-scotland-had-voted-yes-independence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/mar/24/what-if-scotland-had-voted-yes-independence","fields":{"headline":"What if Scotland had voted yes?","bodyText":"Had Scotland voted to sever its links from the rest of the UK in the referendum of September 2014, the then first minister Alex Salmond said he would have proclaimed the independent state on 24 March 2016. To mark that date, four prominent yes voters discuss how things might have turned out, had the poll gone their way. A L Kennedy, author Recent legislation to allow communities to own land for homes has been used to concentrate huge holdings in private hands. This is bad news for the ecology of Scotland and for rural communities. A new independent government should have addressed this and rolled back some changes diluting the independence of the legal system. I would have hoped for prioritised investment and job creation in renewable energy, weaning the country off the UK-wide addiction to fossil fuels and military spending. Scotland has a history of investment in public services. Ramping up those commitments – to having an economy based on real money, rather than onerous and unstable debt income – would be very wise, particularly before the next major crash. Continued investment in health would lead even more clearly to social mobility and a public discourse based on more than punishment. Legislation to encourage ethical behaviour in finance would be essential. Billions saved from quantitative easing and corporate tax amnesties could then maintain a civil society. It would make huge sense to invest even more in robust trade apprenticeships and primary, secondary and tertiary education that’s of high quality and freely available to all. Faked testing, teaching to test and closed doors to all but the wealthiest students damage any country and it would be great to reverse those UK-wide blights. Encouragement of parliamentary oversight and a diverse media environment would be essential. In short, we’d need the usual things that preserve democracy, but which we have been encouraged to believe we can’t afford. Dr Richard Dixon, chief executive, Friends of the Earth Scotland What if we had voted yes? Today I would be looking forward to escaping from the Tories’ obsession with nuclear power and unreasoning opposition to renewable energy of all sorts. Making our own way in the world would let Scotland play to our huge strengths in green energy, unburdened by an electricity market rigged to make nuclear power viable. The realities of the low oil price would mean an independent Scotland would finally have to confront the reality of the approaching end of oil. Throwing billions of pounds in subsidies at the North Sea oil and gas sector wouldn’t be an option, so we would instead have to get serious about turning dirty energy jobs into clean energy jobs. I would also very much look forward to throwing Trident out of Scotland. It might take a year or two but housing the whole massive enterprise somewhere else in the UK would be so expensive and politically difficult that Scottish independence could easily have spelt the end of the UK’s weapons of mass destruction. Sir Harry Burns, professor of global public health at the University of Strathclyde, and former chief medical officer, Scotland If you wanted to transform the health of Scotland you would increase the economic capacity and sense of purpose that does not exist in so many areas because they have been unemployed and without hope for so long, by focusing on economic inequality and lack of meaning in people’s lives. With taxation and fiscal powers in general, if we had those 100% in our own hands, it would have allowed an opportunity for innovation that I don’t think we currently see. By that I don’t mean tax the rich and give to the poor: there would have been a variety of things which would have incentivised the Scottish economy. On public health, alcohol policy could have been more directly influenced by taxation, rather than minimum unit pricing, but the most important thing for public health is to give people control over their lives, to make more informed decisions and give people a sense of the future. Rev Doug Gay, lecturer in practical theology at the University of Glasgow Given my interest in the ethics of nationalism, the priorities would always have been to make clear an independent Scotland’s desire for positive, friendly and co-operative relationships with England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, as well as the rest of the EU. The acts of reconciliation which the Church of Scotland took a lead on in 2014 would have been needed even more through 2014-16 in order to overcome perceptions of rejection and hostility from the rest of the UK. A key aim on Independence Day would be to launch a new social union of the countries of the isles, spelling out commitments to friendly co-operation in economic, military and cultural affairs. A new written Scottish constitution would give eloquent expression to these values and principles. Within Scotland, the government would have to emphasise the challenges and costs as well as the opportunities and gains which come from being responsible for our own affairs. My case for yes was always that the prize of a more equal and socially just Scotland was worth having, even if we were not all always better off."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2016/sep/17/lusatian-lake-district-project-east-germany","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-17T09:00:44Z","webTitle":"East Germany’s old mines transformed into new lake district","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/sep/17/lusatian-lake-district-project-east-germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2016/sep/17/lusatian-lake-district-project-east-germany","fields":{"headline":"East Germany’s old mines transformed into new lake district","bodyText":"‘This was once one of the dirtiest areas in East Germany,” says Sören, my tour guide from IBA Tours, as our bikes swoosh through the Lusatian Lake District. “When I was growing up here, before the Wall fell, we never hung our laundry outside, and we never wore white socks, because we knew they wouldn’t be white after a few minutes. The coal dust was everywhere, all the time.” It’s difficult to connect this information with the pristine landscape around us, all soaring pine forests, glistening lakes and immaculate asphalt cycle paths. The only other major signs of life have been a smattering of fellow cyclists and a sedge of cranes in a field. We haven’t heard, let alone seen, a motorised vehicle – and there’s certainly no coal dust in the air now. The development of this region is one of the former GDR’s biggest success stories, transforming what was once one of its primary lignite-producing areas into the largest artificial lakeland in Europe, stretching 50 miles across the states of Saxony and Brandenburg. The popular Spreewald area is just to the north, the Polish and Czech borders are around 55 miles away – as is the handsome city of Dresden – and Berlin can be reached by train in an hour and a half. It’s intriguing to think that each of the 26 lakes that make up this region was once an opencast mine. The mining continued throughout the 20th century, reaching peak production under the GDR regime, which was highly dependant on lignite as a natural energy resource, especially following the 1970s oil crisis. The idea of turning mines into recreational lakes actually began in the GDR, when one of the mines near Senftenberg was flooded in 1973, on the recommendation of landscape planner Otto Rindt. Lake Senftenberg – nicknamed “Dresden’s Bathtub” – subsequently became the blueprint for the current development. Following reunification, the remaining mines were either taken over and cleaned up by Swedish company Vattenfall, or handed over to the federally owned LMBV (founded in 1994) for transformation into recreational areas. Around 13 lakes are already accessible, with the rest a year or two away from completion, at a total cost so far of around €2.2bn. There are cycling paths encircling each lake, many of which criss-cross to create a 300-mile network. The central group either have been, or soon will be, connected by waterways, and associated infrastructures are being individually developed in an attempt to create a variety of experiences. Some lakes have been left relatively undeveloped, while others, like the more eastern Spreetaler See, has been earmarked for boisterous watersports. The most developed lakes – Senftenberger and Geierswalder, connected by a €50m canal – are mostly geared towards families. Here you can find beaches, cafes and restaurants, and activities ranging from fishing and horse riding to quad-biking and diving. Accommodation ranges from campsites to floating rental apartments and the four-star Seeschlösschen Ayurveda Spa &amp; Hotel. According to Kathrin Winkler, manager of Lusatian Lakeland Tourism, visits to the area have been increasing 10% annually. In 2015, there were around 300,000 overnight stays on Lake Senftenberg alone, with another 200,000 spread around the rest of the lakes. Most of the tourists hail from Saxony, Brandenburg and the Czech Republic, illustrating how the region has managed to remain something of a local secret. The lakeland also carries huge symbolic value in terms of the country’s Energiewende, part of Angela Merkel’s renewable energy act, under which all nuclear power stations are to be closed by 2022 in an ambitious push towards clean energy. However, with lignite (together with stone coal) still providing 41.9% of national power, several mines are still in operation around the country, including three in the Lake District. After completing our 11-mile ride around Geierswalder lake, Sören brings me to a not-quite-finished one at Grossrächener, where his offices occupy the former buildings of the IBA-See – a federal and EU-funded project that, between 2000 and 2010, gave a huge boost to the area with around 30 creative projects. Some, like a floating discovery centre, are still awaiting completion, but finished sites such as the visitor centres in former mines and power stations, a water sports centre in Sedlitz and the ‘Rusty Nail’– a rust-coloured architectural tower with stellar views over the area – are now connected via the Lusatian Route of Industrial Heritage. The former IBA offices, now known as the IBA-Terrassen, include a fairly slick cafe-restaurant that’s fronted by an attractive vineyard sloping down towards the lake. The adjacent marina is still in progress but the adjacent Seehotel Großräschen is already up and running. Originally built in the 1920s for Polish mine workers, it’s now a swish four-star with an intriguing museum of counterfeit artwork made by the Russian Posin brothers. As we pass replicas of paintings, including a Mona Lisa, Sören remarks: “They are perfect for the area, aren’t they?” I look at him, nonplussed. “They’re artificial, too,” he smiles. • The trip was provided by Brandenburg Tourism and Germany Travel.

The employee representatives believe EDF’s chief executive “did not communicate crucial information about a major project” he was aware of before the 28 July meeting at which the board of directors approved the £18bn project to build Britain’s first new nuclear reactors in decades, their law firm told Agence France-Presse. The five union board members have filed a complaint with the Paris commercial court seeking to annul the decision because the Jean-Bernard Levy had not shared essential information with all board members. The complaint also protests against the participation of several directors “with conflicts of interests”, according to the law firm Alain Levy. The challenge claims that some of the EDF board members who voted in favour of Hinkley Point represent companies that are EDF customers and could benefit from the UK contract. French firms Bouygues and Vallourec have denied that members of their boards who are also on the board of EDF had a conflict of interest in their Hinkley Point vote. Laurent Langlard, spokesman for the national mines and energy branch of the powerful CGT union which is supporting the court action brought by the five board members, said: “We’re worried. We have never been against the Hinkley Point project in itself. Our concern is the timing. This project can’t be charged into too fast. EDF’s economic situation is serious. More time has to be taken for full feedback and lessons to be learnt. So we want the board decision annulled and we want a full debate at board level.” He said ensuring that EDF could financially stay on its feet was paramount and the company should take two more years to study and prepare the project. The complaint is the latest in several objections to Hinkley Point by workers at EDF. It follows previous legal efforts by several of EDF’s unions to block and then overturn the approval of the project, which they consider a huge financial risk to the heavily indebted company. The unions argue that Levy and representatives of the French state should have informed the board that they knew the British government wanted to take more time to review the contract. Hours after EDF’s board approved the project last month, the UK government postponed its decision until early autumn. Days later, in an email to top EDF executives, Levy admitted that the night before the board meeting he had been told the new prime minister Theresa May wanted a bit more time. He said he had learned that May “was asking for a little more time, without reassessing the project, without giving the date when it could be signed”. However, the unions said that at the board meeting “the British desire to proceed very quickly was again presented as a reason to quickly sign” the deal. Levy has denied lying to board members, saying he was not aware that the British government would in fact announce hours later a review of the project. The nuclear reactors carry huge risks for both France and Britain. EDF will assume the upfront costs, which unions say could jeopardise the firm’s survival, while Britain has committed to pay a price twice current market levels for the power generated by the plant. “Some board members discovered they did not benefit from the same level of information as the CEO and government representative,” the CGT, CFE-CGC and FO unions said. The moderate CFDT union did not sign the statement. The unions added there was no justification to push the board to vote on the project in a hurry. The unions warned earlier this month that this amounted to a “governance scandal”. The French government has been keen to get Hinkley Point approved as it sees the project as crucial for the long-term viability of France’s nuclear industry, which employs 220,000 people. Previous British governments have also been in favour because the reactors would cover up to 7% of Britain’s electricity needs while helping the government meet its CO2 emissions targets. But British support is not unanimous, and criticism focuses on the growing difference between an electricity price guarantee for EDF, subsidised by the British taxpayer, and current falling energy prices. There have also been national security concerns about Chinese involvement in the project – Beijing has a one-third stake in the plan. A date for a Paris court hearing should be set on 5 September. EDF is also being sued by its Works Council, which also wants to annul the vote because it argues it had not received the necessary documents from management to give non-binding preliminary advice to the company."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-live-news-cases-in-italy-overtake-china-us-infections-pass-100000","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-03-29T00:13:30Z","webTitle":"Stricken cruise ship granted passage along Panama canal – Covid-19 as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-live-news-cases-in-italy-overtake-china-us-infections-pass-100000","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-live-news-cases-in-italy-overtake-china-us-infections-pass-100000","fields":{"headline":"Stricken cruise ship granted passage along Panama canal – Covid-19 as it happened","bodyText":"I’ll be handing over to my colleagues in Australia shortly, but before I go, here’s a summary of the key coronavirus developments in the last few hours: The global death toll has passed 30,000, with confirmed cases at 660,706.

The Zaandam cruise liner might have been given permission to pass through the Panama canal but the question of where the coronavirus-stricken ship will be allowed to dock remains unclear. Holland America Line, the boat’s owners, have previously said they planned to try to dock in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. But the Broward County Commissioner told the Guardian that he did not know if the cruise liner will be allowed to dock. Four people have died on board so far. “I haven’t gotten anything,” said Broward county commissioner Michael Udine, who had voiced his strong concerns about the ship coming into South Florida. “That’s something that would have to go through Unified Command at the port first,” referencing a group which includes the US Centers for Disease Control, the US Coast Guard and the Florida Department of Health. “I’m still very concerned,” he said. “If this ship arrives here, it’s going to put a lot of pressure on our local health system.” Panamanian officials did not confirm whether the Rotterdam, another Holland America Line that has been sent to help with the rescue operation of asymptomatic passengers, would be allowed to pass through the canal. New allegations have been made about an outsourcing firm running NHS 111 services making staff work “desk to desk”, in an apparent breach of coronavirus social distancing rules. Labour has written to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, with “urgent concerns” about a call centre operated by Sitel in Plymouth. MP Luke Pollard said numerous workers at the site told him that up to 200 staff are working “desk to desk” in close proximity on one floor of the building, with allegedly no deep cleaning. Pollard said he had been told people are required to go to work or risk their employment even if they are closely associated with people who are self-isolating. David Lloyd health clubs could be turned into emergency hospitals in response to the Covid-19 outbreak. According to ITV News, the chain is in talks with the government about converting a “handful” of its largest gyms into emergency medical facilities in an attempt to prevent the NHS becoming overwhelmed during the pandemic. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has described Trump’s idea of a lockdown in the state as “anti-American”. Earlier, Trump told reporters that he was considering imposing a quarantine in New York, and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. However, Cuomo has said that the travel ban would be “counter-productive”, telling CNN: “If you started walling off areas all across the country it would be totally bizarre, counter-productive, anti-American”. “It makes absolutely no sense and I don’t think any serious governmental personality or professional would support it,” he added. The United States now has more than 120,000 confirmed cases, the highest figure in the world, with New York the national epicentre of the virus. Panama’s government has said it will allow the Zaandam cruise ship to pass through the Panama Canal. No one from the ship will be allowed to disembark in Panama, however. It comes after a stalemate, in which Panama’s authorities had not given approval to let the ship pass through the canal, leaving passengers stuck on board. They are reportedly allowing the ship to pass for “humanitarian reasons”. The Zaandam cruise ship, currently in Panama, has 130 people with flu-like symptoms, and four have died. At least two of those with symptoms are confirmed to have coronavirus. This will allow the ship to try and dock in Florida. My colleagues Patrick Greenfield and Erin McCormick will have more information shortly. Boris Johnson, the UK’s prime minister, is set to warn British citizens that the worst of coronavirus is yet to come, and that tougher measures may be necessary. The country’s 30m households will receive a letter from the prime minister including the warning, along with details of the government’s orders on social distancing, symptoms and handwashing. It comes as the UK braces for a surge in coronavirus cases. Read more here: Two new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Libya. The two cases were discovered in Tripoli and Misrata, the National Centre for Disease Control said, without giving any further details. The first, confirmed on Monday, was a man who had recently returned to Libya from overseas. Libya has been embroiled in war since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and is split between two warring administrations. The conflict has wrecked the economy, fuelled migrant smuggling and militancy, and disrupted oil supplies. Due to the volatile domestic situation, international aid agencies have warned of a disaster if coronavirus spreads. Gatherings of more than two people have been banned in Northern Ireland, and anyone who can work from home must do so, authorities have announced. Authorities will have the power to enforce restriction of movement and social distancing in Northern Ireland, in a deal agreed by Stormont executive. The measures will come into force at 11pm on Saturday night, and enable authorities to hand out fines up to £5,000. The regulations also give the authorities the power to close certain premises and prohibit anyone from leaving home without a reasonable excuse. Mali has recorded its first coronavirus death hours just before its election. The first patient died of coronavirus on Saturday, a day before the West African country voted in a long-delayed parliamentary election threatened by both the pandemic and security concerns. The leader of the main opposition party was kidnapped earlier in the week, with a security source saying he is “likely” in the hands of a jihadist group, according to Reuters. Several opposition parties on Saturday called for the vote to be postponed due to the pandemic. So far, 18 people have tested positive in Mali, with the first diagnosis on Wednesday. Saudi Arabia is indefinitely extending the suspension of international passenger flights and workplace attendance in both public and private sectors, as part of ongoing efforts to tackle the spread of coronavirus. Domestic flights, trains, buses and taxis also remain suspended, the Interior Ministry said in a statement. Airbnb has announced it will offer frontline healthcare workers free places to stay during the coronavirus outbreak. The accommodation company announced it has teamed up with the NHS to create a global programme which aims to house 100,000 frontline healthcare staff fighting the coronavirus pandemic around the world. This will include healthcare professionals, relief workers and first responders. Homeowners who list their properties through Airbnb are able to opt in to the programme and offer an entire home, with Airbnb waiving all fees for the stays. So far, nearly 1,500 places to stay have been offered in the UK. Patrick Robinson, director of public policy at Airbnb, said: The entire country is behind our heroic NHS and medical staff as they battle the coronavirus outbreak. We have made it our priority to stand with the Airbnb community to do what we can to help. By working together, we can ensure that frontline workers can find a free and convenient place to stay as they continue their critical work. We thank our doctors and nurses across the country from the bottom of our hearts and are grateful to hosts who have already opened their homes during these difficult times. The initiative builds on programmes already launched in Italy and France where Airbnb and local partners, including the French Government, announced that doctors, nurses, care-givers and other medical support staff who are responding to the outbreak in the country can access accommodation on Airbnb. Here’s an update of the top twenty countries for number of coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker: US: 116,505 cases, 1,925 deaths Italy: 92,572 cases, 10,023 deaths China: 81,999 cases, 3,299 deaths Spain: 72,248 cases, 5,812 deaths Germany: 56,202 cases, 203 deaths France: 38,105 cases, 2,317 deaths Iran: 36,408 cases, 2,517 deaths UK: 17,312 cases, 1,021 deaths Switzerland: 14,076 cases, 264 deaths Netherlands: 9,819 cases, 640 deaths South Korea: 9,478 cases, 144 deaths Belgium: 9,134 cases, 353 deaths Austria: 8,188 cases, 68 deaths Turkey: 7,402 cases, 108 deaths Canada: 5,448 cases, 61 deaths Portugal: 5,170 cases, 100 deaths Norway: 3,981 cases, 23 deaths Australia: 3,640 cases, 14 deaths Israel: 3,619 cases, 12 deaths Brazil: 3,477 cases, 111 deaths You can get the full list here. There have been 649,904 confirmed cases, with 30,249 fatalities. An organ transplant consultant volunteering for the NHS frontline fight against coronavirus has died from the disease, it has been reported. Dr Adil El Tayar, a working surgeon, died on Wednesday at West Middlesex University Hospital in Isleworth, west London, his family told the BBC. Dr El Tayar, 63, had volunteered to help in the A&amp;E and general department of a hospital in the Midlands, his cousin said in a report for Radio 4’s From Our Own Correspondent programme. Dr El Tayar was a father of four, two of whom were NHS doctors. Two weeks ago he became unwell and did not return to work, eventually having to be taken to hospital where he died, his cousin said. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran, has had her leave from prison extended by two weeks, her husband has said. Richard Ratcliffe said his wife’s father had been told that her temporary release from Evin prison in Tehran will now continue until 18 April. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s father was also notified that his daughter’s file had been put forward to the Iranian Prosecutor General for consideration for clemency, Richard Ratcliffe said. A crowdfunder to raise money for personal protective equipment in British hospitals has reached £400,000. The fundraising effort was launched by a group of NHS doctors and a GP to source PPE “for those who need it the most”. The group originally set a £200,000 target, but this was met in 48 hours. According to the crowdfunder, actor James McAvoy made a large contribution, with the group behind the fundraiser thanking him for his “extraordinary generosity”. The next two weeks will be the toughest yet in the fight against coronavirus in France, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has warned. Doctors in the greater Paris region have warned their intensive care units will be full by the end of the weekend, whilst healthcare services in the east of France are already struggling to cope. “We are fighting a battle that will take time,” Philippe said in a televised address. “The first two weeks of April will be harder than the two we have just lived through.” The army and emergency workers were this weekend stepping up the transfer of patients to less-affected regions, using a military helicopter and a specially-adapted TGV train, in an attempt to free up intensive care beds in worst-hit areas. By Saturday, the death toll in France was 2,314, with more than 37,575 confirmed cases, according to official figures. However, the government tally only accounts for those dying in hospital, so the figure is likely to be much higher. Authorities say they will be able to compile data on deaths in retirement homes from next week, which is likely to result in an increase in the official death toll. Hundreds of passengers stuck on a cruise ship where coronavirus has spread will be transferred to another ship. The Zaandam cruise ship, currently in Panama, has 130 people with flu-like symptoms, and four have died. At least two of those with symptoms are confirmed to have coronavirus. “The ship which could not dock at any port in South America will remain in Panamanian waters 8 nautical miles from the coast, since it did not receive approval from Panamanian health authorities to cross the (Panama) Canal,” Panama’s maritime authority said. It said 401 asymptomatic passengers will be transferred from cruise operator Holland America Line’s 238-meter (781-foot) MS Zaandam vessel to the Rotterdam, a sister ship. There are 1,243 guests and 586 crew on board the Zaandam, as well as four doctors and four nurses, the cruise operator has said. About 70 healthy passengers on the Zaandam have already been boarded onto tenders pulled up on the port side of the ship for transfer to the Rotterdam, according to a passenger. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has surpassed the 1,000 mark in Greece after a further 95 people tested positive overnight. The country’s health ministry spokesman, professor Sotiris Tsiodras, said 1,061 cases had now been recorded, up from 966 yesterday, with the vast majority in Athens. The death toll had also risen from 28 to 32 (25 are men). The average age of those who had succumbed to the virus was 73, he said. Although almost 1,000 more people had been tested for the virus in the last 24 hours, testing in Greece remains low (14,363 in total), fuelling fears that the real number of those with the novel virus is higher. Addressing reporters, Tsiodras said the country, thus far, had managed to avert “the bad scenario of the type [we have seen] in Italy.” But Greek experts also insist that the coming weeks are crucial. Earlier, the minister of development and investment, Adonis Georgiadis, acknowledged that restrictive measures on movement, for several weeks among the most stringent in Europe, were likely to be extended way beyond the original end date of April 6th. Further curbs are not excluded. Tellingly, the government announced it would be cutting air links to the Netherlands in addition to severing flights to Italy, Spain, the UK and Turkey. Greeks abroad would only be repatriated if they had “a serious reason” to be returned to the country. “We are not implementing a general repatriation. That would be devastating for the country,” the deputy minister for civil protection Nikos Hardalias also told reporters. Some 2,850 Greeks have requested to be repatriated from the UK but only pregnant women or those with health problems or who had nowhere to stay would be brought back to Greece, he said. Here’s some more detail on Spain’s announcement from my colleague Sam Jones in Madrid: The Spanish government has tightened up its national lockdown, ordering all non-essential workers to stay at home for the next two weeks in a bid to halt the spread of the coronavirus and relieve pressure on the country’s overstretched hospitals. The measure, which comes two weeks after the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, declared a state of emergency, was announced hours after Spanish health authorities said the outbreak appeared to be peaking in parts of the country. In a televised address on Saturday evening, Sánchez ordered all those in non-key jobs to stay at home from Monday, saying the “extraordinarily tough” measures were needed as the county intensified its efforts to contain the pandemic. “This measure will reduce people’s movement even further [but] it will reduce the risk of contagion and allow us to unblock out intensive care units,” the prime minister said. Sánchez also warned that the EU needed to react to the global health crisis in a united and decisive fashion to safeguard its own future. “It’s Europe’s time to act. Europe is at risk,” he said. You can read the full article here: South Africa’s confirmed cases of coronavirus increased at a slower rate on Saturday, up by 17 to 1,187 people, the health ministry said. The country is in its second day of a national lockdown. In a statement the Ministry of Health however stressed that the slower rate of reported infections did not indicate a reduction in the speed of the outbreak. “We must outrightly state that these numbers do not indicate a reduction in the number of infections. It is merely a reflection of positive results that were received, verified and ready for today’s reporting,” the ministry said in a statement. Since the first positive case was reported on March 5 the rate of infections in South Africa has been exponential, rising from less than 20 two weeks ago to over 1,000, leading President Cyril Ramaphosa to announce a 21-day lockdown to slow the outbreak. Only one death has been reported in South Africa so far. Italian PM is approving new legislation to make €4.7bn available to cities in Italy affected by coronavirus, Sky News have just announced. Meanwhile, the Italian economic minister says Europe will need a package like that of the Marshall plan after the Second World War. The United Arab Emirates has extended its nightly curfew to April 5 in an attempt to combat the spread of coronavirus. It came as neighbouring Qatar reported its first death from the disease. The UAE’s deep clean campaign, being implemented between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. each day, began on March 26 and had been due to end on the morning of March 29. “We are all hoping that everybody - citizens, residents and visitors - will stay at home during this period,” Farida Al- Hosani, a health ministry spokeswoman, told a news conference. Qatar became the latest Gulf state to report its first virus-related death, a Bangladeshi resident. The majority of the 590 cases in Qatar are among migrant labourers, where foreigners make up most of the work force. Thanks to all those getting in touch on Twitter. I won’t be able to answer all questions directly but will try and fill in any gaps in information here on the blog. If you spot something I miss, you can drop me a message @mollyblackall. Hubei province in China, where the outbreak originated, has removed all outbound traffic highway checkpoints, the Chinese media outlet Global Times reports. The city of Wuhan, where the wet market thought to have been the source of coronavirus was located, is the only exception. This signals another lifting of restrictions, as the rate of coronavirus spread in China slows. All remaining checkpoints in Wuhan will be removed on April 8. Germany conducts 500,000 tests in a week, Sky News reports. The British government is aiming to be testing 10,000 per day by tomorrow. Coronavirus is not an airborne infection. Here’s a fact check from the World Health Organization: Six people in the Vatican have tested positive for coronavirus, but the Pope and his aids are not among them. Tests were done on 170 people in the Vatican and six showed positive, including one of the several dozen permanent residents of the Santa Marta guesthouse on the Vatican grounds, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement. The person who tested positive works in the Secretariat of State and is in a Rome hospital. “I can confirm that neither the Holy Father nor his closest aides are among these,” he said. Tests showed one other person who had been in contact with the priest also came up positive but that person did not live in the papal residence. The modern residence, which has 130 rooms and suites and a staff of about 30 people, is home to dozens of priests who work in key Vatican departments. Bruni said the entire residence, which is run like a hotel but has not been accepting temporary guests for the past few weeks, was sanitised. Francis appears to be in generally good health but part of one of his lungs was removed following an illness when he was a young man. Canada will prevent anyone with symptoms of coronavirus board domestic flights or inter-city passenger trains, prime minister Justin Trudeau has said. The measures will come into effect on Monday at noon EDT. Asked how screening would be different, Trudeau said the government was giving new tools to airlines and railways. Transport Canada later said airline and rail company staff would ask health questions of passengers and look for visible symptoms. Even enhanced screening offers “no guarantee” that sick people will not board, as they can hide symptoms, Howard Njoo, Canada’s deputy chief public health officer, said in a separate press conference. Canada has confirmed 5,153 cases of coronavirus, and 55 deaths. You can read the full report on the developments in Italy from my colleague Lorenzo Tondo in Italy here: The 47 countries of the WHO Africa region now has 2,650 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 49 deaths, the head of the World Health Organization has said. Dr Tedros made the announcement in a tweet: Coronavirus patients in intensive care units in the UK have a 50% survival rate, a report has revealed. Data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) showed that of 165 patients treated in critical care in England, Wales and Northern Ireland since the end of February, 79 died, while 86 survived and were discharged. The figures were taken from an audit of 775 people who have been or are in critical care with the disease, across 285 intensive care units. The remaining 610 patients continue to receive intensive care. You can read the rest of the article from my colleagues Denis Campbell and Toby Helm here: The death toll in France has risen to 2,314, up from 1,995 on Friday, French health authorities have said. French health authorities reported 319 new deaths from the coronavirus on Saturday, up 16% on the previous day. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in France has reached 37,575, compared to 32,964 on Friday. The daily government tally only accounts for those dying in hospital but authorities say they will be able to compile data on deaths in retirement homes from next week, which is likely to result in a big increase in registered fatalities. Ireland hopes to lift or tweak restrictive measures in a fortnight, Health Minister Simon Harris said. This will only be possible if the country can slow the rate of admissions to intensive care units, however. Ireland’s prime minister ordered citizens on Friday to stay home until April 12, with people only allowed to leave to shop for groceries, for brief individual physical exercise or to make essential family visits. Ireland reported 14 deaths on Saturday, the most on a single day. The death toll has reached 36. A further 294 cases brought the number of infections to 2,415, slightly down on the 302 new cases reported on Friday. The British government has chartered three more flights to bring Britons trapped in Peru back to the UK, the British Ambassador has announced. The flights are set to leave Lima on Sunday and Monday, and are being operated by British Airways, ambassador Kate Harrisson said in a video posted on Twitter. The government are also bringing in flights from other regions to connect to those flights out of Lima, and are organising bus routes across the country which will begin tomorrow morning. To reach more remote destinations, the government is working with international partners to bring British nationals, along with other nationals, back to Lima, Europe, or the UK. Harrisson said that coronavirus cases have been confirmed in hostels where UK nationals are staying. She said consulate staff are providing those nationals with support. There are around 1,000 British nationals in Peru at the moment, Harrisson said. On Wednesday, the government brought around 200 Britons back from Peru. Trump contacted UK prime minister Boris Johnson last night, who apparently said “the UK needs ventilators” as soon as Trump picked up the phone. Trump was speaking outside the US naval hospital ship Comfort, which will now head to New York to treat patients suffering from emergency conditions other than coronavirus, to free up healthcare workers and resources to treat the virus. All non-essential workers must stay home over the next two weeks, in an attempt to stem the spread of coronavirus, the Spanish prime minister has announced. They will be paid a full salary, PM Pedro Sanchez says. The measure are set to last from March 30 to April 9. The number of confirmed cases in Ireland has reached 2,415, up from 2,121 on Friday. Trump is speaking now, and confirms he is considering a quarantine in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Trump says he’ll announce either way soon, but says this won’t apply to truckers, and won’t affect trade. He also says that four hospitals have been completed in “record time”. He adds that reserves are being activated to boost healthcare supplies. Using his catchphrase, he says he has “millions and millions” of new supplies in process. Iran has allocated 20% of its annual state budget to fighting the coronavirus outbreak in the country, President Hassan Rouhani said. Iran is one of the worst-hit countries in the world, with the death toll from coronavirus rising to 2,517 on Saturday. It had 139 fatalities in the past 24 hours, and cases rose by 3,076 to 35,408. “We are in difficult conditions, in conditions of sanctions but we have allocated 20% of our budget this year to corona ... and this might be surprising for the world from a country under sanctions,” Rouhani told state TV. The budget allocation, amounting to about 1,000tn rials, would include grants and low-interest loans to those affected by Covid-19, Rouhani said. France has ordered 1bn face masks, mostly from China, the French health minister has said. Health Minister Olivier Veran said the country was using 40 million face masks each week, and currently has three weeks worth of supplies. Here’s some more information from my colleague Lorenzo Tondo in Italy, on the announcement that the Italian death toll has now passed 10,000: The number of deaths from coronavirus in Italy has passed 10,000 while the number of total cases is now over 90,000. On Saturday, Italy announced 889 new deaths from Covid-19, as total fatalities leapt to 10,023. Another 5,974 have tested positive with coronavirus, 470 less than Friday. Some 70,065 people across the country are currently infected with Covid-19. The total number of contagions in Italy, including the deceased and those who have recovered, is 92,472. Yesterday, the country recorded its highest daily rise in Covid-19 deaths, with 969 new fatalities. On 31 March, flags will be flown at half-mast in cities across Italy to commemorate the victims of the pandemic. Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, warned on Saturday that the EU could lose its purpose if it failed to come up with a strong response to the coronavirus threat and accused other member states of a timid response to an unprecedented economic shock. “If Europe does not rise to this unprecedented challenge, the whole European structure loses its raison d’être to the people,” Conte told the Il Sole 24 Ore financial newspaper. “We are at a critical point in European history,” Conte added, “I represent a country that is suffering a lot and I cannot afford to procrastinate.” The national government is said to be considering plans to extend a country-wide lockdown to mid-April. The Higher Health Institute (ISS) said that the peak of the coronavirus epidemic in Italy was approaching. “We have seen an apparent reduction in the infection curve since 20 March but we are not yet in a downward phase,” said ISS president Silvio Brusaferro. As the spread of coronavirus in Italy continues to soar, the Vatican has confirmed the Pope and his aids do not have coronavirus. The EU has granted Tunisia €250m in aid to help it cope with the economic and social effects of the coronavirus outbreak, EU ambassador Patrice Bergamini said in a tweet. Tunisia has limited healthcare infrastructure, leading to concerns about the spread of coronavirus. Currently, the country has 227 confirmed Covid-19 cases and six deaths. In Italy, 10,023 people have now died from coronavirus, after rising by 889 since Friday. The number of confirmed cases in the country increased to 92,472 from 86,498. The death toll in Turkey has risen from 16 to 108, the health minister has announced. The country now has 7,402 cases, an increase of 1,704. Cuomo said that the cost of ventilators had increased from $25,000 to $45,000 because of demand. Despite Donald Trump telling reporters earlier that there was a possibility of an enforced quarantine in New York, the state’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said he hadn’t been told anything about this. Cuomo added that Trump had not consulted him about a quarantine, saying “I don’t even know what that means”. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that cases in the state have increased to 52,318, and the death toll has risen to 728. He warns that coronavirus efforts are a “marathon not a sprint”, admitting that it feels like a “lifetime” since schools closed just 10 days ago. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Greece has risen to 1,061. It comes after Greece confirmed 95 new cases on Saturday. So far, 32 people have died due to coronavirus in the country. This is Molly Blackall, taking over the blog for the next few hours. I’ll be keeping you up to date with all of the latest coronavirus developments from around the world. If you spot anything I miss, do drop me a message on Twitter, @mollyblackall. I won’t be able to reply to everything, but will try to read it all. Thanks in advance! Earlier we reported that thousands of migrant workers in India had been forced to trek back to their homes after the government shut down trains to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Here are some pictures from the sub-continent. The Covid-19 death toll in Lombardy, Italy, has risen by 542 since Friday, Reuters reports. The agency says it learned the figure, which brings the total in the region worst hit by Italy’s coronavirus outbreak to 5,944, from a source “familiar with the data”. Official figures are not due to be published until later. The number of deaths was in line with Friday’s tally of 541, which was the second highest since the outbreak began on 21 February, the agency said. The number of cases in the region increased by 2,117 to 39,415, the source said. Nationwide figures will be released at around 6pm local time (1700 GMT). The country’s death toll stood at 9,134 on Friday, the highest in the world. More than 11 million people tuned in to watch Pope Francis deliver a blessing in an empty Saint Peter’s Square, Lorenzo Tondo reports television bosses as saying. The pope’s blessing, Urbi et Orbi - to the city and the world - is usually reserved for Christmas Day and Easter Sunday, when many thousands of people gather to hear it. Images of the cloudy sky and glistening square with the pope praying alone on a platform illuminated by the faint light of six candelabras, were beamed across the world. He said: For weeks now it has been evening. Thick darkness has gathered over our squares, our streets and our cities. It has taken over our lives. Panama’s maritime authority has shared images of a boat-to-boat rescue operation from a cruise liner with a Covid-19 outbreak on board near the entrance to the Panama canal. A small number of symptomless passengers are being moved from the Zaandam to its sister ship, the Rotterdam, after dozens of people reported flu-like symptoms and four people died. The ship was carrying 1,243 guests and 586 crew before the operation, of whom 53 guests and 85 crew have fallen ill so far. Several Latin American countries refused to let the Zaandam dock and there are fears that hundreds of ill and elderly passengers and crew members will be left stranded at sea during the global pandemic. Passengers contacted by the Guardian on Friday issued a desperate plea to be allowed to dock after Panama refused to let the ship pass through the canal, citing safety concerns to their staff. China has sent a plane loaded with medical personnel and supplies to Pakistan to help fight the spread of the coronavirus in one of the world’s most populous countries, the Associated Press reports. The foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureishi, met the plane at Islamabad airport on Saturday and greeted the Chinese doctors and officials on board. Pakistan is a key link in Beijing’s ambitious One Road project linking south and central Asia with China. Beijing is also an important military supplier the the country, which is a nuclear power, and supplied it with missiles capable of carrying atomic weapons. Pakistan, with a population of 220 million, has 1,408 confirmed cases of the virus, and has recorded 11 deaths. Most of the infected people were travellers returning from neighbouring Iran, which is in the grip of one of the worst outbreaks. Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, has refused to impose a countrywide lockdown, saying it would devastate the country’s poor. He has, however, ordered non-essential businesses, including restaurants, money changers and wedding halls, to close. Thousands of migrant workers in India, left jobless and penniless by the full shutdown of the country, are walking long distances back to their home villages after all transport was stopped except for essential services, AFP reports. Huge numbers had crammed onto trains and buses before the country of 1.3 billion people ground to a halt for three weeks, but many others were left stranded. “Rather than die hungry, we decided to walk,” said Dilipji Thakor, who worked at a now-shuttered shopping centre in Ahmedabad in Gujarat state, as he trudged along a road. In Italy they are singing and sharing recipes. In France humour is saving the day. In Spain communal staircases have become the new running tracks, and in Germany ordinarily disorderly hackers are busy coding corona-busting apps. As hundreds of millions of Europeans languish in lockdown, people are finding increasingly inventive ways to keep themselves entertained and counter what the continent’s psychologists warning are the very real risks of confinement. The Guardian’s correspondents across the continent report. The first official train to disembark passengers in Wuhan since it was put under lockdown arrived in the Chinese city on Saturday, as it began to reopen after more than two months of almost total isolation, Peter Beaumont reports. The easing of the quarantine, allowing people to enter the city of 11 million and ground zero of the global coronavirus outbreak, comes as China plans measures to kickstart its economy. Trains have been fully booked for over a week in advance. Chinese state media showed crowds of passengers arriving at Wuhan station on Saturday, many wheeling suitcases. Some people had managed to slip back into the city a day earlier on rail services that were stopping in the city, but had nominally banned passengers from disembarking. A 1,000 bed US navy hospital ship is to head to New York City to aid Covid-19 healthcare efforts in the what has become the United States’ worst affected region, the Associated Press reports. The USNS Comfort was undergoing maintenance but has been pressed back into service and rushed to the city. It is expected to arrive at Manhattan pier on Monday - a week after its sister ship, the USNS Mercy arrived in Los Angeles to preform similar duty on the west coast. The ship has 12 operating rooms as well as radiology suites and a CT scanner. It also has intensive care beds, a laboratory and a pharmacy. The 1,100 or so medical staff on board are mostly active duty service members from the U.S. Navy, and some reservists, who serve on the East Coast. All migrants in Portugal will be treated as permanent residents until 1 July to ensure they have access to public services during the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reports. Claudia Veloso, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Internal Affairs, told the news agency: People should not be deprived of their rights to health and public service just because their application has not yet been processed. In these exceptional times, the rights of migrants must be guaranteed. The policy is also intended to reduce contagion risk by minimising contact between border control staff and applicants, the statement said. Portugal has reported 5,170 cases of the virus and 100 deaths, far fewer than in neighbouring Spain. Health authorities expect cases to peak at the end of May. It is not known how many people have ongoing residency applications, but government statistics show that a record 580,000 immigrants were living in Portugal in 2019 and 135,000 people were granted residency. The Department of Health said another 260 people across the UK had been reported dead in the last 24 hours, a significant one-day rise from 759 and by far the largest since the outbreak began. The latest total is 34% higher than the equivalent figure yesterday, the largest day-on-day percentage increase since 18 March, when there was a 46% jump. In England, a further 246 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths there to 935, NHS England said. “Patients were aged between 33 and 100 years old and all but 13 - aged between 63 and 99 years old - had underlying health conditions,” it said in a statement. A further four people died from coronavirus in Wales, bringing the total to 38, health officials have said. The country also reported 172 new confirmed cases, bringing the total to 1,093. Dr Robin Howe, the Covid-19 incident director at Public Health Wales, said the true number of cases was likely to be higher: Coronavirus is now circulating in every part of Wales. The single most important action we can all take in fighting coronavirus is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives. We know that staying at home can be hard, and we want to thank each and every person across Wales for doing their bit to help slow the spread of the virus. In Scotland, a further seven people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total there to 40, the Scottish government announced. Two further people with Covid-19 have died in Northern Ireland, taking the toll to 15, the nation’s Public Health Agency said. There were also 49 new positive cases of coronavirus confirmed on Saturday, bringing the total number of known cases there to 324. Across the UK, a total of 120,776 people have been tested for coronavirus as of 9am on March 28, with 17,089 positive results. As of 5pm on Friday, of those threated in hospital in the UK, 1,019 have died. Russia will close its borders on Monday, a government order published on Saturday said. The measure will come into force at all vehicle, rail and pedestrian checkpoints, and will also apply to Russia’s maritime borders. The country, which has already grounded all international flights, has reported 1,264 coronavirus cases. Russian diplomats and drivers of freight trucks, among others, will be exempt from the ban. The coronavirus outbreak may be peaking in parts of Spain, the country’s health authorities said on Saturday as they announced another record single-day death toll of 832, Sam Jones reports from Madrid. The number of cases in the country rose from 64,059 on Friday to 72,248 on Saturday, and the number of dead now stands at 5,69o. Between Thursday and Friday, 769 people died from the disease. Despite the figures, the head of Spain’s centre for health emergencies said that the situation was improving in certain places. Fernando Simón told a press conference on Saturday afternoon: We don’t know exactly when we’ll get confirmation, but we’re getting close to the peak of the curve that we’re studying so anxiously. In some parts of the country, they probably may even have passed it – but we need to be cautious with preliminary information ... The increase in cases is coming down in comparison with previous weeks, but it could be that there are cases that aren’t being detected in some regions. But Simón also warned that reaching a peak would not ease the pressure on Spain’s overstretched intensive care units (ICUs), adding they were predicted to pass beyond full capacity in less than a week’s time. We still have a big problem when it comes to the overloading of our ICUs Patients who pick up the disease today may need a bed in an ICU in seven to 10 days. That means that we’re still seeing a lag between the control of transmission and the saturation of ICUs. It also means they’re going to be overloaded by the end of next week or the beginning of the following week. France’s supermarkets have pledged to engage in “food patriotism” to boost the country’s hard-hit farmers and producers during the coronavirus crisis, Kim Willsher, the Guardian’s Paris correspondent, reports. Fruit and vegetable growers have been severely hit by a government decree banning open air markets. Now major stores have said they will shun foreign imports in favour of national produce. The French Federation of Business and Distribution said all the country’s major supermarket chains, including Carrefour, Leclerc and Intermarché had agreed. They are in the process of moving to French supplies. Foreign products on the shelves will be sold, but there will be no resupplying from outside France. Local prefects and mayors have been given the power to allow local markets if they are essential to farmers and shoppers and on the condition that they ensure strict distancing and health safety measures are enforced. In a message to customers, Carrefour promised that “100% of our strawberries, cucumbers, and asparagus (white and violet) are from now on 100% French”, adding:. To support French production, we have decided to stop the sale of fruit and vegetables from abroad where there is a French alternative available. French farmers have also put out an appeal for 200,000 volunteers to help them harvest fruit and vegetables. The sector normally relies on foreign workers for two thirds of its workforce, but with restrictions on movement and border closures, there is a shortage. The Latin American populists Jair Bolsonaro and Andrés Manuel López Obrador have faced intense criticism for their lackadaisical reaction to the coronavirus crisis. Critics accuse the leaders of Brazil and Mexico of playing down the risk posed by the pandemic, Tom Phillips reports from Rio de Janeiro. But López Obrador, or Amlo as he is known, appears to be changing tack as the regional death toll rises. In a 14-minute “message to the Mexican people” on Friday, he declared: “We need to stay in our homes. We need to keep a healthy distance from each other. “If we don’t stay inside our homes the number of infection cases could shoot up, and it would saturate our hospitals. It would be overwhelming.” Bolsonaro shows no sign of a similar change in approach. He has been actively undermining efforts to keep Brazil’s 210 million citizens at home in recent days. His son, supporters and the federal government have backed a campaign called Brazil Can’t Stop. “Some people are going to die,” Bolsonaro said on Friday. “That’s life ... You can’t shut down a car factory because people die in traffic accidents.” A number of people who attended “lockdown parties” in Belgium are now gravely ill, Daniel Boffey in Brussels reports the country’s prime minister, Sophie Wilmès, as saying She announced an extension of the country’s lockdown measures until 19 April and urged everyone to take the crisis more seriously. Many young people do not feel concerned. You feel invincible when you are young. Among the young people who partied in cafes a fortnight ago, there are some who are today in intensive care. Residents in Belgium are only allowed to leave their homes for exercise, essential shopping and work that cannot be done remotely. Large gatherings are banned and police have been told to be active in fining those found to be flouting the rules. A total of 353 people have died in Belgium of Covid-19 infection, including 64 in the past 24 hours. There are 3,717 patients in hospital, including 789 in intensive care. Singapore reported 70 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the health ministry said, taking the city-state’s total number of infections to 802. Of the new cases, 41 were imported and 29 were local cases who had no recent history of travel abroad, the ministry said in a press release. Singapore is still carrying out extensive contact tracing of patients confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus. More than half of its confirmed cases have been in patients arriving from overseas. A little something to lighten the mood ... Outrage is growing in Kenya after police fired teargas at a crowd of ferry commuters and mobile phone footage captured officers hitting people with batons as they enforced the country’s Covid-19 lockdown. Amnesty International Kenya and 19 other human rights groups said in a statement: We were horrified by excessive use of police force ahead of the curfew that began Friday night. We continue to receive testimonies from victims, eyewitnesses and video footage showing police gleefully assaulting members of the public in other parts of the country. The teargas caused hundreds of people trying to reach a ferry in the port city of Mombasa ahead of the curfew to touch their faces as they vomited, spat and wiped away tears, increasing the chance of the virus spreading, the statement said. The Associated Press reported Kenya’s interior ministry on Saturday as saying in a statement that the curfew “is meant to guard against an apparent threat to public health. Breaking it is not only irresponsible but also puts others in harms way.” Kenya’s government has not said how many people have been arrested. Six new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the West Bank, raising the total in Palestine to 97, the Wafa news agency reports. West Bank government spokesman Ibrahim Milhem said in a daily briefing on Saturday that three new cases were confirmed in Irtas, a village near Bethlehem, one in nearby Beit Iskaria, and two in villages near Jerusalem. Milhem urged Palestinians to stay at home and avoid socialising with family members. Social visits appear to have been the main cause of transmission so far. Nine of Palestine’s confirmed cases are in Gaza. Officials from the Israeli civil administration in the West Bank confiscated tents on Thursday intended as a field clinic and emergency housing for Palestinians affected by the Covid-19 outbreak, the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem reported. The group said in a statement: As the whole world battles an unprecedented and paralysing healthcare crisis, Israel’s military is devoting time and resources to harassing the most vulnerable Palestinian communities in the West Bank, that Israel has attempted to drive out of the area for decades. Shutting down a first-aid community initiative during a health crisis is an especially cruel example of the regular abuse inflicted on these communities, and it goes against basic human and humanitarian principles during an emergency. There are plans in India to turn some railway coaches into isolation wards for patients with the coronavirus, as authorities prepare the country’s health infrastructure for an expected surge in cases. The country’s 1.3 billion people were this week ordered to stay indoors for three weeks in the world’s biggest lockdown, leaving the country’s trains lying idle. One train coach has been turned into a prototype quarantine facility, the state-owned Indian Railways said in a statement on Saturday. Once they receive clearance, the plan is for each of India’s 16 railway zones to convert 10 coaches into such wards every week, the company added. Saudi Arabian airlines will begin exceptional commercial flights this week to bring British nationals and their families back to the UK, and similar flights are being arranged for American citizens to return home, both countries said. All international passenger flights in and out of the Arab country were suspended for two weeks starting March 14 to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus , but there is no indication normal travel will resume on Sunday. However, flights to London Heathrow will begin on Sunday from Riyadh and later in the week from Jeddah and Dammam, according to the British embassy. The US embassy said on Saturday it was working with the Saudi authorities to arrange repatriation flights on a commercial airline, but no flights had been confirmed yet. The kingdom recorded 99 new confirmed cases on Saturday, taking its total to more than 1,200 – the most in the Gulf Arab region – with four fatalities. Another 38 people have died in Switzerland from coronavirus over the past 24 hours, the health ministry has said. The Alpine country’s death toll is now 235 people, and the number of cases has also increased to 13,213 from 12,161. Army medical units have been deployed at hospitals to help in crisis regions like Ticino, which borders Italy, and it is drawing upon its strategic stockpile of pharmaceuticals to cover rising demand, Reuters reported. Like other European countries, Switzerland is pumping money into its crisis-hit economy, and state-backed loans worth 20bn Swiss francs (£16.9bn) became available on Thursday. Finance minister Ueli Maurer made clear on Saturday the government was happy to help with state-backed loans worth more than $20bn, but that it needed the money back and could not compensate for income losses. He told SRF radio: We are not distributing federal money, but taxpayers’ money. Many of those who pay taxes are now partially unemployed, their jobs are in question, and now we take the money away from them and distribute it somewhere where there are also problems. Greeks should brace themselves for the long haul and prepare for lockdown to continue for some time yet, the country’s development and investment minister warned today. In the first hint of government thinking on the issue, Adonis Georgiadis said measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus will be in place “until scientists tell us we have beaten the virus.” Restrictions on movement in Greece – already some of the most stringent in Europe – have extended to citizens being forced, with few exceptions, to remain at home. The controls have turned cities across the country into ghost towns after prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced the measures last Sunday. But Georgiadis said there was no prospect of the restrictions being relaxed by April 6 – the original cut-off date. “The measures prohibiting circulation in our country will last much longer than April 6th,” he told Open TV. Officials are privately voicing fears that April will be the most difficult month yet. Transmission rates and fatalities, as a result of Covid-19, are both expected to rise even if the spread of the disease has, so far, been kept under relative control. Latest figures show the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases jumping to 966, according to the government, with 28 fatalities recorded as of Friday. But experts believe in the absence of widespread testing – only 13,477 people to date have been tested for the virus – the real number is almost certainly higher. Media reports on Saturday suggested that the centre-right government is considering enforcing even stricter measures, including a ban on all flights in and out of the country, and perhaps even clamping down further on movement. People are currently allowed to venture out of their homes for exercise, upon the condition they stay in the vicinity of their immediate neighbourhood and inform authorities beforehand. China has sent medical personnel and supplies on a plane to Pakistan to help stop the spread of coronavirus, the Pakistani foreign ministry said on Saturday. The plane carrying aid to Pakistan was met at the capital’s airport on Saturday by its foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureishi, who greeted the arriving Chinese doctors and officials, the Associated Press reported. China has already sent ventilators, masks and other medical equipment to the South Asian country. Pakistan, with a population of 220 million, currently has 1,408 confirmed cases of Covid-19 – including 11 deaths. It has closed its borders with both Iran and Afghanistan, but has been criticised for its initial lax response to the virus. Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, has refused to impose a countrywide lockdown saying it would devastate the country’s poor people, but non-essential businesses have been ordered to close, including restaurants, money-changers and wedding halls. According to Pakistan’s federal health authorities, the outbreak has been largely concentrated in the Punjab – which borders India – with 490 confirmed cases there, and Sindh, which has 457 confirmed infections. Other cases are spread throughout several other regions, including the capital, Islamabad. On Saturday a woman in the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province became the latest person in Pakistan to die from coronavirus-related symptoms. Health authorities said the woman fell sick after returning from a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, before dying in a government hospital where she tested positive for coronavirus. A group of teenagers in the north of England who claimed to have coronavirus and deliberately coughed at NHS staff will be prosecuted, police have said. Details of the incident were released on the Facebook page of Warrington police. Sgt Hillyard of Cheshire police wrote: We have attended reports of a group of youths coughing at NHS staff stating they have coronavirus. The youths will be prosecuted as will their parental guardians. This is an absolutely abhorrent incident involving abuse of our NHS heroes. I will once again urge all parents and persons with parental responsibility to make sure that their children stay inside. You too can and will be prosecuted if you fail to keep your children inside. A man in Manchester has also been charged with assault after allegedly coughing at a police officer and claiming to have the coronavirus. Greater Manchester police said Mateusz Rejewski, 33, of no fixed abode, has been charged with one count of common assault on an emergency service worker and one count of breaching a dispersal notice. The officer is self-isolating as a precaution, and Rejewski has been remanded in custody and will appear at Manchester magistrates court on Tuesday. More than 5,000 medics from countries around Europe have appealed to governments and the EU to urgently ensure the safety of refugees and migrants in overcrowded camps on the Greek islands, where they warn of an impending medical disaster. The pandemic that threatens to overwhelm the camps will have “catastrophic consequences for the refugees, Greek inhabitants and the rest of European society,” says the petition, launched last week by Dutch medical professors and public health experts. It is an illusion to think that a COVID-19 outbreak in these camps could be kept under control: 40,000 people are living on a few square kilometres, and there are only a handful of doctors present. Many children and adults are already ravaged by physical and mental traumas. If Europe looks away now, this situation could escalate to become a medical disaster, which would represent a serious violation of the norms and values of European healthcare. It is our duty to prevent this from happening. The signatories called on EU member state governments to comply with their 2016 agreement to take in a fixed number of refugees to prevent “a medical disaster on European territory”. The European parliament’s civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee called last week for the evacuation of the 42,000 people on the Greek islands as an urgent preventive measure to avoid “many deaths”. Holding facilities on all five Aegean islands opposite the Turkish coast, widely considered particularly high-risk environments for the spread of the virus, are currently six times over capacity. The first case of Covid-19 on the islands was confirmed earlier this month when a Greek woman on Lesbos, the island long on the frontline of the refugee crisis, tested positive. A doctor in Uzbekistan has died after attempting to treat a coronavirus infection that the patient had kept secret, according the country’s health authorities. The 39-year-old man had been in contact with Uzbekistan’s “patient zero”. The doctor was admitted to hospital in a critical condition on 26 March and died two days later. He is the second person known to have died of the coronavirus in the country, according to Reuters. Uzbekistan has 104 confirmed cases of the virus. It has locked down all of its provinces and barred citizens from leaving their homes except for work and essential shopping. Here are the latest major developments in the global coronavirus pandemic so far on Saturday. The number of confirmed cases globally has passed 600,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. The true extent of infections is likely to be much greater. A sixth of those infections are in a single country, after the number of cases in the US passed 100,000, making it the worst affected country in the world, followed by Italy and China. Spain, the fourth-worst affected country, reported a record single-day rise of 832 in the number of people to die Covid-19 deaths in a single day. The country now has confirmed 72,248 infections. The ratings agency Fitch has cut Britain’s sovereign debt rating to AA-, saying debt levels will jump as the government increases its spending to offset the near shutdown of the economy. Moody’s downgraded South Africa’s sovereign credit rating to junk status, heaping more pain on an economy already in recession and facing a further steep contraction. A global shortage of condoms is looming. The world’s biggest manufacturer said coronavirus lockdowns had forced it to shut down production. Iranian doctors say hundreds of people have died after ingesting toxic methanol and thousands more have fallen ill after a rumour spread that it killed the coronavirus. Passengers on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama have issued desperate plea to be allowed to dock after four people died during a Covid-19 outbreak on board. Lockdowns around the world have triggered a rise in domestic violence. From Brazil to Germany and from Italy to China, activists say they are already seeing an alarming rise in abuse. Afghanistan has reported 15 new Coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, pushing the total number of infections to 110. The figure includes four Nato soldiers and two foreign diplomats, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports. Eleven of the new cases have been confirmed in western province of Herat, raising the total number of infections in Afghanistan’s worst-affected province to 76. Herat borders Iran, where the authorities have been struggling to control one of the world’s worst outbreaks. Three cases were also reported in Farah province, which also has a border with Iran. Another was confirmed in Ghazni province, which is related to travel to Iran, health ministry said. The Afghan government has a partial curfew in place in all cities that border Iran, and a three-week curfew was also announced on Friday for Kabul, a city of around 6 million people. The curfew went into effect on Saturday morning. The Taliban announced that it had established a coronavirus treatment and isolation centre in an area of the the northern province of Kunduz it controls. Three coronavirus deaths and four recoveries have been reported across Afghanistan, but testing is limited and experts fear the true scale of outbreak is unknown. This tweet from the air traffic tracking service Flightradar24, showing the number of planes in the air on Friday evening compared to four weeks earlier, shows the remarkable impact of travel restrictions across Europe. Spain has recorded a record single-day death toll for the second day in succession after 832 people died between Friday and Saturday, the Guardian’s Madrid correspondent, Sam Jones. The total number of people to have lost their lives to the coronavirus now stands at 5,69o. Spain also has 72,248 confirmed cases of the virus, up from 64,059 on Friday. Between Thursday and Friday, 769 people died from the disease. The Spanish government has already extended the nationwide lockdown declared a fortnight ago to 11 April and does not rule out introducing stricter controls. Speaking to the Guardian earlier this week, Spain’s foreign minister, Arancha González Laya, said: We have done what was required at every moment and we will continue down that path. Iran has reported 139 new coronavirus deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the total for the country to 2,517, Reuters reports. Kianoush Jahanpour, a health ministry spokesman, said on state TV that the total number of cases diagnosed had rised by 3,076 to 35,408, and that 3,206 people were in a critical condition. Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, earlier reassured the public that the country, one of the most affected by the pandemic, has a strong healthcare system able to cope should the disease spread rapidly. In comments broadcast on state TV, he said his government had allocated 20% of the budget to fighting the outbreak. The tycoon Richard Branson is trending on Twitter after news broke that his airline, Virgin Atlantic, is applying for hundreds of millions of pounds in state aid. Twitter users, by and large, are not impressed. Branson’s carrier has been hit hard by the travel bans and does not have the cash reserves of larger rivals such as British Airways or easyJet, my colleague Gwyn Topham, transport correspondent, reported yesterday. Spain has reported 832 deaths from Covid-19 since Friday, bringing the total for the country to 5,690. The health ministry also reported 8,189 new confirmed infections, bringing the total to 72,248. Spain has the second-highest Covid-19 death toll, and the fourth highest number of confirmed cases. Saudi Arabian Airlines has agreed to operate exceptional commercial flights to repatriate British nationals, Reuters reports. They will take place in the week starting 29 March from Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam to London’s Heathrow airport. Additional flights will be put on if required, according to a British embassy email sent late on Friday. Authorities in Finland have restricted movement out of Uusimaa, the region that includes the capital, Helsinki, to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Restrictions came into force at midnight and are expected to remain in force until 19 April, Yle Uutiset reports. They prevent people from entering or leaving Uusimaa, except to work, return home or care for a vulnerable person. Uusimaa has most of Finland’s 1,025 confirmed coronavirus cases. The Finnish parliament approved the measures unanimously on Friday night. Feeling brave? Scientists at Oxford University are recruiting volunteers to take part in the UK’s first coronavirus vaccine trial. Police enforcing the coronavirus lockdown in South Africa fired rubber bullets at shoppers queuing outside a supermarket in Johannesburg, according to an Agence France-Presse photographer. The agency said about 10 police vehicles had arrived in Yeoville, a poor part of the city’s central business district, where several hundred people who had gathered outside a Shoprite supermarket were failing to observe physical distancing rules. Startled shoppers trampled on each other and a woman with a baby on her back fell to the ground, the report said. Police later used whips to get the shoppers into line. South Africa, which has 1,170 confirmed coronavirus cases, recorded its first death from the virus on Friday. The country’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has ordered the population of 57 million to stay at home for 21 days, and has deployed the security forces to enforce the lockdown. The number of people on Jersey confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus has reached 52, and one person is confirmed to have died. There are 83 tests still pending and 601 people have tested negative, according to an update the island’s government published on Facebook on Friday evening. For readers more interested in the latest coronavirus news from the UK, my colleague Lucy Campbell has just published our UK-focused live blog. That means I will only be taking the top UK news lines for this blog, which from now on will focus on global developments. Health officials in the Philippines reported 14 new coronavirus deaths and 272 new cases on Saturday, according to Reuters. The numbers reported represent the country’s largest daily increase in deaths and infections since the outbreak began . The total number of confirmed infections in the Philippines is now 1,075, of whom 68 have died, the health ministry said. Four patients have recovered, bringing the number of recoveries to 35. In a sign of the wider impact of the crisis now enveloping the world, wildlife rescue centres around the world are struggling to treat endangered species, Gloria Dickie reports. As the coronavirus spreads from country to country, disrupting global travel and the economy, the centres are struggling to make ends meet. The Centre for Orangutan Protection in Kalimantan in Indonesia’s section of Borneo has temporarily shut down to minimise the spread of the virus. Others such as Merazonia in Ecuador rely on tourism dollars to care for their animals. Since China’s shutdown of Wuhan in January, visitor numbers have also plummeted at Asia’s wildlife centres. Derbyshire police in the north of England made headlines this week after using a drone to shame dog walkers who had driven into the Peak District National park during the lockdown. Now, the Guardian’s north of England editor Helen Pidd reports, police officers have been pouring black dye into a reservoir near Buxton known locally as “the blue lagoon” to make it less appealing to swimmers. The Buxton Safer Neighbourhoods Team wrote in a Facebook past that it taken the measure after receiving reports people were congregating there: No doubt this is due to the picturesque location and the lovely weather (for once!) in Buxton. However, the location is dangerous and this type of gathering is in contravention of the current instruction of the UK government. With this in mind, we have attended the location this morning and used water dye to make the water look less appealing. This is a regular tactic that we use to reduce ASB and we work in partnership with HPBC and Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service. However, as things stand, it has never been so important to discourage these types of gatherings. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world has now passed 600,000, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. With many countries, including the UK, now only testing the most serious cases, however, the true extent of infections is likely to be much greater. According to the university’s interactive map, 601,478 people had been confirmed as infected with Covid-19, and 27,862 deaths attributed to the disease. At least 131,826 people have recovered after falling ill. The US has the highest number of confirmed infections with 104,837, followed by Italy with 86,498 and China with 81,948. The lockdown implemented to curb the spread of the coronavirus is disrupting UK government plans to recruit 20,000 new police officers - a key manifesto pledge of the Conservative party at the December election. Assessment centres have been hit by sweeping closures of premises, PA Media reports. Katy Bourne, the chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC), who also serves as PCC for Sussex told the agency: We began a big recruitment drive and along comes this virus. We don’t want to stop that recruitment. The national call has a lot of officers who are in the pipeline who have been through the assessment centres and are still waiting to come out to forces and so on. The assessment centres nationally where you expect people to turn up to classrooms, obviously those can’t function because we are all isolated, we have got to stay at home. So, it’s keeping those officers warm or those potential officers warm in the system. It’s really how do forces deal with the numbers that they have got. Bourne also said it was critical that police officers get the equipment they need to stay safe during the pandemic. The personal protective equipment (PPE) has been a big issue nationally. The police are out and about in the country they need protection. I know from Sussex’s point of view they have managed to secure some. I know some police forces in other areas of the country have really struggled. The supplies are there but it’s getting it out to those forces. After a week in which France’s government has come under increasing criticism for perceived lack of transparency, the prime minister, Édouard Philippe, and the health minister, Olivier Véran, are holding a press conference on Saturday to outline the situation in detail and answer questions, Kim Willsher reports from Paris. We will have the usual announcement of the daily update figures early evening. The controversial hospital professor Didier Raoult from Marseille released new research late on Friday on 80 patients conducted over six to 10 days, which apparently shows that hydroxychloroquine in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin is effective in treating Covid-19 patients. Let’s begin with the latest from the UK. In Wales, teachers have been urged to keep schools open for NHS staff and carers during the two-week Easter holidays, PA Media reports. The education minister, Kirsty Williams, who described school workers as national heroes for keeping more than 700 schools open during the coronavirus epidemic, said: It takes a community to raise a child and that statement has never been more true. In this time of national need, our school community has stepped up and met the challenge. More than 700 schools have stayed open to look after the children of NHS staff, carers, people who are saving lives. I am now asking you to do more and keep schools open during what would have been school holidays. It has never been more important for our children and young people to be surrounded by the people they know and trust. I am asking you to be flexible, and to offer up some time during the Easter period to continue to support both vulnerable children and the families of our critical workers. Williams also confirmed that the families of children who get free school meals would continue to be assisted during the break. She said: Wales has a strong tradition of supporting communities and I can confirm that the funding announced last week to support children in receipt of free school meals can be used to carry on providing free school meals over the Easter holiday. This will allow local authorities to continue with their local arrangements while we establish a national scheme to support children in receipt of free school meals. In devising a national scheme I will ensure that local authorities will still be able to maintain their own approaches, should they want to do so. They will have the discretion to opt into a national scheme or continue to provide flexible support if that is their preference, such as direct payments or deliveries to families who are unable to leave their homes, due to isolation requirements. I believe this will be a sustainable approach, that will enable families to budget and plan their spend according to their needs. Hello everybody, this is Damien Gayle taking the reins of the live blog from London. As usual I will be bringing you the latest coronavirus updates from our network of correspondents around the world, from the news wires and anywhere else I can find it. And as usual I will need the help of the Guardian’s global readership. Please send any coronavirus news from your part of the world to me at damien.gayle@theguardian.com or via a direct message to my Twitter profile, @damiengayle. Let me know what we’re missing. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan on this Saturday in what I can’t believe is still March. It’s been a long month. I leave you now with my colleague Damien Gayle. I’ll be moving to a different room to watch an entire continent isolate itself from incoming flights. And who said self isolation wasn’t fun? Here are the latest key coronavirus pandemic developments from around the world: US cases passed 100,000. Doctors and nurses on the front lines of the US coronavirus crisis pleaded on Friday for more protective gear and equipment to treat waves of patients expected to overwhelm hospitals as the number of known US infections surpassed 100,000, with more than 1,600 dead. The ratings agency Fitch has cut Britain’s sovereign debt rating to AA-, saying debt levels will jump as the government ramps up its spending to offset the near shutdown of the economy in the face of coronavirus. Italy overtook China to become the second-worst affected country after the US. Italy also recorded the highest daily rise in deaths anywhere since the outbreak began, with 969 fatalities. Chinese authorities reverse planned re-openings of movie theatres. China’s official media also told people to stay on guard against the coronavirus on Saturday, and restrictions on foreigners entering went into effect, as the country reported no new locally transmitted infections and a small drop in imported cases. Australia stepped up enforcement of social distancing rules on Saturday. In an attempt to contain community transmission of the novel coronavirus, states across the country implemented fines, closed beaches and threatened stricter measures if people defy pleas to stay at home. More than 100 Australian doctors and dentists returned to Australia after being stranded on a cruise ship off the coast of Chile. Moody’s downgraded South Africa’s sovereign credit rating to “junk” status on Friday, heaping more pain on an economy already in recession and now staring down the barrel of a steep contraction over the global coronavirus pandemic. A global shortage of condoms is looming. The world’s biggest producer or condoms warned of a global shortage after a coronavirus lockdown forced it to shut down production. Iranian doctors say ‘hundreds’ have died after ingesting toxic methanol. An Iranian doctor said hundreds have died and thousands have been sickened from ingesting toxic methanol across the Islamic Republic out of the false belief it kills the new coronavirus. Passengers on cruise ship stranded off Panama coast issue desperate plea. Passengers on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama issued a desperate plea to be allowed to dock after four people died during a Covid-19 outbreak on board. Argentina saw a record jump in cases. Despite the full national lockdown declared on March 20, the country reached 690 cases and 17 deaths so far, with 101 new cases and five deaths reported Friday. The capital city of Buenos Aires is the worst hit, with 223 cases, followed by the province of Buenos Aires with 193. South Korea reports highest new cases in a week. South Korea reported 146 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest number in a week, its disease control agency said on Saturday, with the country suffering a rise in imported cases from Europe and the United States during recent days. Lockdowns around the world bring rise in domestic violence. Women and children who live with domestic violence have no escape from their abusers during quarantine, and from Brazil to Germany, Italy to China, activists and survivors say they are already seeing an alarming rise in abuse. A shorter summary is available here: The NHS could have prevented “chaos and panic” had the system not been left “wholly unprepared for this pandemic”, the editor of a British medical journal has said. Numerous warnings were issued but these were not heeded, Richard Horton wrote in The Lancet. He cited an example from his journal on 20 January, pointing to a global epidemic: “Preparedness plans should be readied for deployment at short notice, including securing supply chains of pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment, hospital supplies and the necessary human resources to deal with the consequences of a global outbreak of this magnitude.” Dr Horton wrote that the government’s Contain-Delay-Mitigate-Research plan had failed. “It failed, in part, because ministers didn’t follow WHO’s advice to ‘test, test, test’ every suspected case. They didn’t isolate and quarantine. They didn’t contact trace. “These basic principles of public health and infectious disease control were ignored, for reasons that remain opaque. “The result has been chaos and panic across the NHS.” Dr Horton’s warning came as the UK saw its biggest day-on-day rise in deaths since the Covid-19 outbreak began, while Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock said they had tested positive for the virus and frontline testing of NHS workers was set to begin. The ratings agency Fitch has cut Britain’s sovereign debt rating to AA-, saying debt levels will jump as the government ramps up its spending to offset the near shutdown of the economy in the face of coronavirus. Fitch downgraded the country by one notch to the same level as its rating for Belgium and the Czech Republic. It said a further cut could follow as it kept the rating on negative outlook. “The downgrade reflects a significant weakening of the UK’s public finances caused by the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and a fiscal loosening stance that was instigated before the scale of the crisis became apparent,” Fitch said. “The downgrade also reflects the deep near-term damage to the UK economy caused by the coronavirus outbreak and the lingering uncertainty regarding the post-Brexit UK-EU trade relationship.” Fitch said the coronavirus shutdown was likely to shrink Britain’s economy by nearly 4% in 2020, assuming the drastic containment measures could be relaxed in the second half of the year, leading to a 3% bounce in growth in 2021. But doubts about Britain’s future trading ties with the European Union posed a further risk, Fitch said. Here’s the wrap of coronavirus pandemic news from the last few hours: The US has become the first country to exceed 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases as Donald Trump signed into law the largest economic stimulus package in US history, a $2.2tn bill designed to rush federal assistance to workers and businesses. The number of confirmed US cases rose by 15,000 on Friday, fewer than the 16,000 reported on Thursday. By Friday night there were more than 6,000 hospitalised Covid-19 patients in New York with almost 1,600 in intensive care while the state had logged 519 deaths, the most in the US, and more than 44,000 infections. Hospitals in New York City, New Orleans, Detroit and other virus hotspots have sounded the alarm about scarcities of drugs, medical supplies and trained staff. In California a navy hospital ship, the Mercy, has docked at the Port of Los Angeles to provide 1,000 beds and full medical facilities – freeing up hospitals on land for seriously ill coronavirus patients, as the state braces for an outbreak potentially on New York’s scale. The president on Friday invoked a national security law compelling General Motors (GM) to mass produce ventilators – accompanied by barbs that the carmaker had not been acting quickly enough. Some saw it as partly an act of spite amid Trump’s continuing feud with the company – GM said it had already been working around the clock for more than a week to help build more ventilators. Italy became the second country to overtake China in terms of the number of infections, reaching more than 86,000 cases. Its latest 969 deaths represent the highest national one-day figure anywhere since the outbreak began, seemingly dashing hopes that Italy might be flattening its rate of infection. The US Navy is the military service hit hardest by the coronavirus, as it scrambles to contain its first at-sea outbreak, with at least two dozen infected aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt, one of 11 active aircraft carriers whose mission is central to the Pentagon’s strategy for deterring war with China and Iran. The Roosevelt and its contingent of warplanes may be sidelined for days, sitting pier side in Guam as the entire crew more than 5,000 is tested, Reuters reports. Navy leaders say the carrier could return to duty at any time if required, but the sudden setback is seen as a harbinger of more trouble to come. The carrier, like other Navy ships, is vulnerable to infectious disease spread given its close quarters. The massive ship is more than 1,000 feet long; sailors are spread out across a labyrinth of decks linked by steep ladder-like stairs and narrow corridors. Enlisted sailors and officers have separate living quarters, but they routinely grab their food from crowded buffet lines and eat at tables joined end-to-end. Although the US Navy is much smaller than the US Army, it accounts for at least one-third of all reported Covid-19 cases in the military. None has been reported among Navy submarine crews, which are widely deployed and include subs armed with long-range nuclear missiles on constant patrol. The US embassy in Riyadh said on Saturday it was working with the Saudi authorities to arrange repatriation flights to the United States on a commercial airline. “No flights or departure/arrival locations have been confirmed at this time,” it said in a statement. “It is likely that flights will be scheduled with little advance notice.” Meanwhile a video shared on Twitter claims to shows a father crying after coming home to his son. The doctor is heard saying “No, no,” in Arabic as his son rushes to greet him. There are 1,104 reported cases in the country, and three deaths. Coronavirus latest: at a glance A summary of big developments in the global coronavirus outbreak: What happens to people’s lungs when they get coronavirus? What became known as Covid-19, or the coronavirus, started in late 2019 as a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause. The cause of the pneumonia was found to be a new virus – severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or Sars-CoV-2. The illness caused by the virus is Covid-19. Now declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the majority of people who contract Covid-19 suffer only mild, cold-like symptoms. WHO says about 80% of people with Covid-19 recover without needing any specialist treatment. Only about one person in six becomes seriously ill “and develops difficulty breathing”. So how can Covid-19 develop into a more serious illness featuring pneumonia, and what does that do to our lungs and the rest of our body? The UK Ambassador to Madagascar and Comoros Phil Boyle pointed out on Twitter a few hours ago how few flights are going to and from Africa at the moment, as countries across the continent respond to the coronavirus pandemic. The latest data, from FlightRadar24, still shows the continent as having close to zero aircraft leaving or arriving: The Guardian’s Emma Graham-Harrison and Angela Giuffrida report from Rome with Helena Smith in Athens and Liz Ford in London. Around the world, as cities have gone into lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus, the mass efforts to save lives have put one vulnerable group more at risk. Women and children who live with domestic violence have no escape from their abusers during quarantine, and from Brazil to Germany, Italy to China, activists and survivors say they are already seeing an alarming rise in abuse. In Hubei province, the heart of the initial coronavirus outbreak, domestic violence reports to police more than tripled in one county alone during the lockdown in February, from 47 last year to 162 this year, activists told local media. “The epidemic has had a huge impact on domestic violence,” Wan Fei, a retired police officer who founded a charity campaigning against abuse, told Sixth Tone website. “According to our statistics, 90% of the causes of violence [in this period] are related to the Covid-19 epidemic.” It is a pattern being repeated globally. In Brazil a state-run drop-in centre has already seen a surge in cases it attributes to coronavirus isolation, the Brazilian broadcaster Globo said. “We think there has been a rise of 40% or 50%, and there was already really big demand,” said Adriana Mello, a Rio de Janeiro judge specialising in domestic violence. “We need to stay calm in order to tackle this difficulty we are now facing.” The Catalan regional government said that calls to its helpline had risen by 20% in the first few days of the confinement period; in Cyprus, calls to a similar hotline rose 30% in the week after 9 March, when the island had its first confirmed case of coronavirus. Hong Kong has brought in new restrictions on gatherings and nightlife venues after a recent rise in imported cases and a cluster of 43 infections connected to live music venues. Another 19 people were diagnosed with Covid-19 on Friday who are connected to the cluster. The venues are in Tsim Sha Tsui, Wan Chai, and Lan Kwai Fong. Musicians from bands manage by one company are among those infected. Last week Hong Kong’s chief executive Carrie Lam flagged suspending the liquor licences of 8,600 venues, reasoning that people get intimate when they’re drinking. However that was later withdrawn, and restrictions on the number of patrons brought in instead. Britons go on shopping spree to ease grind of Covid-19 confinement In more British retail and manufacturing news, the prospect of weeks trapped at home has seen Britons embark on unlikely shopping sprees as they create home offices and gyms but also embrace hobbies ranging from dressmaking to jigsaw puzzling and growing their own veg, Zoe Wood and Joanna Partridge report for the Guardian. With all non-essential high street shops and some websites now closed, what is left of high street trade is online as households hunker down and seek ways to keep themselves and their children entertained. During week one of the government’s new home isolation rules, online sales were “fairly flat” on a year ago, according to the IMRG Capgemini online retail index. However, that measure, based on the web sales of 200 retailers, masked seesawing demand: while sales of electricals and DIY products were up 42% and 14% respectively, sales of clothing fell 27% and demand for footwear slumped 38%. British retailers and manufacturers in ‘wartime effort’ to fight Covid-19 British industry has thrown its weight behind the fight against Covid-19 in a wartime-style effort to churn out protective masks, hand sanitiser and medical ventilators. While most retailers have been forced to shut down to contain the pandemic, a raft of firms across the country, in sectors from manufacturing to fashion, are setting up emergency operations that often involve striking out into unfamiliar territory. The most high-profile example has been the effort by industrial powerhouses to manufacture 30,000 medical ventilators, with household names such as Airbus, Dyson, Ford and Rolls-Royce all pitching in with expertise and resources. The banking group HSBC moved to help ventilator manufacturers by offering fast-track loan applications, cheaper interest rates and extended repayment terms. A host of companies are focusing on limiting contagion and protecting NHS workers. In Australia, retailers Country Road, Mimco, Politix, Trenery and Witchery will close their doors as the spread of coronavirus leaves many shoppers confined to their homes. The stable of retailers, owned by South African company Woolworths Holdings, announced the temporary closure of stores until further notice on Saturday. Department store David Jones, which is also owned by Woolworths, will continue to operate its larger stores. “As a heritage Australian brand, we recognise that we have an important role to play in slowing the spread of COVID-19,” Country Road said in a statement posted online. “This is a decision that has not been made lightly, and one we feel is necessary to protect the health and wellbeing of our team, customers and wider community.” All the brands will continue to trade online. The closures follow an announcement by competitor Myer on Friday that it would shut its shops from Sunday night. Have questions, news tips, or jokes you think our readers would enjoy?

Thailand reported 109 new coronavirus cases and one death on Saturday, bringing the total to 1,245 infections and 6 deaths, the spokesman of the government’s Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) said. The new cases are higher than the 91 reported on Friday. The latest death is of a patient with some prior health complication, Taweesin Wisanuyothin, the CCSA spokesman said. The Thai government on Friday ordered the closing down of more public facilities and businesses to curb the spread of coronavirus, and has extended existing closures until the end of April. The provinces of Narathiwat and Pattani in southern Thailand are in lockdown while several other provinces have issued orders to restrict the opening and closing times of 24-hour convenience stores. People in greater Tokyo and the Osaka area in western Japan hunkered down on Saturday as officials urged citizens to stay indoors to prevent a potential emergency, but some were carrying on as normal, Reuters reports. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike’s plea for the tens of millions of people in the capital and surrounding regions to avoid non-essential, non-urgent outings until 12 April, and particularly this weekend, followed a surge in coronavirus infections this week that she said put Tokyo on the brink of an emergency. Koike urged the public to avoid the national pastime of congregating to drink and watch the cherry blossoms as they hit their peak in the capital, saying on Friday, “The cherry blossoms will bloom again next year.” Infections in Japan have climbed to more than 1,400, with 47 deaths, excluding those from a cruise ship quarantined last month. Hit early by the coronavirus in its initial spread from China, Japan had seen a more gradual rise than the recent surge in much of Europe and the United States. This week, however, saw an acceleration that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called “a national crisis”. Infections on Friday rose by a daily record 102, said public broadcaster NHK. Tokyo reported 40 new cases on Friday, bringing its total to 299. Moody’s downgraded South Africa’s sovereign credit rating to “junk” status on Friday, heaping more pain on an economy already in recession and now staring down the barrel of a steep contraction over the global coronavirus pandemic. The ratings firm downgraded the rating one notch to ‘Ba1’ from ‘Baa3’ and maintained a negative outlook, meaning another downgrade could follow if the economy performs worse or government debt rises faster than expected. An annual budget in February showed a worsening of the fiscal picture, and the country entered a 21-day nationwide lockdown on Friday that will dent output as workers have been told to stay at home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The local Eye Witness News channel reported that homeless people living in the city of Durban said they had been taken to a reception centre against their will: South Africa’s finance ministry said the downgrade would add to prevailing financial market stress. Moody’s said the main driver behind the downgrade was “the continuing deterioration in fiscal strength and structurally very weak growth”. “The rapid spread of the coronavirus outbreak will exacerbate South Africa’s economic and fiscal challenges and will complicate the emergence of effective policy responses,” it added. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said the government was not “trembling in our boots” and was committed to reforms to address weak growth and ailing state-owned companies. The agency is the last of the big three agencies to downgrade Africa’s most industrialised economy to sub-investment grade, after S&amp;P Global and Fitch moved there in 2017. Moody’s left South Africa on the brink of junk in November after it revised the outlook on its rating to negative following a bleak mid-term budget. NSW Health have also revealed that more than 100 Australian doctors and dentists, who were stranded on a cruise ship off the coast of Chile, have today returned to Australia. Last week, we reported the doctors were on board as part of a medical convention when Chile banned cruise vessels from docking. Today NSW Health confirmed they had returned and none were identified as being “unwell”. “Two international flights arrived in Sydney overnight and this morning with 245 passengers...These passengers include numerous doctors and nurses who had been attending a health convention on-board who had not been able to berth off the South American coast,” the departmnet said. “Airport screening was immediately commenced, including symptom assessment and temperature, and no passengers were identified as being unwell. “All passengers are subject to the requirement for 14 day isolation under ministerial direction. This includes those who were able to safety return to their place of residence as well as around 150 people who are in quarantine in two Sydney hotels.” China’s official media told people to stay on guard against the coronavirus on Saturday, and restrictions on foreigners entering went into effect, as the country reported no new locally transmitted infections and a small drop in imported cases. “At this time, we must be extremely vigilant and cautious, and we must prevent the post-epidemic relaxation from coming too soon, leading to the loss of all our achievements,” the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily newspaper said in a front-page editorial. The authorities also reversed planned re-openings of movie theatres, the state-owned China Securities Journal reported, citing sources. Reuters could not verify the existence of the National Film Administration’s order to extend cinema closures, but a man answering the phone at a Wanda Cinemas theatre in Shanghai confirmed it had been ordered to close again. Theatres in major cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing, remained closed, searches on an online ticketing platform showed. Effective Saturday, China has suspended the entry of foreign nationals with valid Chinese visas and residence permits. Beijing has also ordered airlines to sharply cut international flights from Sunday. China’s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases. There were 55 new cases a day earlier, one of which was transmitted locally. The total number of infections for mainland China now stands at 81,394, with the death toll rising by three to 3,295, the commission said. A reminder that UK prime minister Boris Johnson became the first major world leader to test positive for Covid-19 in Friday night. On 3 March, Johnson boasted that he was continuing to shake hands with ‘everybody’, including people who had tested positive for Covid-19. On another day of rapid growth in the number of deaths caused by the virus, Johnson issued a video message revealing that he had developed “mild symptoms”,write Heather Stewart, Matthew Weaver and Kate Proctor write for the Guardian. But he added: “Be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus.” Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, was subsequently spotted running out of No 10 and along Downing Street, apparently hoping not to be noticed. Not long afterwards, Hancock issued his own statement saying he too had tested positive, and would be working from home. And later in the day, Prof Whitty, who had advised the prime minister to get tested, said he too was displaying symptoms. In other news: US cases passed 100,000. Doctors and nurses on the front lines of the US coronavirus crisis pleaded on Friday for more protective gear and equipment to treat waves of patients expected to overwhelm hospitals as the number of known US infections surpassed 100,000, with more than 1,600 dead. Italy overtook China to become the second-worst affected country after the US. Italy also recorded the highest daily rise in deaths on Friday. With 969 fatalities, it was the highest one-day increase anywhere so far since the outbreak began, AFP reports. The new fatalities took the country’s total to 9,134. The number of cases topped 86,498 according to Johns Hopkins University figures. The head of the country’s national health institute warned that infections have not yet reached their peak and that lockdown measures will have to be extended. Australia stepped up enforcement of social distancing rules on Saturday. In an attempt to contain community transmission of the novel coronavirus, states across the country implemented fines, closed beaches and threatened stricter measures if people defy pleas to stay at home. The death toll from the virus rose to 14 after an elderly woman died in an aged-care facility in New South Wales, where several residents and employees have tested positive for the virus, according to NSW health officials. A global shortage of condoms is looming. The world’s biggest producer or condoms warned of a global shortage after a coronavirus lockdown forced it to shut down production. Malaysia’s Karex Bhd makes one in every five condoms globally, normally marketed internationally by brands such as Durex, supplied to state healthcare systems such as Britain’s NHS or distributed by aid programmes such as the UN Population Fund, Reuters reports. Iranian doctors say ‘hundreds’ have died after ingesting toxic methanol. An Iranian doctor said hundreds have died and thousands have been sickened from ingesting toxic methanol across the Islamic Republic out of the false belief it kills the new coronavirus. Passengers on cruise ship stranded off Panama coast issue desperate plea. Passengers on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama issued a desperate plea to be allowed to dock after four people died during a Covid-19 outbreak on board, the Guardian’s Patrick Greenfield and Erin McCormick report. Argentina saw a record jump in cases. Despite the full national lockdown declared on March 20, the country reached 690 cases and 17 deaths so far, with 101 new cases and five deaths reported Friday. The capital city of Buenos Aires is the worst hit, with 223 cases, followed by the province of Buenos Aires with 193. South Korea reports highest new cases in a week. South Korea reported 146 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest number in a week, its disease control agency said on Saturday, with the country suffering a rise in imported cases from Europe and the United States during recent days. No new domestic infections in China. China’s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases. There were 55 new cases a day earlier. Just a reminder that you can get in touch with me, Helen Sullivan, any time on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Australia stepped up enforcement of social distancing rules on Saturday to contain community transmission of the novel coronavirus, implementing fines, closing beaches and threatening stricter measures if people defy pleas to stay at home, Reuters reports. The death toll from the virus rose to 14 after an elderly woman died in an aged-care facility in New South Wales, where several residents and employees have tested positive for the virus, according to NSW health officials. The country’s total number of confirmed coronavirus cases rose by 212 to 3,378 early on Saturday, two-thirds of them in NSW and Victoria states, according to the federal heath ministry. The infection rate in Australia remains slower than in many other countries, although it is accelerating, especially in the most populous states of NSW and Victoria where more than half of the country’s 25.5 million people live. As of midnight on Saturday, all returning citizens from abroad will be put into compulsory quarantine in hotels for two weeks at the government’s expense. Military personnel will help ensure travellers comply with the new rules. Australia’s state and federal governments have sent some mixed messages about social distancing and other containment measures, leading to widespread confusion. While there is no national order to stay home, entertainment and other mass-gathering venues have been shut and authorities have urged people to cancel house parties and other social gatherings. In Victoria, police closed beaches on Saturday after hundreds of people flocked to the waterside a day earlier in a repeat of scenes the previous weekend at Sydney’s Bondi beach. Police raided a party at a backpacker hostel at Bondi on Friday night, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported. In Queensland state more than one million people headed to polling stations on Saturday for council elections, and were asked to bring their own pens and maintain distances of 1.5 metres (5 feet), the state government said. A global shortage of condoms is looming, the world’s biggest producer said, after a coronavirus lockdown forced it to shut down production. Malaysia’s Karex Bhd makes one in every five condoms globally. It has not produced a single condom from its three Malaysian factories for more than a week due to a lockdown imposed by the government to halt the spread of the virus. That’s already a shortfall of 100 million condoms, normally marketed internationally by brands such as Durex, supplied to state healthcare systems such as Britain’s NHS or distributed by aid programmes such as the UN Population Fund. The company was given permission to restart production on Friday, but with only 50% of its workforce, under a special exemption for critical industries. “It will take time to jumpstart factories and we will struggle to keep up with demand at half capacity,” Chief Executive Goh Miah Kiat told Reuters. “We are going to see a global shortage of condoms everywhere, which is going to be scary,” he said. Malaysia is Southeast Asia’s worst affected country, with 2,161 coronavirus infections and 26 deaths. The lockdown is due to remain in place at least until April 14. There are already more than 6,000 hospitalised Covid-19 patients in New York, with almost 1,600 in intensive care, AP reports. The state has logged a nation-high of 519 deaths, and has more than 44,000 confirmed cases. An Iranian doctor says hundreds have died and thousands have been sickened from ingesting toxic methanol across the Islamic Republic out of the false belief it kills the new coronavirus, AP reports. Iranian media report nearly 300 people have been killed and more than 1,000 sickened so far by ingesting methanol across the Islamic Republic, where drinking alcohol is banned and where those who do rely on bootleggers. An Iranian doctor helping the country’s Health Ministry told The Associated Press on Friday the problem was even greater, giving a death toll of around 480 with 2,850 people sickened. The poisonings come as fake remedies spread across social media in Iran, where people remain deeply suspicious of the government after it downplayed the crisis for days before it overwhelmed the country. “Other countries have only one problem, which is the new coronavirus pandemic. But we are fighting on two fronts here,” said Dr. Hossein Hassanian, an adviser to Iran’s Health Ministry who gave the higher figures to the AP. “We have to both cure the people with alcohol poisoning and also fight the coronavirus.” Brunei reported its first coronavirus death on Saturday, that of a 64-year-old man. Brunei has reported 115 cases of the virus so far, some of which were linked to a religious gathering in Malaysia that authorities said had been attended by about 16,000 people. The man who died had not attended the gathering but had a history of travel to Malaysia and Cambodia. The director of one of Haiti’s top hospitals was kidnapped on Friday, prompting staff to refuse to take in new patients in protest, as the impoverished country battles an outbreak of the novel coronavirus amid a spike in gang violence. Dr. Jerry Bitar, a surgeon, was kidnapped shortly after leaving for work at Hospital Bernard Mevs from his home in an upmarket neighborhood of the capital, hospital administrative assistant Carla Puzo told Reuters. “The relevant authorities are following the case,” a Health Ministry spokesman said. “The Bernard Mevs hospital is a trauma and critical care center and is not treating coronavirus cases currently, but could need to if the disease spreads substantially in the country, where healthcare services and sanitation infrastructure are inadequate.” Kidnappings for ransom have sharply increased this year amid a political and economic crisis in Haiti, which according to the World Bank is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Police confirmed 15 kidnapping cases in January alone. Gangs appear to strike indiscriminately, with victims ranging from Haitian schoolchildren, lawmakers and businessmen to foreign aid workers. “Hospital staff decided not to take any new cases for the time being,” Puzo said. “We will continue to look after those already here.” A crowd gathered outside the facility in solidarity with Bitar, who runs the hospital together with his twin brother, while staff chanted in unison calls for his release. Haitian media outlets also pleaded for bandits to free Bitar. Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson returned to Los Angeles on Friday after spending more than two weeks in quarantine in Australia after testing positive for the coronavirus. Hanks, a double Oscar winner and one of America’s most beloved stars, and Wilson were the first big celebrities to announce they had tested positive for the disease. They were treated in hospital in Australia and isolated themselves for a further period after leaving. Hanks’ last post on his Twitter account on Sunday said it had been two weeks since their first symptoms and that they were feeling better. Hanks was in Australia working on a movie about Elvis Presley when he announced on 11 March that he and Wilson had tested positive for the disease. Filming has since been shut down on the movie, and on hundreds of other film and television productions worldwide. A chilling video from New York records the wails of ambulance sirens on Friday night, as patients are rushed to buckling hospitals amid the coronavirus pandemic. The US has become the worst-affected country on earth, with more than 104,000 confirmed cases. New York state accounts for 44,000 of these. The video was posted to Twitter minutes ago by Pulitzer prize-winning science journalist Laurie Garrett: In the US, congress ensured that the legislation for the US$2.2tn rescue plan for American businesses creates multiple layers of accountability, despite president Donald Trump’s declaration tat “I’ll be the oversight,” when lawmakers were in the final days of drafting the plan, AP reports. The House passed the bill by voice vote on Friday and Trump immediately signed it. The new oversight system will test the relationship between the White House and Congress, which frayed after Democrats won the House and deteriorated severely during Trump’s impeachment as officials flouted requests for witnesses and documents. Trump immediately threw the oversight provisions into question, writing in a signing statement Friday night that the new law contains several provisions that raise constitutional concerns.’’ Trump said a new inspector general intended to monitor spending under the law would not be bound by requirements to report to the Congress without delay. His administration will continue the practice of treating provisions like these as “advisory and non-binding,” Trump said. Italy on Friday recorded the most daily deaths of any country since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports. Italy showed a continuing downward trend in infection rates, however. The country overtook China to become the second-worst affected country after the US. Six of the 10 countries with the highest number of infections are in Europe, including the UK, according to Johns Hopkins University figures: US: 103,942 Italy: 86,498 China: 81,897 Spain: 65,719 Germany: 50,871 France: 33,402 Iran: 32,332 United Kingdom: 14,745 Switzerland: 12,928 South Korea: 9,332 There are 597,072 cases confirmed worldwide and 27,360 deaths. South Korea reported 146 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest number in a week, its disease control agency said on Saturday, with the country suffering a rise in imported cases from Europe and the United States during recent days. Aid groups warn that without measures millions could die in low-income countries and war zones such as Syria and Yemen, where hygiene conditions are already dire, AFP reports. Across Africa, the official numbers are still relatively low with 83 deaths and over 3,200 confirmed cases on Friday, according to the African Union. But aid groups are sounding the alarm on the potentially devastating consequences of a severe outbreak in low-income and conflict-ridden countries, where healthcare systems are in tatters and hygiene conditions poor. Around the world three billion people lack access to running water and soap, which are the most basic weapons of protection against the virus, UN experts said. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres issued a stark warning last week: “If we let coronavirus spread like wildfire - especially in the most vulnerable regions of the world - it would kill millions of people.” The UN chief announced a humanitarian relief plan on Wednesday, featuring an appeal for US$2bn dollars to help the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people. As India and other South Asian nations work to stop the spread of the virus, they face another battle: reams of misinformation, AP reports. On Tuesday, Indians were ordered to stay indoors for three weeks in the worlds biggest coronavirus lockdown. In announcing the move, Modi reiterated the danger of misinformation. “I appeal to you to beware of any kind of rumours or superstitions,” the prime minister said. With the pandemic starting to gain a foothold in the region, social media sites are rife with bogus remedies, tales of magic cures and potentially hazardous medical advice. Experts are urging caution and warning that the coronavirus infodemic could have disastrous consequences. It’s a trend also seen elsewhere and governments around the world have been urging citizens not to listen to or spread rumors about the pandemic. As we continue to report on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, we’re looking for stories of how this unprecedented crisis has affected couples, families, friends and communities. If you’ve been separated from a loved one by lockdowns, have had to cancel your wedding or miss an important family event, we’d like to hear from you. We’re always interested in hearing what you may have done in response, too, or how you and your loved ones (and neighbours) are supporting each other in these trying times. Please do include photographs if you can and are happy for us to use them. Send me a message on Twitter @helenrsullivan, tag me in a tweet of your own (if you’re happy for us to include it in the blog), or email me: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. Here’s the latest from Australia, which announced its 14th coronavirus-related death on Saturday. From midnight anyone arriving at an Australian airport from overseas will be taken straight to a hotel. The Victorian and NSW premiers have explained how this will work: travellers will be given health checks and taken straight by bus to hotel rooms. They will be monitored by authorities to ensure they are adhering to quarantine and so they can be given treatment if they become unwell. They will be provided with food. Another airline support package has been announced to support regional communities that depend on aviation for medical and food supplies. The additional $198m was announced by the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, with about 140 communities relying on regional aviation. Victoria and South Australia have followed NSW in introducing on-the-spot fines for businesses and individuals breaching social distancing restrictions. Total job losses across Australia have exceeded 75,000. Queenslanders are heading to the polls for local government elections and two state byelections, with the state’s Covid-19 total now at 625. Pleas for safe harbour from stranded cruise ship near Panama Passengers on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama have issued a desperate plea to be allowed to dock after four people died during a Covid-19 outbreak on board, the Guardian’s Patrick Greenfield and Erin McCormick report. Two people have tested positive for the disease and dozens are ill with flu-like symptoms on the Zaandam luxury cruise liner, which has not been able to dock after several Latin American countries closed their ports in response to the global pandemic. Hundreds of North American, Australian and British citizens are in isolation in their rooms and a boat-to-boat operation is underway to move some healthy travellers to a sister ship, the Rotterdam, over the weekend. But there are fears that sick, elderly passengers and crew members will be left stranded at sea during a global pandemic, with some on board isolating in small, humid cabins with no natural light or fresh air. The latest leap in coronavirus cases has set a new record in Argentina, as the country braces for an expected sharp increase in cases over the coming weeks – despite the full national lockdown declared on March 20. The total has reached 690 cases and 17 deaths so far, with 101 new cases and five deaths reported Friday. The capital city of Buenos Aires is the worst hit, with 223 cases, followed by the province of Buenos Aires with 193. The country locked its borders to its own citizens even more tightly Friday, closing the northern border crossing at Foz de Iguazú to Argentinians trying to enter the country on land from Brazil. President Alberto Fernández ordered the halt of repatriation flights this week on the suspicion of persons hiding their symptoms by lying about their health and taking paracetamol to lower their fever before boarding planes. Some 15 thousand Argentinians have been left stranded abroad, mainly in Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, Peru, the US, Spain, Italy and the UK. Repatriations will be considered on a case by case basis, with travelers who left the country after March 13, when the government had already put in place its first measures against the pandemic, to be awarded the lowest priority, authorities said. A line of cheap credit for small and medium-sized companies having trouble paying wages during the lockdown was announced by Argentina’s national bank, Banco Nación, Friday. The loans carry a yearly interest rate of 24%, high by international standards, but still less than half the country’s annual inflation rate of 50%. In the US, Donuts Delite in Rochester is selling doughnuts featuring the face of Dr. Anthony Fauci’s – the doctor leading the US battle with coronavirus – surrounded by white frosting and topped off with patriotic sprinkles. The exclusive treats have been selling “like crazy” since the store put them on display Monday, according to Nick Semeraro, franchisee of the café, AP reports. It appears the city of Los Angeles inadvertently notified more than 200 people about their Covid-19 results in a mass email that included the names of all recipients, according to LA Times reporter Soumya Karlamangla: The mass email, which reportedly failed to blind copy the recipients, was informing them of negative results, according to a screenshot posted by Karlamangla, who noted this was a major privacy violation: The email came from someone listed as a contract specialist for the mayor’s office of public safety, writing on behalf of the health department’s Covid-19 response team. Spokespeople for the mayor’s office did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment this afternoon. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Friday he will maintain his busy travel schedule dedicating infrastructure projects around Mexico in spite of growing restrictions prompted by the coronavirus, including a shutdown of most federal government operations, the Associated Press reports. López Obrador took a commercial flight to the western state of Nayarit and then was heading to the northern border state of Baja California before finishing the weekend in Sinaloa. However, the president said he doesn’t want people gathering in airports to see him like they usually do to shake hands and request selfies with him. He was criticized last weekend on a similar swing in the southern state of Oaxaca for stopping to eat in a local restaurant and for urging Mexicans to continue to eat out in spite of the virus. He said Friday he would continue to evaluate the situation, but for now planned to continue travelling. Mexico reported 717 cases of the coronavirus and 12 deaths as of Friday night. And here is a tweet about Boris Johnson testing positive for coronavirus: Here’s the clip of US president Donald Trump saying on Friday that he had a conversation with UK prime minister Boris Johnson, who has tested positive for coronavirus, and “the first thing he said to me is: ‘We need ventilators’”. Trump mentioned Johnson “asking for ventilators today” twice during the Coronavirus Task Force briefing. Thirty-nine Australians who were on board the Costa Luminosa, and are now trapped in quarantine in Rome, have gotten word that at least two of their international shipmates have died, Matilda Boseley reports for the Guardian. Italian authorities demanded the group isolated for two weeks before returning to Australia after Coronavruis infections broke out on board their cruise ship. They may soon be joined by 200 Australian’s on the Costa Victoria. The Australian state of New South Wales has confirmed 212 new cases of the virus since yesterday, bringing the state total to 1,617 confirmed cases. The state is the worst-affected by the virus. NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said 84,907 people have been tested and excluded. Of those infected, 22 are in intensive care. There was a death overnight: a 91 year-old woman who was a resident of the Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care facility. The death toll in the state is now eight. Australia has the 19th-highest number of cases worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. The total number of cases is 3,378, according to the health department. From midnight on Saturday all people arriving in Australia will be put into a mandatory 14 day quarantine in hotels and other accommodation. Hospital ship arrives in LA as California braces for crisis on par with New York The Mercy hospital ship docked on Friday morning at the Port of Los Angeles, joining California’s battle against the coronavirus as the state prepares to meet New York City levels of demand on hospitals, possibly within days. The Mercy is one of two supertankers the navy converted to a floating hospital. Typically deployed to provide disaster relief, the ship has fully equipped operating rooms, a 1,000-bed hospital facility, a medical laboratory, a pharmacy, and a landing deck for military helicopters. Speaking from an afternoon press conference, with navy ships as a backdrop, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, said the Mercy was fully staffed and operational with 800 medical staffers and 12 operating rooms. It would be ready to start taking patients as early as tomorrow, Newsom said. Today, at the end of that contentious and partially accurate White House coronavirus briefing, a reporter asked Dr. Anthony Fauci – who has become a trusted figure for many Americans overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic – whether over the course of his career he had experienced anything like the past month in the United States? While the HIV/AIDS epidemic was incredibly devastating, the suffering and deaths unfolded more slowly than what people around the world are experiencing now, Fauci said. “What we’re seeing now, in actual real time, is something that’s unprecedented. This is something we have never seen before, at least in our generation. They’ve seen maybe something like this 100 years ago.” “We’re really being challenged to not only learn in real time, to be able to respond in a way that’s helpful an effective, we’re also in uncharted waters. That is the thing that I find different...” “It isn’t as if we have an example of how to do it.” During briefing, Trump feuds with state governors, makes false claims Two key moments from Trump’s coronavirus briefing earlier today. Trump tossed out barbs at state governors he said have been insufficiently gracious to him, and said he advised the vice-president, Mike Pence, just not to return their calls. (But added that Pence called them anyway.) And asked if his administration’s belated push to manufacture or obtain 100,000 ventilators meant that everyone who needed a ventilator will be able to get one, he lashed out at the reporter asking the question, calling him a “wise guy” and complaining about all the problems he had inherited. A British man has described the ‘gut-wrenching pain’ of losing his mother to coronavirus. Stuart Hamlin urges people to stay inside in an emotional video filmed hours after his mother died from the coronavirus. He describes his pain just four days after Tracy was admitted to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms. “We can’t grieve. We can’t comfort each other. We can’t hold each other. Losing someone is hard enough, but not being able to hold your family close when you do is the most gut-wrenching pain I’ve ever felt in my life,” he says. Doctors and nurses on the front lines of the US coronavirus crisis pleaded on Friday for more protective gear and equipment to treat waves of patients expected to overwhelm hospitals as the number of known U.S. infections surpassed 100,000, with more than 1,600 dead, Reuters reports. Physicians have called particular attention to a desperate need for additional ventilators, machines that help patients breathe and are widely needed for those suffering from Covid-19, the respiratory ailment caused by the highly contagious novel coronavirus. Hospitals in New York City, New Orleans, Detroit and other virus hot spots also have sounded the alarm about scarcities of drugs, medical supplies and trained staff while the number of confirmed US cases rose by 15,000 on Friday to just over 100,000. That was down slightly from more than 16,000 new cases reported on Thursday, the largest one-day US surge to date, but kept the United States as the world leader in the number of known infections, having surpassed China and Italy on Thursday. In the US, Gizmodo is reporting that a 17-year-old boy has become the first coronavirus patient to die after being denied treatment because he lacked private health insurance. The Guardian is working to verify this story. Gizmodo reports: A 17-year-old boy in Los Angeles County who became the first teen believed to have died from complications with covid-19 in the U.S. was denied treatment at an urgent care clinic because he didn’t have health insurance, according to R. Rex Parris, the mayor of Lancaster, California. “He didn’t have insurance, so they did not treat him,” Parris said in a video posted to YouTube: Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, tweeted about the news, calling it “barbaric”. China’s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases. There were 55 new cases a day earlier. The total number of infections for mainland China now stands at 81,394, with the death toll rising by 3 to 3,295, it said. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. I’ll be taking you through the next few hours of important updates and breaking new as the number of cases worldwide moves towards 600,000. Both the US and Italy now have more cases than China, with 101,657 and 86,498 respectively. You can get in touch with me on Twitter throughout the day @helenrsullivan. Before we kick off, here’s a summary of the main points so far: US President Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to built ventilators for hospitals, he announced at the White House’s daily coronavirus briefing. The Irish government has announced sweeping restrictions that will put Ireland in a de facto lockdown. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Friday evening that from midnight people should stay home for two weeks, until 12 April, in a significant tightening of curbs on social and commercial life. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro insinuated that the number of coronavirus cases was being inflated for political purposes. He added: “Some people will die. I’m sorry. That’s life.” Syria said on Friday it was banning travel between cities and governorates as part of tightening measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. Syria has recorded five cases of corona virus so far but relief agencies worry that any outbreak could be lethal after years of conflict that has ravaged its healthcare system. The UK has again recorded its biggest daily rise in coronavirus deaths. In the last 24 hours, 181 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19. It comes after 115 deaths were recorded the day before. The UK death toll stands at 759, with 14,579 confirmed cases. Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus and is exhibiting “mild symptoms”. In a video posted on Twitter, Johnson confirmed he had developed “a temperature and persistent cough” over the last 24 hours. The UK prime minister, 55, said he was now self-isolating and working from home and would continue to lead the national fightback against the virus. Matt Hancock, the UK’s health secretary, also tested positive. Spain recorded a new record single-day death toll. There have been 769 deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 4,858. The previous record was 738, between Tuesday and Wednesday this week. The country now has 64,059 confirmed cases up from 56,188 yesterday. The Spanish government has withdrawn 9,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits from use after it emerged that they had an accurate detection rate of just 30%. The number of cases in Iran has risen to 32,332, while the number of deaths hits 2,378, according to the country’s health ministry. Covid-19 continues its spread across the African continent with 3243 cases and 83 deaths now recorded. South Africa has reported its first deaths resulting from Covid-19. There are now more than 1000 cases in the country. Firefighters, retired police officers and former ambulance workers are being drafted in to help the NHS. It comes as one in five police officers are off sick or self-isolating in areas worst hit by the virus. Italy recorded the highest daily rise in deaths and has not yet reached peak, experts say. Italy had 919 new fatalities, taking the total to 9,134. The update follows a warning from the head of the country’s national health institute that infections have not yet reached their peak and that lockdown measures will have to be extended. France extended its lockdown by a fortnight. France has recorded 299 Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours, the prime minister announced in a speech. Edouard Philippe said it was clear that the country was “just at the beginning of this epidemic wave”. A spike in coronavirus patients means hospitals in and around Paris will reach saturation point within 48 hours, said the head of the French Hospital Federation. Four died on a cruise ship after the outbreak. Four people have died on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama after a Covid-19 outbreak on board, the boat’s owners have confirmed. The US approved a $2.2tn economic stimulus package. Congress has given final approval for a $2.2tn financial package designed to rush federal aid to workers, businesses and a healthcare system ravaged by the virus, after politicians united to overcome a last-minute attempt to delay its passage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2016/nov/05/new-generation-of-ethical-hackers-aims-to-impress-recruiters","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-07T11:39:30Z","webTitle":"New generation of ethical hackers aims to impress recruiters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/05/new-generation-of-ethical-hackers-aims-to-impress-recruiters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2016/nov/05/new-generation-of-ethical-hackers-aims-to-impress-recruiters","fields":{"headline":"New generation of ethical hackers aims to impress recruiters","bodyText":"With the launch of the National Cyber Security Centre, backed by £1.9bn of funding to battle online crime, the government has made a statement. Defence experts have long warned of the growing menace of cybercrime and now they have good reason to believe the threat is being given priority treatment. Recognising the danger is one thing though, dealing with it another. The world – and by extension the UK – is facing a shortage of people with the skills needed to mount an effective defence. The global cyberdefence industry is going to need another 1.5 million staff by 2020, according to non-profit security organisation (ISC)2. At the Cyber Security Challenge in London – a three-day competition designed to identify raw cybersecurity talents – recruiters are doing their best to address the shortage. Stephanie Daman, the chief executive of Cyber Security Challenge UK, believes that the UK is slowly recognising the value of ethical hackers, also known as “white hats”, the cybertroops required to protect our increasingly connected world. “We’re beginning to build a pipeline of people. But that, by its nature, is going to take a little while to come to fruition,” says Daman, who spent 17 years working for the government on security matters. In the meantime, events such as the Cyber Security Challenge are trying to address the skills gap. The event is sponsored by corporations such as PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), BT and BAE Systems, while camera-shy staff from GCHQ and the National Crime Agency look on, hoping to unearth a new generation of cyberspooks. Around half of the contestants in the challenge typically get a job out of it, while all are likely to be interviewed. Recruiters like the event because it allows people who may not shine academically to show that they can still thrive in a high-pressure, realistic scenario. Last year’s Cyber Security Challenge was fairly fanciful. It involved a bio-hazard attack and a threat against a minor royal. This year, the challenge is more grounded in reality. The contestants are asked to fight an assault on a fictional energy company, Bolt Power. They are tasked with assessing and battling an attack from “hacktivist” cybercriminals, repairing a data breach and investigating the theft of £125m. There are good reasons to be concerned about cyber-attacks on infrastructure within energy, but also in areas such as transport and telecommunications, or even hospitals. Earlier this year, Theresa May delayed a final decision on the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, and anxiety about the involvement of state-backed China General Nuclear was thought to be among the reasons for the delay. These concerns have been heightened by hacks perpetrated against, among others, semiconductor firms in the US, and suggestions that designs for narrow-body aircraft have also been targeted. Understandably, few people at the Cyber Security Challenge are willing to talk about Hinkley or point the finger at Beijing. But they are clear about the nature of the threat from state-backed groups. Kris McConkey, cybersecurity partner at PwC, is on the frontline of the war against cybercrime. His job is to make life intolerably difficult for hackers. When the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the UK must “strike back” against cyber-attacks, it was people like Kris he surely had in mind as his infantry. “A lot of cases we get called in to are where organisations find it difficult to deal with [it] themselves,” says McConkey. “A high proportion of those are attributed to state-sponsored groups.” There may still be a threat, he says, even where the state in question is only involved financially in a sensitive infrastructure project. Companies may try to set up a firewall between sensitive systems and foreign powers, but it does not always work. “A lot of organisations have tried to do it and a lot of organisations have had their fingers burned. It’s a very difficult line to walk.” “For the most part these things end up in some joint endeavour. There’s almost always a people aspect and that’s often where you get an insider placed there to gain information.” He cites a recent example where a cyber-espionage group had hidden inside a company’s network for two years, helped by a contractor the unnamed firm had hired. So how to stop this? Businesses can pass information to the security services, but they are not legally allowed to “hack back” by launching cyber-attacks themselves. But they can at least lay booby-traps to confuse and deter – a concept known as “active defence”. “One way is to go and hack the bad guys, yes. The other way is to make your network a hostile place for an attacker to break into,” says McConkey. “If you’ve got a burglar coming through your door, you want them to be standing in a house of mirrors, you want them to think there are many more systems than there are.” That may be easier said than done, but the Cyber Security Challenge is about finding out who has the requisite technical ability, as well as the decision-making and interpersonal skills needed to liaise with businesses facing a threat. Contestants are encouraged to think on their feet and a team of mischievous PwC staff sits on the sidelines, occasionally throwing cyber-attacks at the contestants themselves in a bid to trip them up. The atmosphere is tense and the contestants, many barely out of school, are feeling the heat. But despite the technical expertise on show, there is something that does not add up. Of the seven competing teams – all named after famous cryptographers – four honour brilliant women, while 24-year-old Holly Rostill oversees the day’s events in the role of game master. Lisa, 21, is a fourth-year computer science student and one of only two women competing out of 42 contestants. “This challenge is hard and it’s gradually getting harder. Some of it is more like a whodunnit. You approach it with a technical mindset, but the challenge isn’t necessarily technical.” “It’s a real-world simulation. If something breaks then the cybercriminals don’t stop. They take advantage, they get you when you’re weak.” The stark gender imbalance is all the more concerning when the talent pool needs to be as deep as possible. “There’s a horrible dearth of women in this space,” admits Daman. “Because we haven’t engaged girls and women at school and kept them engaged when they make subject choices, we’ve lost a generation of women.” Lisa, who asked for her surname to be omitted, adds: “It’s well known that the tech industry is short on women, but there’s a lot of work being done to engage women into Stem subjects [science, technology, engineering and maths]. “Maybe it’s a lack of awareness, but it is improving. Girls can do it too, we’re just as good.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/dec/31/nuclear-deal-iran-cuba-proliferation","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-31T13:15:04Z","webTitle":"A nuclear deal with Iran would mean a less volatile world | Julian Borger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/31/nuclear-deal-iran-cuba-proliferation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/31/nuclear-deal-iran-cuba-proliferation","fields":{"headline":"A nuclear deal with Iran would mean a less volatile world","bodyText":"There will be no greater diplomatic prize in 2015 than a comprehensive nuclear deal with Iran. In its global significance, it would dwarf the US detente with Cuba, and not just because there are seven times more Iranians than Cubans. This deal will not be about cash machines in the Caribbean, but about nuclear proliferation in the most volatile region on Earth. An agreement was supposed to have been reached by 24 November, but Iran and the west were too far apart to make the final leap. After nine months of bargaining, the intricate, multidimensional negotiation boiled down to two main obstacles: Iran’s long-term capacity to enrich uranium, and the speed and scale of sanctions relief. Iran wants international recognition of its right not just to enrich, but to do so on an industrial scale. It wants to maintain its existing infrastructure of 10,000 centrifuges in operation and another 9,000 on standby, and it wants to be able to scale that capacity up many times. The US and its allies say Tehran has no need for so much enriched uranium. Its one existing reactor is Russian-built, as are its planned reactors, so all of them come with Russian-supplied fuel as part of the contract. The fear is that industrial enrichment capacity would allow Iran to make a bomb’s-worth of weapons-grade uranium very quickly, if it decided it needed one – faster than the international community could react. However, the west is currently not offering large-scale, immediate sanctions relief in return for such curbs on Iran’s activity. President Barack Obama can only temporarily suspend US congressional sanctions, and western states are prepared to reverse only some elements of UN security council sanctions. The best the west can offer upfront is a lifting of the EU oil embargo. These gaps remain substantial, but none of the parties involved can walk away from the table. A collapse of talks would lead to a slide back to the edge of conflict between Iran and Israel; the latter has vowed to launch military strikes rather than allow the former to build a bomb. It could also trigger a wave of proliferation across the region and beyond as other countries hedge their bets. So the parties to the talks have given themselves more time – until 1 March 2015 – to agree a framework deal for bridging them and until 1 July to work out all of the details. They have resumed meetings in Geneva, with an emphasis on sessions between the two most important countries, the US and Iran. The trouble is that, while the diplomats inside the chamber sense that they are still making progress in closing the gaps, the sceptics back home just see deceit and playing for time by the other side. This is particularly true of the US Congress. A new Republican-controlled Senate will convene on 6 January. From that date, the White House can no longer rely on a Democratic majority leader to keep new sanctions legislation off the Senate floor. The legislation now under discussion could take the form of triggered sanctions, which would come into effect if there was no deal by a target date. That would add urgency to the negotiations, undoubtedly a good thing, but it would also provoke counter-measures from Iran’s parliament, the Majlis, and a very volatile environment. It is possible that the Republican leadership in the Senate will choose other battles to fight with the president before trying to build a veto-proof majority on sanctions, but the pressure will build exponentially if there is no deal on the table on 1 March. It could be the most important diplomatic date of the year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2016/sep/17/digested-week-david-cameron-battered-legacy-bake-off-hinkley-point","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-16T23:53:47Z","webTitle":"David Cameron's shifting legacy and food-based catastrophe – Esther Addley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/17/digested-week-david-cameron-battered-legacy-bake-off-hinkley-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/sep/17/digested-week-david-cameron-battered-legacy-bake-off-hinkley-point","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron's battered legacy and food-based catastrophe","bodyText":"Monday David Cameron famously once said he wanted to be prime minister “because I think I’d be rather good at it”. (Spoiler alert: he really wasn’t.) Even that expensively acquired self-belief may have suffered a wobble, however, given the reaction to Cameron’s announcement that he was scarpering from Westminster (sample from the Telegraph’s James Kirkup: “petulant ... no big idea... a lack of seriousness” – you get the picture). It’s been a humbling few days for the former PM, forced to watch Theresa May coolly reversing his decisions, one by one. Grammar schools, opposed by Cameron, back on the agenda. The chair of the BBC Trust Rona Fairhead, whom he reappointed, gone. Now, the lowest blow of all. The Bullingdon Club, it has emerged, is threatened with extinction because nobody wants to join. “Every reasonable person thinks it’s a joke,” said a mole. Well, yes. Like we say, not a great week for Cameron. On the other hand, this fact alone may have cheered yours immensely, so every cloud and all that. Tuesday TV audiences have inevitably been smaller for the Paralympics than last month’s Olympics, which is a shame because there’s no doubt the games have showcased plenty of sporting brilliance. Consider, for example, the T13 1500m men’s final, won by the Algerian Abdellatif Baka in a world record time of 3:48.29. Ethiopia’s Tamiru Demisse and Kenyan Henry Kirwa claimed silver and bronze, while Baka’s brother Fouad just missed a medal in fourth. Runners in the T13 category are visually impaired, which makes it particularly striking that each of the first four finishers, had they been competing in the Olympics 1500m final on 20 August, would have beaten the entire field, including Matt Centrowitz who claimed gold for the US in a snail-like time of 3:50.00. The American’s victory came in a highly tactical race that got off to an unusually slow start, but still. Did someone say “backwards and in heels”? Wednesday A big week for food-based transportation calamity headline gags, which – speaking personally – has been just about the only thing that has got me through. First, of course, there was the embarrassing pasta disaster on the A5 near Shotatton in Shropshire, where a lorry slopped 20 tonnes of spaghetti bolognese across the carriageway. Then came that incident with the tanker transporting molasses off the Cumbrian coast which – dear reader, you are ahead of me – got stuck. Is it just possible, all the same, that we have overindulged just a little on the food puns with the news that a baking programme is moving channels? I mean, crumbs, newspapers do like to rise to the challenge when faced with these ingredients, but whether we kneaded quite so many overcooked puns about the Great British Bake Off’s BBC1 departure is a matter of taste. Let’s all agree: the BBC got burned, Mel and Sue were delicious and Breadxit means Breadxit. Now can we leave it there? I’m feeling queasy. Thursday So we are, after all, to have a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point, after May declined to overturn her predecessor’s bafflingly unfavourable deal with its Chinese backers. For all their glee at the Hinkley contract, the real prize for Chinese investors is a potential new plant at Bradwell, on a sparse stretch of coast near Maldon in Essex. Bradwell, as it happens, has been of interest to incomers for some time. Just east of the power station site is a small stone building that could pass for a ramshackle old barn. It is, instead, the chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall, built by St Cedd, a missionary from Lindisfarne, in 654, which makes it probably the second oldest church in Britain. Cedd’s builder-monks reused stones from the Roman fort of Othona, and the tiny, single-roomed chapel stands at the end of an arrow-straight stretch of Roman road, with just the North Sea behind. It feels like a miraculous survival from another time, perched on the very edge of the world. Do visit before the chaps in radiation suits and the three-eyed fish take over. Friday Sometimes life writes its own punchlines. So it must seem, at least, for Rebecca Moss, who sailed from Vancouver last month on board a container ship bound for Shanghai. Moss, 25, is an “absurdist artist” and her project “23 Days at Sea” was intended to examine the comedic friction between mechanical systems and nature. In a textbook case of “be careful what you wish for”, however, the Hanjin Shipping Company, which owns the tanker, went bust on 31 August, leaving the ship stranded at sea since port operators, afraid they won’t be paid, have refused to let them dock. Meat and drink for an absurdist artist, one might think. Maybe so, but when contacted by email on Friday for an update, it was clear the comedy of the situation was wearing thin for Moss. She is looking forward, she said, to “being out of this situation and to be in a position to reflect back on it. When you are in it, the stress is hard to manage.” Friday was the day she was due to disembark; her plan was to spend a few days with collaborators in Shanghai before flying home to London. “Now this is looking somewhat unlikely.” Quite enough absurdity for one lifetime.

At the last minute, the government has hit the pause button in order to take a hard look at what Hinkley is offering in return for £37bn of energy consumers’ money. The voices of opposition are growing. Even newspapers which have supported the nuclear industry are raising doubts. Its supporters chant the same mantra: there is no alternative, Britain needs Hinkley to keep the lights on. That was the warning from the then business secretary, John Hutton, in 2008 yet the lights are still on and Lord Hutton is now the chairman of the Nuclear Industry Association. But the world - and the electricity landscape - has changed radically since 2008.Then, just 5.5% of the UK’s electricity came from renewables. It’s now 25%. Costs have plummeted – solar photovoltaic is 50% cheaper than it was in 2011, onshore wind is down 43%. More than 800,000 homes now have rooftop solar and the UK was recently ranked sixth in the world for total solar capacity - despite our weather. It is ranked first in the world for offshore wind, which is on course to supply 10% of our power by 2020, much more than Hinkley C. The cost for wind and solar is coming down too. The way we increasingly get our energy is changing. The former chief executive of the National Grid, Steve Holliday, said that the idea that we need nuclear power stations to provide baseload electricity is “outdated”. Baseload is the trump card of Hinkley’s supporters: how do we keep the lights on when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing? But the National Grid predicts that in some scenarios by 2020, small-scale and distributed generation will represent a third of total capacity in the UK. The future is more local and in our control. It will also provide more jobs and greater energy security at increasingly lower cost. Intermittent supply is already being tackled with interconnectors - basically, huge cables connecting the UK with European countries like Norway to manage variations in supply coming from renewables. They could be hugely expanded. But renewables and interconnectors are only part of the answer. Electricity demand is not constant. At peak times, there can be up to 50% more demand compared to the average – typically when people get home from work in the early evening and prepare their evening meal, especially in winter. This demand needs to be met with power generation which can be switched on, sometimes at very short notice. Hydropower does this – with reservoirs in places like Scotland, Wales and Sweden being filled up at a time of low demand, so water can be released through turbines when demand is high. Existing gas-fired plants can also be fired up at short notice, but this comes with a carbon cost. The point is to use it only when back up is required and only until alternatives become mainstream. The real leap forward will come with improved storage. You can also look at energy demand another way. Rather than building lots of extra capacity to meet intermittent peaks, could those peaks be lower by shutting down demand where and when it’s not needed? Google and Tesla are already experimenting with smart energy – managing how gadgets are switched on and off. Energy systems and the thinking behind them are changing fast. What happened in just a few years with telephones - where we moved from centralised exchanges and fixed landlines to mobile phones - is about to happen with energy systems. Hinkley is a roadblock in this transition. And then there’s the Cinderella of them all - energy efficiency. The less we use, the easier the problem is to solve. If all street lights were switched to LED bulbs we could take half a GW of demand off the grid with ease. If all homes did the same, we’d save 2.7GW of power at peak use - that’s nearly the equivalent of Hinkley by just changing the lightbulbs. The UK has come a long way since 2008 – the year parliament passed the Climate Change Act, which committed the UK to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. We are already halfway there with emissions down 40%. A low-carbon future is essential. So is energy security and affordable energy.

The move would not cause the lights to go out, would cut both carbon emissions and air pollution and would boost cleaner energy projects, according to a report from Bright Blue, a thinktank of Tory modernisers. The report also concludes that if the troubled Hinkley C nuclear plant is cancelled it could be replaced by renewable energy. Overall, the report found that encouraging renewable energy, energy efficiency, storage and electricity interconnectors to other countries would benefit energy bills and security of supply, as well as tackling climate change. Energy secretary Amber Rudd pledged in November to phase out unabated coal burning by 2025, a move that was widely praised. But the government has also cut solar power subsidies, blocked onshore wind farms, cut support for energy efficiency and cancelled a £1bn carbon capture and storage project. “Thanks to a Conservative government, the UK is now committed to taking dirty, polluting coal out of our energy mix completely,” said Barker. “So we should take maximum advantage of this bold move. The government should give investors [building greener energy projects] even greater certainty and with that, put UK plc firmly at the forefront of the global drive for clean and smart energy technologies.” The new report includes analysis by Aurora Energy Research of how closing coal plants early might affect the nation’s security of supply. This included a “high stress” scenario in which the expansion of renewables is slow, Hinkley C is cancelled and coal power stations close early. “Despite what some exaggerated claims suggest, a coal phase out even under a ‘high stress’ scenario, will not result in the lights going out,” said Ben Caldecott, author of the report and associate fellow of Bright Blue. “Our analysis shows the significant benefits for pollution and system security of further encouraging renewables, interconnection, storage, demand side response and energy efficiency.” The report said there is “plenty of time” under each scenario to commission any new gas power stations needed to keep the lights on. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate change said: “The government is absolutely committed to phasing out power production from unabated coal and we are the first country to set an end date for doing so. We will consult on how we plan to do this in the coming months.” The report said: “The UK should [take] the lead in promoting coal phase-out internationally. The UK has significant technical and moral leadership it can deploy to encourage other countries to agree to a coordinated phased approach for closing down coal-fired power stations. The world’s climate future really does hinge on what other countries do with their coal fleets.” On Hinkley, the report said: “The future of Hinkley Point C nuclear power station appears to be highly uncertain. Should the project not materialise, renewables can easily fill the capacity gap in the late 2020s. This should be ‘Plan B’.” It noted the fast build time and rapidly falling cost of renewable energy and said: “The ability of these technologies to deliver this capacity is already impressive and will be even more so in the mid to late 2020s.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2017/jan/31/theresa-may-further-alienate-eu-donald-trump-brexit-best-buddy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2017-01-31T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"May manages to further alienate EU with Trump as her Brexit best buddy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/31/theresa-may-further-alienate-eu-donald-trump-brexit-best-buddy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2017/jan/31/theresa-may-further-alienate-eu-donald-trump-brexit-best-buddy","fields":{"headline":"May manages to further alienate EU with Trump as her Brexit best buddy","bodyText":"Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing, a summary of developments as Britain edges towards the EU exit door. If you’d like to receive it as a weekly early morning email, please sign up here. A quick heads-up: the Guardian’s latest in-depth Brexit means ... podcast is out now, and you can listen to it here. This time we look at what Brexit could mean for the UK’s multibillion-pound financial services industry – and hear from some EU rivals who are eager to capitalise. Also this: producing the Guardian’s independent, in-depth journalism takes a lot of time and money. We do it because we believe our perspective matters – and it might well be your perspective, too. If you value our Brexit coverage, become a Guardian Supporter and help make our future more secure. Thank you. The big picture Barely 48 hours after the supreme court ruled that the government would have to obtain the consent of parliament before it could trigger article 50 – though not, to No 10’s relief, of the devolved assemblies – there the draft law was. The EU (notification of withdrawal) bill, all two clauses and 137 words of it, aims to “confer power on the prime minister to notify, under article 50(2) of the treaty on European Union, the UK’s intention to withdraw from the EU”. Parliament will get just five days to debate the bill – far from enough for some MPs. Many are also upset that the formal policy paper on Brexit, reluctantly promised by the government, is not certain to be published before the vote. In case you missed it, May then went to the US to rekindle the “special relationship”. The UK and US were “100% behind Nato”, but she and Donald Trump looked out of step on Russia – and the “UK-US trade negotiation agreement” they signed is, at this stage, just a promise. For some, it all smacked a little of desperation. Having tossed away her keys to the EU single market, as my colleague Jonathan Freedland put it, May “will soon be homeless” – and Trump knows it: He will have seen May as that most desperate of creatures: the house buyer who rashly sold her old house before she had found a new one. For all the niceties, he will have seen May as a sucker who needs to make a deal. And he will look forward to naming his price. Not to mention, of course, that no sooner was she back in London – via Istanbul – than the prime minister was forced to confront the consequences of Trump’s anti-Muslim travel ban and the outrage it provoked. With its chosen best Brexit buddy as untameable and as unpredictable as this, it begins to look like life outside the EU may not be quite such smooth sailing as the government hoped ... The view from Europe There is a real risk that by pursuing close ties – particularly on trade – with Trump, Britain will end up poisoning good relations with the rest of the EU at a time when it most needs them. The Centre for European Reform’s Charles Grant put it this way: The more that British ministers cosy up to Trump and avoid criticising his worst excesses, and the more the president’s pronouncements ... reveal a worldview far from that of the Europeans (including the British), the more alien the British appear to other Europeans, and the more their soft power erodes. EU officials and diplomats warned last week that pursuing trade talks with non-EU countries risked undermining the UK’s efforts to negotiate a favourable Brexit deal and may also be illegal. The French presidential hopeful Emmanuel Macron painted an even darker long-term picture, saying Britain had always “lived in an equilibrium with Europe” but now risked “becoming a vassal state ... the junior partner of the United States”. Guy Verhofstadt, the EU parliament’s chief negotiator, made clear that cosying up to the US would not be viewed kindly on the continent. Trump and his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, were determined to break up the EU and were actively working towards exit referendums in Berlin and Paris, Verhofstadt said, “hoping for a disintegration of the EU”. Mario Giro, Italy’s deputy foreign minister, meanwhile, warned that Britain and the EU were heading into an “economic cold war” over Brexit – and that there were more hardliners against the UK than it appeared. Meanwhile, back in Westminster Or Cardiff, actually, where May had the tricky task of telling the leaders of the devolved assemblies of Scotland and Wales – along with the DUP’s Arlene Foster and Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill, thanks to the collapse of the Northern Ireland administration – that they would, in effect, have no say on the post-EU world. This was the final meeting before the likely triggering of article 50 of the joint ministerial committee, a pre-existing talking shop given a new lease of life for talks about how Brexit can be managed across the various parts of the UK. Scotland and Northern Ireland voted against Brexit, while the two biggest parties in Wales want continued access to the single market. Before the talks, however, May said she had a mandate to “secure the right deal for the whole of the UK”. Translation? No favours, no veto. The most probable result is May going into Brexit negotiations with only the backing of one of the UK’s four constituent parts. Back in London, one of the few constants of the Brexit process has been Labour’s travails over finding a coherent response to it, and this week was no exception. After Jeremy Corbyn confirmed he would seek the maximum level of party discipline to oblige his MPs to vote for the article 50 bill, a number of backbenchers rebelled and two frontbenchers stepped down. Even thousands of ordinary members were not happy. Undaunted, Corbyn said he understood the worries, but warned that shadow cabinet ministers who did not fall into line could expect to lose their jobs. Labour’s Brexit travails are far from over. You should also know ... Car manufacturers and retailers insisted the UK must keep some benefits of the single market and customs union after Brexit. The UK’s top post-Brexit trade deal negotiator will be paid £160,000 a year – more than the prime minister. Applications by EU nationals to study at UK universities have fallen by 7% since the referendum. Theresa May held talks with Ireland’s taoiseach, Enda Kenny, over Irish fears of a “hard border” with Northern Ireland after Brexit. The new Hinkley Point C nuclear power station will be delayed because Brexit will involve leaving Euratom, Europe’s atomic power treaty. The Institute for Government said interdepartmental squabbles, low staffing levels and “big challenges” were hindering Brexit progress. About 900,000 British citizens live in other EU countries – fewer than the 1.2 million previously thought, the Office for National Statistics said. Unite for Europe, an umbrella group of remain campaigners, plans the biggest march seen in modern UK history on 25 March. Almost half of exports from UK cities go to the EU, compared with just 15% to the US and 4% to China, the Centre for Cities thinktank said. Read this: In the Guardian, John Harris urges Labour MPs to think twice before they follow their leader’s instructions and vote to trigger article 50. Trump, who was not in office when the UK voted to leave the EU, leaves the UK facing a fork in the road, Harris says. Hard Brexit and Trump, or Europe: At a moment so freighted with historic significance, when the UK may be about to trade in an enduring alliance with Europe for a role as the ally of a truly terrifying US president, will it really be Labour MPs’ choice to back the most reckless course imaginable? In the Financial Times (paywall), Gideon Rachman makes a similar point, arguing that Trump is a disaster for Brexit because Britain will no longer be able to look to the US for support after its divorce from the EU: Were it not for Brexit, the UK government would be able to take an appropriately wary approach to Mr Trump ... As it is, Britain has been thrown into the arms of an American president that the UK’s foreign secretary has called a madman. The Emperor Nero has now taken power in Washington – and the British are having to smile and clap as he sets fires and reaches for his fiddle. Back at the Guardian, Jo Stevens explains why she is resigning from the shadow cabinet to vote against the triggering of article 50: There have been no clear guarantees about protecting single market access, employment, environmental and consumer rights, security and judicial safeguards and the residency rights of many of my constituents and others across Britain ... I can’t change how I feel about this.

At Monday’s Trident debate in parliament, when Brighton’s Green MP Caroline Lucas dared to suggest that Britain’s possession of nuclear weapons encouraged their proliferation, our new prime minister Theresa May’s response was contemptible. “Sadly [Lucas], and some members of the Labour party, seem to be the first to defend the country’s enemies,” May declared, summoning the political ghost of George W Bush and his infamous judgment that “Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.” Given she was being smeared as borderline treasonous, Lucas’s response was dignified and restrained: “How dare you,” she mouthed. Those of us who believe Britain could set an example by disposing of its nuclear weapons should have the humility to accept we have not convinced the majority of people in this country, including those whose jobs currently depend on Trident and who have not been persuaded about an alternative economic plan. We have to at least start from there. That does not mean the compelling argument for unilateral disarmament should not be heard, or that it should be subjected to McCarthyite smears. Take this argument: “Nuclear weapons have shown themselves to be completely useless as a deterrent to the threats and scale of violence we currently face or are likely to face, particularly international terrorism. Our independent deterrent has become virtually irrelevant, except in the context of domestic politics.” Jeremy Corbyn at the despatch box yesterday? No: that would be Field Marshall Lord Bramall and two other senior generals. Or this: “Strategic nuclear weapons have no military use. It would seem the government wishes to replace Trident simply to remain a nuclear power.” Which firebrand radical said this? Major General Patrick Cordingley, who headed UK forces during the Gulf war. Former supporters of Britain’s nuclear weapons – like David Owen and Michael Portillo – are among those who have since recanted. Even Tony Blair considered the force of the “common sense and practical argument against Trident. Yesterday’s debate was about deploying Trident as a weapon of mass destruction against the Labour party. The results were, indeed, explosive, with Labour parliamentarians openly turning on each other. But rather committing Britain to long-term multilateral nuclear disarmament, the government’s motion – that we retain a nuclear arsenal for “as long as the global security situation demands” - is vague enough to mean “indefinitely”. Politicians are often ridiculed for abstaining, but MPs such as Labour’s defence secretary Clive Lewis and Emily Thornberry were absolutely right to do so. This was a trap, nothing else, and an attempt to play politics with a critical issue, which should be treated with contempt. But should Labour go to the wall on this? On so many issues, the left has the support either of the majority, or at least a huge portion of the population: higher taxes on the rich, challenging the power of big business, investment rather than cuts, a housebuilding programme, increased workers’ rights, a publicly run and properly funded NHS, opposition to calamitous foreign wars like Iraq. Nuclear disarmament would free up money better spent on conventional weapons and public services – but it isn’t a precondition to an alternative to cuts. Nuclear weapons are a totemic issue for much of the British left: unlike, say, France, whose Communist party declared in 1977 that nuclear weapons were necessary “to neutralise any possible imperialist nuclear blackmail.” Prominent backers of Corbyn – from Unite to the journalist Paul Mason – support some form of nuclear arsenal. If Trident becomes the defining issue of the impending Labour leadership contest, that will further complicate Labour’s already imperilled chance of winning popular support. The debate must instead focus on the issues that millions of people actually care about, and on policies they are sympathetic towards. If unilateral nuclear disarmament becomes the one clear policy where the electorate are actually clear where Labour stands – the one key issue that cuts through – then the party’s electoral prospects are bleak indeed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2015/nov/12/turning-up-the-heat-on-amber-rudd-over-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-12T19:32:28Z","webTitle":"Turning up the heat on Amber Rudd over renewable energy | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/12/turning-up-the-heat-on-amber-rudd-over-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/12/turning-up-the-heat-on-amber-rudd-over-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Turning up the heat on Amber Rudd over renewable energy","bodyText":"Amber Rudd admits the UK doesn’t have the right policies to meet the UK’s renewable energy targets (Rudd criticised after leak reveals renewables failure, 10 November), but she is clutching at straws to try to transfer the burden on to transport and renewable heat, while sacrificing a popular grassroots movement that could bring about a real transition to a low-carbon economy, under the guise of protecting taxpayers. Hundreds of small volunteer groups that engage communities in combating the causes of climate change by creating their own sustainable energy social enterprises are threatened. If heat is to replicate the success story of solar power, this sector needs more support rather than less. In defending the support given to EDF and its Chinese backers, Ms Rudd may be saving a few pounds of taxpayers’ money now, but she is leaving a legacy of huge increases in electricity bills over the next 45 years. Soaring electricity bills will add urgency to developments in battery technology, already incentivised by the electrifying of road transport, which are key to making the variable output of renewable energy systems viable as an alternative to expensive nuclear power. As storage-based renewable technologies become more competitive we will see communities developing their own micro-grid solutions and going off-grid, rather than paying the high cost of nuclear power. Ms Rudd needs a strategy, not political rhetoric. James Tod Skipton, North Yorkshire • Your reference to “a global temperature rise of more than 2C, considered to be the threshold for dangerous climate change” (Stern: Paris talks could be EU’s last chance to save planet, 9 November) is dangerously misleading. The scientific consensus is that exceeding 2C is probably catastrophic, not that up to 2C is safe. A rise of 2C is expected to inundate cities, displace hundreds of millions of people, cause widespread desertification, cut food production, lead to large-scale species extinctions, and generate weather extremes such as storms, floods and droughts.

The Labour MP Mary Creagh told Gove on the BBC’s Daily Politics: You are elected by people in Surrey to represent them and yet you talk about your job being to generate news, not to stand up to some of the outrageous things Trump has said. There was nothing in your interview about his comments on women, which I find disgraceful. I think it creates real questions about this second job you have got. On Twitter Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, said: And Sayeeda Warsi, the former Conservative party chairman, used Twitter to criticise Gove for endorsing someone which such a poor record on issues like gender and racial equality. She also tweeted this, appearing to endorse the headline on a critical article about the interview written by the Guardian’s Jonathan Freedland. A quick trade deal with the US under Donald Trump could mean harsh compromises on issues such as the environment and food safety, campaigners and politicians including the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg have warned. The CBI has said that Britain risks a “disorderly crash landing” if it assumes it can safely walk away from troublesome Brexit talks. Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI’s director general, spoke out in an interview with the Guardian as the Policy Exchange thinktank published a report saying the government should go for a “clean Brexit”, leaving the single market and the customs union. The reports authors, economists Gerard Lyons and Liam Halligan, say: We need key planks of the UK’s future relationship with the EU to be clear as soon as possible. Chief among those is that we must leave the Customs Union and the Single Market. Declaring ‘Clean Brexit’ now, and putting it at the forefront of our thinking, helps avoid a dramatic policy change overnight for which we are unprepared. It offers businesses greater certainty about the future. It also means we can walk away from the Article 50 negotiations if the EU does not offer us a good enough deal without endangering our economy. Less than a third of voters trust the government’s so-called “Three Brexiteers” to “do what is right” regarding Brexit, a poll suggests. As the Press Association reports, foreign secretary Boris Johnson (26%), Brexit secretary David Davis (24%) and international trade secretary Liam Fox (20%) trailed Theresa May in the trust ratings, although she also lacked majority support and attracted 36% of support among respondents. In a separate question, May’s trust rating following the EU referendum was 35% compared to 23% for Jeremy Corbyn - with the Labour leader having scored 28% in 2016 - while Johnson dropped from 43% in 2014 to 24% in 2017. A government review of a Scottish business model has been launched following allegations linking it to a $1bn US dollar fraud. As the Press Association reports, the UK Government review will examine limited partnerships across the country, particularly focusing on Scotland. Scottish limited partnerships (SLPs) have their own “legal personality” enabling them to hold assets, borrow money from banks and enter into contracts - unlike limited partnerships elsewhere in the UK - which is allegedly leading to exploitation by criminals. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. In the Commons the Labour MP Ian Austen used a point of order to pay tribute to Prof Anthony King, the political scientist and broadcaster who died last week. Austen was taught by him at the University of Essex, and he said that King also taught John Bercow, the Speaker, Priti Patel, the international development secretary, and the Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh. But Bercow was the only one of them to get a first, Austen said. Bercow thanked Austen for raising the issue. He went on: Colleagues will doubtless have noted that Prof Anthony King died last week, aged 82, after a stellar career and vocation as one of the most distinguished political scientists of this generation. He was a brilliant teacher. He was an outstanding communicator, not least on television in his analysis of byelections. And he was a prodigious and illuminating writer. Personally I feel every day a sense of gratitude to Tony for what he did for me - and, God, I must have been an awkward student to teach 30 years ago - and he stuck with me, and I’m hugely grateful ... Tony King was a great man who did wonders for the study and teaching of political science in the United Kingdom and we should honour his memory. A potent warning from the student movement in Northern Ireland today about the political crisis at Stormont and the collapse of the power sharing government. Fergal McFerran, president of the National Union of Students/Union of Students in Ireland, has said the imminent end of the cross community government would convince young educated people from the region never to come back home. McFerran said: Today I am reflecting on the thousands of young people who leave Northern Ireland to make a future for themselves elsewhere. The majority of those young people will never return. Looking at the state of affairs as they are, why would they? An increasing number of people look to Stormont and see nothing that relates to their lives in any meaningful way. We are treading dangerous territory where people question the value of devolution and its capacity to improve our society. That is an appalling place for us to be. The Institute for Government thinktank has published a report today calling for the tax-making process to be simplified. It supports the government’s plan to abolish the autumn statement and have just one budget statement a year and it says budgets should contain fewer measures which are better thought out. The report includes these charts to justify the IfG’s claim that new taxes are proliferating. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lifted UK growth forecasts for 2017 saying better-than-expected economic performance in the wake of the Brexit vote raised prospects for the year ahead, the Press Association reports. However, a simultaneous downgrade to the IMF’s forecast for 2018 is pointing to a slowdown in Britain’s productivity. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF said it now expects the UK economy to grow by 1.5% this year, marking a 0.4% upward revision to forecasts made in October. The UK is among a number of countries - including the Germany, Japan and Spain - to see growth forecasts raised “mostly on account of a stronger-than-expected performance during the latter part of 2016,” the report stated. “Preliminary third-quarter growth figures were somewhat stronger than previously forecast in some economies, such as Spain and the United Kingdom, where domestic demand held up better than expected in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.” The IMF has downgraded its UK forecasts for 2018 by 0.3%, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2018 now expected to come in at 1.4%. The IMF is also warning that Donald Trump’s protectionism could be a threat to the world economy. Downing Street has welcomed Donald Trump’s pledge to seek a rapid trade deal with the UK after Brexit while stressing that only limited discussions are possible before the departure from the EU is finalised. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, is set to become richer by £14.5m after Hotcourses, the educational listings company he co-founded in 1990, was sold to an Australian firm. Sinn Fein has declined to re-nominate a Stormont deputy first minister in a move set to collapse the powersharing executive in Belfast and trigger a snap election. As the Press Association reports, barring a highly unlikely u-turn by the republican party, the institutions will now fall at 5pm on Monday and Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire will be legally obliged to call the election. The Welsh government has unveiled legislation it plans to put through the Welsh assembly to stop the curbs on public sector strikes in the Trade Union Act applying in Wales. EU citizens could have their lives turned upside down with bank accounts closed, employment terminated and rental agreements revoked if their current rights to reside in the UK are not guaranteed after Brexit, a leading immigration lawyer has warned. The Labour peer Stewart Wood has written a good blog 15 things things we’ve leant from the Trump/Gove interview. My colleague Jonathan Freedland has a good article on the Trump/Gove interview. Here’s an excerpt. Above all, the Gove/Trump encounter provides a useful glimpse into what the future of direct media accountability of the US president will look like. You can see why Trump Tower granted the former minister his hour. It’s the same reason Trump gives regular access to Sean Hannity of Fox News. He would prefer to be questioned only by those who are ideological sympathisers. Gove provided regular reassurance of that, seeing no reason to challenge Trump on anything. So when the new president slammed the invasion of Iraq, Gove was too polite to note that Trump is on tape supporting that decision. (“Are you for invading Iraq?” Trump was asked on 11 September 2002. His reply: “Yeah, I guess so.”) The MP was similarly happy to let the billionaire assert that the EU’s uselessness was proved by the fact that he was blocked from building a sea wall to protect a Trump golf course on the Irish coast from the effects of the same climate change Trump calls a “hoax”. And here is the piece in full. On the Daily Politics Jo Coburn effectively accused Michael Gove of asking Donald Trump soft questions. Here is a summary of the Number 10 lobby briefing. Downing Street played down the prospects of a trade deal with the US being signed as soon as the UK leaves the EU. The prime minister’s spokeswoman said that the government welcomed Trump’s comments about an early trade deal. But she also said that Britain would respect its obligations while it remained a member of the EU, and that these prevented EU member states from entering into free trade agreements. She said “scoping discussions” about a deal could take place before the UK left, but she did not challenge suggestions that these would not amount to full trade negotiations. Number 10 refused to support Trump’s plan to introduce “extreme vetting” for Muslims entering the US. In his Times interview Trump said this policy would apply to Muslims entering the country from places with terrorist problems. He told the newspaper: There will be extreme vetting, it’s not gonna be like it is now, they don’t even, we don’t even have real vetting. The vetting into this country is essentially non-existent as it is, as it was at least, with your country. Asked if the UK government supported this, the spokeswoman said there would be much greater opportunity to learn about the policies of the new administration once Trump takes office. Britain would want to discuss “a whole range of issues” with the president then, she said. The spokeswoman indicated that May does not share Trump’s views about the future of the EU. “We want to see a strong, successful European Union,” the spokeswoman said. But Trump is neutral about the survival of the EU (see 10.12am) and he told the Times that he expected other countries to leave and that it would be “very hard to keep it together”. The spokeswoman said May was not bothered about the fact that Trump had shown Michael Gove the letter May sent her at Christmas. May also sent Trump a copy of Churchill’s address to the American people in 1941, after Pearl Harbour, and May told Trump what Churchill said in the speech about the “unity and fraternal association” between the UK and the US then applied as much today. The Times has published a photograph of May’s letter. Asked about this, the spokeswoman said: [Trump] was delighted to receive a gift. Often when you are delighted to receive a gift, you tell people about it. The spokeswoman hinted that May’s Brexit speech tomorrow might amount to the full Brexit plan promised by the government. In December last year the government agreed to publish a plan for Brexit before article 50 is invoked. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, tolds MPs that it would not be published before February. Many MPs want it to comprise a lengthy white paper, but Davis refused to say what form it would take when giving evidence to MPs in December. Asked if the government was still planning to publish a plan at some point after May’s speech, the spokeswoman said that May would be setting out more details tomorrow and that people should wait for that. The spokeswoman also refused to rule out a document of some kind being published alongside the speech tomorrow. The spokeswoman played down the prospect of ministers or officials debriefing Gove to learn more about Trump. The government had “strong lines of communication” with Trump already, she said. Number 10 reaffirmed Philip Hammond’s threat that the government could slash business taxes in the UK if the EU failed to offer a good Brexit deal. Hammond made this point in an interview with a German newspaper released at the weekend. Asked if Theresa May agreed, her spokeswoman said: We want to remain in the mainstream of recognisable, European-style taxation systems. But if we are forced to do something different if we can’t get the right deal, then we stand ready to do so. But the spokeswoman rejected claims that Hammond’s comments amounted to a threat to reconfigure the welfare system. In his interview Hammond said: We are on the US end of the European spectrum, but we do have an open-market economy with a social model that is recognisably the European social model that is recognisably in the mainstream of European norms, not US norms. And most of us who had voted remain would like the UK to remain a recognisably European-style economy with European-style taxation systems, European-style regulation systems etcetera. I personally hope we will be able to remain in the mainstream of European economic and social thinking. But if we are forced to be something different, then we will have to become something different. But the spokeswoman said that it would be wrong to read what Hammond said as applying to welfare. The spokeswoman refused to say what May thought about the fact that three of her Brexit interventions have led to falls in the value of the pound. (See 9.08am.) “There’s a long-standing policy of not commenting on the currency,” the spokeswoman said. She also refused to confirm reports saying some in Number 10 expect her speech to lead to what they call a “market correction” (ie, a devaluation). May spoke to Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland’s first minister, and Martin McGuinness, her Sinn Fein deputy, this morning about the crisis affecting the Northern Ireland assembly, the spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman said May “wanted to encourage them to take what time is left today to try to find a resolution”. The spokeswoman said that the NHS plans to increase the amount it recovers from foreigners who are treated in hospitals in this country. Some £289m a year is recovered now, and this is due to go up to £500m by the middle of this parliament, she said. This question was prompted by the story about a hospital being left with a bill for £350,000 after it treated a Nigerian woman who had complications when giving birth to twins. Britain has raised concerns with the authorities in Bahrain over the execution of three men found guilty of a deadly bomb attack on police in the Gulf state, the spokeswoman said. The execution by firing squad of the Shiite men on Sunday has been condemned by human rights groups and sparked outrage among opponents of the Sunni-ruled government. Asked about this, the spokeswoman said: Clearly, we have concerns about the situation there. We are firmly opposed to the death penalty. The foreign secretary [Boris Johnson] raised this specific issue with the Bahrain government in a phone call ahead of the weekend. Richard Tice, the co-chair of Leave Means Leave, has just told BBC News that it is “nonsense”, legally and practically, for Number 10 to argue that the UK cannot start formal trade talks with the US while it remains a member of the EU. I’m just back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. These are probably the two best lines. Number 10 reaffirmed Philip Hammond’s threat that the government could slash business taxes in the UK if the EU failed to offer a good Brexit deal. Downing Street played down the prospects of a trade deal with the US being signed as soon as the UK leaves the EU. UPDATE: There is now a full summary of the lobby briefing here, at 1.13pm. During the 2015 Labour leadership campaign Jeremy Corbyn said he was opposed to building new nuclear power stations. But this stance creates problems for Labour in the Copeland byelection (Sellafield is the most important employer in Copeland) and in an interview with Andrew Marr yesterday (pdf) Corbyn shifted his stance, indicating that he would back plans for a new nuclear power station in the constituency at Moorside. He told Marr: I want to make sure there’s an energy mix in this country. We have to first of all make sure there is sufficient energy supplies and there has to be an energy platform. So what happens in Moorfield is pretty key to ensuring that actually happens. This morning the Green party has attacked him for this. Jonathan Bartley, the Green party co-leader, said: Jeremy Corbyn’s defeatist attitude will no doubt be a massive disappointment to the many people across the country who don’t believe that dirty, expensive nuclear power is the way forward. We know that alternatives to nuclear exist – and that renewable power will provide more jobs than this redundant technology of the past. Labour’s U-turn leaves the Greens as the only party who will be fielding an anti-nuclear candidate in the Copeland by-election. We’ll have our plans for a clean energy revolution at the heart of our campaign, as well as protecting the NHS and maintaining a close relationship with Europe. I’m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. The full transcript of Michael Gove’s interview with Donald Trump which has gone up on the Times’ website (paywall) shows that Gove gave the president-elect a copy of his book Celsius 7/7 about Islamist extremism. Gove described it as a book on how to fight terrorism. Trump replied: Good, I’d love that. That’s fantastic - how to fight terrorism. I can use that. Michael Gove has given several interviews this morning about his Trump interview. Here are the key points he has been making. Gove said that Donald Trump wanted a UK-US trade deal “signature ready” for when Britain left the EU in 2019. (See 8.55pm.) Gove said he believed an expert analysis saying a UK-US trade deal could increase jobs and growth “significantly”. I’ve been impressed by work that has been done by Shanker Singham of the Legatum Institute [a thinktank] who is probably at the moment in Britain the leading expert on trade deals, and he’s pointed out that it would be possible for Britain to conclude a deal not just with America but with other countries like New Zealand, whose prime minster was here recently ... Shanker Singham has concluded that such a deal could increase Britain’s GDP and jobs and growth significantly. There are some experts whom one does not automatically follow, but I’m inclined to believe that Shanker Singham and the work the Legatum Institute has done points the way to a successful trade relationship between Britain and other countries. In his final sentence he is alluding to his famous comment about Britain having had enough of experts who get things wrong. Gove said Trump a proprietorial interest in Brexit. He feels a sort of sense of ownership of our decision to leave the European Union, because he predicted it and he was one of the few international figures to back our leaving the European Union. Now he says that he wants to make a success of it. Gove played down the fact that Trump refused to say yes when Gove put it to him that the UK would be in the front of the queue for a trade deal with the US after Brexit. Trump said it was a mistake for President Obama to say the UK would be at the back of the queue. Gove then put it to him that the UK would be at the front of the queue. Trump replied: “I think you’re doing great. I think it’s going great.” When it was put to him that this did not sound like a yes, Gove replied: One of the things about interviewing President Trump is that he does not like anyone putting words into his mouth. So when you ask a question, it’s as much a prompt to the next flow of information and rhetoric as anything else. Gove also said it thought it was possible to “read what it is that [Trump] wants. When asked if he felt he could trust Trump, he replied: “I can’t make a window into Donald Trump’s soul. But what I can tell is that was enthusiastic about Brexit.” Gove said he did not believe that Trump wanted to destabilise the EU. When asked if he thought this was Trump’s intention, he said no. But he also implied that he thought Trump was neutral about whether the EU survived. Until now, American administrations have always supported the EU. But Gove said: We asked Donald Trump what his view as directly about the European Union. Did he believe that it was better for America for there to be a strong European Union or stronger individual nation states? And he said that, in a sense, that he did not have a strong view either way about the future of Europe from America’s point of view. He said specifically that he felt that the European Union had been created in order to have a rival trade bloc to America. But he concentrates on what’s right for America. Gove dismissed suggestions that he could be Britain’s next ambassador to Washington. When this was put to him by Today’s Sarah Montague, he laughed. Then he went on: I think you can probably tell from my instinctive reaction to that that, wonderful though the Foreign Office is, it is probably better off without me as one of its ambassadors. We have got Kim Darroch doing a fantastic job in Washington, by all accounts. Certainly, from the encounters I have had with him, he is a first-class diplomat. Gove said that he thought Theresa May was doing an “exemplary job” as prime minister. He said they last spoke in a private meeting before Christmas. Gove would not say what they said to each other. He said he did not agree with Trump’s claim that the EU refugee crisis was the reason for people voting to leave the EU. He said he thought Lord Ashcroft’s analysis explained best why people voted for Brexit. Gove said that, while he could not defend some of the things Trump has said and done, he found him an “engaging” personality. He said Trump was a “big, bombastic personality”. When you actually meet him, yes he is an electric figure - charismatic - but also he is warmer ... close up than you would imagine. Gove said Trump was a deal-maker who wanted the best deal for both sides. Everything that he says is in capital letters and in glowing gold, but then he also, when he gets into the room, looks at the spreadsheet and tries to get the best possible outcome for both sides ... He is a businessman. The important thing about any world leader dealing with Donald Trump is to think ‘How can I get a deal that suits us both?’. He said Trump had a “soft spot” for Britain. His mum comes from Scotland and he has a soft spot for Scotland particularly but Britain generally. The Times has just published a full transcript of the Gove/Trump interview on its website (paywall). I will be taking a look at it and posting any lines that we have not already picked up in our coverage of the interview. Theresa May is giving a speech on Brexit tomorrow and advance briefing suggests it will firm up suggestions that the UK will be leaving the single market and the customs unions. For at least the third time, a Brexit intervention by May has sent the pound heading south. My colleague Nick Fletcher is covering this on the business live blog. Unless you have managed to avoid all news this morning, you’ll know by now that Donald Trump has given an interview to the Times and that it was conducted by Michael Gove, the former justice secretary and former Vote Leave leader who was sacked by Theresa May when she became prime minister. This is how the Times has presented. And here is the Guardian’s overnight follow-up story. Gove has been giving interviews this morning and, on the Today programme, he firmed up the line that Trump wants to negotiate a trade deal with the UK quickly. The president-elect wanted a deal that would be “signature ready” by 2019, when the UK is due to leave the EU, Gove said. (The UK cannot sign one while it is still a member.) Gove said: Judging from both the interview and also from the conversation that we had off the record, he wants to see Theresa May as quickly as possible, he wants to invite her to the White House as quickly as possible, and then lay the groundwork for a deal. My understanding - I have to stress I’m no expert in trade negotiations - is that we have to wait until Britain has concluded its divorce from the European Union before we can sign any new deal. But I think the president-elect wants to have something signature ready at the earliest possible opportunity, and I think there are two reasons for that. Firstly, he sees real economic benefits for both Britain and America in forging this deal. The other things is that he feels a certain, what’s the word, sympathy for Britain as a result of our decision to leave the European Union. I will post more from Gove’s interview soon. Meanwhile, here is a Guardian summary of what Trump said in the interview. And here is a story about Trump criticising Angela Merkel’s refugee policy. May is due to deliver her big speech on Brexit tomorrow, but we’ve got a Number 10 lobby briefing at 11am, and so we should get some reaction to Trump then. Otherwise, the diary is relatively empty. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it.

Sober and commonsensical, she behaves with the moral seriousness we expect from a vicar’s daughter. She may be a little clunky, but what a relief it is to have a straightforward leader from the heart of the country after the flash, poll-driven phonies of the past. I am not saying her public image is all a pretence. No focus group told her to campaign against the modern slave trade when she was home secretary. There were few Tory votes in stopping the police targeting young black men, either. But the dominant side of Theresa May is more superficial than David Cameron and more dishonest than Tony Blair. It is a tribute to the power of cliches to stop us seeing what is in front of our noses, that so few have noticed that the only reason she’s prime minister is that she put ambition before principle. Last week, Downing Street spin doctors were trying and failing to downplay the importance of a secret speech she gave to Goldman Sachs on 26 May, which was leaked to Nick Hopkins and Rowena Mason of the Guardian. In private, May was unequivocal. “The economic arguments are clear,” she told the bankers. Companies would leave the UK if the UK left the EU. In public, however, she made just one speech during the referendum campaign. You forgot it the moment you heard it. May never mentioned the danger of companies fleeing. Her economic case, such as it was, came down to a flaccid, pseudo-impartial argument that “there are risks in staying as well as leaving”. As an orator, May was hopeless. As a politician on the make, she was close to perfect. When Craig Oliver, Cameron’s former chief of communications, wondered if she was secretly an “enemy agent” for the Leave side, he was being too Machiavellian. May was just making the smart move. She kept her views about the economic consequences of Brexit quiet, so that the Conservative right would accept her as leader if Cameron lost. Failing to state your honest opinion on the most important decision Britain has taken in decades may seem cowardly enough. But the consequences of May’s pretence do not stop with one referendum. Her manoeuvres have forced her into a position where she must make arguments she cannot possibly believe, on behalf of causes she cannot possibly believe in. Her behaviour shows that, far from “taking back control”, Brexit is depriving us of the ability to take decisions, giving privileges to the special interests the Leave campaign claimed it was fighting against, and imposing burdens on the taxpayer far greater than the mythical £350 million a week that Vote Leave said we sent to Brussels. Example: May opposed a new runway for Heathrow. Maybe she was just thinking about her constituents whose peace will be wrecked. Maybe she was worried about cramming an expanded airport into a dangerously overcrowded corner of London. The point, post-Brexit, is surely that the environmental or logistical arguments no longer matter. As her government admitted, May had to approve Heathrow to prove to sceptical markets that she had a “commitment to keeping the UK open for business now and in the future”. Her objections to the Hinkley Point nuclear power station were just as reasonable. Chinese investment threatened handing control of a part of our energy supply to a potentially hostile foreign power. As pertinently, Hinkley’s proposed reactor is fantastically expensive and next to impossible to build. (A forerunner in Finland is nine years behind schedule and €5.2bn over budget.) When May called in the decision to go ahead with Hinkley, she looked like the proud prime minister of the newly independent nation that Vote Leave promised us. Until, that is, Xinhua, the official news agency of the Chinese Communist party, explained Britain’s new place in the world. “A kingdom striving to pull itself out of the Brexit aftermath” could not afford to “deter possible investors from China”, it warned. After a brief moment of defiance, the submissive May agreed. Her defenders say that she is responding to the will of the British people. I won’t go on about how a 52-48 vote was hardly the people speaking as one. Instead, you should understand her by looking at how, after abandoning her beliefs, May refused to level with the public and confront them with the hard choices ahead. Rather than speak plainly, she has embraced the Leave campaign’s big lie that Brexit will be painless. To maintain the illusion, her ministers scramble in secret meetings to cut deals with special interests. Whatever bribes they have offered Nissan will only be the start. Farmers, the City and corporations with muscle will all want taxpayers’ money to compensate them for their losses. The bill will be picked up by small businesses, which cannot afford lobbyists and, of course, by the taxpayers, who will fund the right’s illusion that we can have Brexit without pain. As I said, May had the reputation as a reforming home secretary and some of that reputation was deserved. But as she presides over an upsurge in racial violence and the gobby resurgence of ignorant-and-proud-of-it nationalism, it’s worth remembering another moment in her time at the Home Office, which shows how willing she is to live with lies. You can trace the origins of today’s yobfest to 2013, when the right manufactured a pseudo scandal about “health tourists” exploiting the dear old NHS. Pressed by the BBC to say how much money thieving foreigners were stealing from the health service, May could not give an honest reply, for the Royal College of GPs had already explained that the supposed “problem barely existed”. May did not care. The perception that there was a scandal mattered more to her than the reality that there was none. The electorate had the “feeling that people who are here illegally were accessing services”, she said, so she must maintain the pretence. Now she is a prime minister of pretences, running a government where feelings matter more than fact. She pretends that we should leave the EU, even though she knows we should remain a member of the single market. She offers us the illusion that we are taking back control, even as we lose our freedom to act. She cuts deals in secret, in the hope that the public will never realise that her land of make-believe is an expensive place to live."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2016/jul/15/the-fate-of-britains-environment-rests-on-a-cabinet-tug-of-war","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-15T11:18:39Z","webTitle":"The fate of Britain's environment rests on a cabinet tug of war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2016/jul/15/the-fate-of-britains-environment-rests-on-a-cabinet-tug-of-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2016/jul/15/the-fate-of-britains-environment-rests-on-a-cabinet-tug-of-war","fields":{"headline":"The fate of Britain's environment rests on a cabinet tug of war","bodyText":"The cast has changed following Theresa May’s reshuffle, but the play remains the same. It’s a struggle pitching free-market red tape slashers against those backing a clean, green economy as the UK’s best long term bet. The big question is whether this performance will have a different ending. The performance directed by David Cameron was full of good lines - “the greenest government ever” – but the reviews, even by him, were poor: “cut the green crap”. So what about the new actors, starting at the top. Theresa May has said virtually nothing about the environment and climate change, but the new chancellor, Philip Hammond already has some stirring words up his sleeve. In November last year, as foreign secretary, he said climate change was both a grave threat and a fantastic opportunity: “There may now be more risk in being left behind than there is in taking the lead.” Yet the antediluvian atmosphere of the Treasury could turn him from friend of the environment to foe, as it did George Osborne. Hammond’s immediate backing for the white elephant that is the new Hinkley nuclear power station suggests he doesn’t understand the rapid global shift already underway from old, centralised energy to distributed renewables and smart grids. In the last performance, Oliver Letwin was on hand to break down Treasury resistance, but he’s exited, stage centre-right. Next of the new actors to take a bow is Hammond’s replacement, Boris Johnson, a climate change sceptic who is now in charge of the UK’s climate change diplomacy that did a great deal behind the scenes to ramp up ambition around the world. He’s not even diplomatic. All the world may be a stage, especially for showman Boris, but the dramatic tension at the heart of the play is most taut at home. It is the ideological battle over regulation, seen as business-slaying red tape by one side and protections that can open new markets by the other. Most of the key departments are now being run by machete-wielding red tape slashers. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs now has Andrea Leadsom in charge – she is as passionate a free-marketeer as she was a Brexiter. It’s hard to imagine that someone who thinks the minimum wage should be abolished for small businesses is going to look kindly on the regulations needed to protect air, water, land and wildlife in post-Brexit Britain, despite the enormous economic benefits of a clean, thriving environment, nor the large sums of taxpayers’ cash needed to defend people from flooding. One seasoned commentator dubbed her the Sarah Palin of the UK. Over at Transport now is Brexiter Chris Grayling, a man who thinks red tape is “mad”. He is now in charge of cutting the huge emissions from transport, much of which was going to be tackled via EU rules. Sajid Javid, at the Department of Communities and Local Government, was a remainer, but is a described a “true Thatcherite” and revels in “getting the government off your back”. In charge of big planning decisions, he now has a key role in the roll-out of fracking and continuing the government’s relentless blocking of wind and solar farms. Climate change around the world will impact the UK and the nation provides billions in support to imperilled countries, via the Department for International Development. Its new boss, Brexiter and red tape hater Priti Patel, doesn’t even think her department should exist. With this cast, the role of the new Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy is vital. Its boss, Greg Clark, has had rave reviews for his previous work on energy and climate change and he could provide the plot twist not seen in earlier performances: putting the fast growing low carbon economy of the future at the heart of industrial strategy. But he’ll need the help of the new international trade secretary: enter stage far-right Liam Fox, who detests “binding” red tape. As before, the pivotal character determining the course of this drama is likely to be the chancellor. We will have to wait and see if he retains or rewrites these lines from November: “It is increasingly clear that the economy of the future will be a low carbon economy [and] by stimulating greater innovation and efficiency, climate policies will increase our economic competitiveness.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2016/oct/11/republicans-divided-trump-clinton-polls","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-11T12:06:33Z","webTitle":"Republicans divided as Trump poll numbers plummet | The daily briefing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/11/republicans-divided-trump-clinton-polls","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2016/oct/11/republicans-divided-trump-clinton-polls","fields":{"headline":"Republicans divided as Trump poll numbers plummet","bodyText":"Polls show Clinton surge as Trump fulminates The chaos of Donald Trump’s election campaign increased yesterday as the House speaker, Paul Ryan, signalled he was effectively abandoning the candidate and Trump’s poll ratings began to plummet following the release of the so-called groping tape. Campaigning in Pennsylvania, Trump made no reference to his current predicament, and succeeded in generating further controversy by praising WikiLeaks and adopting an erroneous report by a Russian government-sponsored news agency. He fired up his loyal army of followers by repeating the threat that once ensconced in the White House he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate his Democratic rival’s alleged crimes. When the baying crowd shouted “Lock her up!”, Trump shot back at them: “Lock her up is right!” One of the first opinion polls to have been conducted since the groping bombshell, conducted by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, put Clinton on 46% to Trump’s 35%. Donald Trump marches on amid spiraling disaster of Republican party desertion Clinton addresses ‘locker room’ talk Clinton, in her first appearance since an ugly showdown with Trump that saw the Republican nominee threaten to jail her if elected president, told a crowd in Michigan that during the debate on Sunday, “Donald Trump spent his time attacking when he should have been apologizing”. Clinton dismissed Trump’s “locker room talk” explanation. “Women and men across America know that is just a really weak excuse for behaving badly and mistreating people,” she said.

Driverless cars are next. But is our reliance on automation dangerously diminishing our skills? In a compelling long read, Tim Harford walks us through the paradox of automation. From commercial airline pilots “to operators of nuclear power stations to the crew of cruise ships, from the simple fact that we can no longer remember phone numbers because we have them all stored in our mobile phones, to the way we now struggle with mental arithmetic because we are surrounded by electronic calculators … The better the automatic systems, the more out-of-practice human operators will be, and the more extreme the situations they will have to face.” Crash: how computers are setting us up for disaster Trump’s assault boast becomes national meme The Republican nominee’s boast that he would grab a woman’s genitals has inspired a national reaction, with women expressing their outrage online and creating posters, T-shirts and a song hammering home the message that the #PussyGrabsBack on election day. “Pussy Grabs Back” became a popular hashtag on Twitter. Female Collective, a feminist brand and online community, has turned the image into a T-shirt. “Here’s to smashing patriarchy, respecting women’s bodies, pussy power, and the end of the road for Donald Trump … and the party he rode in on,” the description of the T-shirt reads. ‘Pussy grabs back’ becomes rallying cry for female rage against Trump Flooding: the new normal The frequency of Hurricane Sandy-level floods is rising so sharply that they could become relatively normal, with new research laying bare the enormous upheavals already under way in the US due to climate change.

That pattern is exaggerated in New Jersey, where minors who commit crimes such as robbery, drug trafficking or homicide can be tried as adults – but that only happens at a prosecutor’s request. According to an analysis by WNYC Radio, 692 minors were tried as adults in the state in the past five years. The youngest were 14 years old when charged, and almost 90% were black or Latino.

Some 147 Gigawatts of renewable electricity came online in 2015 - the largest annual increase ever and as much as Africa’s entire power generating capacity. Clean energy investment increased to $286bn (£198bn), with solar energy accounting for 56% of the total and wind power for 38%. Overall, more than twice as much money was spent on renewables than on coal and gas-fired power generation ($130bn in 2015), the REN21 global status report found. Christine Lins, REN21’s chief, said: “What is truly remarkable about these results is that they were achieved at a time when fossil fuel prices were at historic lows, and renewables remained at a significant disadvantage in terms of government subsidies. For every dollar spent boosting renewables, nearly four dollars were spent to maintain our dependence on fossil fuels.” For the first time, emerging economies outspent richer nations in the green energy race, with China accounting for a third of the global total. Jamaica, Honduras, Uruguay and Mauritania were among the highest investors, relative to their GDP. African and Latin American countries also set some of the world’s most ambitious targets for clean energy deployment last year, the report says. But the renewables revolution stuttered in many developed countries, with the significant exception of the US. In Europe, investment plummeted by 21% after the withdrawal of policy supports, such as clean energy subsidies and binding targets. Despite this, renewables still provide 44% of the EU’s electricity capacity, and 15% of its final energy consumption. Jean-François Fauconnier of Climate Action Network Europe said the report should be a “wake up call” to the European commission, spurring increased 2030 renewable goals in a review later this year. “The EU is at risk of missing the ongoing energy revolution and lagging behind other leading economies for decades,” he said. The UK saw a 25% rise in renewable energy investments last year, the paper finds. But figures for the first quarter of 2016 suggest this may not survive cuts to solar subsidies and a slowdown in onshore wind planning approvals. Industry reactions to the REN21 paper were buoyant, with the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) hailing news that 173 countries now have renewable energy targets. Steve Sawyer, GWEC’s secretary general said: “A record 63.5 GW of wind power was installed worldwide in 2015, demonstrating the maturity of the sector; and showing how renewables are supplying competitive, reliable and clean energy to fuel economic growth and cut CO2 emissions.” Around the world, 8.1million people are now employed in the clean energy industry - excluding hydropower - 3.5 million of them in China. In the US, more people now work in the solar industry than in oil and gas extraction. While employment in the clean energy sector grew by 6% in 2015, jobs in the oil industry contracted by 18%, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. But the fast-maturing renewables sector still has to overcome storage limitations, and the world’s dependence on infrastructure systems geared towards fossil fuels. Arthouros Zervos, the chair of REN21 said: “The renewables train is barreling down the tracks, but it is running on 20th-century infrastructure – a system based on outdated thinking where conventional baseload is generated by fossil fuels and nuclear power.” A build-out of decentralised and community-based generation was urgently needed to accelerate the clean energy transition, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2014/jul/23/investing-new-nuclear-power-uk-carbon-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-23T11:27:33Z","webTitle":"Not investing in new nuclear power would be a costly gamble for the UK | Keith Parker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2014/jul/23/investing-new-nuclear-power-uk-carbon-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2014/jul/23/investing-new-nuclear-power-uk-carbon-energy","fields":{"headline":"Not investing in new nuclear power would be a costly gamble for the UK","bodyText":"\"Nuclear power remains, prospectively, one of the cheapest low-carbon technologies and can play an important role as part of a cost-effective portfolio of technologies to decarbonise the power sector.\" As the Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, this is something you’d expect me to say, but this is the viewpoint of the Committee on Climate Change in its progress report to Parliament earlier this month. Recently, Tom Burke wrote on these pages of the \"costly gamble\" of investing in new nuclear because of rising renewable energy output. I’m afraid that the \"costly gamble\" will be not investing in new nuclear plants. I’m not arguing against renewables, but it isn’t the answer alone. The UK needs a mix of low-carbon sources of energy. This must include nuclear. Renewables cannot provide power to the grid 24/7 even though the UK gets as much as 15% of its electricity from these sources. So, one versus the other isn’t the answer – it must be a combination of both. A cost-effective portfolio of technologies, to quote the committee again. Nuclear can support power to the grid 24/7 and with an ambitious plan for building new nuclear plants, it could provide an even greater proportion of the electricity needed in the UK. It is a fallacy to try to compare renewables with nuclear as both will work in different situations. Nuclear can provide a continuous supply to the electricity grid, while renewables will be reliant on the elements. The government estimates that by 2025 the UK will need 60GW of new electricity generating capacity and the infrastructure to run it. Of this, 35GW would come from renewables and 25GW would come from other sources, including nuclear power. The first of the new nuclear plants will be Hinkley Point C in Somerset. However, Burke questioned the ‘strike price’ – the minimum price paid for the electricity generated agreed between EDF Energy who will build the plant and the government. To quote the committee's report again, it stated specifically on Hinkley that \"the agreed strike price therefore offers good value for money and the potential for significant cost savings from a new nuclear programme in the UK\". All large infrastructure investment projects – be it new nuclear capacity, a new wind farm or solar farm – have a strike price. Burke argued that the Hinkley price of £92.50/MWh was too high, but compare that with the offshore wind farm price of £155/MWh and £120/MWh for a large solar farm. Over its lifetime of at least 60 years, Hinkley Point C is expected to contribute £2bn to the economy – £100 million of that will directly benefit the local economy through each year of construction. The UK hasn’t built a new nuclear power station for 20 years and all of the current stations will begin to retire in the next 15 years or so. If we don’t build new ones, that means we could potentially lose a fifth of electricity which is generated on home soil, meaning we’d have to import more. We’d lose a low-carbon source of energy generation which for each kilowatt hour only emits 5g of CO2, compared to 900g from coal-fired. We’d potentially lose a major component of the UK’s science and engineering base too. But building this new nuclear capacity will mean thousands of jobs. Our own conservative estimates put this at a peak of 32,500 jobs annually, some have put it more towards 100,000 when retiring current plants and simultaneous build of new plants are taken into account. Upwards of 5,000 apprenticeships will be created across new build, creating much needed jobs and training for young people. Annual exports from the nuclear industry could increase from £700m a year to up to £1.6bn. We’re already seeing workers from Sellafield going to share their knowledge and experience with other countries, and research and innovation from our universities is also helping other countries in decommissioning and management. Yes, building a new nuclear power plant takes time. By starting the process now, the UK can increase its secure low carbon electricity generation, in tandem with renewables, ensuring the country continues to decarbonise the UK’s energy supply and contributing to economic growth creating long term, high quality jobs. • Keith Parker is chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/may/18/portugal-runs-for-four-days-straight-on-renewable-energy-alone","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-18T13:59:56Z","webTitle":"Portugal runs for four days straight on renewable energy alone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/18/portugal-runs-for-four-days-straight-on-renewable-energy-alone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/may/18/portugal-runs-for-four-days-straight-on-renewable-energy-alone","fields":{"headline":"Portugal runs for four days straight on renewable energy alone","bodyText":"Portugal kept its lights on with renewable energy alone for four consecutive days last week in a clean energy milestone revealed by data analysis of national energy network figures. Electricity consumption in the country was fully covered by solar, wind and hydro power in an extraordinary 107-hour run that lasted from 6.45am on Saturday 7 May until 5.45pm the following Wednesday, says the analysis by the Sustainable Terrestrial System Association and the Portuguese Association of Renewable Energies (Apren). News of the zero emissions landmark comes just days after Germany announced that clean energy had powered almost all its electricity needs on Sunday 15 May, with power prices turning negative at several times in the day – effectively paying consumers to use it. Oliver Joy, a spokesman for the Wind Europe trade association said: “We are seeing trends like this spread across Europe - last year with Denmark and now in Portugal. The Iberian peninsula is a great resource for renewables and wind energy, not just for the region but for the whole of Europe.” James Watson, the CEO of SolarPower Europe said: “This is a significant achievement for a European country, but what seems extraordinary today will be commonplace in Europe in just a few years. The energy transition process is gathering momentum and records such as this will continue to be set and broken across Europe.” Last year, wind provided 22% of electricity and all renewable sources together provided 48%, according to the Portuguese renewable energy association. While Portugal’s clean energy surge has been spurred by the EU’s renewable targets for 2020, support schemes for new wind capacity were reduced in 2012. Despite this, Portugal added 550MW of wind capacity between 2013 and 2016, and industry groups now have their sights firmly set on the green energy’s export potential, within Europe and without. “An increased build-out of interconnectors, a reformed electricity market and political will are all essential,” Joy said. “But with the right policies in place, wind could meet a quarter of Europe’s power needs in the next 15 years.” In 2015, wind power alone met 42% of electricity demand in Denmark, 20% in Spain, 13% in Germany and 11% in the UK. In a move hailed as a “historic turning point” by clean energy supporters, UK citizens last week enjoyed their first ever week of coal-free electricity generation. Watson said: “The age of inflexible and polluting technologies is drawing to an end and power will increasingly be provided from clean, renewable sources.” • This article was amended on 19 May and 21 December 2016. An earlier version said that in 2013 Portugal generated 27% of its electricity from nuclear, 13% from hydro, 7.5% from wind and 3% from solar, according to Eurostat figures. In fact those figures are for the whole of the EU; Portugal does not have any nuclear power plants. The organisations that undertook the analysis, which were not identified initially, have been added. After publication, it was pointed out that some fossil-fuel-generated power is used, for example, for pumping in hydro schemes. Notwithstanding that element, Apren says, renewable energy generated enough power to meet Portugal’s demand over the four days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/feb/18/japanese-tourists-cat-lucky-eyebrows-hachi","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-18T10:00:07Z","webTitle":"Japanese tourists flock to see Hachi, the cat with lucky eyebrows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/18/japanese-tourists-cat-lucky-eyebrows-hachi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/feb/18/japanese-tourists-cat-lucky-eyebrows-hachi","fields":{"headline":"Japanese tourists flock to see Hachi, the cat with lucky eyebrows","bodyText":"It may be the year of the monkey in Japan, but people from across the country are reportedly flocking to a tiny tobacconist north of Tokyo for an encounter with a cat that has ”lucky eyebrows”. Hachi, described in the Mainichi newspaper as an employee of the shop in Mito, Ibaraki prefecture, sports two black markings above her eyes that resemble the kanji character for the number eight, considered a harbinger of good luck in Japan. Now tourists have joined regular customers to catch a glimpse of the cat’s lucky markings, the newspaper said. Hachi, whose name means “eight” in Japanese, was born a month after the magnitude-9 earthquake that struck north-east Japan on 11 March 2011, triggering a deadly tsunami and a triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The cat was taken in by Yoichi Maeda, a local editor, who asked the tobacconist’s owner, Kaori Hasegawa, to look after her during the day in the hope that she would bring some luck to local businesses affected by the disaster. “A lot of people have told me that good things happened to them after they saw Hachi’s face,” Hasegawa told the Mainichi, although she did not elaborate. It is not the the first time Japan’s obsession with cats – from Hello Kitty and Doraemon to maneki neko figurines and cat cafes – have been used to drum up business.

EDF confirmed that finance chief Thomas Piquemal had resigned, amid reports he wanted the French state-owned company to delay a final decision on building the UK’s first new nuclear power station in a generation. French trade unions latched on to Piquemal’s departure as evidence that the Hinkley Point C plant, which is expected to meet 7% of the UK’s energy needs once up and running, poses a threat to EDF’s future. Analysts echoed the finance director’s concerns, with one energy expert saying that the project to build two nuclear reactors on the Somerset coast was “verging on insanity”. Labour called on the government to come up with a “Plan B”, in case EDF pulls out. But EDF and the UK and French governments said the project would go ahead as planned, with a final decision due to be taken in the “near future”. Jean-Bernard Levy, the chairman of 85% state-owned EDF, said he regretted the “haste” of Piquemal’s departure. “With the support of its shareholder, the state, EDF can confirm that it is looking to invest in two reactors at Hinkley Point under the best possible financial conditions for the group,” said Levy in a statement. A Downing Street spokesman said the British government would not “speculate on the resignation of one individual” but added that “we continue to fully support the project”. French economy minister Emmanuel Macron also reiterated his government’s “full support” for Hinkley, which he said would be “very profitable” over the next 30 years. But critics said the plan, which would see nuclear power produced at Hinkley from 2025, was being driven by political will rather than business sense. “Politics is rather trumping the economics at the moment,” said Tim Yeo, the former Tory MP who chairs pro-nuclear lobby group New Nuclear Watch. He said the government should put the project on hold and consider potentially cheaper nuclear technologies from South Korea, China and Russia. Yeo added: “Now is the moment for the government to examine whether these alternatives represent value for money. We need to cast the net a bit wider.” The government has faced criticism for agreeing to guarantee EDF a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour for energy produced at Hinkley. But EDF’s €37bn (£29bn) debt pile, coupled with the impact on its day-to-day income from low energy prices, has led to fears that it cannot afford to proceed even with such a substantial subsidy. Force Ouvrière, a french trade union, said that Piquemal’s departure showed they were right to be concerned about the impact of Hinkley on EDF’s long-term financial health. Serge Gianorsi, Force Ouvrière’s trade union secretary, said: “The resignation of such a high-ranking executive is pretty spectacular and shows the disagreement even at the highest levels.” Martin Young, an energy analyst at investment bank RBC Capital Markets, said that for EDF to proceed with such a costly plan would be “verging on insanity”. He said the firm would have to sell assets in the “double-digit” billions to afford the project. EDF was initially looking for a partner to fund 49% of the project but has only been able to secure investment to cover 33% of its cost from China’s state-owned China General Nuclear. Young added that EDF was under pressure to push ahead with the project because it uses European pressurised reactors [EPR], a technology that France hopes will be a lucrative export for its nuclear industry. EPR reactors being built at Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland have met with huge cost overruns and lengthy delays. “To walk away from the project would be a blow to French aspirations to be a major force in the nuclear world,” said Young. “If they walk away from doing this, they’re admitting that EPR has failed.” Peter Atherton, an energy analyst at investment banking firm Jefferies, said that despite these problems, the British government was determined to press on for fear of missing legally binding targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Atherton said: “The biggest problem the government would have is that without a large nuclear programme it’s very difficult to see how you can hit climate change targets. It’s being driven by those targets, not economics or security of supply. “Alarm bells have been ringing on this project for some time but the two governments are determined to push it though.” He added that EDF might struggle to find buyers for its assets as it tries to raise cash to fund the project. Labour’s shadow energy secretary, Lisa Nandy, said the government should say what alternative options it has in place in the event that EDF walks away. “This power station is absolutely central to the government’s strategy for keeping the lights on and meeting Britain’s international commitments on climate change,” she said. “With growing scepticism over whether it will now be built, ministers must tell us what is their plan B.” Kevin Coyne, national officer for energy at the Unite trade union, said EDF should follow the lead of the British and French governments by confirming that Hinkley will go ahead. “We want to unpack the boots and shovels and get on with the job,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2016/nov/25/film-maker-directors-clint-eastwood-tom-hanks-intimidating-as-hell-sully","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-25T16:19:55Z","webTitle":"Hell of a film-maker: the directors who make Clint Eastwood look soft","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/25/film-maker-directors-clint-eastwood-tom-hanks-intimidating-as-hell-sully","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2016/nov/25/film-maker-directors-clint-eastwood-tom-hanks-intimidating-as-hell-sully","fields":{"headline":"Hell of a film-maker: the directors who make Clint Eastwood look soft","bodyText":"In his acting heyday, Clint Eastwood was a taciturn maestro of understatement. In his Man With No Name or Dirty Harry periods, one eyebrow raised was usually enough to pitch even the most arrogant antagonist into throes of panic and self-doubt, while a simple curl of the lip usually signified that the nearest dude was a dead man walking. So it comes as no surprise to learn that Eastwood’s unusual directing style made Tom Hanks extremely nervous on the set of the true-life disaster movie Sully. “You certainly don’t want one of those Eastwood looks,” Hanks told Graham Norton, in an episode of the chat show to be screened on BBC 1 on 25 November. “He treats his actors like horses, because when he did the 60s series Rawhide, the director would shout ‘Action!’ and all the horses bolted. So when he’s in charge, he says in a really quiet, soft voice: ‘All right, go ahead,’ and instead of shouting ‘Cut!’ he says: ‘That’s enough of that.’ It’s intimidating as hell!” And yet Eastwood’s mildly unorthodox methods surely pale into insignificance compared with the behaviour of some of his Hollywood peers. Here are the true titans of on-set tyranny – Hollywood’s most difficult directors to work for: Alejandro González Iñárritu The Mexican director was accused of putting cast and crew of his Oscar-winning frontiersman epic The Revenant through a “living hell” to indulge his desire to film only in natural light, and with minimal use of CGI, in remote parts of Canada in 2015. Whistleblowers complained they were forced to work in sub-zero conditions, with temperatures unexpectedly dropping to -25C (-13F) during the shoot, and multiple crew members quitting under the brutal conditions. Iñárritu later admitted to making “bad” and “irresponsible” decisions during filming, but insisted The Revenant’s critical acclaim during the 2015-16 awards season made all that individual suffering worthwhile. “I’m glad that I made that irresponsible decision, but it could have been really bad,” he told Rolling Stone. “Like when you climb Mount Everest and nobody dies, but we were so close! It’s that feeling of relief.” The crew may have been upset, some telling the Hollywood Reporter that the experience of making the western had been the worst of their careers. But star Leonardo DiCaprio appears to have been fully on board with the tortuous film-making process, cheerfully munching his way through raw bison liver in freezing conditions and even climbing into a horse’s carcass on his way to a debut Oscar. James Cameron The six-month shoot for Cameron’s 1993 science fiction epic The Abyss is sometimes described as the toughest in Hollywood history, because of persistent delays, six-day, 70-hour weeks and the difficulties faced in shooting underwater scenes. The film was shot almost entirely in a huge concrete containment tank at an abandoned nuclear power station, with Cameron refusing to allow stunt doubles to stand in for his actors. Ed Harris, who at one point believed he was about to die after running out of air during one submerged scene, reputedly found himself in tears while driving home at the end of a week’s shoot, while Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio suffered a physical and emotional meltdown on set. Cameron, for his part, asked his stars to pee in their wetsuits in order to avoid wasting time by going to the toilet. But the Canadian film-maker was unapologetic about the film’s delays, which Michael Biehn estimated meant he was on set for five months in order to shoot for only 3-4 weeks. “For every hour they spent trying to figure out what magazine to read, we spent an hour at the bottom of the tank breathing compressed air,” he told the New York Times. Stanley Kubrick The US director was famed for his rigid attention to detail and refusal to compromise. Kubrick’s unnerving horror classic The Shining made the Guinness Book of Records for a scene featuring Shelley Duvall walking backwards up some stairs, crying and swinging her baseball bat at Jack Nicholson, that required 127 takes to get right. And Nicholson reputedly refused ever to work with the director of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Eyes Wide Shut again after a separate segue in which the camera slowly zooms in on actor Scatman Crothers, as the Overlook Hotel’s chef, took more than 60 takes to get right – causing the 70-year-old to break down in tears. David Fincher Another film-maker known for his precise approach, Fincher left Jake Gyllenhaal in a state of extreme frustration during the shoot for austere 2007 serial killer thriller Zodiac owing to his habit of asking a technician to “delete the last 10 takes” while his actors were still on set doing their best to complete a scene. Meanwhile, the Se7en director’s penchant for long working hours caused co-star Robert Downey – before the actor’s post-Iron Man transformation into the world’s most highly paid star – to mount his own private protest involving the placement of discreet jars of urine around the shoot. “I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrotte him, that I was going to give him what he wanted,” Downey Jr told the New York Times. “I think I’m a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags.” Werner Herzog The veteran German film-maker is well known for threatening his muse Klaus Kinski with a gun when the latter briefly refused to complete filming of 1972’s sprawling jungle epic Aguirre, the Wrath of God. And there is also the time he filmed 1982’s Fitzcarraldo deep in the Amazon, fending off raids by the local Amahuaca tribespeople that resulted in one crew member being shot through the throat with an arrow – he narrowly survived – and his wife requiring eight hours of surgery after being hit in the stomach. But Herzog’s finest hour as a film-maker from hell may well have come during the shoot for the 1976 documentary La Soufrière. Production saw the director put the lives of his entire film crew at risk by taking them to the small town of Basse-Terre on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, which had only recently been evacuated because of a nearby active volcano. Lars von Trier Von Trier is often accused of misogyny for the manner in which he routinely puts his leading ladies, from Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves to Charlotte Gainsbourg in Antichrist, through varying forms of on-screen torture. After completing her turn as a poor Czech immigrant who guards terrible secrets in the Palme d’Or-winning drama Dancer in the Dark, Björk described Denmark’s enfant terrible of indie cinema as an “emotional pornographer” and vowed never to act again. “You can take quite sexist film directors like Woody Allen or Stanley Kubrick and still they are the ones that provide the soul to their movies,” she wrote in an essay. “In Lars von Trier’s case it is not so and he knows it. He needs a female to provide his work soul. And he envies them and hates them for it. So he has to destroy them during the filming.

The prime minister’s programme, which was restricted by campaigning in the run-up to the referendum, has now virtually ground to a halt amid the Conservative leadership race to replace him. Ministers who are supposed to be implementing new laws are instead focused on their future careers. As a result, the government’s ambitious programme which was meant to reduce the deficit and radically reform public services is in a state of flux. Emma Norris, a programme director at the Institute for Government, pointed out that the government had so far been able to introduce just six out of 20 of the legislative bills outlined in the 2016 Queen’s speech. She said: “I think Brexit is going to create uncertainty and delay for a range of existing government plans. Some of the decisions you are going to see being delayed are those whose political champions are being otherwise distracted by leadership contests. “Other tough political decisions are being delayed until there is a new prime minister, such as the third runway [at Heathrow], and then there is the resulting economic uncertainty of a Brexit which is causing jitters for some planned infrastructure projects.” Aspokeswoman for the Cabinet Office insisted that the legislative programme would be delivered. “We are elected with a decisive mandate to implement a manifesto and we are getting on with the important job of delivering just that,” she said. Here is a rundown of legislation that is thought to be on hold or is facing an uncertain future: • Extra runway capacity in south-east England. A decision was due in July on whether the government would stick with plans to build a third runway at Heathrow. This has been delayed until the autumn at the earliest, according to Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary. • HS2. Construction of the rail ink between London, Manchester and Leeds was meant to begin in 2017. Whitehall sources have said the £50bn project could be delayed or even shelved following the vote for Brexit. • Health and work programme. The process of contracting for a new programme to replace the work programme and work choice (the Department for Work and Pensions’ specialist disability employment programme) was to begin in July. Providers have been told that it will not begin before August. • Sugar tax. Was supposed to be introduced via the finance bill in 2017. It is not clear whether this will happen now. • Education white paper on higher education reform. This might be put on hold, according to government sources. • The cost recovery bill . Intended to recover the cost of NHS care from non-EEA nationals, it might not go ahead, according to health sources. • “Life chances strategy”. Led by the DWP, this was supposed to improve opportunities for the most disadvantaged through the early years, with policies around childcare, school, universities and the workplace. Reports suggest that this might now be altered. • Hinkley Point C. The proposed new nuclear power station, with estimated costs ballooning to £37bn, could be put on hold, according to reports. Well-placed sources in energy firm EDF have told the Guardian that the already divided board which must make that decision is in danger of fracturing further as former supporters of the project worry about Brexit. • Measures to modernised the UK economy. The Queen’s speech in May also set out a range of measures, including legislation to enable the development of commercial spaceports; allow Britain to pioneer driverless cars; and spread the use of drones by businesses and individuals, as well as a legal right to fast broadband connections for every household. These measures are also on hold. • Local government finance. The spending review in November announced plans for changes, with central government funding cut and local authorities able to retain 100% of business rates. The timetable for the consultation on these changes, which must happen before legislation is passed, is now unclear."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/mar/07/edfs-hinkley-point-dilemma-adds-to-project-woes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-07T11:40:19Z","webTitle":"EDF's Hinkley Point nuclear nightmare adds to company's woes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/edfs-hinkley-point-dilemma-adds-to-project-woes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/mar/07/edfs-hinkley-point-dilemma-adds-to-project-woes","fields":{"headline":"EDF's Hinkley Point nuclear nightmare adds to company's woes","bodyText":"Building an £18bn nuclear power station such as Hinkley Point C would be a huge financial commitment for any energy company – even one that is mainly state-owned. EDF, the company at the heart of the Somerset project that is 85% owned by the French government, has brought in Chinese state-owned firms as partners and negotiated generous subsidies with the UK government. However, the resignation of EDF’s finance director, Thomas Piquemal, shows nervousness at the top of the group about the dangers of a project of this magnitude, even though chief executive Jean-Bernard Levy insisted on Monday that he still wanted to reach a final decision on the Hinkley investment soon. EDF is under tremendous pressurefrom inside the company to stop but also to proceed, with the British government desperate to avoid a flagship energy project being abandoned at a time when few other schemes seem to be going right. The French president, François Hollande, told UK PM David Cameron last week that he wanted to see Hinkley go ahead, but he has loaded EDF with added financial responsibilities at a time when it could least manage them. Hinkley Point in 2012 might have looked like just another ambitious but doable scheme. But the intervening years have brought trouble – a lot of it – to the French company. Flamanville EDF has been building a European pressurised reactor (EPR) plant in Normandy, France. The latest EPR has been dreamed up by EDF in conjunction with its engineering partner Areva. It was meant to be a showcase to the world, allowing EDF and Areva to market and build these plants globally, not least at Hinkley in Somerset. But Flamanville has turned into a nightmare project with endless delays, regulatory problems and cost overruns. The situation has been made worse by another scheme involving EPRs at Olkiluoto in Finland. This too has turned into a huge public relations embarrassment. It has been plagued with contract disputes, broken budgets and is 10 years behind schedule. Fukushima The Japanese nuclear disaster that occurred five years ago this Saturday has badly dented confidence in nuclear power, the technology that EDF specialises in. Germany has decided to abandon atomic power in the aftermath of Fukushima. France relies on it for almost all of its electricity and will continue to do so. But the Paris government has insisted EDF must introduce new safety mechanisms on its reactors in France. The cost of these changes have been estimated by some experts at up to €50bn (£38.7bn). Energy prices The wholesale cost of electricity has been tumbling in Britain and the rest of Europe, making it harder for relatively higher-cost nuclear to compete. Some of this is temporary, due to falling oil and gas prices, and some is more permanent because of subsidised renewable power. Wind and solar technologies are developing fast and reducing in price, which puts more pressure on rival energy sources. EDF, which has already large debts, has already been forced to borrow money to pay for dividends to shareholders, notably the French government. The share price has been hammered by these financial stresses and is now almost 90% lower than it was in 2007. News of the finance director’s resignation led EDF shares to plunge 10% in early trading on Monday. Even many financial analysts in the City of London have concluded that Hinkley would be a step too far. RBC Capital Markets said: “To proceed with Hinkley Point C at this juncture would be verging on insanity.” EDF has in turn said it is willing to sell a bundle of €6bn worth of assets to raise cash in the meantime. Among the stakes that could be sold is a 30% holding in EDF Energy in Britain, the formal developer of Hinkley. It is not clear at this time who would want to buy these assets and what price they would pay. Areva A lot of EDF’s problems have been caused by the near financial collapse at its nuclear engineering partner, Areva. This company designed the EPR and has been at the heart of the Olkiluoto plant delays. It is said to need a €7bn cash injection over the next couple of years to keep going. The French government has in effect demanded that EDF take over Areva – putting even more pressure on EDF’s finances. Areva has designed the proposed new Hinkley reactors and was meant to be lined up to win some of the biggest contracts there much to the frustration of British engineering firms. Board warfare The financial pressures on EDF have led to the company announcing in January a 5% reduction to its workforce. The French unions, who have places on the group board, are furious and blame Hinkley for some of the problems. They want the Somerset project ditched to avoid further difficulties. They are accused by some nuclear industry experts of leaking negative information from board meetings to try to undermine the Hinkley plans further. The resignation of Piquemal, which apparently happened last week but was only confirmed on Monday, suggests even he believes Hinkley could break the EDF camel’s back. For such a senior executive to walk out at such a crucial point puts enormous pressure on Levy not to proceed too quickly. Piquemal is believed to have wanted to delay the decision on Hinkley until new money was successfully raised from the proposed asset sales. Levy may yet get his way over the dissenters inside the board but the stakes are now very, very high."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2014/jul/20/grand-central-review-intoxicating-love-story-tahar-rahim","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2014-07-19T23:05:10Z","webTitle":"Grand Central review – intoxicating love story in the shadow of a nuclear power plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/20/grand-central-review-intoxicating-love-story-tahar-rahim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2014/jul/20/grand-central-review-intoxicating-love-story-tahar-rahim","fields":{"headline":"Grand Central review – intoxicating love story in the shadow of a nuclear power plant","bodyText":"Urgent physical performances from Tahar Rahim and Léa Seydoux power this tale of toxic love in the poisonously radioactive shadow of a nuclear power plant. Originally inspired by Elisabeth Filhol's novel La Centrale, which shone a pre-Fukushima light upon the perilous working environments of subcontractors in the nuclear industry, Gaëlle Macé and co-writer/director Rebecca Zlotowski's contrived but affecting screenplay places Rahim's unqualified worker (a modern working-class hero) in ever-increasing danger as he prolongs his intoxicating spell at the plant in order to stay within the fallout zone of Seydoux's irradiating charms. While the central love-and-death metaphor may be overripe and overwritten (a knee-weakening kiss is theatrically used to illustrate the symptoms of radiation sickness), Rahim and Seydoux keep things grounded in the familiar isotopes of human emotion, their passion less explosive than merely uncontained, progressing inexorably toward meltdown. Zlotowski flags up an underlying debt to westerns via a mechanical rodeo bull which our hero bests in the opening movement, while a throbbing soundtrack (are those pulses the sound of blood coursing through veins, or of radiation seeping through lead-lined walls?) nods toward the doomed romance of dystopian future fantasy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2016/sep/20/global-trade-deal-threatens-paris-climate-goals-leaked-documents-show","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-20T08:00:55Z","webTitle":"Global trade deal threatens Paris climate goals, leaked documents show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/20/global-trade-deal-threatens-paris-climate-goals-leaked-documents-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/sep/20/global-trade-deal-threatens-paris-climate-goals-leaked-documents-show","fields":{"headline":"Global trade deal threatens Paris climate goals, leaked documents show","bodyText":"A far-reaching global trade deal being negotiated in secret could threaten the goals of the Paris climate deal by making it harder for governments to favour clean energy over fossil fuels, a leak of the latest negotiating text shows. The controversial Trade in Services Agreement (Tisa) aims to liberalise trade between the EU and 22 countries across the global services sector, which employs tens of millions in Europe alone. But a new EU text seen by the Guardian would oblige signatories to work towards “energy neutrality” between renewable energy and fossil fuel power, although amendments proposed by the EU would exempt nuclear power from this rule. The document, marked “limited distribution – for Tisa participants only”, would also force member states to legislate against “anti-competitive conduct” and “market distortions” in energy-related services. This is viewed by campaigners as code for state support for clean power sectors, such as wind and solar. A right to regulate is explicitly mentioned in the paper, but governments would first have to prove the necessity for regulations that legally constrain multinationals. The same clause was used in the World Trade Organisation’s Gatt and Gats treaties which entered into force in 1995, and led to 44 complaints by multinationals via their governments. Of these, 43 were upheld. Susan Cohen Jehoram, a spokeswoman for Greenpeace, told the Guardian: “We fear the same thing will happen with Tisa but on a much larger scale, when legislation is proposed to keep temperature rises to 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels, as agreed at the Paris climate summit]. “If we want to reach that target, governments will need a toolbox of measures that can give incentives to cleaner energy. Tisa, like the proposed TTIP and Ceta trade agreements, would increase the power of multinationals to prevent governments taking desperately needed measures to decrease CO2 levels.” The Paris climate agreement called for “making finance flows consistent with a pathway to low greenhouse gas emissions” but the deregulatory thrust of the negotiating text, which was obtained by Greenpeace Netherlands, seems to run counter to this. Its energy annex says that the trade rules will apply to all legislative measures covering power generation services, “whether the energy source is renewable or non-renewable”. It also contains a “standstill” clause freezing in perpetuity the high watermark of liberalisation in certain sectors, and a “ratchet” clause to stop countries reintroducing trade barriers that had been previously removed. Both mechanisms have been proposed by Australia. Under their tenets, any government elected on a ticket of reversing the liberalisation of services contained in the treaty would thus be unable to do so, campaigners claim. The UK’s shadow international trade and energy spokesman, Barry Gardiner, Labour MP, told the Guardian: “Whilst every effort should be made to promote business and trade, this must not be at the expense of the protection and enhancement of workers’ rights, environmental safeguards and the wider interests of the British people.” While Brexit could prevent the UK from being bound by the planned trade treaty, any agreement allowing access to the EU’s single market would probably oblige it to follow the new rules. Opposition to the proposed text from Theresa May’s government is thought unlikely. David Davis, the minister for Brexit, recently described the similar Ceta trade agreement with Canada as his preferred model for a trade arrangement with the EU. Gardiner said: “The British people have voted to come out of the European Union to preserve the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, it cannot be right then that secret trade deals are currently being conducted entirely outside the scrutiny of national parliaments and law-makers.” “The structure of such deals are like a lobster pot – once you have gone through and given power to the commercial interest it is no longer possible to recapture democratic control. What we do hear, through leaks and rumours, are terms which clearly prevent the ongoing capacity of governments to govern in the public interest.” Before coming into effect though, any finalised Tisa text will most likely need to be approved by all EU member states – which currently includes the UK – and will also require approval from the European parliament. Earlier this year, MEPs voted to back the deal, on the proviso that public services were excluded and that the deal legally secured the right to regulate at European, national and local authority level. Parliament’s rapporteur, the former EU justice commisioner, Viviane Reding, has previously said that the assembly will “never consent” to any trade pact that diminished the EU’s right to regulate on climate, health and social laws. Reding refused to comment on the leak but informed sources said that neither she nor the European parliament would consent to provisions which prevented public authorities from supporting renewables. Reding, a conservative politician from Luxembourg, has also called on the Luxembourg government to demand an end to negotiations on the EU-US free trade deal known as TTIP, over the use of controversial secret investor courts, and threats to the environment and food safety. Unlike TTIP, Tisa deals with the less tangible trade services sector that nonetheless constitutes more than half of the global economy, and could impact on an estimated 1.8 billion people. As well as energy, any Tisa deal will apply to financial services, e-commerce, information and communications technology services, international maritime transport services, computer related services, postal and courier services, and government procurement of services. A report by the UN conference on trade and development later this week is expected to say that mega-trade deals such as TTIP and Tisa are becoming increasingly politicised, and failing to provide a solution to the slowdown in global growth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2016/aug/10/wednesdays-best-tv-inside-cern-a-horizon-special-britains-benefit-tenants","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-10T05:09:03Z","webTitle":"Wednesday’s best TV – Inside Cern: A Horizon Special; Britain’s Benefit Tenants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/10/wednesdays-best-tv-inside-cern-a-horizon-special-britains-benefit-tenants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/10/wednesdays-best-tv-inside-cern-a-horizon-special-britains-benefit-tenants","fields":{"headline":"Wednesday’s best TV – Inside Cern: A Horizon Special; Britain’s Benefit Tenants","bodyText":"Inside Cern: A Horizon Special 8pm, BBC2 A special episode focusing on recent progress by the boffins at Cern – the Swiss-based operators of the Large Hadron Collider.

The intervention by the Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom comes after the British government’s decision last month to delay final approval of the project, which is receiving major financial support from China. “If Britain’s openness is a condition for bilateral co-operation, then mutual trust is the very foundation on which this is built,” Liu Xiaoming wrote in an article for the Financial Times, in which he placed the project at the centre of Britain’s evolving trade relationship with China. “Right now, the China-UK relationship is at a crucial historical juncture. Mutual trust should be treasured even more. I hope the UK will keep its door open to China and that the British government will continue to support Hinkley Point – and come to a decision as soon as possible so that the project can proceed smoothly.” The prime minister Theresa May is thought to have ordered a delay owing to concerns about the role of China General Nuclear, which has a one-third stake in the Hinkley project. Comments by May’s chief of staff, Nick Timothy, last year have led to claims that the delay has been prompted by concerns that Chinese state-owned companies were being allowed to invest in sensitive infrastructure. While not specifically addressing those concerns, Liu said that “security” was central to the debate surrounding the project, adding that the UK has “a state-of-the-art supervision regime and legal system”. The article comes in the wake of wider doubts about the future of the close relationship with China that David Cameron and George Osborne had heavily promoted. The ambassador, who said that Chinese companies have invested more in the UK than in Germany, France and Italy combined over the past five years, concluded by stating that it “has not been easy for China and the UK to have come this far”. “As long as both sides cherish what has been achieved and continue to expand and deepen our co-operation across the board, bilateral relations will maintain their strong momentum and work for the wellbeing of both the Chinese and British people,” Liu said. Meanwhile, French unions have said that the decision by energy firm EDF to invest in Hinkley Point should be declared invalid. Three unions at the French state-owned firm said senior board members knew the British government was considering delaying its final decision on Hinkley, but nothing was said before last month’s vote on whether EDF should back the project. Jean-Bernard Lévy, the chairman and chief executive of EDF, wrote to board members last week, saying he knew about the delay before the board met to approve building and co-funding the first British nuclear site in a generation. Just hours before a signing ceremony was due to take place at the site in Somerset May quashed hopes that Hinkley would go ahead by putting off government approval until early autumn. Unions said they believed some board members knew of the likely delay, meaning the board’s approval – by 10 votes to seven – should be overturned. “Our three unions denounce this information asymmetry,” they said in a joint statement. “They therefore consider that the board’s Hinkley Point decision, taken on the basis of incomplete information, is null and void.” The unions, CGT, CFE-CGC and FO, said the UK government’s supposed desire for a swift resolution had been cited by EDF’s leadership as a key reason to vote in favour of the project. The moderate CFDT union, which also represents EDF employees, did not sign the statement. But Lévy told executives he believed May only wanted a few more days, and EDF said he had not been aware of any plan to push back the decision to autumn. EDF said it knew at the time of the boardroom vote only that a signing ceremony planned for the day after the meeting was to be delayed. “Reading the entire internal email sent on 2 August by the chairman and CEO of EDF to members of the executive committee confirms unambiguously that when the company’s board of directors was held, EDF and its chairman had no knowledge of the intention of the British government to conduct a further review of the Hinkley Point project,” EDF said. “All that was known before the press statement issued by the British government on July 28 was that the signing ceremony originally proposed for Friday, 29 July, would be postponed. “This potential date of signature had not been confirmed, and therefore had not been communicated either to the board nor the market. There was therefore no requirement to communicate its postponement.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/may/12/china-may-take-over-hinkley-point-nuclear-project-claims-lord-howell","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-12T22:50:31Z","webTitle":"China may take over Hinkley Point nuclear project, claims Lord Howell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/12/china-may-take-over-hinkley-point-nuclear-project-claims-lord-howell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/may/12/china-may-take-over-hinkley-point-nuclear-project-claims-lord-howell","fields":{"headline":"China may take over Hinkley Point nuclear project, claims Lord Howell","bodyText":"Chinese companies are ready to step in and offer to build new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset if French company EDF backs out of the government’s flagship energy project, it has been claimed. EDF recently put back a final investment decision until September amid mounting problems – not least whether it has the financial muscle to construct what may be the most expensive power plant ever. David Howell, father-in-law of George Osborne, told the House of Lords on Thursday night about Beijing’s intentions just as EDF faced even more opposition from its own private shareholders to the Hinkley scheme at its annual general meeting in Paris. “Is my noble friend aware that the Chinese also have a plan B which is to bypass EDF altogether and build two smaller reactors on the Hinkley C site and to do it rather quicker than the present Hinkley C plan?” asked Lord Howell. He later told the Times that he had made his comment on the back of private meetings with Chinese delegations: “This is the view of informed thinktanks and a deduction of the way they must be thinking.” The state-owned China General Nuclear Power Corporation has already committed itself to taking a third stake in the new reactors planned by EDF for Hinkley Point C but has also outlined its own aspirations to construct a new plant at Bradwell in Essex. China has never said publicly it would be willing to take over the full Hinkley project and would face enormous difficulties and potential delays if it wanted to use Hualong designs – which are unlicensed in Britain. It is possible China may take over French European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) designs that have been produced by EDF’s French partner, Areva, and which are already approved for UK operation. But the huge opposition inside EDF to Hinkley and problems with an EPR being built at Flamanville in France has led many – including apparently the Chinese – to question whether EDF will be forced to abandon the British project. The French energy company admitted ahead of its AGM that the final cost of Hinkley could be £20.7bn, but later argued that it still expected it to be constructed for £18bn. The final investment decision at Hinkley has been delayed several times. Last month, French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, said he expected a decision by September which would mean the earliest start up would be spring 2026. In October 2015, EDF said the first operation was scheduled for 2025, which was already a two-year delay from its 2013 estimate for a 2023 start. Jean-Bernard Lévy, the chief executive of EDF who has seen his finance director resign over the cost of Hinkley told shareholders that construction risks were present but would be “well managed”. But the FT reported that one shareholder, Gilles Sauront, speaking at the AGM held in the Louvre art gallery, as saying: “Every decision has been terrible and it is us who are paying for it … The EPR project (in the UK) has no credibility.” The share price of EDF has been hammered as the uncertainty over Hinkley increased while cost overruns and delays increased at the Flamanville project."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2018/jan/25/davos-2018-may-trump-hammond-lagarde-climate-change-crypto-tax-avoidance-day-three-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-01-25T21:24:27Z","webTitle":"Davos 2018: Donald Trump, Theresa May and George Soros at WEF - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/jan/25/davos-2018-may-trump-hammond-lagarde-climate-change-crypto-tax-avoidance-day-three-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2018/jan/25/davos-2018-may-trump-hammond-lagarde-climate-change-crypto-tax-avoidance-day-three-live","fields":{"headline":"Davos 2018: Donald Trump, Theresa May and George Soros at WEF - as it happened","bodyText":"A late PS, from the Associated Press’s Pan Pylas on the moment Trump arrived at the World Economic Forum. One way to get President Donald Trump to stop and talk at the World Economic Forum: wield a book about him. On his way into the World Economic Forum, Trump stopped and talked for about ten seconds to one delegate who was brandishing a copy of “God and Donald Trump” by Stephen E. Strang. He then proceeded to hold the book aloft in his left hand. Trump is the first U.S. president to attend the World Economic Forum since Bill Clinton back in 2000. Trump is holding a series of meetings and is due to deliver a speech on Friday in which he will argue that what is good for the U.S. economy is beneficial for the global economy. And finally, readers will be keen to know that Donald Trump is probably tucked up in bed. Here’s the final dispatch: Motorcade arrived at the Intercontinental at 9:23. Pool did not see POTUS get out. He will sleep here tonight. That’s all from us until tomorrow! Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Here’s some colour from Donald Trump’s dinner with business leaders, from the White House press pack: President Trump’s eyes narrowed, as he looked a bit tired by the jetlag and long trip. But he seemed to enjoy the camaraderie with businessmen, joking with them about their success and lofty responsibilities, and nodding in agreement as they spoke about their large manufacturing capacity and thousands of US-based employees. Among the topics discussed: Kanye West’s role in designing Adidas shoes, Mack Trucks made by Volvo, Nestlé’s non-chocolate business portfolio. Among Trump’s asides: “When he says he works for Siemens, he’s the president of Siemens!...Wow, that’s big!....Good luck with the G.E. purchase.” Trump spoke about the thriving American economy – crediting his tax policies, deregulation and his role as a cheerleader for American business. Soros then claims the bitcoin price will be propped by up by dictators, who use it to ‘build their nest eggs abroad”. Q: As a former currency trader (who beat the Bank of England on Black Wednesday) what do you think of cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin is not a currency, Soros replies. A currency is supposed to be a stable store of value, and a currency that can fluctuate 25% in a day can’t be used to pay wages It’s a speculation, based on a misunderstanding. Soros suggest the EU should help Africa’s economy develop, if it wants to address the migration crisis. Onto questions. Q: What should be done to tackle the technology giants? It’s a very complicated issue, Soros replies. It requires the full-time attention of those who formulate and enforce new laws. I put my faith in them, especially commissioner Vestigar who has done so much to enforce the laws - and made an award against Google. Q: If you don’t like social media companies, why do you buy shares in them? calls out a diner from the back of the room. Soros doesn’t reply (I’m not sure he heard). Instead he takes a question about migration, saying he cares about refugees because he was one himself; he came to Britain and was better treated than refugees arriving in Europe today. Another punchy quote from Soros: On Europe, Soros suggests that a multi-speed, multi-track approach would be more successful. This would allow Britain to rejoin the EU in the future without having to commit to joining the euro, explained Soros (who hasn’t given up hope that Brexit won’t happen). George Soros then turns his guns at the technology sector. In a blistering attack, he accuses social media companies of “deliberately engineering addiction”, which is “particularly harmful” for adolescents. He accuses them of inducing customers to give up their autonomy too. Soros says there are similarities between internet platforms and gambling platforms - pointing out that casinos have developed techniques to hook customers so they keep gambling even when they’ve run out of money. But... while tech giants may think they’re masters of the universe, they are actually just slaves to preserving their dominant position Soros continues. It’s only a matter of time before the monopoly of the US IT giants is broken, he declares: Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered. Regulation and taxation will be their undoing. I see Trump as a purely temporary phenomenon which will disappear in 2020, or earlier, Soros says - winning a laugh from his audience as they tuck into their chicken, potatoes and spinach. Soros adds that he expects a Democratic landslide in 2018. America must recognise the reality that North Korea has become a nuclear power, Soros continues. There is no military action that can prevent what has already happened. The only sensible strategy is to accept reality….and come to terms with North Koreas as a nuclear power. That means working with China to find a solution. Soros says that the survival of our whole civilisation is at stake, due to the rise of Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Donald Trump in the United States. They both seem to be willing to risk a nuclear war to keep themselves in power. At another dinner in Davos, billionaire businessman-turned-philanthopist George Soros is giving his views on the state of the world. He’s warning that open societies are in crisis, with various forms of dictatorship on the rise - such as Vladimir Putin’s Russia. “In the United States, President Trump would like to establish a mafia state, but can’t”, Soros continues, because America’s institutions, constitution and its “vibrant civil society” won’t allow it. If you’re just tuning in, here’s our news story about the prospect of Donald Trump visiting the UK later this year: UK government officials have been updating the British press about Theresa May’s meeting with Donald Trump this afternoon, shortly after he arrived at WEF (and brought it to a standstill). Mark Knoller, CBS News White House Correspondent, has details of Trump’s dinner with European business chiefs: Donald Trump is now sitting down for diner with the bosses of some of Europe’s biggest companies. Mark Tucker, the chairman of HSBC, and Punit Renjen, the chief executive of Deloitte, are flying the flag for Britain - according to this guest list from the White House press pack: President Donald J. Trump Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Department of State Secretary Kirstjen Nielson, Department of Homeland Security General H.R. McMaster, National Security Advisor Gary Cohn, Director of the National Economic Council Kasper Rorsted, Adidas (Apparel)—Germany Joe Kaeser, Siemens AG (Tech)—Germany Heinrich Hiesinger, Thyssenkrupp AG (Industrials)—Germany Eldar Saetre, Statoil ASA (Energy)—Norway Mark Schneider, Nestle SA (Food and Beverage)—Switzerland Vas Narasimhan, Novartis AG (Pharmaceutical)—Switzerland Mark Tucker, HSBC (Financial Services)—UK Patrick Pouyanne, Total SA (Energy)—France Carlos Brito, Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (Food and Beverage)—Belgium Rajeev Suri, Nokia Corporation (Technology)—Finland Punit Renjen, Deloitte (Consulting)—UK Martian Lundstedt, AB Volvo (Auto)—Sweden Werner Baumann, Bayer AG (Pharmaceutical)—Germany Bill McDermott, SAP SE (Technology)—Germany Ulrich Spiesshofer, ABB Ltd (Manufacturing)—Switzerland • This list was amended on 26 January 2018 to correct inaccurate details provided by the White House press office. The spelling of Carlos Brito’s first name was corrected from Carols, and the location of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV’s headquarters has been corrected from the Netherlands to Belgium. President Trump is likely to face protests if and when his visit to the UK takes place, even if it is just a “working visit”. For a start, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson pulled no punches, saying: “Trump is a dangerous, misogynistic racist and is deserving of the protests he will undoubtedly face. “If and when he comes to the UK the Liberal Democrats will be at front and centre of the protests.” The White House says Theresa May and Donald Trump discussed plans for a “working visit” to London. That may mean that it won’t be a full-blown state visit. A working visit would mean less pomp and ceremony (and probably not a visit to see the Queen). Here’s the official statement (which includes that all-important nod to the Special Relationship). President Donald J. Trump met today with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom. The President and Prime Minister discussed joint efforts to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS and other jihadist terrorist organizations in Syria and Iraq. They discussed the importance of confronting Iran’s destructive behavior across the Middle East and fundamental flaws in the Iran nuclear deal. The leaders committed to expanded trade between the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as how the two countries can work together to ensure all nations engage in fair and reciprocal trade practices. The two leaders also discussed plans for a working visit to London in the coming months and affirmed the “special relationship” between the two countries is stronger than ever. Donald Trump emerged from his meetings a little while ago, and briefly chatted with delegates who hadn’t been driven away by security. He said his first day at Davos had been “really good” and “very successful”, before calling it a “very great day”. Here’s the key quote (with thanks to the White House press corp) “I think the real message is we want great prosperity and we want great peace and I think that’s the message. It’s been going really well. A lot of people are coming back to the United States. We are seeing tremendous investment and today has been a very exciting day. Very great day and great for our country. Thank you very much.” Here’s more details: Q: Is America great? Trump: “America’s great” Q: Is everybody else great? “Everyone’s great,” Trump said, turning his head toward the questioner as he walked through the convention hallway. Donald Trump may be in the spotlight in Davos today, but it was Wednesday’s comments by US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin about the dollar which caused ructions at the European Central Bank. Mnuchin said that a weaker dollar was good for American trade, and ECB president Mario Draghi suggested this was not in the spirit of an agreement between governments made in October in Washington. Draghi said: Ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed to] refrain from competitive devaluations and not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. He said the current exchange rate volatility was partly due to”the use of language in discussing exchange rate developments that doesn’t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed.” Mnuchin’s comments yesterday sent an already weak dollar still lower. Marco Valli, chief European economist at UniCredit Bank, said: [The ECB] remains fairly relaxed about the effects of a stronger euro, but bluntly criticised the recent foreign exchange messages from the US administration, seen as violating the long-standing international commitment to avoid competitive devaluation. And of course Donald Trump has tweeted about his meeting with Theresa May: Theresa May’s meeting with Donald Trump at Davos took place shortly after she gave a special address to the World Economic Forum (highlights start here) May focused on the opportunities and threats of new technology, and Britain’s efforts to equip its economy for the challenges ahead. Paul Sheard, chief global economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings, tells us that she missed a trick by not also talking about Brexit, and UK-US relations. Prime Minister May made a strong pitch for the UK to be seen as a global leader in AI and regulation-friendly innovation, but ‎I thought her not spending some time laying out the UK government’s latest thinking on Brexit - particularly what it aspires for the all-important future relationship - was a bit of a missed opportunity. We don’t know what details still need to be finalised, so it’s possible that officials can’t actually get Donald Trump’s visit nailed down. One possible hitch might be the certainty of large protests against the US president from British citizens appalled by his view on climate change, accusations of sexual harassment, the Muslim ban, his America First policies - to name just four. Trump is reportedly rather worried about facing major protests - something he’s been spared in Davos, due to its ultra-tight security net. Bloomberg reported this week that the US president had asked May to make sure he got a good reception. In one phone conversation during 2017, Trump complained to May over the criticism he’d been getting in British newspapers. Amid warnings that Trump would face protests in the streets when he arrived, he told the prime minister he would not be coming to the U.K. until she could promise him a warm welcome. It’s official. Barring a few details, US president Donald Trump will visit the United Kingdom later this year. May and Trump asked their respective officials to work on ‘finalising the details’ of a trip, at the end of their bilateral meeting here in the World Economic Forum. A Downing Street spokesman says that: The PM and President concluded by asking officials to work together on finalising the details of a visit by the President to the UK later this year.” There’s no word on when it might happen, though. Downing Street also say that the two leaders discussed Brexit, Iran, terrorism, and worries that jobs could lost at Bombardier’s factory in Northern Ireland due to the trade dispute with Boeing. The spokesman says: The two leaders began by discussing Bombardier, with the PM reiterating the importance of the company’s jobs in Northern Ireland. The PM and the President discussed Iran, and the need to work together to combat the destabilising activity which it is conducting in the region, including ballistic missile development, and continuing efforts to ensure Iran does not develop nuclear weapons. They also agreed on the importance of continuing to stand side-by-side in the fight against Daesh in Syria and elsewhere. The Prime Minister updated the President on the good progress which had been made in the Brexit negotiations so far. The two leaders reiterated their desire for a strong trading relationship post-Brexit, which would be in the interests of both countries. NEWSFLASH: Theresa May and Donald Trump have asked officials to work on “finalising the details of a visit by the President to the UK later this year”, Downing Street said. More to follow. Swiss campaign group CAMPAX have hung a Trump protest banner on a mountain at Sargans - about 50 kilometres from Davos. Here’s a photo of the Davos meeting room which Donald Trump and his delegation swept into, a couple of hours ago: There’s still a huge crowd at the bottom of the stairs; I think there’s only one way out.... During his meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, president Trump suggested that aid would be withheld from the Palestinians if they didn’t show respect. He said “they disrespected our great Vice President” (Last November, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas didn’t meet Mike Pence during his visit to the Middle East). Trump said (via the White House pool report): “The money is on the table. And the money was never off the table. [Yesterday, it was reported that former US secretary of state John Kerry had advised Abbas not to give in to Trump’s demands] Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu has returned from his meeting with Trump. He says it was “excellent”. Here’s the White House pool report on the Trump-May meeting: President Trump and PM May sat beside one another in a WEF conference room with aides on each side. Among them on US side: Gary Cohn, HR McMaster, Tillerson, Sarah Sanders. Highlights: Trump “Its a false rumor” that there is tension in the US-UK relationship. “We’re on the same wavelength in I think every respect” The two are “liking each other a lot” and “joined at the hip” when it comes to the military. He looked at her and said there was nothing that would happen where the US would not be there for Britain. May also reaffirmed the special relationship. When asked about a state visit, May said it’s being discussed now. Trump seconded that. No answers to shouted questions about the far right video retweet [back in November, Trump retweeted several anti-Muslim videos] Donald Trump has also talked about the prospect of a trade deal with the UK, but only in very general terms. Trade between the US and the UK is going to increase ‘many times’, Trump said during his meeting with May, adding: The discussions...that will be taking place are going to lead to tremendous increase in trade between our countries, which is great for both in terms of jobs. Q: But what about a state visit to Britain? May and Trump say they’ll talk about that during their meeting at Davos. Several people have come down the stairs where Donald Trump’s meetings are taking place. I’ve spied IMF chief Christine Lagarde, Europe’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, and Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell. That doesn’t mean they’ve all been meeting the US president - there’s more than one room up there. Q: How large an effect does your communication have on exchange rate? When I said communication I didn’t mean ECB communication but other people’s communication. We don’t target exchange rate. When someone says a good exchange rate is good, that is targeting exchange rate. That goes back to years ago before the [recent] terms of agreement were agreed. Q:Why did you chooses September to end QE? Commodities are priced in dollars and could effect inflation data. When we recalibrated programme last October we had a discussion whether it should be six or nine months, and how much. So after that we came out with this educated outcome. In defining our objective we have different definitions, including underlying inflation which excludes energy etc. We target headline inflation, but we look at evidence from other definitions. Q: Oil price has risen significantly since December, could that cancel out strong euro. Yes, although it’s not easy to understand exactly the timing of these compensations. That doesn’t imply we accept a certain level of exchange rate as a good or bad thing. And with that it’s over. Q: how do you feel about ECB communications this year including from individual members, could it be improved. What level of concern was there today about a possible change in US policy [after US dollar comments] Yes there was concern. It was broader than simply the exchange rate, but about broader state of international relations right now. If this leads to an unwarranted tightening of monetary policy we would have to think about our monetary policy strategy. On communications, you see same thing in other jurisdictions. All the communiations since Dec have in common three characteristics. All based on commitment to objective of inflation target. None questioned the sequence whereby interest rates will stay at current levels well past end of asset buying programme. Well past was emphasised. Q: Some commentators factoring in an interest rate rise this year? At its current level does euro reflect fundamentals? Based on today’s data I see very few chances at all that interest rates can be raised this year. On euro, we should ask is it produced by strength of economy, or by statements, or by monetary policy elsewhere. Q: Another question on the G30 membership, could it compromise ECB? Draghi repeats his previous answer, but adds ombudsman said there was no evidence the meeting influenced ECB, and ECB must have contacts with other financial participants. Q: Will differences of views within ECB deepen on exit strategy? At March meeting, will you give restatement of forward guidance. I don’t think the differences are as substantive as they were on other occasions. Some are a little more confident, if they live where inflation is rising. But there are not deep existential differences. But there may be differences on when to say certain things, when to move forward. Markets have expectations on path, but also on dates, timelines. In March we will assess how things stand at that point in time. Away from Davis briefly and back with the ECB, and president Mario Draghi said at his press conference that domestic price pressures remained muted, inflation has yet to show a convincing upward trend. He said the recent foreign exchange volatility is a source of uncertainty. An ample degree of monetary stimulus is necessary. On the economy, he said there could be positive growth surprise in the near term. But there were downside risks remain relating to global factors, forex. More on inflation: he said it was expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our measures, rising wage growth etc He then repeats his usual call to governments to do more: To reap the ull benefits from monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute. Structural reform in euro area countries needs to be stepped up . On fiscal policies, the case is strengthened for rebuilding fiscal buffers, especially in in countries where debt remains high. Strengthening EMU remains a priority. Now for questions: Q: What will have to happen for the exchange rate to be a problem for the inflation target? And you said in December you would revisit guidance [on the bond buying programme] early this year? Draghi says there is confusion about the guidance comment, there was no difference between what was said at the December meeting and what Draghi said at the press conference. All that was said was there would have to be discussions about the need to have a discussion in the early part of the year. That discussion hasn’t really started. We went through the events since October to now, trying to assess whether something has changed. There was not much of a change except the strengthening of the economy a little more than expected. By and large the risk to growth is balanced. We can’t declare victory. Price pressures are muted. Underlying inflation is showing little signs of upward movement. So we simply restated policy. He said the commitment to the inflation target remained firmer than ever. Monetary policy will remain accommodative. On exchange rates he said there were three reasons for volatility. The improvement in the economy, the heightened market sensitivity to perceived changes in our communication. Finally the use of language in discussion exchange rate developments that doesn’t reflect the terms of reference that have been agreed in October in Washington [an agreement between governments on exchange rate policy] Q:Dollar weakness is what you were probably referring to. It must not be helpful to hear a lower dollar is something [US officials] like. Are we heading to currency war scenario. Also, could you envisage ending QE programme in September. We don’t target exchange rates, they are important for growth and price stability. Movements justified by strength of economy are a fact of natiure. Are there other movements caused by use of language, not parts of terms agreed. Whether that has an effect on our inflation path...inflation is our main concern. Too early to assess whether pass through has already taken place, and what will be extent. Some are questioning the extent of pass through, but large exchange rate movements are bound to have an effect. In Washington - ministers and governments recognised excessive volatily or disorderly movements in exchange rates could have adverse effects. [They agreed] we will refrain from competitive devaluations and will not target exchange rates for competitive purposes. On second question, we didn’t have any discussion today, but we never stop the programme abruptly. Q: Will you give up you membership of the G30, after ombudsman letter? We received the letter from the ombudsman, we will respond in time. There is a procedure. We will assess the letter and the comments and respond. Q: German pay negotiations. Could there be broad pay increases across eurozone economy following Germany? We observe from a monetary policy angle, where we consider wage growth as a convincing sign of future inflation convergence to our objective. Whether it spreads, depends on conditions of labour market. Tight conditions in Germany, not so in other countries. Q: Are there financial stability risks from long term accommodative policy? Vice president Vitor Constancio answers. No one can talk about asset price bubbles in euro area. We have overstretched valuations in some places for commercial real estate, high yield corporate bonds but nothing else.... We see prices in market are close to fair value. Same is true of housing prices. Fundamental values are in line with fundamental. Prices of houses increasing by 4%, between 2000 and 2006 they were up 7%. So no general situation of overvaluation in residential properties. Some countries have also taken macroprudential policies to combat excesses. The effect on banks of negative rates, taking into account all our policies, they have been favourable to their profitability which is still low but increasing. So negative rates have been absorbed by banking sector. Draghi talks about fiscal buffers. Interest rates will at some point stop being so low. At that point all governments will want to have policy space, so budget consideration now when the time is good is favourable. NF We’ve now got video footage of Theresa May and Donald Trump meeting. Trump says he and May have a mutual feeling of ‘liking each other a lot”. He says there have been a false rumour out there, which he wants to rebut. He tells May: We have great respect for everything you’re doing, and we love your country. We think it’s truly good. Trump says that the US and the UK are working on economic development, trade and military issues. We are very much joined at the hip when it comes to the military Theresa May’s meeting with Trump is over - she’s departed the scene without speaking to the press. Next up.... Israel’s president Benjamin Netanyahu. He’s gone up the stairs with a small group, presumably to meet Trump. Curiously, Theresa May and a few advisors came down from the Trump meeting.....vanished into another room...reappeared and then went back up again. OK, it looks like Trump and May have been holding their meeting - and it’s nearly over.... White House reporters are travelling with Trump - here’s one of the latest pooled reports: Pool arrived at 2:40 at the conference center after brief motorcade through town that includes some small souvenir shops, ski shops, restaurants. There were some JP Morgan flags posted on the route as well. The smattering of onlookers included a few waving American flags and some young kids in ski helmets. A few more photos of Trump’s arrival: I managed a short video clip of Trump’s arrival: President Trump and his entourage then move up the stairs, to a constant clicking of cameras. One delegate welcomes him to Switzerland. “Thank you very much. Great country.” Trump replies. He then continues up another flight of stairs, to an area where most delegates (and journalists) aren’t allowed. A security guard is now posted there to prevent any intruders. Trump arrives to his audience; reporters shout out a few questions. Asked what his message is to Davos, he replies “Peace and prosperity”. There are a few laughs. Here he comes...... The entire World Economic Forum has gone into a weird semi-lockdown. Half the delegates are crowding around, in a hush, waiting for Trump. The rest are milling around in the corridors and lounges, or getting on with business. Curiously, most delegates are waiting in silence..... President Trump is about to arrive at the World Economic Forum. People are crowding around the security cordon and flocking on the balcony , desperate for a glimpse. Theresa May ends her speech by calling on the World Economic Forum to work together to solve the problems she identified. The UK has a proud history of stepping up and delivering progress that can deliver for all, she says: Let’s renew our commitment to collaboration - and set ourselves on a path to benefit all our people. Now, and for generations to come. That’s it. No questions. Theresa May says technology companies employ some of the brightest minds in the world - they should be able to design a system where unacceptable content is deleted automatically. No-one wants to be known as a a platform for terrorism, or the best place for child pornography, she points out. She says there are three key priorities: Considering whether new regulations are needed for these tech platforms Investors must think about the social impact of the firms they invest in. Working on the ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence Theresa May is now challenging social media companies to do more to protect users - especially children. We want Britain to be a “World leader in innovation-friendly regulation” she says (not the catchiest slogan). That means being the safest place in the world to be online, while also being a great place to run a digital business. Technology companies must “step up to their responsibilities”, the PM says sternly. Companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery, or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content. Theresa May singles out Uber as an example of the potential,and problems, created by technology. It’s an innovative company, but it has also got things wrong - with safety issues and concerns about its treatment of workers The solution isn’t to shut them down, but to improve the system so companies work better. Employment law must protect workers and give businesses the flexibility it needs, says the PM - it can’t just be a one-way street. Maybe 2/3 full was an overstatement.... May is pitching to businesses here, saying the government is raising Britain’s digital skills for the 21st century. We’re also at the forefront of low-carbon technologies, she declares. And on artificial intelligence, we’re only at the beginning of what AI can achieve, says May. Those of you up here in Davos mustn’t forget the plight of those who face losing their job after 20 years, says May. We must channel the power of business and government together to harness technology, and make it a force for good, May continues - to address people’s concerns. I understand the power of business as a force for good. Free markets drive risk-taking that have delivered the great advances of our time. But I also believe in the power of government, she adds. Our new business strategy will make Britain one of the best place in the world to start and run a business, she pledges. Turning to technology, Theresa May says the internet can deliver $2.2 trillion worth of GDP to developing countries. And just last week, a drone saved two boys from drowning off Australia by carrying a float to them. Medical tests show that technology can reduce breast cancer cases by a third. But people are worried about the malevolent impact of technology, she says. Britain will continue to be an advocate of free trade after Brexit, May insists. And she challenges Davos delegates to live up to their commitments, in three ways: The commitments on steel must be implemented. Aid donors must match the UK and help developing countries The World Trade Organisation must do more to keep pace with the global economy - she singles out the service sector, and e-commerce Theresa May begins by saying that last year, she warned that the benefits of free trade weren’t being shared fairly, and this risked undermining the global world order. One year on, there are grounds for optimism. Global growth is strengthening. The populism of the far left and far right has not made the progress some predicted, and in the UK, unemployment is at a 40-year low and government and business are working together well. Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, is introducing Theresa May now. The room is roughly two-thirds full - respectable, not as much as for president Macron last night. Schwab says many Davos attendees were impressed last year, by May’s passionate plea to address global slavery. That work continues this year, he says. Cowbells are ringing across the Davos congress centre (yes, really), to tell delegates that Theresa May’s speech starts soon. The hall is filling up well, but it’s not packed out yet. One delegate tells me she’s hoping to hear some clarity on Britain’s future after Brexit. “There’s a lot of uncertainty right now”. At the CBI’s lunch in Davos, Philip Hammond insisted that Britain would leave the EU on 31st March 2019. That’s a statement of political reality, the chancellor insists. Hammond said Britain should go for something more ambitious than previous deals with the EU. An off-the-shelf Norway or Canada agreement won’t work. Unusually for trade talks, we’re starting from a point where we are already deeply interconnected with highly aligned regulatory systems and close co-operation on defence and security. Should go for something much more ambitious than anything that’s previously been agreed. Former UK cabinet minister and New Labour architect Peter Mandelson was also at the lunch, and pointed out that French president Emmanuel Macron had hosted 140 CEOs at Versailles the other day. Mandelson warned: For France, Brexit is a gift that keeps on giving. Hammond hit back, though, saying you’d get more top CEOs in London on an average day (probably not all meeting a world leader, though!). The European Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged and repeated that its bond buying programme will run until September or beyond if necessary. The ECB added it could increase the programme from its current €30bn a month if circumstances change: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the asset purchase programme (APP) in terms of size and/or duration. On rates it said they would be kept at present levels “for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.” Of course the detail will come in president Mario Draghi’s press conference this afternoon, when analysts will be looking for more on the future of the QE programme and when rates might rise. But Draghi must be tempted to keep his cards close to his chest, and avoid anything which could push the euro higher when inflation is still below the bank’s target. NF Donald Trump and his team are staying at the Intercontinental Hotel in Davos. That’s a sensible move from a security point of view; the Intercontinental is at the edge of Davos, rather than slap bang next to the conference centre like the Belvedere (scene of many parties and meeting). It’s also up a steep hill, so easier to prevent protests . The White House press pack report that they saw onlookers snapping pictures of the Trump convoy, but no demos on the route. Hello... Business Insider’s Paul Colgan has spotted some anti-Trump protesters outside the conference halls. There’s very tight security all around the Davos area, making it hard for demonstrators to travel up the mountain and exercise their democratic rights. You’d almost think the global elite didn’t want to know what people really think of them.... Chancellor Philip Hammond is cracking some jokes at the CBI’s lunch with British business chiefs - including one at Theresa May’s expense. He reminds his audience that it was a walk in the mountain air that inspired the prime minister to call a general election last year*. I’m discouraging her from taking any strolls, Hammond grins. * - (wiping out her majority) Boris Johnson once said that he was put off from visiting parts of New York by the very real risk of meeting Donald Trump. Well in Davos, you also run the very real risk of running into Piers Morgan. The UK journalist and TV personality has done well, though, securing an exclusive sit-down interview with the US president. It’s due to air on Sunday night, with clips released on Friday morning. Davos delegates without a swanky lunch invite (or the time to go) are being fed individual jars of pasta dishes. And it’s great fun to watch the global elite scrambling to over each other whenever the waiting staff emerge with a new tray of goodies. Your humble correspondent finally gets a pot, balances it on his iPad - and is promptly mistaken for a waiter by a fellow delegate who tries to nab it off me. Maybe it’s time for a career change... Trump has touched down in Switzerland, but there’s no sign of him in the Congress Hall yet. Ireland’s leader, Leo Varadkar, is in Davos -- and refusing to accept that Apple got an unfairly good tax deal from the Irish government. In 2016, the EC ruled that Apple had received €13bn of state aid. Last November, it referred Ireland to the European Court of Justice because Dublin hadn’t started reclaiming the cash. According to Varadkar, this process will start soon.....but he’s not rolling over in the ECJ. Speaking of the CBI, UK retail sales have grown modestly in January so far, according to its latest distributive trades survey, but at a slower pace than anticipated. The survey showed a balance of +12 for January, down from +20 in December. Sales for the time of year were the weakest compared to the norm for more than four years, said the CBI. Orders to suppliers also fell, and looking ahead retailers expect similar growth in sales volumes while orders are forecast to be flat. Anna Leach, CBI head of economic intelligence, said: Retailers have seen fairly modest sales growth this month overall, but it is online retailers who have set the pace during the January sales. Household spending will remain under pressure this year from higher inflation and low wage growth, which will continue to weigh on sales growth in the retail sector. NF British business chiefs and media leaders have headed to a lunchtime event with chancellor Philip Hammond, hosted by the CBI. It’s a traditional part of the Davos week for the UK delegation, but this year it could be a little frostier than usual. That’s because CBI chief Caroline Fairbairn declared last week that Britain must remain in the customs union after Brexit. I imagine the Treasury weren’t best pleased by this intervention (unless we’ve outsourced Brexit negotiations to the CBI...a safer bet than using Carillion, anyway). But we understand that Hammond won’t use his speech to rebut Fairbairn’s call, and will cover other issues.... My colleague Larry Elliott’s there, so we’ll have more details soon.... Theresa May has given an interview to Bloomberg. She spoke about the revelations about sexual harassment at a charity dinner in London, saying: I was frankly appalled when I read the report of this Presidents Club event. I thought that that sort of attitude of the objectification of women was something that was in the past. Sadly, what that event showed is that there is still a lot more work for us to do. That chimes with Malala Yousafzai’s comments this morning. Our Politics Live blog has more details: We hear that Theresa May’s meeting with Donald Trump will take place shortly after her speech (which starts at 2pm, or 1pm GMT). It’s likely to focus on foreign affairs issues like Syria and North Korea. Theresa May has now ended her private meeting (perhaps a roundtable?) and swept the WEF congress hall in a gaggle of aides. Down the stairs at pace, she’s quickly into another secure section of this rabbit-warren of a building. Disappointingly she didn’t stop for questions - a camera had been lined up, just in case. Still, we’ll hear from her in a couple of hours. Chancellor Philip Hammond has told the Davos panel on financial risks that Europe will lose out if the City suffers after Brexit. New York and Singapore would benefit from new business, he says, not European cities. The idea that you can recreate London’s financial centre anywhere else is a fantasy. Hammond also says that financial services are very important to the UK side, and “the centre of our negotiating strategy”. Those who say the financial sector will not be part of a deal have not been looking at the numbers, he says. We have a trade deficit of £100bn with Europe, and a surplus in services of £40bn, Hammond explains, adding: The only deal that can be done is one that can be fair to both parties One that included trade and not services would not be fair to the UK. Theresa May and her entourage have just swept through the Davos congress centre, into a private meeting room. Alas media are certainly not allowed in to listen. Trump’s treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin is also on the panel on the future of finance. Yesterday, Mnuchin sent the dollar tumbling by saying a weak currency is good for exports. Today, he’s very relaxed about the whole issue, saying: “In the short term where the dollar is is not a concern of mine. It is not something I spend a lot of time thinking about.” Mnuchin also denies that America is trying to launch a trade war, insisting that the US doesn’t want less trade it wants “fair trade”. The big debate on financial stability is also underway. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, says trade is one of the factors leading to stronger growth. When asked about the risks of a trade war, she says: “Who would want to do anything that would lead to weaker growth? Al Gore, former US vice-president, has suggested that Donald Trump can’t disrupt the battle against climate change - especially if he isn’t reelected in 2020. Speaking on a panel here in Davos, Gore says there is strong momentum to fight climate change. Several governors of our largest states, hundreds of cities, and thousands of US businesses are now ensuring that the US will not just meet, but exceed, the commitments it made in the Paris Agreement. Gore explains that America can’t legally leave the Paris Agreement (to act to limit rising global temperatures) until after the next presidential election. And if there’s a new president (at which point Al Gore offers a silent prayer), they could give 30 days notice and America would be back in the agreement. That’s the good news. The bad news, Gore says, is that the maximum action that is political feasible falls far short of the minimum of what is needed to battle climate change. So, we need to move the boundary of what politicians can do. You can watch the panel live, here. Back in the UK, and mortgage approvals by Britain’s banks fell to their lowest level since April 2013 in December, according to trade association UK Finance. Banks approved 36,115 mortgages for housebuying, down from 39,007 in November and 19% lower than a year ago. Annual growth in consumer credit slipped from 0.8% to 0.7%. And this could give the Bank of England a problem: NF Newsflash: Theresa May has met with South Africa’s deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa.....and there’s not a fondue dish in sight either. Theresa May’s former press chief has caused a stir this morning, accusing the PM of spending last year’s Davos “sitting in a hotel eating fondue” rather than meeting fellow world leaders and business chiefs. Writing in The Times, Katy Perrior claims the PM struggled to schmooze at the 2017 World Economic Forum, and even turned up with the wrong sort of footwear (her new £120 snowboots should work better this time). Perrior claiming business leaders were frozen out by May: ‘Elsewhere they get personal audiences with President Macron in France and Malcolm Turnbull in Australia but not so much as a digestive biscuit from the PM. ‘Does she have any idea how frustrating that is for them? Other world leaders are on a charm offensive, desperate to woo major businesses to their shores. ‘As we count down to post-Brexit Britain, she would do well to spend less time enjoying the fondue and more time meeting and greeting.’ More here. Personally, I was disappointed not to see May meeting business chiefs and academics at Oxford University’s excellent Davos cheese and port party last night (maybe I left too early #bestbehaviour ) Perrior also claims May turned down the chance to meet Alibaba’s Jack Ma last year. He’s still at Davos, so there’s still time to make amends, prime minister... Kristin Lemkau, JP Morgan’s chief marketing officer, sums up Davos so far: Sterling continues to go from strength to strength. In Asia overnight it hit $1.4328, and although it has eased back from that, it is still up 0.11% so far today at $1.4255. It is partly the expectation of an earlier than expected UK rate rise, given the recent strong data including Wednesday’s employment and wages figures. But of course there is also the weak dollar, hit recently by the expectation that Donald Trump’s tax cuts would raise the already hefty US deficit. More immediately Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told Davos the US wasn’t worried about a flagging greenback. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale said: Steven Mnuchin (US Treasury Secretary) went to Davos and said that a weaker dollar ‘is good for us as it relates to trade and opportunities’. He also pointed out that that he isn’t concerned by where it is in the short term and that in the longer term, its strength is a reflection of the strength of the US economy. In other words, he said very little really, but he said it under snow-plastered slopes and he was speaking to a market where dollar bulls have been under the cosh. A few more capitulated. Against the euro the pound is pretty flat, down just 0.01% at €1.1473 ahead of the latest European Central Bank meeting. But the euro is up against the dollar, 0.11% better at $1.2421. The strength of the euro presents a problem for ECB president Mario Draghi. If he appears too bulllish at hinting at an end to the bank’s QE programme, the euro will appreciate even further. And that would keep a lid on inflation which is already below the bank’s target. Equally, he cannot ignore the improving European economy. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets explains: With headline inflation remaining well below its 2% target rate at 1.4% and an economy that continues to show decent levels of economic activity the ECB is faced with having to navigate the minefield of guiding markets over the tightrope of communicating a credible timeline for stimulus reduction and interest rate policy, while trying to move CPI back to target against the difficulty of a rising currency. Since the beginning of 2017 the euro has risen 18% against the US dollar and could well rise even further given yesterday’s remarks by US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. Last week ECB vice president Vitor Constancio along with Austria’s Ewald Nowotny expressed concern about recent exchange rate movements. These concerns are likely to have increased in recent days which will make today’s press conference by ECB President Mario Draghi much more interesting. He can’t very well ignore the improving outlook but if he comes across as too bullish the euro could well be well on the way to the 1.3000 level by the end of this quarter. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said: Draghi would have to adopt a delicate approach and seek a strategy which stops the euro from firming further. The only way out of this situation for him would be to emphasize that the process of the rate hikes is not within sight yet. The market is expecting a rate hike in 2019 from the ECB, Draghi would have to pull a rabbit out of hat in order to convince the market that rate hike isn’t on the agenda and market participants are getting ahead of themselves. We do think that overly dovish statement by the European central bank is priced in the euro to some extent. If Draghi fails to convince the market or if he doesn’t sound as dovish as the market is expecting, we think that the euro can take off from here. I think the risk to the downside for the euro are limited, it is the upside move which would be more exciting. NF Theresa May’s Conservative Party has confirmed she will hold social media giants to account in Davos: Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of Lloyd’s, says that companies are taking out more insurance against cyber attacks. “It is the fastest growing part of our business”, Carnegie-Brown says, adding: “Companies are certainly becoming more concerned about the risks.” Lloyd’s has 30% of the global market, Carnegie-Brown says, with 85% of the business coming from US firms. The insurance market is changing, he says. “People are more concerned about cyber attack than a fire when it comes to the potential impact on their business.” Carnegie-Brown says he has been floating the idea in Davos that governments might use part of their aid budgets to insure poor developing countries against the cost of natural disasters. Lloyd’s will pay out almost $5b to the US states affected by the three hurricanes last year but says the world as a whole is under-insured. Malala also warns that world leaders need to invest more in education, to help future generations. Malala Yousafzai, the world’s youngest Nobel Prize winner, is speaking at Davos right now, about the importance of giving girls equal rights to education. She’s explaining that education can play a key role in improving giving the message of equality. So what’s your message to Trump on the issue of gender equality, asks Miriam Elder of Buzzfeed. Yousafzai says: I get so disappointed to see that people in these high positions openly talk against women, do not accept women as equals, they harass woman. It is just shocking to think that is is happening I hope that women stand up and speak out against it. I hope that people who are involved in such shameful things think about their own daughters, their own mothers, their own close female relations, and just imagine for a second, could they let it happen to them? I don’t think they would accept that. Malala, who was shot by the Taliban in 2012 after campaigning for girls education, says women must “raise up their voice”, and reach the ears and minds of those who still hold views which we hoped didn’t exist any more Just in: chancellor Philip Hammond says he’s “very happy” with the strength of sterling, which has hit its highest level since the Brexit vote. Foreign exchange rates are a big story at Davos, after America’s Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin seemed to hint that Washington liked a weaker dollar Some of President’s Trump’s top officials are briefing the press again this morning. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross is in combative mood, denying that America is protectionist - even though it just slapped new tariffs on washing machines and solar panels from Asia. Ross also says that America is “more interested” in bilateral trade deals than multilateral ones - which doesn’t bode very well for the ongoing NAFTA negotiations. John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, is also in Davos, and bringing a warning for the global elite: McDonnell will be telling top business people and world leaders that they’re dangerously insulated from the problems outside WEF’s security cordon and swanky parties: “Many of those attending the World Economic Forum have been patting themselves on the back as international growth figures have begun to pick up. “But they should be worried. In the real world, outside the Davos bubble of Alpine restaurants and chalets, the global economic system they have built isn’t working for billions of people. “And just as Davos faces the risk of an avalanche this week, growth for a few risks a political and social avalanche unless there is fundamental change to our rigged economic system. Philip Hammond, the UK’s chancellor of the Exchequer, is also at Davos. He’s been giving his views about artificial intelligence at a Microsoft breakfast, saying: “We are at the point where computers move from being dumb and fast to being smart and fast.” Hammond says AI is going to be disruptive and managing the process is the key to it being accepted, warning: “To many it will seem to be a big threat to their prosperity and livelihoods”. Losers would include members of the middle class but it was important to embrace the new technology rather than resist it. “Let’s not create a generation of 21st Century Luddites who feel the only chance of survival is to resist change.” Hammond said AI would affect the jobs market, would disrupt business models and had ethical dimensions including privacy and the way new technology could be used in wars. “The choice is simple: do we look inward or outward, look to the future or cleave to the past?” Here are some photos of Donald Trump setting off to Davos last night: Good morning from Davos. It’s another big day at the World Economic Forum, with Theresa May giving a keynote speech this afternoon – and meeting Donald Trump on the sidelines. The UK PM is expected to put technology giants under pressure to clean up their act and tackle extreme content. She’ll say: Investors can make a big difference here by ensuring trust and safety issues are being properly considered. And I urge them to do so. These companies simply cannot stand by while their platforms are used to facilitate child abuse, modern slavery or the spreading of terrorist and extremist content.” Her meeting with Trump will be a chance to talk trade after Brexit, discuss terrorism, and perhaps patch up that Special Relationship after the row over the US embassy. As Beth Rigby from Sky News puts it: The two leaders are expected to focus on areas where there is common ground in international affairs: North Korea, as well as eradicating Islamic State in Syria and northern Iraq. They might touch on Iran. But the thornier issue of Russian aggression in Europe is less likely to be raised as the Prime Minister seeks to soothe relations and not stoke further tensions. President Trump set off for Davos last night - part of the biggest US delegation ever. We’ll be hearing more from his team this morning. There’s also masses of other events, covering gender equality, financial stability, tax avoidance and climate change.

Here is a summary of the day’s events: Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership has come under scrutiny once again after Labour lost the byelection for Copeland - a seat it had held since 1935 - to the Tories. The Unison general secretary, Dave Prentis, said the blame did not lie solely with Corbyn but “he must take responsibility for what happens next”. Senior Labour backbencher David Winnick said Corbyn was an “obstacle” to victory and should consider his position. The leader of Usdaw described the result as “a wake-up call” and the MP for neighbouring Barrow-in-Furness warned the party was heading for disaster at the general election. Corbyn insisted his leadership did not contribute to the byelection defeat and that he would not be stepping down from his position. “We will continue our campaigning work on the NHS, on social care and on housing,” he said. He also highlighted Labour’s victory in Stoke. Theresa May claimed the Conservative victory in Copeland showed her party is governing for every part of the country. The prime minister signalled an intention to challenge Labour in its northern heartlands. The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, lamented the party’s performance in Stoke where it failed to dislodge Labour but the current leader Paul Nuttall dismissed suggestions he would quit. Farage said the party “could have been clearer on immigration” and others also questioned Nuttall’s performance. But asked if he would stand down, Nuttall said he was “not going anywhere”. Despite the historic nature of the Conservative win in Copeland, on the Prospect website, Jay Welwes argues it was a pyrrhic victory for the prime minister: It looks like victory, and in the short-term, it is. But in the longer-term, its effects work against [Theresa] May, not for her. Because the more powerful she becomes domestically, the more confident the pro-Brexit Tory core becomes and the further it drives them into their error of mistaking domestic prowess for foreign influence. The by-election victory will only boost the expectations of the eurosceptics, who will see in their domination of British politics license to take a tough negotiating line with the EU. But what they are really doing is setting themselves and their prime minister up for a catastrophic fall. Copeland will, in its way, boost the Conservative Brexiters’ confidence. The “mandate creep” towards hard Brexit continues. And the higher the expectations of the Brexit brigade, the more painful will be their eventual and inevitable landing. Some more interesting byelection statistics: John Hannett, the general secretary of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw), has called the the result a “wake up call” and warned the Labour party not to “pass the buck”. Usdaw is a critical union affiliated to the Labour party but one of the few that did not back Corbyn in the leadership campaign. Hannett told the Guardian: We can’t dismiss these by-elections or blame other people - whether previous politicians or the media. All of that is a distraction from why isn’t the current Labour party connecting with voters. Talking about issues that affected his members such as terms and conditions and Sunday trading rules, he said people needed a Labour government. “Usdaw members whether in shops or factories are desperate for a credible opposition,” he added, arguing that while he applauded the scale and size of Labour’s membership, the party had to reach out further. You can’t win an election purely from an internal base - you have to have vision and reach to people not yet convinced. Yesterday’s result is a further wake up call that there is a need for an urgent debate within the party, from the leader and across the piste, as to why we do not seem to be connecting with the wider public... “We need to stop the blame game,” added Hannett, who said it wasn’t in the interest of the party to point the finger of blame at the media or Tony Blair. We determine our strategy but it is difficult to get an understanding of your policy when - at the moment - the public is not listening. Jeremy Corbyn was irked by members of the media shouting competing questions at him during his brief appearance in Stoke this afternoon. Gareth Snell, Labour’s winning candidate in Stoke, also chimed in. Moving away from the byelections for a moment, the Tory MP who told critics of the government’s policy on child refugees that they should stop being “so sentimental” has hit back at the media, claiming her comments were “misconstrued”. Pauline Latham took to Twitter to protest at the Guardian and other media’s reports on her remarks and has now issued a statement saying it is wrong to suggest she does not care about unaccompanied children trying to get into the UK. She wrote in a circular to voters who had contacted her to complain: Almost immediately after my speech articles went out in the press which only quoted the phrase ‘stop being so sentimental’ and implied that I had no concern at all refugees, which is completely untrue. She had been speaking in the House of Commons on an emergency debate on the government’s decision to end the so-called Dubs scheme which gave lone children the chance of legally coming to the UK instead of risking their death on the back of a lorry. I care a great deal about refugees and the appalling plight they face. I have visited two Jordanian refugee camps and one in Turkey and have spoken to refugee children. I did that out of concern for them, not a lack of it. Indeed I was at the speech in the first place because I care about their plight, and want to consider the best way to help them. Latham did not offer further comment on remarks that if refugees were living in “rat-infested” shelters in Greece, that was Greece’s problem. Baroness Smith, the shadow leader of the House of Lords and a former Labour MP, has urged Jeremy Corbyn to think “long and hard” about what she called the devastating defeat in Copeland. She told HuffPost UK: “I think all of us, across the shadow cabinet, individually and collectively, have got to look long and hard at what people in Copeland have told us ... “Was this people didn’t want to hear what Jeremy wanted to say to them? Was that the reason? Or are there wider, more deeper reasons? I don’t think we should rush to conclusions on that ... “I can’t believe for one moment he draws any comfort from that result and he will be clearly be thinking long and hard about it.” Channel 4 News’s Michael Crick says Corbyn refused to answer whether he still wants a general election. The Labour leader ignored all questions from reporters. Jeremy Corbyn has made an appearance in Stoke. He said the result was result was “very disappointing” but made clear he was determined to carry on. I was elected to lead this party. I am proud to lead this party. We will continue our campaigning work on the NHS, on social care, on housing. He told cheering supporters that Labour was working for “an economy that is based on investment, based on good jobs, based on growth, based on opportunities for everybody in our society”. “Ukip can’t offer that, the Tories can’t offer that. We can, we will, and we will win,” said the Labour leader, who left without taking questions from reporters. One more analysis piece to add to that list is Ian Dunt on politics.co.uk who paints a depressing picture of the opposition: So what happens now? The so-called Labour moderates have not just been silenced by the Owen Smith contest. They are also petrified by Brexit and the witch hunt against anyone who tries to ‘thwart the will of the people’. Theresa May’s steely gaze in the Lords this week, as peers debated amendments to the Article 50 bill, looks upon MPs as well, daring them to stand up and oppose her plans and be branded traitors to the country by her cabal of rabid newspaper supporters and parliamentarians. The only thing that unites the right and left of the Labour party is terror over Brexit and Brexit is the only political subject which matters. There’s just not much going on. Corbyn offers no hope. His opponents offer no hope. Labour does not appear prepared to split or to select a new leader. Instead it is just slumped on the floor, occasionally twitching, although even that sometimes seems too much for it now. The fact it can even win a by-election in Stoke is actually impressive. It shows the resilience of the Labour brand despite the utter poverty of those who represent it in parliament. Here is a round-up of some the most interesting analysis of last night’s results. The scrutiny is understandably on Labour and its leadership but Anthony Wells on UK polling report notes that Ukip is also faced with some tough questions after its disappointing performance in Stoke Central: It does perhaps give us a idea of the limits to the Ukip threat to Labour. Ukip were perceived as the main challengers from the beginning and it was a promising seat for them: a somewhat neglected working class Labour seat that voted strongly for Brexit, but with a Labour candidate who was remain. They seem to have thrown all they could at it, but with very little success. Again, we can’t be certain why – Paul Nuttall obviously had a difficult campaign and anecdotally Ukip’s ground game was poor, but there are also wider questions about Ukip’s viability now Brexit has been adopted by the Conservatives and without Farage at their helm. While Wells is one of many to suggest the issue of nuclear power was key to Labour’s defeat in Copeland, Paul Mason, on Medium, as is his wont, has a different interpretation. He writes: People are voting Tory in the full knowledge that the NHS is collapsing, being privatised, that refugee children are being left molested at Calais and that a bunch of Tory incompetents are in charge - because they want Brexit. Brexit, not nuclear power, is the thing blinding a large section of the English and Welsh electorate at present and that will not change until the negotiations go catastrophically wrong, and the economic disaster unfolds Everybody on the progressive side of British politics needs to understand this will take some time. In the Independent, John Rentoul says that the Copeland defeat spells the end of Jeremy Corbyn but adds: Of course, Labour’s problems are deeper than Corbyn’s leadership. Brexit would have divided the party even – perhaps especially – if it had been led by someone who sincerely opposed it. But it must now be obvious to the 313,000 party members and supporters who re-elected Corbyn just five months ago that his leadership is unsustainable. What is less obvious is the answer to the question that got Corbyn to the leadership in the first place: who would be a better choice? On Labour List, Richard Angell is firmly of the opinion that it was the antipathy of Corbyn and his close allies towards the nuclear power industry that cost the party in Copleland: Labour woke up to the news that voters in Copeland felt it more important to send a signal to Labour its leadership – and its plans for their jobs, were it ever to get into power – than hit a Tory government on the nose for actually closing their maternity unit and urgent care centre while the campaign was running ... [Shadow chancellor John] McDonnell and a small number of shadow cabinet members are the only ones keeping Corbyn in office. It is time to accept his rumoured wish to resign. Failing that they condemn the Labour party to the same fate as the hard-left’s leadership of the party – irrecoverable decline. It never rains, it pours... “Labour will never come back again here.” That is the common portentous view among lunchtime drinkers in the Mirehouse Labour Social Club, the hub of life on Whitehaven’s biggest estate. Savouring a cheap pint the day after the Conservative party ended Labour’s eight decade rule in Copeland, the lifetime Labour voters expressed antipathy towards Jeremy Corbyn and deep disillusionment about politics in general. “A lot of people don’t like Corbyn,” said one downcast voter. “He’s a lunatic. If they want to keep the nuclear industry, he’ll shut it down. If they want to keep the hospital, he’ll shut it down. It’s either his way or no way.” “This week I’ve spoken to a lot of people, lifelong Labour voters who I’ve known for a very long time, who voted Conservative because they want Jeremy Corbyn out,” said Mike Starkey, the independent mayor of Copeland. Starkey said he believed the Labour revolt would claim further scalps in the party’s heartlands if Corbyn remains in charge. He predicted that Sue Hayman, the well-respected Labour MP for neighbouring Workington, would be next to lose her seat without change at the top. “There’s a consensus that if Jeremy Corbyn leads them into a general election it will be catastrophic,” he said on Friday. These are from the Independent’s John Rentoul. That is all from me for today. My colleague Haroon Siddique is taking over the blog now. In the comments refitman asked this. You’re right. It isn’s as simple as it used to be, because the Fixed-term Parliaments Act stops a prime minister just announcing one. But there is an over-ride provided two-thirds of MPs vote for one (a rare example in statute of a simple majority in the Commons not being sufficient) and Jeremy Corbyn is on record as saying Labour would vote for an early election. So, on this, Theresa May has a two-thirds majority. May could also repeal the FTPA with a simple majority in the Commons, although getting that through the Lords would be more tricky. On the Daily Politics earlier Ian Lavery, who is Labour’s joint elections coordinator along with Andrew Gwynne, criticised people who were using the Copeland result to attack Jeremy Corbyn. That’s being spewed out onto the media this morning. The attack, whether it is Stoke or Copeland, is being solely focused on why everybody should get rid of Jeremy Corbyn. In fact, Jeremy Corbyn is one of the most popular politicians in the country at this moment in time. The issues in Copeland weren’t about Jeremy Corbyn. The issues in Copeland were about jobs and about the economy. People were worried about those. Theo Bertram, a former adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, has written an interesting blog looking at Labour’s problem in Copeland. He goes into detail about how the party has been losing support amongst skilled working-class (C2) and semi-skilled and unskilled workers (DEs). Here are three key charts from his blog. This shows how Labour’s working class support has declined over the last 40 years. This shows how the Conservatives are currently ahead with C2, even though in the past Labour has had a lead amongst this group. And this shows how Labour has almost lost its lead amongst DEs. Bertram says working class voters don’t like Jeremy Corbyn. Working class voters looked at Corbyn and made up their minds in the first two months. On the left, in September 2015, 32% of C2DEs had no opinion on whether Corbyn was doing a good or bad job. Only 30% thought he was doing a bad job. By November 2015, only 14% didn’t know. 63% thought he was doing a bad job. But he says they do like Theresa May. David Cameron put off working class voters, Theresa May does not. In April 2016, Cameron had a net satisfaction rating among working class voters of minus 35%. 62% of them thought he was doing a bad job (nearly as many as Corbyn). In July 2016, in her first month as Prime Minister, Theresa May’s net satisfaction rating among working class voters was +16%. So while Labour flat-lined under Corbyn, the Tories changed their leader and their working class approval leaped by 51 points. Worse still for Labour, whereas working class voters liked Corbyn much lessafter two months, they like May more now than they did in July. The former Labour mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, a longstanding ally of Jeremy Corbyn’s, has also claimed that what happened under New Labour led to the party losing in Copeland. Livingstone told Sky News: If you look at the collapse in the vote, 20 years ago when Tony Blair won his first election, we got 58% of the vote in Copeland. Two years ago at the last election that had collapsed down to about 4% more than we got yesterday. This isn’t a decline that’s happened under Jeremy. It’s been happening for 20 years and you hear it from so many ordinary people on the streets saying, ‘What did the last Labour government ever do for me?’ If we are to turn this round, Labour MPs have got to stop undermining Jeremy and focus on the economy. A sernior Ukip figure has criticised the campaign fought by Paul Nuttall in Stoke, arguing he was poorly advised in seeking to tackle Labour on their own policies, rather than keeping the party’s reputation as a radical voice. Bill Etheridge, one of Ukip MEPs for the West Midlands region, said he hope Nuttall would instead pursue a “Farage-ist approach” from now on, arguing that the Stoke Central result – which saw the Ukip leader come within 79 votes of being pushed into third place – had been a failure for the party. Etheridge said: I’m very disappointed at the result, but extremely proud of the work the activists put in. I’m 100% supportive of Paul continuing as the leader, but I believe there is room for us to be more of a challenging, radical, rightwing party, with libertarian values at the forefront, which I think have got obscured of late. Maybe some of Paul’s advisers have led him down a dead end on this. We are all going to back Paul, but hopefully, we’ll win the argument for the party to get back to its real roots, of challenging authority and a sort of Farage-ist approach to the future.Etheridge’s comments indicate the party remains still split between modernisers, keen to take on Labour on issues such as NHS spending, and more traditional elements, who prefer a robust approach on areas such as immigration and crime. Etheridge’s comments indicate the party remains still split between modernisers, keen to take on Labour on issues such as NHS spending, and more traditional elements, who prefer a robust approach on areas such as immigration and crime. Nuttall’s team in Stoke included Suzanne Evans, Ukip’s head of policy, Patrick O’Flynn, another MEP, and Lisa Duffy, a former leadership candidate, all of whom are on the wing of the party pushing for a more modern outlook. But only three months after Nuttall was overwhelmingly elected as leader, replacing Diane James’s 18-day tenure, there is no thought that he could be challenged. Another senior Ukip figure, who asked not to be named, said: “There’s no appetite for challenging Paul, not least as we’ve got no one else to replace him”. Earlier the Labour MP John Woodcock criticised people blaming the last Labour government for the defeat in Copeland. (See 12.06pm.) At the time I said I had not seen anyone explicitly making that claim, but Woodcock may have been referring to these tweets from Ken Loach, the filmmaker and Corbyn supporter. Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, Britain’s biggest public sector union and a powerful force in Labour politics, has issued what sounds rather like an ultimatum to Jeremy Corbyn. In a statement he implied that Corbyn was partly to blame for the Copeland defeat (the blame “does not lie solely” with Corbyn) and he said the Labour leader must “take responsibility” for turning things around. While it was pleasing to see Ukip put in its place, Stoke should never have been in doubt and the result in Copeland was disastrous. The blame for these results does not lie solely with Jeremy Corbyn, but he must take responsibility for what happens next. Nurses, teaching assistants, care workers and ordinary people everywhere need a Labour government. Jeremy has to show he understands how to turn things around and deliver just that. This is what Theresa May told Conservative activists in Copeland when she spoke to them a few minutes ago. This is an astounding victory for the Conservative party, but also for the people of Copeland. Labour have held this seat since the 1930s. A party in government has not won a byelection in a seat held by the opposition for 35 years. And you know what people were saying about this election. Labour were saying, ‘We’re going to win it.’ Experts were saying Labour would increase their majority. But all of you, the volunteers who went out there day in and day out and campaigned, you have made sure that that did not happen, that this is truly a wonderful victory for the Conservative party, but also for the people of Copeland. And what I think we’ve seen from this victory is that this truly is a government that is working for everyone and for every part of this country. Theresa May is in Copeland, and she is speaking to Conservative activists now. She says the experts expected Labour to win in this constituency. But the party has shown that it is truly working for everyone. And the party had an excellent candidate, May says. She says Trudy Harrison is someone who rolls up her sleeves and gets things done. It is a fantastic result and wonderful victory, she says. Trudy Harrison says she is really looking forward to getting to Westminster and delivering for everyone. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, has used an interview with Sky to say that his party should have been clearer on immigration and that it needs to improve its election machine. These are from Sky’s Tamara Cohen. Here is Marc Stears, a key adviser to Ed Miliband when Milband was Labour leader, on the Copeland result. Here is the verdict on the byelections from a Guardian Comment panel, with contributions from Gaby Hinsliff, Gary Younge, Polly Toynbee and Giles Fraser. On Whitehaven marina, opinion among traditional Labour voters is united on one issue: Jeremy Corbyn. Many commentators felt his perceived anti-nuclear stance would prove toxic in Copeland, where more than 10,000 jobs rely on the industry, but it appears that the feeling runs far deeper than that. Christine Curtin, a 57-year-old housewife who described herself as a dyed-in-the-wool Labour voter, said Corbyn was alienating the party’s core vote. “Just about everyone - Labour people - I’ve spoke to does not like him,” she said. “I don’t think he’s the right man for the job. He can’t do the job. “I think it’s his personality, the Irish thing - it’s his history of engaging with what we see as terrorists. There’s a lot of things involved. He seems to be more extreme than a lot of us are around here.” Curtin said she made a last-minute decision to vote Labour despite deep reservations about Corbyn, who she felt was only interested in Copeland “because he wants to shut the factory” – a reference to the Sellafield nuclear decommissioning site and the Labour leader’s perceived hostility to nuclear which hung over the byelection. A passing cyclist, who did not want to be named, said he was a lifelong Labour voter and remained that way begrudgingly in Thursday’s byelection. He said he would take his vote elsewhere at the next election unless Corbyn was unseated. “I’m quite disillusioned with the party,” he said. “I’m not a Jeremy Corbyn supporter and even after this result it confirmed deep down what I thought about the current state of the party. I don’t think I’ll ever vote Tory but it depends what happens with Labour, if they get their house in order and sort their policies out.” Leonard Rogers and his wife, Joy, both 81, were Lib Dem voters but voted Conservative on Thursday. “Labour doesn’t enthuse anyone with confidence, does it?” said Leonard. “With him leader I certainly would not vote for Labour. The Conservatives seem to be the only viable alternative.” Rogers, a retiree who swapped the southwest London for the west Cumbrian coast, said most of his friends here were Labour supporters. “We’ve got friends just down the road from us and they’ve historically voted Labour but this time they’ve voted Conservative. They felt it was the only viable party.” Mary Mooney, 67, and her husband Geoff, 68, said most of their friends “were Labour voters” but many voted against the party in protest at the perceived decline of Whitehaven town centre, which was busy with half-term holidaymakers on Friday. “I’m not surprised at the result because people needed change,” said Mary Mooney. “The town’s derelict. The harbour’s beautiful but go to the town and there’s nothing to keep visitors here. The [Labour-run] town council doesn’t do much. Something drastic needs to happen in Whitehaven.” In Copeland Theresa May secured the biggest rise in the share of the vote for a governing party in a byelection since Labour at the Hull North byelection in 1966. (See 7.49am.) That result encouraged Harold Wilson to call an early election. Asked at the Number 10 lobby briefing if Theresa May would do the same, the prime minister’s spokesman said: The prime minister has set out the position very clearly on a general election. There are no plans for one. Politics Live readers are smart enough to know that, in Whitehall, “no plans” for something does not mean that it will not happen, and quite often it means that there are plans, but that the politician involved just doesn’t want to admit it. But in this case an open mind, rather than acute scepticism, is probably the best response. May has repeatedly ruled out an “early” election (without defining early), she is temperamentally not given to risk and surprise and she does not have a good excuse for calling one. The odds must be against one happening this year. But it would be surprising if someone in Number 10 hadn’t taken a look at the numbers. And, given some of the predictions about what a horror show Brexit may become by 2019, you can see why some might be arguing that May should get the election out of the way now. The Labour MP John Woodcock, who has been a persistent critic of Jeremy Corbyn and whose Barrow and Furness seat is next to Copeland, has used Twitter to argue that the Blair/Brown governments cannot be blamed for Labour’s defeat last night. I have not heard anyone explicitly claim this morning that the New Labour government was to blame for what happened to the Labour vote in Copeland, but Woodcock may have been referring to Jeremy Corbyn’s claim that “the political establishment” have let these voters down. Corbyn posted this on Twitter last night. Corbyn made a similar point in a post on Facebook last night. He said: The political establishment has let down Copeland and Stoke, who have seen their industries gutted, living standards stagnate and hope for a better future for their children and grandchildren decline. Business Insider’s Adam Bienkov has this response. Paddy Ashdown, the former Lib Dem leader who is campaigning for progressive parties to work together against the Tories, claims the Copeland result supports his argument. My colleague John Harris is particularly unimpressed with John McDonnell’s take on the reasons for Labour’s defeat in Copeland. (See 7.22am and 8.05am.) And here is video footage of Jeremy Corbyn responding to the Chris Ship question. (See 11.23am.) Corbyn’s Q&amp;A is over. Here is the full text of Chris Ship’s question, and Jeremy Corbyn’s answer. (See 11.03am.) Ship: I want to ask you specifically about Copeland. Since you found out that you’d lost a seat to the governing party for the first time since the Falklands War, have you at any point this morning looked in the mirror and asked yourself this question: ‘Could the problem actually be me?’ Corbyn: No. Ship: Why not? Corbyn: Thank you for your question. Some in the audience applauded Corbyn’s answer. Corbyn says Labour will be challenging the government’s great repeal bill. It will be challenging it to ensure that employment and environmental protections are maintained. Corbyn says there is a lot of anger amongst voters in Europe at the moment. The challenge is to turn that into a positive force, he says. He says the left has to develop an economic strategy about equality and opportunity. Corbyn is now taking questions from the political attendees at the Labour event, not journalists. But one questioner said he had a point to make about the byelections. It reminded him of the first world war general who said the situation was catastrophic, but not serious, he said. Q: [To ITV’s Chris Ship, on his last day in his job] Stoke was a Labour seat which you retained. Since you have found out that you have lost a seat to a governing party for the first time since the Falklands, have you at any point looked in the mirror this morning and thought you might be the problem? No, says Corbyn. And that’s it. He answers with just one word. Corbyn says he does not think he is to blame for Labour’s defeat in Copeland. Corbyn’s speech is over. He is now taking questions. Q: Are you turning into Theresa May’s best friend in politics? Corbyn says the media should not underestimate the significance of the victory in Stoke. Labour beat Ukip in a city that Ukip was calling its own. Many in the media thought Labour would lose. But he is disappointed by the result in Copeland, he says. He says Labour is determined to get the message across the Britain’s future depends on having a high-skilled economy. Corbyn says today’s conference will allow European progressive parties to set out their goals for an alternative future for Europe. Theresa May is more interested in looking across the Atlantic to President Trump, he says. But he says Labour wants to strengthen, not weaken, relations with countries in the EU. Corbyn says he wants to applaud voters in Europe who have chosen hope over fear, like those most recently voting in the Austrian presidential elections. He says he thinks the same thing will happen in the French presidential elections. Corbyn says he also wants to talk to Labour’s sister parties at the conference today about further European cooperation. Labour will not turn is back on Europe. Labour remains strongly committed to bodies like the council of Europe, he says. And he says the rights of EU nationals living in the UK must be guaranteed. The rights of EU nationals living and working in Britain must be guaranteed now – just as the rights of UK nationals must be protected across the rest of the EU. It is a scandal that our government is trying to use citizens of the EU, who have made their homes in Britain, as a bargaining chip ... I understand the fear in many communities since the Brexit vote. Many EU nationals feel isolated and believe they are no longer welcome in the country they have come to call home. I want to send a clear message to all those people who have already given so much to British society: you are welcome here, Labour will fight for your rights, we will stand up to intolerance, and we will do everything we can to represent and defend you. Corbyn says if the UK becomes a low-tax, low-regulation honeypot after Brexit, as Theresa May has threatened, the government will not be able to fund proper public services. Corbyn says Labour wants the UK to continue to participate in the Erasmus programme (an EU student exchange scheme) after Brexit. Corbyn says Labour would deliver key infrastructure projects, including a Crossrail for the north of England. Corbyn says trade union voices must be listened to in the Brexit debate. Many regions in the UK are dependent on structural funds. Labour has demanded assurances from the government that they will continue to receive funding. The government has not given those assurances, he says. But Labour will be the voice for those regions. Corbyn says that when Theresa May says no Brexit deal is better than a bad deal, we need to be clear that no deal is a bad deal. Britain needs continued access to European markets, he says. There must be no attempt to dilute workplace rights, he says. Corbyn accuses Theresa May of “fake patriotic posturing”. [The government has] wrapped Brexit up in fake patriotic posturing, waving the Union Jack while preparing to sell out our public services and consumer protections to US corporations, cheered on by the corporate media, who pile up their wealth in overseas tax havens while posing as national champions and fostering division both at home and abroad. Let me be clear, those who actually love their country would never seek to divide it. He says the Tories are heading for Brexit with a broken sat-nav system, telling them to turn right, right and right again. We may need to listen to experts, he says. That is why he has called today’s meeting of European socialists to discuss Brexit. Theresa May has dangled the threat of turning Britain into a bargain basement tax haven if the European Union doesn’t play ball. Let’s be clear: slashing taxes still further for big business, and cutting essential regulation in jobs, the environment, consumer protection, will be a magnet for north American corporate giants - that’s not just a threat and a danger to the European Union, it’s a threat and a danger to the British people, effectively turning all of us into bargaining chips. Far from taking back control, that would mean an assault on our public services, our standard of living and our quality of life. This is not, absolutely not, what the majority of our people want. But it is the clearly stated agenda of senior members of the Conservative government, who made clear both during and since the referendum campaign that is exactly the fantasy free market never-never land they want out of Brexit. Corbyn says Labour can shape Britain’s future. And it can stop a divisive, Tory Brexit. But to do that it must be united. Our future should not be decided by a cabal of rightwing zealots, he says. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. There is a live feed at the top of this blog. He says Labour is determined to play a pro-active role in Europe in the future. The referendum last year revealed sharp divides in Britain, he says. People are starting to view politics through the prism of leave or remain, he says. He says that was clear in the byelections. The Labour victory in Stoke was a decisive rejection of Ukip’s divisive politics, he says. But Labour’s message was not enough in Copeland. He says this is difficult for Labour. Most Labour MPs voted remain, but most Labour constituencies voted leave. Labour could choose to just represent those who voted remain. Or it could try to represent everyone, and choose a way forward. That is what is has chosen to do, he says. The Labour MP Ian Lavery said leadership did not come up on the doorstep when he was in Copeland. “Honestly, Jeremy Corbyn did not come up when I was knocking on doors,” he said. However, he said voters did claim that they couldn’t back a party that was divided. “Disunity is one of the major issues,” he said. Lavery admitted that it was a hugely disappointing night in the Cumbrian seat, but argued it hadn’t been a safe bet. Copeland was not a good result- if is a heartland we have had control of for many years but it is a marginal and has been since 1997. Since then it has been in decline. We need bold and imaginative policies. Lavery argued that the two key issues in Copeland were the NHS but also the nuclear industry, with big concerns about jobs trumping other issues in the end. Jeremy Corbyn recorded a clip for broadcasters before he started his speech. Referring to the Copeland result, he said: Copeland is obviously very disappointing. I hoped we’d have won the election there. We didn’t ... When he was asked if he would resign in the light of the fact that Labour’s share of the vote has been falling in a series of byelections now, he ruled out the proposal. He replied: I was elected to lead this party. I was elected to lead this party to oppose austerity, to oppose the redistribution of wealth in the wrong direction, which is what this government is doing. We will continue our campaigning work on the NHS, on social care, on housing. Jeremy Corbyn is about to give a speech in London on the theme “Road to Brexit”. On Twitter the academic Rob Ford says the Conservatives may have won in Copeland by squeezing the Ukip vote. On the Today programme this morning Matthew Goodwin, who co-wrote Revolt on the Right, the most authoritative book on the rise of Ukip, with Rob Ford, expanded on the same point made by his co-author. Goodwin said: Today some people have been saying the Ukip ballon has completely popped. We still have a second-placed radical right party in a Labour seat with 25% of the vote. That is a significant issue for all the main parties to think about. But also, let’s assume Theresa May wins back half of the Ukip vote. Labour MPs today are cheering the demise of Ukip. What does that mean for Labour? It means that around 45 seats will go to the Conservatives pretty quickly at the next election quite easily, because you have Labour MPs on small majorities where Ukip has around 15/20% of the vote. So Theresa May’s strategy right now, I would suggest, is spot on. Cbris Prosser, an academic who works on the British Election Study, has got an interesting take on the byelection results. This chart helps to illustrate this point. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, has given an interview to Piers Morgan for a Piers Morgan’s Life Stories programme being broadcast on ITV this evening. In it Farage says he is living like a “virtual prisoner” and is “frightened” to leave his home because of the way the media has “demonised” Ukip. Referring to Ukip members with extremist or racist views whose comments have been highlighted by the media, Farage says: It is because of these irrelevant people, who held no position, they happened to join an organisation, and because of these irrelevant people being demonised by liberal media, I’ve had to live years, frankly, of being frightened of walking out into the street all because the media picked out these people. And because of these people, attempted to demonise me and give me a bad name. And you’re surprised three years on, when I have to live like a virtual prisoner, that I’m not happy about it? Will I ever forgive the British media for what they’ve done to me? No. The Labour MP David Winnick has urged Jeremy Corbyn to consider his position in the light of the party’s defeat in Copeland. He told the Press Association: The party is faced with the problem of a leader who is simply not acceptable to a large number of people who would normally vote Labour. That it is an obstacle and it would be wrong not to recognise that. It is now entirely up to Jeremy and those close to him to decide what is best in the interests not simply of the party but the people we are in politics to represent. But Winnick said he was not in favour of a leadership challenge. That would be quite useless. It would end in the same result as previously. I accept that it is quite likely that when the general election comes it will be Corbyn as leader. One just has to accept that. But if I am asked if that is the best way for us to win an election I’m bound to say in all honesty the answer is no. The Ukip deputy leader Peter Whittle told ITV this morning that it would be a mistake to write off Ukip on the basis of the loss in Stoke. He said: When we win something in Ukip we are often called a flash in the pan. When we lose something - ‘Oh, well that’s the end of Ukip’ - nothing of the sort. Yes, last year we certainly did have a difficult time, but that’s in the past now. Here are two articles from Guardian commentators on the byelections results. John Harris says Labour is “racked by a deep, historic crisis that preceded the arrival of Jeremy Corbyn, but which his leadership seems to have immeasurably deepened”. And Rafael Behr says that Labour’s problems pre-date Corbyn but that he was “chosen as the antidote to decline, not its amplifier”. If he is in possession of an inspiring vision and an evangelical gift that can stir a mass movement to sweep Labour back to power, there really isn’t that much stopping him from deploying those gifts. The airwaves are available; so is the vast expanse of social media and any number of venues willing to host another rally. That was the plan when Corbyn sought ownership of the party. And now he owns it. So must he also own last night’s failure. Richard Angell, director of Progress, the Blairite organisation within Labour, has put out a statement saying that the Copeland result is a disaster for the party and that it should trigger a rethink by the leadership. Angell said: In normal times, Labour would be winning midterm byelections in Labour heartlands with increased majorities. Seats held in wipeout years like 2010 and 2015 should be stacking up huge majorities, especially seven years into a Tory government. Yet both sustained swings against Labour that would decimate the parliamentary party at the next election and see the Tories with an increased majority. The Tory gain in Copeland makes the message clear. A hard-left Momentum-led Labour party is more repugnant to the voters than a Tory government closing a local maternity unit and urgent care centre. It is a disaster and should make John McDonnell and Seumas Milne – who are keeping Jeremy Corbyn in office – rethink. They risk bringing the whole party down with this failed hard-left project. The Ukip chairman Paul Oakden was on the Today programme earlier. Here are the main points he made. Oakden said Ukip might have to wait another 20 years before it wins a seat at a byelection again. He said: Something clearly didn’t fire yesterday in as much as the fact that we didn’t win. Politics is a long game. It took us 23-odd years to win a referendum to get Britain out of the European Union. It may take that long for us to get a seat in Westminster via a byelection. But if that’s how long it takes then that’s what we will keep doing, because that’s what we are here for. He said that Paul Nuttall, the party leader and candidate in Stoke, had had a “difficult” campaign but enjoyed the full support of his party. Oakden said: This party is absolutely behind Paul Nuttall as its leader. He is 12 weeks into his leadership. We are all going to support him moving forward. This is one step along a long road for our party. He has had a difficult campaign. There is no doubt that he has been targeted by various unpleasant elements during the last four weeks. I think it was incredibly courageous of him to put his head above the parapet and stand to be the candidate for our party in this election. He did it to unify our party. I think by the evidence of the number of people who came up to support Paul during this campaign, that is what happened. Oakden said Labour won because it was better organised. We weren’t able to get our campaign on the ground as effective as we would have wanted to yesterday. The Labour Party did. The Labour Party have an incredibly strong and efficient campaign machine. Ukip are relatively new on the political scene. Prof John Curtice has written an article for the Guardian arguing that recent byelection results suggest that Labour is not paying enough attention to its supporters who voted remain. Here is his article. And here is an extract. Labour’s share of the vote has now dropped in every single byelection since the Brexit referendum. From leafy Richmond to windswept Copeland the message has been the same : the party is struggling to hang on to the already diminished band of supporters who backed it in 2015. The party’s problems were, of course, in evidence long before 23 June last year. But the vote to leave the EU has exacerbated them. Labour seems to have decided in recent weeks that its first priority is to stave off the threat from Ukip to its traditional working-class vote, much of which supposedly voted to leave in the EU referendum. But in so doing it seems to have forgotten (or not realised) that most of those who voted Labour in 2015 – including those living in Labour seats in the North and the Midlands – backed remain. The party is thus at greater risk of losing votes to the pro-remain Liberal Democrats than to pro-Brexit Ukip. If you want more information on the research showing most Labour voters backed remain, Curtice wrote that up in more detail here. Here is a graphic showing the Stoke results. And here are the results for Copeland. Q: On Twitter last night Jeremy Corbyn said Labour had to go further. What did he mean? McDonnell says that means things like making sure the party selects local candidates to fight elections, as it did in Copeland. And that’s it. The interview is over. McDonnell says the party has to unite. It cannot have a situation where a former leader attacks the party the week before a byelection. Q: So it is Tony Blair’s fault. McDonnell says he hopes it does not happen again. Q: The Labour-supporting Daily Mirror today says there are two words that explain Labour’s defeat: Jeremy Corbyn. McDonnell says he could also quote a woman he saw interviewed on the news last night who said what she wanted from a leader was someone who is honest and decent. That is Jeremy Corbyn. He says Corbyn has not considered standing down. And he says the Tories should not take Copeland as a green light for going ahead with cuts. Q: You feel the NHS is at risk. Corbyn raised this at PMQs. People are saying if he stays leader, the Tories are guaranteed to win the next election. McDonnell says Corbyn has had to spend half his time fighting leadership elections. The party wants unity, he says. He says Labour has managed to defeat Ukip, “a stain on British politics”, in Stoke. John McDonnell is being interviewed on Today now. Q: Do you agree with John Woodcock that Copeland was a “disaster” for Labour. (See 8.13am.) McDonnell says it was really disappointing. The prime minister will come out today to argue that Copeland is not just a loss for Labour but a big win for the Conservatives; that the voters weren’t just sceptical of Jeremy Corbyn but positive about Theresa May’s party. She will suggest that it shows her party’s message is connecting with ordinary voters. In Downing Street they see their strategy as two pronged, in which the firm line on Brexit is only one - necessary- but small part of the puzzle. They think it’s about trust and values. And I think they’ll take a good look at Stoke. She did go there, not because they believe they can win it now, but because Stoke is the type of seat that they think could - possibly- be target in future. They look back at Thatcher and Blair and think the only way to win big majorities is to encroach on Labour territory with a centre ground stance. The Labour MP John Woodcock, who represents Barrow and Furness, which is next to Copeland, and who is on the right of the party, told the Today programme that the defeat in the seat was a “disaster” for the party. We should not try to insult people’s intelligence by suggesting it is anything other than that. This was a campaign where we had an absolutely solid NHS issue that really cut through on the doorstep, the future of the local maternity unit and A&amp;E was very much on people’s minds. It was in many ways a classic byelection issue which could unite the community. But we failed to do so. Asked about Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, he said he thought it was counter-productive for MPs like him to keep challenging him. He said Corbyn would remain leader unless or until he decided to go. But Labour was not on course to win an election, he said. Certainly the position we are in at the moment, we are not on course for victory. We are on course to a historic and catastrophic defeat and that will have very serious consequences for all of the communities that we represent. In his interview earlier with ITV John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and key Corbyn ally, suggested that Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson were partly to blame for Labour’s defeat in Copeland because of their attacks on Corbyn. He said: What’s interesting is that the overwhelming number of members of the party, the majority of the party, are saying “unite”. And we can’t have a situation like we did last week when Tony Blair comes out and attacks his own party, Peter Mandelson as well. So we are saying to those people “unite” because people will then see the real Labour party campaigning. And we will win back places like Copeland. McDonnell also said he did not think Jeremy Corbyn’s position as leader would be under threat because of the defeat. He accepted that voters in Copeland “weren’t convinced that the party supported the nuclear industry”. But he said this was an exceptional issue in the constituency, because of the imortance of Sellafied. On the Today programme Prof John Curtice, the BBC’s main elections expert, said that since 1945 the government party has only taken a seat from the opposition in three byelections. One was at Mitcham and Morden in 1982, where Labour, which lost, had a smaller majority than in Copeland. The other two were Brighouse and Spenborough in 1960 and Sunderland South in 1953. Labour lost in both, but in both seats it was defending very small majorities. In Copeland Labour was defending a bigger majority, of 6.5%, Curtice said. The movement to the Conservatives, the increase in the Conservative vote of around 8.5 points, is the biggest increase enjoyed by the government in any byelection since 1966 when Harold Wilson managed to win the Hull North byelection which precipitated the 1966 general election. So this is very, very rare indeed. The general rule of byelections is that governments, even when popular in the polls, lose ground and oppositions, even if they are not doing that well, gain ground. Labour now have to look at a set of results, not just the two last night in both of which they lost ground, but in every singe byelection held since the Brexit referendum on June 23 last year Labour’s vote has been down. Curtice said that he accepted that there were special factors at play in Copeland, where the Sellafield nuclear processing plant is the most important local employer and Jeremy Corbyn’s previous opposition to nuclear power was held against him. But Curtice went on: I suspect Jeremy Corbyn’s critics will argue than in many a voter’s mind his opposition to the nuclear power industry is also linked to his opposition to nuclear weapons, and actually this is symptomatic of a wider problem with Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, in their view, [which] is that he holds certain attitudes and supports certain things which many a voter does not hold credible. For the record, here are last night’s byelection results in full. Copeland - Conservative gain from Labour Trudy Harrison (C) 13,748 (44.25%, +8.46%) Gillian Troughton (Lab) 11,601 (37.34%, -4.92%) Rebecca Hanson (LD) 2,252 (7.25%, +3.80%) Fiona Mills (UKIP) 2,025 (6.52%, -9.00%) Michael Guest (Ind) 811 (2.61%) Jack Lenox (Green) 515 (1.66%, -1.32%) Roy Ivinson (Ind) 116 (0.37%) C maj 2,147 (6.91%) 6.69% swing Lab to C Electorate 60,602; Turnout 31,068 (51.27%, -12.53%) Stoke-on-Trent Central - Labour hold Gareth Snell (Lab) 7,853 (37.09%, -2.22%) Paul Nuttall (Ukip) 5,233 (24.72%, +2.07%) Jack Brereton (C) 5,154 (24.35%, +1.80%) Zulfiqar Ali (LD) 2,083 (9.84%, +5.67%) Adam Colclough (Green) 294 (1.39%, -2.22%) Barbara Fielding (Ind) 137 (0.65%) The Incredible Flying Brick (Loony) 127 (0.60%) David Furness (BNP) 124 (0.59%) Godfrey Davies (CPA) 109 (0.51%) Mohammed Akram (Ind) 56 (0.26%) Lab maj 2,620 (12.38%) 2.14% swing Lab to Ukip Electorate 57,701; Turnout 21,170 (36.69%, -13.24%) We had two byelection results in the early hours this morning. One involved a Labour win in Stoke-on-Trent Central, and a significant setback for Ukip. And the other involved a remarkable and historic win for the Conservatives in Copeland, which saw Theresa May’s party gaining a seat that has been Labour-held for decade and the experts going back to 1945 or even earlier to find a comparable victory. Here is our overnight story about the two results. And here is our live blog from last night. This morning John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, has been blaming party disunity (by implication, those MPs who challenged him for the leadership last summer) for what happened. He told ITV: It’s not a matter of hanging on. Look, the situation is this. You learn lessons from these things. And one of the lessons you learn is people will not vote for a divided party. For the last 18 months, 20 months, we’ve been involved in two leadership elections. So, understandably, in the leadership election, those divisions will come out. I think the overwhelming number of the party, in both the parliamentary Labour party and in the constituencies, are saying we want a united party, let’s unite, and do you know in Stoke that’s what the party did, and we won. We’ve turned back the tide. And I think we’ve defeated quite a dangerous form of politics. I will be covering the reaction in full this morning. And at 10.30am we will be hearing from Jeremy Corbyn himself, because he is giving a speech on Brexit at 10.15am. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here.

The country’s Nuclear Regulation Authority had approved the restart of the reactors at the Takahama plant in Fukui prefecture, but in a ruling on Tuesday judges sided with residents who had sought an injunction against the facility’s operator, Kansai Electric Power (Kepco). The residents had argued that nuclear officials had underestimated the plant’s vulnerability to powerful earthquakes of the kind that triggered the Fukushima disaster. They added that the reactors did not meet proper safety standards and that evacuation contingencies were inadequate. With the nuclear watchdog having approved the restart of the ageing Takahama reactors, as well as two other reactors at the Sendai nuclear power plant in south-western Japan, anxious residents see the courts as their last chance to block the restarts. The last of Japan’s 48 functioning nuclear reactors went offline in September 2013 in response to the March 2011 Fukushima disaster, the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. Another court is to rule this month on a separate injunction brought against plans to restart the Sendai reactors. A similar ruling in that case would in effect derail Abe’s campaign to reintroduce nuclear into Japan’s energy mix this year. Reports say resolving the legal battles over the four reactors could take months, even years. The three-judge panel at the Fukui district ruled that the safety of the Takahama reactors had not been secured and described the mooted restarts as “lacking in rationality”, according to local media reports. The presiding judge, Hideaki Higuchi, is considered a maverick in Japan’s traditionally conservative judiciary, having issued a similar ruling against separate reactor restarts in Fukui prefecture last May. Kepco said the residents’ injunction was “regrettable and utterly unacceptable” and vowed to appeal against Tuesday’s decision. A lawyer representing the residents hailed a “perfect victory”, adding: “This is the best decision we could have expected.” Campaigners said the ruling should prompt a rethink of Japan’s energy mix to include a dramatically bigger role for renewables. “This important ruling signals that the government’s and the utilities’ pro-nuclear agenda can be blocked,” said Hisayo Takada of Greenpeace Japan. “Highly indebted utilities are pushing the restart of their dangerous nuclear plants at any cost – even if their reactors have major safety risks and many are nearing the end of their lifetimes. The decision today is a further setback to a nuclear industry in crisis.” Abe has warned that Japan must restart at least some of its reactors to support the country’s economic recovery amid record imports of coal and liquefied natural gas. The business lobby has complained that firms are paying a high price for energy imports while nuclear reactors remain idle. Kepco, which supplies the sprawling Osaka metropolis, is expecting annual losses of 161bn yen this year and has lost 744bn yen since the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown in March 2011. Before the ruling, nuclear industry officials had appeared optimistic that reactors would go back online in the coming months. “This year marks the exit from zero nuclear power,” Takashi Imai, chairman of the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum, said at an industry event in Tokyo this week. “It is self-evident that nuclear power plants that have passed safety tests should be restarted as soon as possible.” Japan’s pro-nuclear lobby insists that restarts will be critical if Japan is to honour internationally agreed commitments to cut its greenhouse gas emissions. Environment ministry data released on Tuesday showed that Japan’s CO2 emissions rose to the second-highest level on record in the year to March 2014. Local media reports said Japan aims to reduce CO2 emissions by about 20% from 2005 levels by 2030 – a much lower target than other major developed economies. The post-Fukushima reactor closures had already forced it to slash its previous target to just a 3.8% cut from 2005 levels by 2020. Before Fukushima, nuclear accounted for almost 30% of Japan’s power generation, and there were plans to raise its share even higher with the construction of more reactors. Despite government pressure to return to nuclear, a majority of the public has been consistent in its opposition restarts since the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi, which sent large quantities of radiation into the air and sea, and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents, many of whom have yet to return home."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2016/feb/09/guardian-weekly-letters-dangerous-revolution","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-09T13:31:50Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 12 February 2016","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/feb/09/guardian-weekly-letters-dangerous-revolution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2016/feb/09/guardian-weekly-letters-dangerous-revolution","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 12 February 2016","bodyText":"Dangerous revolution What cloud cuckoo land do economists inhabit? Larry Elliott’s article Ready for another revolution? (29 January) is just the emperor pretending he’s not wearing the same old nakedness. His Industrial Revolution 4.0 – based on driverless cars, 3D printing, smart robotics – ignores the fact that untrammelled industrial and technological growth are not only primary drivers of climate change and environmental devastation, but are cannibalising and debauching our entire planetary life-support system. Earth’s wellbeing, hence our own, depends on the resilience of an intricate web of interlocking, inter-active ecosystems, many of which are already tipping into irreversible damage. The others are eroding. Ecology is the study, economy is the law, of the household. The real revolution would be the marriage of these currently opposing poles, the creation of an economic paradigm rooted in moral, social and ecological accountability, and mandated with bequeathing a thriving, exquisitely beautiful planet to all our children: whale calves, spawning tadpoles, sapling oaks, human babies, fledgling eagles. Annie March West Hobart, Tasmania, Australia • I read Larry Elliott’s piece on the fourth industrial revolution and couldn’t help feeling apprehension. Yes, the wave of further automation involving robotics described by Elliott is highly probable. The Archbishop of Canterbury’s statement that this is “about what it is to be human” goes to the heart of the matter. I recently re-read EF Schumacher’s Small Is Beautiful, where he exposes humankind’s desire to eradicate work as a false quest by describing the act of making a shirt: This should provide a) a proud livelihood to those processing the material, b) a stimulating act of creation for the tailor and c) satisfaction to the purchaser, who would possess an article of beauty. These economic steps do not simply allow workers to earn money but also provide essential cohesion to society. But what are we left with following the fourth revolution? Even if it provides us with leisure time, what remains of our pride as human beings? We will have become slaves to the very machines created to serve us. And the energy needed to power these “smart machines”? Where will that come from? I see us charging on into this particular “brave new world” and being consumed by our own hubris. Alan Mitcham Cologne, Germany The debate over therapy In response to Oliver Burkeman’s article about the effectiveness of psychoanalysis versus cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (29 January): after more than 30 years of practice as a psychologist and observing the changes in the dominant models of therapy over the years, I have come to a similar conclusion: we don’t really know what works. The complexity of human behaviour, thought and emotions, together with the working of unconscious processes, makes measuring outcomes and effectiveness extremely difficult. Therapy remains as much an art as a science. Essential variables are the presence of a dedicated therapist and a client committed to change. Burkeman writes of the “dodo-bird verdict”, which suggests that the specific type of therapy makes little difference. However, CBT is not just about getting rid of unwanted thoughts. When CBT is combined with Mindfulness meditation (MCBT), it can be very helpful. There is increasing evidence for positive outcomes with MCBT, but it may be another dodo-bird therapy. In its favour are that is more accessible and less expensive than analysis, and less likely to create dependence on the therapist. Also, MCBT practitioners are keen to research the process of change using brain imaging. We eagerly await the development of better therapies for our clients. Margaret Wilkes Cottesloe, Western Australia • I have experienced both CBT and analysis. To use a motoring analogy: for me CBT is like a get-you-home service, as it deals very well with one specific situation. But to get to and address a more generalised and deeper-lying anxiety, I found analysis to be more like a garage major service in that it covered a much wider spectrum of situations. It isn’t a case of which is better, they each deal with different circumstances and should be regarded not as competing but complementary. Mike Burnett Sydney, Australia Zika virus emergency Having become accustomed to hospital-based hi-tech diagnosis and treatment of non-infectious diseases, we should remember that the main reasons why expectation of life at birth has doubled over the past century are prior developments in public health. The obligatory inoculation of children has saved many thousands of lives. The recent emergence of the Zika virus in South America (5 February) may be compared with rubella infection, causing only mild illness in adults, but tragic consequences for infants developing in utero. Widespread public health measures must be instituted, such as mosquito control, avoidance of travel to affected areas by pregnant women, and availability of contraception. In the meantime, urgent research for a Zika vaccine is needed. Bryan Furnass Canberra, Australia • The Zika virus is likely to spread to all countries of the Americas except Canada and Chile. The virus is linked to microcephaly and mental impairment in babies. Women from several countries across the Americas have been advised to avoid getting pregnant until the virus is better understood. The problem is that most Latin American countries are Catholic. Modern contraception and abortion are difficult to obtain, so women cannot make the choices they need to make to avoid giving birth to a child with microcephaly. Who will care for these poor babies? My son is a special needs teacher and he has been assigned just one adolescent boy this year because the boy’s needs are so great. Will poor countries have the resources to address similar needs of microcephalic children? Not likely. As a matter of urgency, the Catholic hierarchy must change its outdated views and allow both modern contraception and abortion so women have the means to choose whether they have children or not. This is a terrifying disease and it must be taken seriously. Jenny Goldie Michelago, NSW, Australia Britain’s global status I read Matthew d’Ancona’s definition of Britain’s place in the world today: “closely allied to the US; an EU member state; and an independent nuclear power” (22 January). I might downrate it a little to read: “economically dependent on the US; a non-committed EU state; and a nuclear power subject to the US”. It all depends on your view of the world (a proud Brit or a realist), but one cannot be a committed EU state without adhering to the euro and having a say in its stability, nor can one be an independent nuclear power if you have to check with the US before deploying a weapon. Being economically dependent on the US is simply a fact of trading life. One also might inquire why d’Ancona omits the rest of the UK from his calculations. Nor does he give any credit to Britain being a leader of a Commonwealth of Nations, as I might for historic reasons. The UK is more important than the writer implies and for totally different reasons. John Graham Palo Alto, California, US Briefly • As an American subscriber to the The Guardian Weekly, I am often amused by the discovery of incongruities between our English and yours. But the headline in the story about a jail in Riyadh – “Pot plants and lilac doors ...” (29 January) particularly intrigued me and I was fascinated to learn, on reading the article, that “pot plants line the corridor”. I think that’s very considerate of the prison authorities: the guards and the prisoners can then avail themselves of the pot plants and smoke joints to pass the time. Leigh Dolin Portland, Oregon, US • Miss Piggy of the Muppets must be delighted by their being picked up by the elitist and expensive HBO channel after toiling for so many years on public television, or PBS (29 January).

They had been awaiting their fate for years, kept going with fodder slipped them by their kindly keeper, George Osborne. Cameron never made up his mind what to do with them and so left them to his successor. Their names were Hinkley, HS2 and Heathrow. To Theresa May they have become talismans of her muscular approach to infrastructure. She could have shot them on sight and directed their upkeep to good causes. But white elephants are not without defenders. Each had been portrayed as the embodiment of Britain’s industrial greatness. If May wanted to look good, she should shower them with largesse, not kill them. Last month she gave Hinkley, the sickest of the beasts, a loving hug. Yesterday, it was the same for HS2. Next week, we are told, the trio will be completed with Heathrow. It is said that they will together consume over £100bn of public money. This is a stupefying sum for a government supposedly short of cash. An old Treasury joke has a project for a bridge to the moon. Advocated as feasible by some boffin, a headline-hungry minister secures “seed money” to “scope options”. Consultants gather like bees to honey, followed by construction lobbyists. Reports are funded to boast that Britain would be in the van of moon-bridging. UK plc would be at the top table. There would be “massive spin-off”. The steel industry would revive. Thousands of jobs would be created from Scunthorpe to Kent. All opposition to the moon bridge is dismissed as defeatist, as showing a lack of enterprise, of patriotism, of care for jobs-’n’-growth. Doubts of the project’s feasibility are rebutted with reports from PwC and McKinsey proving that, if you spend enough public money, you will indeed get to the moon. Our three white elephants are all bridges to the moon. There is no constituency of expert opinion behind any of them. Hinkley Point C was always a blind alley in the vexed world of nuclear power generation, a giant reactor that has never worked and may never. Such is the financial state of its French builder, EDF, that doubt still consumes its future. When announced by the government last month, the reasons given for proceeding were entirely political. It would help the French, please the Chinese, create jobs. For taxpayers and consumers who must pay for it, it is a dreadful deal. But like all such projects, as economics deflates, politics inflates. HS2 is different only in the obscurity of its origins. Back in 2010 it was Cameron’s back-of-an-envelope alternative to a new runway at Heathrow, which he had sworn not to build. A fast train would relieve the airport of pressure from internal flights. The last sane inquiry into HS2, by Rod Eddington in 2006, dismissed such new-fangled networks as costly and time-wasting. Worse, they tended to “acquire a life of their own … and prove difficult and unpopular to stop, even when the benefit-cost equation does not stack up”. Never a truer word was spoken. HS2 was seized on by Osborne, eager for a symbol of his youthful machismo. It was like Bilbo’s ring. Every Treasury official, Whitehall economist, Commons committee and thinktank have given it thumbs-down for value. It was energy inefficient and low on any priority list for new capacity. Its only serious backers are those with money in it, largely consultants drawing down millions a year in fees from the government. Ministers have been, in effect, paying lobbyists to lobby ministers for a project no one wants except the lobbyists. It is trains on southern, western and north-western routes that are desperate for investment, not commuters into Euston. Osborne’s friend, chief executive of Manchester city council Howard Bernstein, told me early this year he had switched to preferring new transport links in the north – so-called HS3 – over HS2. Even the line’s champions, former transport minister Andrew Adonis and lobbyist Jim Steer, now doubt the practicality of bringing HS2 into Euston, rather than halting it at Acton. Driving through Primrose Hill and Camden will be a nightmare, causing a decade of chaos and delays to west coast mainline services. The cost in inconvenience will be astronomical. The third elephant is Heathrow. May is next week expected to overturn Cameron’s “no ifs, no buts” rejection of the third runway. She will approve the only major expansion of an airport over a built-up area in Europe and unleash merry hell on west London. There is no reason for a third runway at Heathrow beyond lobbying by its operator Heathrow Airport Holdings, the former BAA. London airports are not about business but about leisure. It is reasonable (and cheaper) to expand Gatwick and build a high-speed link to London’s “third airport” at Stansted. In 2008 BAA was itself planning to move its hub from Heathrow to Stansted, until Gordon Brown suddenly gave Stansted to Manchester “to promote competition”. The waste of Stansted is a scandal, British planning at its worst. The last transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, never got a grip on his two white elephants. On HS2 he lacked the guts at least to reverse priorities and build HS3 first. It was hoped his successor, Chris Grayling, might be made of sterner stuff. Clearly not. The lion’s share of transport investment for the next decade is to be blown on an unnecessary luxury train, while Heathrow will become a lawyer’s feast. In all three cases, May could easily have decided the other way, with no damage to her reputation as investment-friendly. The alternatives were perfectly desirable infrastructure: smaller Chinese power stations, HS3 in the north and Gatwick/Stansted. All would have been quicker to build. Instead we have been given a worrying insight into the performance of the prime minister’s policy team. As in decisions on obesity, grammar schools and immigrant registers, there is a sense that May’s staff are out of their depth, unable to scrutinise policies passing across their desks. It is always easier to take the quickest route to a headline. As a result, we are saddled with three of the worst and most extravagant projects inflicted on British taxpayers in a generation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/aug/18/ice-scientists-arctic-ice-disappearing-reduce-emissions-peter-wadhams","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-18T08:38:55Z","webTitle":"Time to listen to the ice scientists about the Arctic death spiral","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/18/ice-scientists-arctic-ice-disappearing-reduce-emissions-peter-wadhams","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/18/ice-scientists-arctic-ice-disappearing-reduce-emissions-peter-wadhams","fields":{"headline":"Time to listen to the ice scientists about the Arctic death spiral","bodyText":"Ice scientists are mostly cheerful and pragmatic. Like many other researchers coolly observing the rapid warming of the world, they share a gallows humour and are cautious about entering the political fray. Not Peter Wadhams. The former director of the Scott Polar Research Institute and professor of ocean physics at Cambridge has spent his scientific life researching the ice world, or the cryosphere, and in just 30 years has seen unimaginable change. When in 1970 he joined the first of what would be more than 50 polar expeditions, the Arctic sea ice covered around 8m sq km at its September minimum. Today, it hovers at around 3.4m, and is declining by 13% a decade. In 30 years Wadhams has seen the Arctic ice thin by 40%, the world change colour at its top and bottom and the ice disappear in front of his eyes. In a new book, published just as July 2016 is confirmed by Nasa as the hottest month ever recorded, this most experienced and rational scientist states what so many other researchers privately fear but cannot publicly say – that the Arctic is approaching a death spiral which may see the entire remaining summer ice cover collapse in the near future. The warming now being widely experienced worldwide is concentrated in the polar regions and Wadhams says we will shortly have ice-free Arctic Septembers, expanding to four or five months with no ice at all. The inevitable result, he predicts, will be the release of huge plumes of the powerful greenhouse gas methane, accelerating warming even further. He and other polar experts have moved from being field researchers to being climate change pioneers in the vanguard of the most rapid and drastic change that has taken place on the planet in many thousands of years. This is not just an interesting change happening in a remote part of the world, he says, but a catastrophe for mankind. “We are taking away the beautiful world of Arctic Ocean sea ice which once protected us from the impacts of climate extremes. We have created an ocean where there was once an ice sheet. It is man’s first major achievement in re-shaping the face of the planet,” he writes. And, boy, are we seeing extremes. So far this year, the planet’s average temperature has been 1.3C warmer than the late 19th century, and 2016 is virtually certain be the hottest year ever recorded. Britain and northern Europe may have had average temperatures, but 500 million people in the Middle East and north Africa, along with most of south-east Asia, have experienced droughts and searingly hot days and nights, which are only partly to do with the natural El Niño phenomenon. Meanwhile, China, India and the US have seen some of their longest heatwaves and worst floods in decades, and nearly 100 million people will need food aid in the coming months because of disrupted rainfall patterns. Mitribah in Kuwait has reported a world record 54C, India and Iran have both recorded their highest ever temperatures, and deadly heatwaves have struck China, the US, Indonesia and New Zealand. We are perilously close to the 1.5C limit of warming that all countries signed up to in Paris last year and on track for a 3C-4C increase which would make much of the world uninhabitable. Because Wadhams says what other scientists will not, he has been widely slandered, attacked and vilified by denialists and politicians who have advised caution or non-action. But now he returns their fire, exhorting people to counter what he calls “the sewage flow of lies and deceit” emitted by the deniers. Above all, he says, people who study climate change should speak up and be prepared to risk the blighting of their careers and absence of honours. But he joins other climate researchers to cross lines that the public may still find unacceptable. He wants global action to find new ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere, and is not afraid of nuclear power – both of which answers can be swallowed – but he also argues for a colossal, global research programme in geo- engineering. This is the deliberate attempt to reduce warming by the planetary-scale manipulation of weather patterns, oceans, currents, soils and atmosphere to decrease the amount of greenhouses gases. Spraying sun-reflecting chemicals into the atmosphere, mimicking volcanoes, blocking sunlight and fertilising the oceans with iron filings attracts people who think that technology has all the answers, but it should strike fear into most of the world, which has not been responsible for warming and which has no reason to trust politicians’ or scientists’ further meddling with planetary forces. How to proceed safely in a warming world without disastrous unintended consequences? The need for truly urgent action is undeniable, but by the time answers have been found to the massive questions of science, engineering and governance that Wadhams agrees need to be solved before geo-engineering on a planetary scale can go ahead, it will be far too late. Climate change has been caused by ignorance and stupidity and cannot be solved by endorsing more of the same with geo-engineering. The only answer is reducing greenhouse emissions.

In the half century since its publication, this fierce little book has only tightened its talon grip on us. It reads now as uncannily prophetic: of the Anthropocene (our geological age, in which human activity is now the dominant influence on the environment), of extinction events, of dark ecology – even of virtual reality. In ancient Rome a haruspex was a person trained in a form of divination based on inspecting the entrails of sacrificed animals. Baker’s book – strewn as it is with eviscerated birds, obsessed as it is with prediction – is a text of killing and foretelling: of seeing the future in blood and guts. It has haruspicated our present, and I suspect its prescience is not yet all used up. The story of The Peregrine’s writing is remarkable, and has a mystery at its heart. For around a decade – from 1954 to 1964 – a myopic office worker from Essex tracked the peregrine falcons that hunted over the landscape of his county. He pursued them on bicycle and on foot, watching through binoculars as they bathed, flew, stooped and roosted. He carried Ordnance Survey maps on which he marked in ballpoint pen the locations of his sightings, with circled capital letters – P, SH, HH, BO – recording raptors by species (M is for Merlin, K is for Kestrel). He learned to predict the peregrines’ locations by means of an intelligence that began as logic and ended as instinct, and in a relationship that began as fascination and ended as obsession. Even the savage winter of 1962–63 – when the sea froze for two miles out from the shore, and spear-length icicles hung from eaves and trees – didn’t deter Baker from his quest. After a day in the field, he would retreat to the spare room of his Chelmsford terrace house, and write up the details in journals that together run to more than 1,600 manuscript pages. In the mid-1960s, he compressed those journals into a book fewer than 60,000 words long, and written in ecstatic, violent, enraptored prose. The journals were coal to The Peregrine’s diamond: crushed, they became the book. He collapsed 10 years into a single “season of hawk-hunting”, and “stripped” the narrative “down to the livid bone”, to borrow a phrase from one of his early poems. Instead of plot, he deployed pattern. The same actions recur across the book’s course: man pursues falcon, falcon pursues prey. Repetitious in structure, the prose is nevertheless huge in drama – and much of this arises from the extraordinary energy Baker invests in his language. His style possesses what Charles Olson – laying out his theory of “open field poetics” in 1950 – called “percussive” and “projectile” powers. Grammatically, his prose is dense in metaphors, similes, verbs and adverbs; accentually, it is thick with stressed syllables. This combination of axe-knock emphasis and high-impact syntax results in sentences that are stunning to read. The mystery: at some point during the writing of The Peregrine, Baker went back to his journals and destroyed nearly all the passages in which he had recorded his field-sightings of the falcons. He left no account of why he had done so, and no version of the originals. By means of this redaction, he ensured that the most astonishing sequences of the published book flew free from any tether, and could not, as it were, be read back against the real. Birdwatchers speak of the “jizz” of a bird to mean the sum of characteristics – shape, plumage, posture, call, habitat – that allow its instant identification from a general impression. A bird’s jizz is its gist and vibe: the aggregation of its particulars into a compound signature of life. Baker’s style has its own jizz. I think I could encounter a sentence of his prose anywhere and identify it immediately as his. Adjectives and nouns wrenched into verbs; surreal similes; flaring adverbs: these are among the specifics that make up his unique gestalt. “Five thousand dunlin … rained away inland, like a horde of beetles gleamed with golden chitin.” “The north wind brittled icily in the pleached lattice of the hedges.” A yellow-billed cock blackbird is “like a small mad puritan with a banana in his mouth”. A woodpigeon dead on a winter field “glow[s] purple and grey like broccoli”. I’ve never taken LSD: thanks to Baker, I don’t need to. His Essex is landscape on acid: super-saturations of colour, wheeling phantasmagoria, dimensions blown out and falling away, nature as hypernature. Baker has inspired many imitators over the years, aiming to riff and rip to a comparable intensity of description. I’ve been one of them. But our style always feels brittle and synthetic in comparison with the original – mere Bakerlite. Early in The Peregrine, he describes a dunlin being caught by a falcon that approaches it from behind at greater speed. “The dunlin,” he writes, “seemed to come slowly back to the hawk. It passed into his dark outline and did not reappear.” The image is space operatic: a small craft trapped in a larger craft’s tractor beam, and drawn relentlessly in. Baker’s book possesses a comparable traction. It locks on to its readers, and they pass involuntarily into it. By no means does everyone like it. I’ve heard it described as fascistic for its fetishisation of northerliness and predation. I know people who turn away from its misanthropy, which I think of as species shame. But no one doubts the book’s bleak bite. Unlike much that passes for the culture of nature, The Peregrine cannot be passively consumed. It sticks in the craw, it rakes the mind. The reprimand it offers – with its rituals of killing, and the spitting self-hatred of its narrator – to sentimental representations of a capitalised “Nature” is surely one reason for its contemporary grip. Under the sign of the Anthropocene, messy entanglement has replaced cool spectatorial distance. In an age of mass extinction it has become hard to tolerate notions of nature as an external or salvific “other”, except as forms of cute or kitsch. Baker’s sanguineous nature is very far from cute. It exists at the frayed edges of things, in a scruffy landscape of medieval woods and suburban sprawl, salt marshes and sea walls. Human experience is drastically decentred in favour of what the philosopher John Gray (another of the book’s admirers) calls the “godless mysticism” of creaturely life. The Peregrine is not “green” literature. It suggests no basis for the establishment of an environmental ethics born of commonality. “We are the killers. We stink of death,” writes Baker in the most self-lacerating passage. “We carry it with us. It sticks to us like frost. We cannot tear it away.” Yet its furious vision has given it an oddly hopeful power over many of its readers. Over the years I have been told many stories of the effects of The Peregrine on individuals. A former student cited it as the main influence in her decision to move to direct action as a means of environmental protest. A man wrote to say that he had grown up in working-class Walsall and at the age of nine had read The Peregrine. “A whole new world opened up to me among the post-industrial gloom of the 1980s,” he said, “and directly as a result of the book I came to see the kingfishers that lived on the canal banks, and from there arose a lifelong fascination with the more-than-human world.” He went on to become a professional conservationist, bringing everyday nature into the lives of young people. Several years ago, I came to know a young musician living in a south London squat, and performing as frontman for a hardcore punk band. He was a talented, troubled person for whom “nature” as usually understood was irrelevant. But the dark fury of The Peregrine spoke to him. He read it repeatedly, and lent his copy out often (though always claimed it back). He and I collaborated on a project one summer; there were plans to work together again. Then he died of a heroin overdose aged 23. He was buried in a winter field in Cornwall, with the cars of his friends pulled up near the grave, their stereos blasting out his music in tribute – and placed in the coffin with him was his copy of The Peregrine. No other book – save perhaps Nan Shepherd’s The Living Mountain, which stands as The Peregrine’s golden twin, offering light to its darkness, relation to its depletion – has been so influential on the recent British literature of landscape. Roger Deakin, Tim Dee, Kathleen Jamie, Richard Mabey, Helen Macdonald, James Rebanks and I are among the many to have acknowledged its force. The Peregrine is increasing its territorial range, too. It was published last year in Germany, and editions are forthcoming in Chinese, Dutch, Spanish and Hebrew. The book’s impact is not confined to literature. An opera company is presently considering an adaptation. A one-man theatrical interpretation is in development. A decade ago, the Australian composer Lawrence English picked up a copy from a friend’s desk and opened it at random. He read a description of an owl silently hunting, and was gripped by the intensity of “listening” in the prose. “The book changed my life,” recalled English in 2015. To him it marked a “turning point in the 20th century” in its “recognition of the role humans play in shaping their environment”. In response English produced an album that surprised me when I first heard it for its sonic scarcity. Responding to The Peregrine’s preoccupation with absence, English used frost-bitten drones and high strings to compose a burnt-out, irradiated soundtrack: a half-life soundscape of white ash. He sent a copy of The Peregrine to the film director Werner Herzog; Herzog read it and was astonished. He has since spoken often of the book, and it is now one of only three required texts for his Rogue Film School – along with Virgil’s Georgics and Hemingway’s story “The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber”. Herzog describes The Peregrine as inducing “ecstasy” in the radical sense of the word: not just entranced or frenzied, but literally beside oneself. There are moments, he notes, “where you can tell that [Baker] has completely entered into the existence of a falcon. And this is what I do when I make a film: I step outside of myself into an ekstasis; in Greek, to step outside of your own body.” The attraction of The Peregrine to a film-maker is obvious: the pristinated vision, the sudden rapid pull shots (a stooping lens), the immense field of vision, the swivelling eye. The attraction to Herzog is clear, too, compelled as he has been in so many films by obsession, extremity and wildness (Fitzcarraldo, Grizzly Man, The Ends of the Earth). The puzzle to me, for years, was why Herzog had not yet filmed The Peregrine. In 2015, I wrote to ask if he was planning to do so. “If anyone can, it should be you,” I said. I sent him a photograph of my local peregrine perched on a church spire, part-gargoyle. Herzog replied within a few hours, generous about my own writing on Baker, but adamant about the book’s adaptability: “A feature film would be very wrong. There are texts that should never be touched. Georg Büchner’s Lenz is one of these cases. In fact, whoever tries to make a feature film of The Peregrine should be shot without trial.” Oh! Right. Message received and understood. Thirteen years ago I described The Peregrine as “not a book about watching a bird, [but] a book about becoming a bird”. Baker himself often suggests a comparable process of conversion, writing of how – by means of primitive rituals of following and mimicking – “the hunter becom[es] the thing he hunts”. Now, though, I no longer believe The Peregrine is a book about “becoming a bird”. Truer to say that it is a book about “failing to become a bird”. Unmistakably Baker longs for the deterritorialised experience of the falcons, wishing as they do to live in a “pouring-away world of no attachment”. And there are many moments of extreme interspecies identification, as when he finds himself “crouching over [a] kill, like a mantling hawk”. But these ecstatic moments are always followed by Baker’s wounding awareness of his anchorage in a crabbed human body. Again and again, subject-object distance is almost closed – only to yawn wide once more. Baker craves to “think like a falcon” (to adapt the title of Thomas Nagel’s famous 1974 thought experiment) but also knows he cannot slip his form or quit his species. Baker is, as English nicely puts it, a “ghost of a narrator”. He tells us almost nothing about himself. He scarcely eats or drinks, doesn’t sleep, never defecates, has no life beyond the fields and the sky, barely describes his clothing or his body. In mystical terms, he is an ascetic depleting himself in advance of disembodiment. In shamanic terms, he is a body preparing for sky burial. In terms of virtual reality, he is readying himself for upload into the cloud, and transformation into pure avatar. But however imagined, this activity of self-depletion can never quite be completed. Baker seeks a conversion from human to falcon, but the book’s desolation arises from the futility of his hope for this magical metamorphosis. ... On 1 July 1940, when Baker was 15 years old, the secretary of state for air in Britain issued the “Destruction of Peregrine Falcons Order”. Adult and juvenile birds were to be shot, eyasses killed in the nests, eggs smashed and eyries disrupted. The order was made under wartime emergency defence regulations: peregrines were deemed too great a threat to the carrier pigeons that RAF bomber crews routinely took with them on flights. If a plane ditched at sea and a location could not be radioed through, the pigeons would be released with a leg tag to report their position. Falcons were dispensable, airmen were not – and so the falcons died. During the six years that the destruction order was in force, around 600 peregrines were shot, and unnumbered eyasses and eggs were destroyed. In certain counties – especially in southern England – peregrines were almost exterminated. By the time the order was lifted in 1946, the number of nesting pairs in England had been reduced to around half of its prewar level. The recovery of the English peregrine population from its wartime decline was incomplete when the next major human threat emerged. In 1956 – two years after Baker took up birdwatching – the first symptoms of the crisis became visible, as increasing numbers of peregrine pairs failed to hatch chicks. The toxins of organochlorine pesticides used in agriculture, most notably DDT, were concentrating as they moved up the food chain. Raptors suffered increased adult mortality, and a thinning of eggshells to the point of non-viability. The result was, in the words of raptor-specialist Derek Ratcliffe, “a spectacular crash of population with a speed and on a scale seldom found in the vertebrate kingdom”. By 1963, only three territories were reported as occupied by peregrines in southern England, and Scottish and Welsh populations were also in freefall. “Few winter in England now, fewer nest here,” writes Baker early in his book. “The ancient eyries are dying.” He was well aware of the connection between pesticide use and peregrine death: hence his hissing fury in the book at what he calls the “filthy, insidious pollen of farm chemicals”. “If further decline had continued unchecked,” noted Ratcliffe later, “extinction of the peregrine in Britain could have occurred around 1967” – the year The Peregrine was published. As the falcons were dying, so the Essex landscape was also undergoing its most drastic transformation since enclosure. Urban growth caused green belts to bulge and break, and the postwar drive for big-field farming and agricultural self-sustainability resulted in the destruction of thousands of miles of hedgerows. We know from Baker’s letters and poems that his affection for the Essex countryside, especially inland Essex between Great Baddow and West Hanningfield, was profound – and his pain at its disruption correspondingly acute. An even greater threat hangs over The Peregrine, though, than the extinction of a single species in a single country or the devastation of a loved landscape. In the famous prologue of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring, an imaginary American town is poisoned by a “white … powder” that drops from the air “like snow upon the roofs and the lawns, the fields and the streams”. This is the powder of agrichemicals – but of course it is also the dust of radioactive fallout. It is hard to read Silent Spring outside its cold war context, and I also take Baker’s book to be nuclear as much as it is pesticidal. Baker was researching his book through the first decade of atomic and hydrogen bomb testing, and began writing it shortly after the Cuban missile crisis. In 1957 construction work started on the massive nuclear power station at Bradwell-on-Sea, right in the heart of Baker’s hunting territory. Generation was commenced in 1962. His prose is riven with nuclear anxieties: this is a book in which death falls from the air, and in which the landscape is figured frequently as “burning” and “dying” on a planetary scale. ... Fifteen years ago, relatively little was known about Baker. This was partly due to the writer’s strategic development of his own mystery. In the winter of 1967, he was given an Arts Council award of £1,200. The Daily Telegraph reported on the award: “The most unusual of the [recipients] is John Baker, who lives in a council house in Essex and does not want to say which town in case the neighbours discover what he does. He has no telephone and never leaves his home.” As the cult of Baker has spread and strengthened, much more has been discovered in terms of biography. Thanks to the efforts of David Cobham, James Canton, Mark Cocker and especially John Fanshawe – who painstakingly gathered and secured Baker’s archive, including journals, letters, book drafts and a list of the titles in his library – our picture has now filled out. This autumn, Little Toller books will publish the first biography – the beautifully titled My House of Sky by Hetty Saunders. The two details that perhaps bear most forcefully on The Peregrine are Baker’s extreme short-sightedness, and the agonising inflammatory arthritis that afflicted him for most of his life. By the 1960s his illness was so severe that it was first stiffening and then fusing the joints in his spine, fingers and legs. Suffering as he did from curtailed vision and a stiffened body, the peregrine stood as both his dream totem and his prosthesis – perfected in precisely the ways that Baker was lessened. A peregrine’s eyeballs magnify vision by around 30% in comparison to human sight, allowing it to spy prey from sky high, and then fall on it at up to 270mph, the fastest speed of any creature on earth. What Baker could not see unaided, he saw with the aid of technology: his Miranda 10 x 50 binoculars and his featherweight JH Steward spotter scope, which he carried with him in the field. “Binoculars and a hawk-like vigilance,” he wrote, “reduce the disadvantage of myopic human vision.” The Peregrine is therefore a product of what Tim Dee has nicely called “the magnified century”. Faces, in The Peregrine, usually have something held up to them: some object or prosthesis interposing between eye and world. Imagery recurs of visors, masks, helmets and lenses. I have come to think of Baker’s style, in fact, as a kind of augmented-reality visor – an Oculus Rift of text that enables otherwise impossible precisions of seeing and movement. This is one reason why reading Baker is such hard, unsteadying work. He causes us to lose our usual footings in the world. Landscape becomes surface, unfolding around us as we go. The brain is strained by the dynamic dissonances of his prose, and the eyes by its uncanny geometries. Focal range ramps and flattens unpredictably. Horizons lure and retreat. One ends a reading of Baker – lifts the visor – exhausted and exhilarated. ... Peregrines didn’t become extinct in England. Science saved them – and so did literature. In part because of the research of Ratcliffe and others into the link between pesticide use and eggshell thinning in British raptor populations, and in part because of the global impact of Silent Spring, the use of DDT and other organochlorines was restricted. The impact on raptors was massive. Writing in 1991, Ratcliffe noted: The present state of the British peregrine population represents a most heartening turnaround in fortunes from the dark days and gloomy predictions of the early 1960s …It is not often that we are able to celebrate a conservation success, but this one is better than probably any of us had dared to hope. Twenty-five years on from Ratcliffe’s relief, however, and 50 years on from Baker’s book, the “conservation success” story of the peregrine in Britain looks both less and more secure. Less secure, because raptor persecution in the UK is presently at atrocious levels, in large part as a result of the game-shooting industry. Numerous birds of prey – peregrines among them – are illegally killed each year on and near shooting estates. Most upland populations of peregrines are presently in decline. The Forest of Bowland population has fallen from 18 pairs to zero in eight years. More secure, because peregrines have now moved into our cities and on to our infrastructure in increasing numbers. Before the 1980s there were few records of peregrine falcons nesting on humanmade structures in Britain, with Chichester Cathedral the oldest known nest site. In 1991, eight pairs nested on humanmade structures; in 2002, 62 pairs. In 2014 there were nesting peregrines on an estimated 180 artificial structures, including churches, radio masts – and the cooling towers of the nuclear power station at Bradwell. Increases have happened in cities worldwide. New York alone now has more than 16 nesting pairs, on bridge girders and apartment block window ledges. Brick, steel and glass, it turns out, provide prime peregrine real estate. Yes, the peregrine has proved to be an excellent urban adaptor, or what in German is known as a Kulturfolger – a “culture-follower”. The conditions in cities are advantageous for falcon life. High buildings give good vantage points for hunting, and secure locations for nesting. Cities tend to be warmer than open country, and more protected from the elements, thus reducing the likelihood of death by cold among fledglings and adults. Most importantly, cities offer an abundance of prey, chiefly in the form of pigeons (another massively successful Kulturfolger). Falcons even seem to be evolving new hunting and killing techniques among the skyscraper canyons of high-rise cities. The result of these accumulated benefits is that peregrines can breed earlier, more often, and more successfully in cities. Peregrines have come to my city, Cambridge. For years a pair nested in a steep-sided chalk pit at Fulbourn – the closest thing to a sea cliff you can get in the Fens. Then, in 2013, a new pair came to the Cambridge University Library, a modernist masterpiece of brown brick. They nested on a sixth-floor ledge: blood-spotted pigeon feathers would spiral down to settle at the feet of incoming library users. After two years there, the pair moved to a 19th-century Gothic revival building in the heart of Cambridge, nesting 20ft or so above pavement level. Somehow they fledged a single chick there, amid the ruckus of the street. The falcons are there still, and have become part of the life of the city in wonderful ways. Each weekday morning for eight months of the year, I pass under the church spires that the falcons like to use as plucking posts. Most mornings I glimpse one of them up there, perched on a curlicue of stone: flint-blue back, barred chest and the bath-duck yellow of eye-ring and feet. The pavement below the plucking post gets spattered with the body parts and feathers of their prey species: mostly city pigeons, but also starlings, woodcock and golden plover. Once, walking past the church, I was stopped in my tracks by the body of a white dove. It lay bright on its back across a kerbstone, wings outstretched, headless and with its chest opened up and its red guts eviscerated. I looked up and there was the male falcon – the haruspex – on the spire, backlit by winter sun. I squinted at this impossible creature, felt both its closeness and its drastic distance. How did Baker put it? “The hardest thing of all to see is what is really there.” • The 50th-anniversary edition of The Peregrine by JA Baker is published by William Collins at £12.99.

In a statement before its annual general meeting, the state-controlled energy company said its ownership commitment on the project could rise from £12bn to £13.8bn. Its Chinese partner, CGN, could be liable for an extra £900m, taking its commitment to £6.9bn. An EDF spokesman said the existing £18bn estimate contained contingency planning for general cost overruns and that the extra £2.7bn was to ensure the project was completed in the event of an extraordinary or catastrophic event. In its statement, EDF said: “The partners’ equity commitment includes a contingency margin and could reach a total of £13.8bn for the EDF group and £6.9bn to CGN.” EDF also indicated Hinkley Point could be completed later than the already delayed target of 2025. It predicted the project would take 115 months after a final investment decision was made. If, as suggested by the French economy minister, a decision comes in September, that would mean the earliest start date would be spring 2026. EDF said it would provide CGN with limited financial guarantees to cover cost overruns or delays to the project or if European authorities challenged the financial terms agreed with the UK government. EDF’s chief executive, Jean-Bernard Levy, told the meeting in Paris that without Hinkley Point, EDF would not win nuclear power contracts in other countries. It has already racked up long delays for smaller projects in France and Finland. “This project is essential for the credibility of the entire French nuclear industry,” he said. EDF agreed the main terms of a deal with the UK government and CGN, China’s main nuclear operator, in October to build two reactors at Hinkley Point. The French group, whose finances are under pressure, said at the time it expected to take a final investment decision within weeks but it has yet to make a definitive commitment. The UK government has made the project a vital part of its energy plans despite longstanding doubts about its viability. Amber Rudd, the energy secretary, did not respond to a question in the House of Commons about the extra potential costs. Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace, accused EDF of not getting its facts straight. “All the evidence shows that EDF are completely willing to say whatever it takes to keep the UK and Chinese governments happy, but are seemingly unable to build a reactor that works on budget and on time.” Alarm has grown inside EDF, which is 85% owned by the French government, about the scale of its future financial commitments and debts at a time of plunging power prices and difficulties with other projects. Thomas Piquemal, EDF’s finance director, quit in March after the company refused to postpone investment to deal with a range of problems. In Britain, Hinkley has attracted criticism from the City for being too costly for taxpayers. The government has promised to pay £92.50 per megawatt hour for the power over 35 years – double the current cost. Ministers say the scheme, which could provide 7% of UK electricity, represents value for money in the long term and could help lower UK carbon emissions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/marketforceslive/2016/apr/21/smiths-pays-nearly-500m-for-us-airport-and-nuclear-security-business","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-21T10:31:38Z","webTitle":"Smiths pays nearly £500m for US airport and nuclear security business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2016/apr/21/smiths-pays-nearly-500m-for-us-airport-and-nuclear-security-business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/marketforceslive/2016/apr/21/smiths-pays-nearly-500m-for-us-airport-and-nuclear-security-business","fields":{"headline":"Smiths pays nearly £500m for US airport and nuclear security business","bodyText":"Supplying security systems to help detect threats against airports, nuclear power plants and military and goverment buildings is big business these days, and UK group Smiths has expanded its reach with a $710m (£493m) deal to buy California-based Morpho Detection. The acquisition, from French engineering group Safran, is Smiths’ first deal for a number of years and comes as a new management team gets to grips with the business. Analysts believe Smiths sell off unwanted operations to reduce borrowings after the cash and debt funded deal. Smiths chief executive Andy Reynolds Smith said: The threat environment for people and critical infrastructure around the world is constantly evolving and becoming more complex and sophisticated. The response, to keep people safe and the world running, demands cutting-edge technology and cost-efficient solutions. Morpho Detection is a high quality business with a strong management team, and I am convinced that this combination provides a compelling competitive platform for product, service and technology leadership. The deal had been suggested last month, but confirmation of the news has pushed up Smiths’ shares 45p higher to £11.53. Analysts at Stifel said: This [deal] was suggested in the press some weeks ago, and we commented at that time that we saw this as a positive strategic move, if Smiths were able to secure a deal. That remains our view. This acquisition will give Smiths Detection clear global leadership across all key geographies and technologies, and a much expanded aftermarket revenue stream. The deal is being funded out of existing cash and debt facilities; we estimate that this will push net debt/EBITDA to 2.2 times, but we believe that the group is also looking at asset and business disposals as part of the portfolio review; this debt level is thus likely to be temporary. We think the main positive of this announcement is that it shows the new management team returning to active portfolio management – a key part of our buy case on the stock. The key attraction for Smiths is Morpho’s strong position in the US market, leading technology in tomography-based baggage scanning systems (Smiths leads in X-ray based detection) and substantial aftermarket revenue stream. Michael Blogg at Investec said: The vibe has changed with the arrival of the new management team and Morpho Detection is set to be the first sizeable acquisition for years. [Morpho] looks a better business than Smiths Detection and less dependent on new project work (Morpho $320m revenue and 18% operating margin; Smiths Detection £467m revenue and 11.8% operating margin). This may not be the area where shareholders would necessarily have wanted expansion, in view of the mixed record, and the deal will take leverage to at least 2 times EBITDA (the pro forma 2 times is based on debt before over £100m of payments into the pension funds), meaning firepower has been used up for the time being. Perhaps this brings forward the time when some disposals will finally be achieved."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/jul/30/theresa-may-delayed-hinkley-point-chinese-beijing-vince-cable","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-30T23:30:00Z","webTitle":"Theresa May 'raised objections to project as home secretary'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/theresa-may-delayed-hinkley-point-chinese-beijing-vince-cable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/jul/30/theresa-may-delayed-hinkley-point-chinese-beijing-vince-cable","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May 'raised objections to project as home secretary'","bodyText":"Theresa May raised objections to the Hinkley Point C nuclear power deal during the coalition government, the former business secretary Sir Vince Cable has claimed, in remarks that will throw fresh doubt over the project’s future. Cable said that as home secretary, May had been unhappy about the former chancellor George Osborne’s “gung-ho” attitude to Chinese investment. Speaking after May unexpectedly delayed signing-off on government support for the new power station, Cable described the late decision as clumsy but understandable. “Certainly, when we were in government, Theresa May was, I think, quite clear that she was unhappy about the rather gung-ho approach to Chinese investment that we had, and that George Osborne in particular was promoting and, as I recall, raised objections to Hinkley at that time,” he said. EDF’s board had voted narrowly to give its final go-ahead for the long-delayed joint project on Thursday, only for Downing Street to pull back from signing the contract and say it would make a decision in the early autumn. The move surprised EDF executives, who were preparing to sign contracts with the government the next day. The company’s UK chief executive, Vincent De Rivaz, was forced to cancel a round of media interviews. Officials from China General Nuclear, which has a one-third stake in the Hinkley project, were also expected to attend a media event in Somerset. De Rivaz has since written to workers in a bid to reassure them the £18bn project is still strong despite the unexpected delay. He said he had met the business and energy secretary, Greg Clark, after the announcement that the government would “consider carefully” all parts of the project before making a decision. He wrote to employees: “My message today is one of continuity and confidence. The EDF board’s decision is a huge achievement and one we should be proud of. Our journey is a long one and there is a further stage. Our job now is to maintain the courage, patience and dedication that have served us so well.” Comments by May’s chief of staff, Nick Timothy, last year have led to claims that the delay has been prompted by concerns that Chinese state-owned companies were being allowed to invest in sensitive infrastructure. Timothy wrote on the ConservativeHome website: “Rational concerns about national security are being swept to one side because of the desperate desire for Chinese trade and investment.” One former cabinet minister said he believed it was “100%” down to Timothy’s intervention that the project had been stalled. “Nick is in an incredibly powerful position,” the source said. “Theresa listens to his every utterance, reads out his speeches and the reshuffle, I’m pretty sure, leads back to him. This is nothing to do with ministers. It will put [the chancellor] Philip Hammond’s nose out of joint and we shall have to see how that plays out.” The Tory MP in whose constituency the plant will be built, Ian Liddell-Grainger, said he did not believe Timothy could have been serious in his comments. He said: “All he was saying is that his concern is the amount of infrastructure that is going to the Chinese. But if that was the case, are we happy that Huawei are running Whitehall communications, as it is their hardware. “You know the Chinese are doing HS2? Are we saying we don’t want the Chinese to do anything and we don’t want their companies to be involved locally anywhere in the UK? The answer is no, that is not what he is saying. I don’t think there is any doubt that he has put forward an idea, but I don’t think he is serious about it.” The former Tory co-chairman Grant Shapps, who leads the all-party British Infrastructure Group, said MPs would be concerned if the pause continued beyond the autumn. He said: “If this is ‘stop, take a breathe, check the numbers and press ahead’, then fine, no one is going to begrudge. But if this is truly just another piece of big infrastructure where we bottle it and don’t do it, like airports, then that is bad news for Britain PLC. “Particularly that is the case post-Brexit when the world needs to see we are out there and prepared to engage internationally and frankly take international investment. Companies have to take pretty serious decisions about these kinds of investment. It makes deals more expensive in the future if we chop and change. So, benefit of doubt, but not for very long is my view.” Jason Millett, the chief operating officer for major programmes and infrastructure at Mace, a major contractor at Hinkley Point, added that the decision to delay had left people bewildered. “We are a little nervous. In the business we do, projects do have ups and downs and there are hurdles. We thought the EDF board decision would be the last hurdle. This is a new hurdle that’s been introduced,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/28/philip-hammond-lloyds-banking-group-eu-referendum-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-28T19:27:06Z","webTitle":"To show confidence, Philip Hammond should hang on to Lloyds shares | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/28/philip-hammond-lloyds-banking-group-eu-referendum-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jul/28/philip-hammond-lloyds-banking-group-eu-referendum-brexit","fields":{"headline":"To show confidence, Philip Hammond should hang on to Lloyds shares","bodyText":"Be grateful, dear retail investor, that George Osborne never got a chance to unleash his mass-market offer of shares in Lloyds Banking Group. The former chancellor had planned to sell discounted stock to the populace at 70p apiece, or thereabouts. Lloyds’ shares now fetch just 52.5p in non-discounted form. The other side of the story, of course, is that Osborne did well to shift more than a few Lloyds shares to City institutions at prices that now look pretty only from the seller’s point of view. The reduction in the state’s stake from 43% in 2009 to 9% today was achieved at an average price of 79p. It is a rare of example of the City being a medium-term loser in a government sell-off. In January, “market volatility” was blamed for the postponement of the Lloyds retail offer. Now, Brexit has surely delayed the spectacle for ages. Philip Hammond, Osborne’s successor, would be silly to attempt a revival at the current share price when he has a credible alternative strategy: do nothing. Brexit has dented the idea that Lloyds would suddenly turn into a dividend gusher, which is why the share price has fallen by 23% since the referendum. The bank’s capital-generating capacity may have reduced by about a fifth owing to various technical tweaks, like adjustments to risk weights. Low interest rates, for even longer, won’t help profit margins. And, if the UK’s short-term growth prospects are weaker, so is Lloyds’ earnings potential: as the country’s biggest bank, it is a geared bet on the UK economy. But some details of Lloyds’ tale are unaltered by Brexit. Disasters like provisions for PPI mis-selling are washing out of the system, which was the main reason why statutory pretax profits doubled to £2.45bn in the first half of the year. Meanwhile, chief executive António Horta-Osório can continue his attack on costs; another 3,000 posts are going. And, barring a serious crash in house prices, the mortgage book looks sound. Add it all up and Lloyds should still be able to afford a dividend this year of 2.55p a share, or maybe a touch more. It’s just that a special dividend sweetener probably won’t happen. But 2.55p equates to a dividend yield of 4.8%. That’s not so bad. Hold the shares, Mr Hammond, if you want to signal confidence in the UK’s post-Brexit prospects. Could Hinkley Point C yet be derailed? EDF of France has taken the plunge and will sign the contract to build a nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. But should you really approve an £18bn project on the basis of a 10-7 boardroom majority? That slim margin does not generate confidence. EDF’s executives could not convince the workers’ representatives on the board to show solidarity. And, before the crucial meeting, a state-appointed director resigned, saying Hinkley was “very risky”. EDF’s last finance director did the same a few months ago. It is still hard to believe this project will proceed, whatever is said about the decision being “final”. The UK has offered a contract to a company that looks fundamentally divided, is carrying a mountain of debt and is permanently at the call of a changing cast of French politicians. Meanwhile, our own National Audit Office has rightly questioned the economics of Hinkley, which look grotesque for UK consumers. This would be the world’s most expensive power station, to be constructed to a design that is not even proven. Events could still derail this absurd adventure. Let’s hope so. Rolls-Royce revs up but there’s a way to go A share to have bought on 24 June was Rolls-Royce: it’s up by almost a third since the referendum. Part of that bounce is mechanical. It’s great to have half your costs in the UK when you are selling engines for dollars. The other part, which yielded a 13.5% rise in the share price on Thursday, is about confidence in management. Chief executive Warren East has clearly learned from his predecessors’ mistakes. When he arrived from ARM Holdings a year ago, he set expectations low. He grumbled about accounting “fog” and pleaded for time to unpick a top-heavy management structure. The City was half-braced for yet another profits warning. In the event, yesterday’s half-year numbers delivered the reverse. A break-even position was on the cards but Rolls produced underlying pretax profits of £104m. That was still 80% lower than a year ago, but East now sounds vaguely cheerful. The target was to achieve cost savings of £150m to £200m by the end of next year. At the current rate of progress, it will happen sooner. For his next trick, East may have to contain shareholders’ excitement. Some may already be dreaming of the day that Rolls matches arch-rival General Electric’s profit margins and boosts its annual profits by £1bn. It’s a nice ambition to pursue but, in a long-term business like engine manufacturing, progress is measured over decades."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jan/21/austria-to-launch-lawsuit-hinkley-point-c-nuclear-subsidies","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-21T12:02:28Z","webTitle":"Austria to launch lawsuit over Hinkley Point C nuclear subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/21/austria-to-launch-lawsuit-hinkley-point-c-nuclear-subsidies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jan/21/austria-to-launch-lawsuit-hinkley-point-c-nuclear-subsidies","fields":{"headline":"Austria to launch lawsuit over Hinkley Point C nuclear subsidies","bodyText":"Austria is to launch a legal challenge against the European Union’s (EU) decision to allow billions of pounds of subsidies for Hinkley Point C, casting fresh doubt over the UK’s first planned nuclear reactors in 20 years. In October, the EU approved the controversial £17.6bn subsidy deal for the power station, which is expected to provide 7% of the UK’s electricity by 2023. David Cameron had previously hailed the subsidy deal between the French state-owned EDF and the UK government as “a very big day for our country”. But the appeal by Austria, a non-nuclear nation, will be launched by April and could delay a final investment decision by the UK government for over two years. The Guardian understands that Luxembourg is very likely to support the case in the European court of justice, arguing that the UK’s loan guarantees – over a 35-year period – constitute illegal state aid. Another EU country may follow suit. “There has been a high-level decision by our chancellor and vice chancellor to challenge the EU decision on Hinkley within two months of its publication in the EU’s official journal,” Andreas Molin, the director of Austria’s environment ministry told the Guardian. The journal’s publication is expected in the next fortnight. Stefan Pehringer, a foreign policy adviser to the Austrian federal chancellory said: “The Austrian government has announced its readiness to appeal against the EC’s [European Commission] decision concerning state aid for the Hinkley Point project, as it does not consider nuclear power to be a sustainable form of technology – neither in environmental nor in economic terms.” Work has already begun at the Hinkley site, which the UK government said will have a capacity of 3.3GW, with the electricity it generates bought at a strike-price of £92.50 per megawatt hour, around double the market rate. EDF had planned to sign a long-awaited funding agreement with its Chinese investment partners in March, thought to be key to settling procurement plans for the £24.5bn build, and the precursor to a final investment decision. But the lawsuit may delay such plans, and introduce uncertainty about the UK’s attitude towards Hinkley, after elections in May. Austrian government analysis suggests that European court cases of this nature typically last for one and a half years. But “as this is going to be a more complicated and fundamental case, it will last a little bit longer,” Molin said. “Two years could be a rough guess.” He added: “If you accept the argument that Hinkley constitutes a ‘market failure’ as put forward by the commission, you could apply it to all other means of electricity production, probably all other forms of energy conversion, and it might even apply beyond the energy sector. We think that the single energy market itself is at stake in this case.” The EU’s original decision last year surprised many observers, as the then-competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia had previously expressed scepticism about Hinkley’s’ conformity with an exhaustive list of strict state aid criteria. These govern proportionality, decarbonisation, the potential for market distortion, the definition of ‘market failures’ and, crucially, whether the public monies advance an “objective of common interest” for the bloc. No grounds for the commission’s volte-face have yet been published, but the Guardian has seen a draft of the EU decision from last October, suggesting that one key decider had been that Hinkley advanced an EU ‘common interest’ around security of supply. A commission investigation declared itself “unsure” whether the reactor would resolve the UK’s security of supply issues, and was unconvinced that ‘diversification’ of supplies, on its own, would justify the monies involved. “The commission however accepted that the decision was in line with the Euratom treaty,” the draft ruling says. The Euratom treaty obliges member states to facilitate investments in nuclear power and encourage ventures that lead to the technology’s development. Molin said that Austria would argue that the Euratom treaty could not be used in this way in state aid cases, but there would be other lines of dispute. “We will try to prove that the commission did not consider all the things which it should have considered and that there were some procedural flaws,” he said. Minutes from the commission’s internal discussion of the issue show that the EC’s president at the time, José Manuel Barroso, viewed the Hinkley decision as unprecedented, and said that it “touched on a politically sensitive topic”. No contract for the Hinkley plant was put out to tender, and the ruling sparked outrage among environmentalists in the EU, that shows no signs of dying down. “The commission took a political decision disguised as a legal one,” Mark Johnston, a senior adviser to the European Policy Centre, told the Guardian. “Barroso thought it would be easier to bend over for Cameron than to defend the single energy market. The significance of the case for energy investments across Europe could not be greater.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/political-science/2015/nov/04/why-eco-austerity-wont-save-us-from-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-04T08:15:27Z","webTitle":"Why eco-austerity won’t save us from climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2015/nov/04/why-eco-austerity-wont-save-us-from-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/political-science/2015/nov/04/why-eco-austerity-wont-save-us-from-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Why eco-austerity won’t save us from climate change","bodyText":"Despite the anti-capitalist rhetoric of green-left writers like Naomi Klein and Bill McKibben, and the anti-corporate street protests of environmental NGOs, could it be that their small-is-beautiful, degrowth, localist, organic, anti-GMO and anti-nuclear approach to solving climate change and biodiversity loss is in fact working in service of neoliberalism (while not even doing much to help the planet either)? Ever since The Population Bomb, the 1968 bestseller by serial-Chicken-Little and anti-natalist Paul Ehrlich, warning that four billion would die of starvation by the end of the 1980s, and the Club of Rome’s 1972 report Limits to Growth that predicted civilizational “overshoot and collapse” within decades, neo-Malthusians have been telling us we need to degrow the economy and retreat from a Western, consumerist, high-technology, unsustainable way of life, or else Hobbesian doom is all but a fortnight away. Updated for the era of the genuinely exacting challenge of global warming and biodiversity loss, a retreat from economic growth is argued to be necessary today because “We cannot have infinite growth on a finite planet”. Yet all this talk of “we” in the developed world (or, as some hair-shirt wags put it, we in the over-developed world), of “our” overconsumption, of an undifferentiated mass of big spenders, ignores the billowingly large class differences that exist in the global north and the decades-long bludgeoning of workers’ standard of living. Throughout the post-war period of powerful trade unions, full employment and a strong welfare state that the French nostalgically call Les Trente Glorieuses, workers’ pay across the West rose in tandem with growth. But since that time, wages and benefits have stagnated or declined in most sectors. If the median US household income had kept pace with the broader economy since 1970, it would now be $92,000 instead of $50,000. From 1990 to 2009, labour’s share of national income declined in twenty-six out of thirty developed economies, according to the OECD. Overall across advanced economies, labour’s share dropped from 66.1 percent to 61.7 percent. And as poor as many are in the developing world, the gap between them and the workers of the global north is less than the gap between the latter and the one percent. That is to say: us ordinary folks in the supposed rich countries are closer in wealth and have far more in common with third-world workers than we do with our own bosses. So who exactly is this “we” that is doing all the overconsuming? Almost everyone I know is just struggling to get by. We don’t need the “Buy Nothing Days” of the trendy anti-consumerist Adbusters magazine, but rather some “Finally-Able-to-Buy-Lots-More Days”. Humans are not like bacteria in a petri dish or a cartoon hamster that gets fatter and fatter until it is a 9-billion-tonne burping, growling Godzilla-rodent, careening through cities eating everything in its path, as a video on from the New Economics Foundation would suggest. Unlike any other species, our per capita rate of material and energy throughput alters as a result of changes in technology and our political economy. Through technological advance, we can use less of something to produce the same amount, or replace one raw material with another. We didn’t “run out” of whale blubber. We replaced it with kerosene. It is true that the right-wing Pollyannas say: “Don’t bother your pretty little head; technology will save us.” The green left Cassandras meanwhile run around screaming: “Technology can’t save us; we’re doomed!” The socialist meanwhile says: “So long as we plan and regulate the economy carefully, we need never run out of anything, no matter how large we grow.” It is not growth, but unfettered free markets that are the problem. Capitalism depends on growth, but growth does not depend on capitalism. Naomi Klein’s jumbling together of the two says more about the contemporary left’s atrophying knowledge of the ABCs of socialist economics than it does about the problem that the current mode of production poses to ecological services. Over the past decade, greens in the European Parliament have repeatedly provided an environmentalist fig leaf to the further privatization and break-up of energy utilities, out of a desire to give independent producers of renewable energy access to the electricity grid. But in the UK, community-owned alternative energy projects represent just five percent of capacity compared to 82 percent represented by private home-owners. Feed-in-tariffs (FiTs) are effectively a subsidy of the middle-class by the poor. They offer subsidies to property owners and companies to install solar panels and wind turbines, with the considerable cost passed on as a surcharge to the utility consumers. In Germany, where FITs are most developed, they have made electricity the most expensive in Europe. The average household now pays an extra €260 a year, while 2,300 energy-intensive companies are exempt from paying the surcharge—and these costs are only expected to rise. And after Berlin began shutting down its nuclear plants, they had to open new plants powered by lignite coal in order to keep the lights on because the sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow. The country’s carbon emissions have predictably begun to creep back up. Yet this need not be the case. We know now that the main historic concerns about nuclear power are not the worry we once thought they were, in the case of radiation and waste, or a phenomenon that next-generation reactor technology eliminates completely, in the case of meltdown. The number of deaths per terawatt hour from nuclear power even with existing technology is by far the lowest of all energy sources. Nuclear should also be cheap. But some 70-80 percent of its cost is due to substantial up-front construction costs, which take decades to pay off, and make the private sector extremely reluctant to go anywhere near the technology without significant public subsidies. In the US in the 1970s, the private companies that were involved in the American build-out of nuclear saw their finances deteriorate due to mammoth cost overruns and had to hand over significant authority to public utility commissions. Over roughly the same period, France, Sweden and Belgium underwent the most successful and rapid decarbonisation programmes in history. France now produces 78 percent of its electricity from this low-carbon source, and enjoyed reductions in emissions of four percent a year over the course of just a decade. The key to France’s nuclear success was making the transition prior to the advent of neoliberalism in the 1980s. Consistently, energy policy researchers have found that the essential element was France’s muscular étatist framework that permitted centralised decision making; a public-sector electricity monopoly enjoying substantial, concentrated resources (the state engineers of the Corps d’État); and strong political support. Alongside this was an influential public research and development agency, and economies of scale from standardised and large-scale build-out. All this is necessary—just as in the Manhattan Project or the Apollo missions—due to high levels of technological risk, reliance on advanced equipment that requires a lengthy lead time, complex learning, a non-proprietorial attitude to knowledge-sharing, and, above all, large amounts of cheap capital. This is precisely why the strongest backers of nuclear power advocate that, for the time being, it cannot be anything other than public sector driven, and why some of the fiercest opponents of nuclear power are, surprisingly, free-market think-tanks such as the Cato Institute. The scale of public investment, centralization, and regulatory control that is required means nuclear smells too much like socialism. But if it were up to the likes of them, we’d never have landed on the moon. An entrepreneurial, risk-taking, mission-oriented public sector got us into space, and it’ll be the same sort of public sector that saves the planet. The patchwork of hair-shirted, back-to-the-land, anti-industrial and degrowth prescriptions common on the green left should really be described as “eco-austerity”. Green anti-modernism is a cuckoo’s egg in the nest of the left. The truth is that we can stop climate change and deliver expanding wealth for all. The end is not nigh and we do not need to rein in industrial society. If anything, we must accelerate our modernity.

May used her first major conference speech since becoming prime minister to make a pitch for the political centre ground. She pledged to take on big business, tackle tax-dodgers, and build more homes to tackle the housing crisis, repeatedly insisting that “change has got to come”. Addressing her party conference in Birmingham on Wednesday, May said the state could reshape society, railed against tax avoidance by the “international elite” and lamented the wealth divide between generations. “It’s time to remember the good that government can do,” May said, in a clear break with her Conservative predecessors’ aims to roll back the state. “While government does not have all the answers, government can be a force for good.” In a key section of the speech, May expounded a vision of a collaborative nation, in a deliberate rejection of Margaret Thatcher’s “no such thing as a society”. She described at length how triathlete Alistair Brownlee gave up his chance to win the final race in the world series in Mexico to help his heat-dazed brother, Jonny, over the line. “We succeed or fail together,” May told the crowd to applause. “There is more to life than individualism and self-interest.” She ended the speech by telling the entire country, whether they backed leave or remain in the Brexit vote, to “come with me and we’ll write that brighter future”. She ended: ”Come with me and together let’s seize the day.” And while reiterating that the Conservatives remained the party of lower tax, May was at pains to describe taxation as “the price we pay for living in a civilised society” and to promise the government would target those who avoided it. “It doesn’t matter who you are,” she said. “If you’re a tax dodger, we’re coming after you. If you’re an accountant, a financial adviser or a middleman who helps people to avoid what they owe to society, we’re coming after you too.” However, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, rejected the idea that May’s government would be moderate, saying the plan by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, to force firms to list foreign workers would stoke intolerance, and singling out Jeremy Hunt’s pledge to reduce the NHS’s reliance on foreign doctors. He said the Conservatives’ approach would “foster division and discrimination in our workplaces and communities”. Business groups also reacted with irritation, with the Institute of Directors saying “business leaders are not pantomime villains, evading taxes and employing cheap labour from abroad out of some destructive desire to do Britain down”. May made repeated reference to “ordinary, working-class people”, saying her party would aim for “the new centre ground of British politics, build on the values of fairness and opportunity, where everyone plays by the same rules”. Aiming squarely at disaffected Labour voters, May said the Conservatives must seek to “govern for the whole nation”. She said: “We are the party of workers – of those who put in the effort, those who contribute and give of their best.” Saying Labour had fled from the centre of British politics, May said the Conservatives were now “the party of the workers, the party of public servants, the party of the NHS”. The prime minister mocked the splits and abuse between Corbyn and his MPs, winning huge cheers by adopting her former description of her own party to describe Labour: “You know what some people call them? The nasty party.” On the economy, May pledged to balance the budget in the longer term, improve productivity and press ahead with major infrastructure such as the HS2 rail lineand the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. On the decision on whether to expand Heathrow or Gatwick airport, May said this would happen shortly. “We will take the big decisions when they are the right decisions for Britain,” she said. “Because that is what government can do.” While a good section of the speech promised to deliver Brexit, and another, much-previewed section railed against the “liberal elite” who May said did not understand the motivations of leave supporters, she argued the 23 June referendum was part of a wider demand for change towards a more equal society. The Brexit vote was notice from people who “were not prepared to be ignored any more”, she said, adding: “Because in June people voted for change. And a change is going to come.” Promising to “stand up for the weak, and to stand up against the strong”, May condemned those who avoided tax, and promised to address the wealth divide between generations and between London and other parts of the UK. “I’m putting you on warning, this cannot go on anymore,” she said. “A change has got to come, and this party, the Conservative party, is going to make that change.” A speech low on new initiatives instead swung between sections designed to please the watching activists – May noted that “life does not seem fair” to those who believe themselves made poorer by low-skilled immigration, and won applause by hailing the return of grammar schools – and messages to the wider audience beyond, covering areas including more housing and better broadband. May was also at pains to praise David Cameron, using an early part of the speech to describe her predecessor as someone who had told the Conservatives they needed to change to win again, adding: “David Cameron, thank you.” She also began with a joke aimed at her foreign secretary, saying, to laughter: “Do we have a plan for Brexit? We do. Are we ready to see it through? We are. Can Boris Johnson stay on message for a full four days? Just about.” The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, rejected the idea May was shifting to the centre ground, calling the rhetoric “utterly divorced from her party’s actions over the last few days”. He said: “The Conservatives are reckless, divisive and uncaring. They are the fence-building, snooping-on-your-emails, foreign-worker-listing party and that is something that most people will be repulsed by. “I was surprised, though, that the prime minister did not take the time to thank the one person who helped create her agenda, not David Cameron but Nigel Farage.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jul/28/climate-change-worlds-wealthiest-understand-but-only-half-see-it-as-threat","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-28T04:33:17Z","webTitle":"Climate change: world’s wealthiest understand, but only half see it as threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/28/climate-change-worlds-wealthiest-understand-but-only-half-see-it-as-threat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jul/28/climate-change-worlds-wealthiest-understand-but-only-half-see-it-as-threat","fields":{"headline":"Climate change: world’s wealthiest understand, but only half see it as threat","bodyText":"People living in the world’s wealthiest nations generally understand what climate change is but in many countries just half perceive it to be a threat, new research has found. The analysis of perceptions in 119 countries found living standards and relative wealth are “poor predictors” of whether someone considers climate change to be a severe risk. While more than 75% of people in Australia, the US, UK and most of the rest of Europe were aware of climate change, far fewer considered it to be detrimental to themselves or their families. In Australia – recently cited as being a world leader in climate science denialism – as well as the US, Germany and the Scandinavian countries, climate change was perceived to be a threat by just over half of those polled. In Russia, despite widespread understanding of climate change, less than 50% of people thought it was a risk to them. The risks of climate change are more widely believed by people in France and Spain, but the greatest concern about its impacts are held elsewhere. In every South American country, concern over climate change is above the 90% mark, with this level of worry shared by Mexico, India, Tanzania and Morocco. Japan is one of the few highly advanced economies in the world to have a population as concerned about the risks of climate change. The paper, published in Nature Climate Change, found different factors drove awareness and risk perceptions of climate change. Education levels and understanding the human influence upon the climate was the greatest factor in Europe, while perception of changing temperatures is the key influence in many African and Asian countries. Authors of the paper, who come from a selection of US universities, say the results show “the need to develop tailored climate communication strategies for individual nations. The results suggest that improving basic education, climate literacy, and public understanding of the local dimensions of climate change are vital to public engagement and support for climate action.” The paper analysed the results of Gallup polls taken in 119 countries, where respondents were asked how much they know about climate change and whether they consider it a threat to them. Dr Debbie Hopkins, an expert at the social understandings of climate change at the University of Otago, said many people still see climate change as a remote issue. “People can be aware of it but they see it as a distant risk and don’t engage with it much,” she said. “This disjunction can negate the feeling that we need to act on climate change. “In many developed countries we have confidence in our adaptive capacity. We think we can adapt and cope, and in many ways we can do so more than developing economies. “We also talk about global averages and that’s a difficult term for many people because two degrees doesn’t seem like a lot. That risk seems diminished whereas if you’re living somewhere with extreme variability and extreme weather events, two degrees can seem like a lot.” Hopkins said accurate media reporting of climate change and more engaged conversations with people on the issue at a local level would help illustrate the threat posed by changes such as rising sea levels and increased heat waves. Climate change is already having its biggest impact upon the world’s most vulnerable, according to the UN, which voiced concern last year that rising temperatures will fuel conflict, war and migration. The number of natural disasters between 2000 and 2009 was around three times higher than in the 1980s, the UN said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-plant-fails-all-tests-bar-the-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-28T17:23:20Z","webTitle":"Hinkley's nuclear plant fails all tests - bar the politics | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-plant-fails-all-tests-bar-the-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2016/jul/28/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-plant-fails-all-tests-bar-the-politics","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley's nuclear plant fails all tests - bar the politics","bodyText":"The new nuclear reactors now given the go-ahead at Hinkley Point have failed every test bar the one that finally mattered - political expediency. The plant, to be paid for by UK energy customers, could cost them £37bn and is a leading contender for the most expensive object ever built on the face of the Earth. A former Conservative energy secretary calls it “one of the worst deals ever” for Britain. It faces formidable commercial, technical and legal obstacles to getting built remotely on time or budget, or indeed at all. And while the rest of the world is accelerating ahead with the smart energy systems of the 21st century, Hinkley is a throwback to the nuclear age of the 20th. But the French government, which majority-owns Hinkley’s builders EDF, wants to preserve its national nuclear industry. The UK government, blinded by the dazzle of a mega-project, is happy to let its citizens pick up the bill. It has taken almost a decade to get to this point. In 2007, EDF said British Christmas turkeys would be being roasted with its nuclear electricity in 2017. The earliest possible switch-on now is 2026, another decade away. What is scary is that reaching the final decision to go ahead was the easy bit. Now they have to deliver a giant and fiendishly complex construction project, described by one nuclear engineer as like “building a cathedral within a cathedral”, that is, “unconstructable”. EDF has never managed to build the types of reactors intended for Hinkley. Its two attempts so far, in France and Finland, remain many years behind schedule and many billions over budget. Perhaps they are hoping for third time lucky. Yet the commercial foundations for this engineering miracle are incredibly shaky. EDF is on the ropes financially and had to be given a €3bn bailout in April by the French government. That may well be challenged under EU state aid rules, which would join an ongoing state aid legal case brought by Austria against UK subsidies for Hinkley. It gets worse. The French Financial Markets Authority raided EDF this month, investigating allegations that it misrepresented the cost of Hinkley and other projects. Banks and other financial institutions already loathed the Hinkley plan, with EDF warned of further credit rating downgrades if it goes ahead, making its huge debt more expensive to maintain. Areva, the French state-owned company which makes the reactors, is being taken over by EDF but it is being investigated by France’s Nuclear Safety Authority over “irregularities” in 400 parts. Areva also faces a state aid investigation. Even many of the staff inside EDF think Hinkley is a colossal white elephant. The company’s unions, who are represented on the board, fear the project will sink the company and have started legal action to delay the decision, while its finance director resigned in March. With foundations this unsound, you would think the UK could get out of the deal easily if it turns sour. But think again. The deal to be signed with EDF contains a “poison pill” which could leave taxpayers with a £22bn bill if a future UK government shuts the plant down. The government is adamant that Hinkley, which could provide 7% of the UK’s electricity, is a vital part of a secure low-carbon future. But a barrage of recent reports from serious players say the opposite. The future is not gigantic centralised energy plants, but widespread networks of renewable energy and storage, interconnected across the continent, bolstered by energy efficiency measures and the smart management of demand. Bodies including the government’s own National Infrastructure Commission (NIC), the National Grid, industry group Energy UK, all point to a smart system that is more secure, cheaper and faster to build. They all use the same word - “revolution” - for the fast changes now happening in energy, while the International Energy Agency talks of a rapid “transition”. Hinkley’s reactors are a revolution only in the sense that they overturn all logic. Energy efficiency could deliver six Hinkley’s worth of electricity by 2030, interconnector cables to Norway, Denmark and France could add another two or three Hinkleys to the grid by 2025 and four Hinkleys’ worth of electricity could be saved by 2030 by increasing the ability to store electricity and making the grid smarter, with the latter alone saving bill payers £8bn a year. Solar and wind power are also cheaper than Hinkley’s nuclear power. EDF had said its decision on Hinkley would be made in September at the earliest. So why the sudden rush, after so many years of delay? The company’s announcement that the decision was being brought forward came on the evening after Theresa May, keen to signal post-Brexit Britain remains open for business, had met Francois Hollande for talks. For Hinkley, as with Brexit itself, political chicanery has triumphed over economic reality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/feb/06/top-50-business-rates-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-06T18:09:30Z","webTitle":"The top 50 business rates bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/06/top-50-business-rates-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/feb/06/top-50-business-rates-bills","fields":{"headline":"The top 50 business rates bills","bodyText":"Heathrow airport, Hounslow: £118,320,000 Sellafield Limited, Cumbria: £32,335,870 Sizewell B power station, Suffolk: £28,283,410 Gatwick airport, West Sussex: £27,849,570 Heysham 2 power station, Lancashire: £24,640,140 No 1 Maintenance Area, Heathrow: £20,301,740 Vodafone fibre optic network and Berkshire premises: £19,720,000 Hartlepool power station: £16,564,800 Corus UK Ltd, Lincolnshire: £15,460,480 Manchester airport: £15,302,720 Stansted airport, Essex: £15,046,360 BA World Cargo Centre Buildings, Heathrow: £13,641,310 Home Office, London: £12,305,280 Harrods, London: £11,827,070 Citigroup, Canada Square, London: £11,822,140 HSBC 8, Canada Square, London: £11,728,470 British Airways, Terminal 5, Heathrow: £11,457,320 Drax power station, North Yorkshire: £11,215,750 BBC Broadcasting House, Portland Place, London: £11,038,270 JP Morgan, Bank Street, London: £10,826,280 Esso refinery, Southampton: £10,826,280 SSI South Teeside works, Cleveland: £10,725,215 Selfridges, Oxford Street, London: £10,042,410 Barclays Bank, Canary Wharf, London: £9,455,740 Ministry Of Defence, Whitehall, London: £9,317,700 Heysham 1 power station, Lancashire: £9,120,500 Credit Suisse, Cabot Square, London: £9,095,850 National Grid, Kent: £8,676,800 Security Service, Millbank, London: £8,553,550 Felixstowe Dock &amp; Railway Co, Suffolk: £8,381,000 BBC, Wood Lane, London: £8,001,390 Ratcliffe-On-Soar power station, Nottingham: £7,685,870 Channel Tunnel, Kent: £7,592,200 Goldman Sachs, Fleet Street, London: £7,488,670 Clifford Chance, Upper Bank Street, London: £7,434,440 Birmingham airport: £7,399,930 Devonport Royal Dockyard, Plymouth: £7,261,890 PWC, Embankment Place, London: £7,084,410 Gas Storage Facility, Hull: £6,837,910 University Of Manchester: £6,783,680 Palace Of Westminster, London: £6,655,500 Didcot B power station: £6,615,074 Phillips 66 Ltd, Lincolnshire: £6,581,550 Staythorpe power station, Nottinghamshire: £6,544,575 New Scotland Yard 10, London: £6,502,670 Cottam power station, Nottinghamshire: £6,409,000 West Burton power station, Nottinghamshire: £6,399,140 John Lewis, Oxford Street, London: £6,384,350 Morgan Stanley, Bank Street, London: £6,344,910 HM Treasury, London: £6,344,910"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2019/jan/16/brexit-vote-theresa-may-faces-no-confidence-vote-after-crushing-defeat","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2019-01-17T00:56:55Z","webTitle":"May calls on MPs from all parties to 'put self-interest aside' – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jan/16/brexit-vote-theresa-may-faces-no-confidence-vote-after-crushing-defeat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2019/jan/16/brexit-vote-theresa-may-faces-no-confidence-vote-after-crushing-defeat","fields":{"headline":"May calls on MPs from all parties to 'put self-interest aside' – as it happened","bodyText":"We’re going to wrap things up, folks. Thank you for following along. Andrew Sparrow will be back in the morning to shepherd us all through the day’s political happenings. Until then, thanks for reading, it’s been a pleasure. Here is Emmanuel Macron laying out what he sees as the three options facing the UK at this point in Brexit negotiations. Macron was speaking on Wednesday in Normandy after the May’s disastrous loss on her Brexit deal. ICYMI, as we say on the internet, a group called Led By Donkeys have had some fun in Dover last night, putting up billboards showing quotes from various Conservative MPs on the subject of Brexit, which now seem a little, well, the words “egg” and “face” come to mind. We’ve got a full story on that here: Tobias Ellwood, a Conservative defence minister, who is pro-remain, has been on Australian breakfast radio where he said that while the vote was tight it was “a distraction from the bigger question of where we go with Brexit.” He also has an interesting take on what the no-confidence vote was about, saying: “The question wasn’t about confidence in the government, it was a question of do you want Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister?” This might be what motivated a lot of Conservatives in their decision to support the PM today, but, needless to say, was not, technically, what the vote was about. Ellwood says any further moves to destabilise May by calling for another no-confidence vote would be “irresponsible”. “Let’s say you had a general election, we’re up against a deadline of March 29th otherwise we end up with either a no-deal Brexit, or you have to extend [the deadline]. Why on earth would you call a general election in the middle of that? It’s deeply irresponsible.” Ellwood said May’s Brexit deal was voted down “not because you have another big idea waiting to slide into view, but because you have different caucuses join together in a coalition of convenience to vote this deal down.” He said that in his own constituency, he is being asked by voters to “vote for no deal, vote for the Norway option, vote for a second referendum, it really is difficult to understand what leave really means, because it was never pointed out, there was never a manifesto statement that says this is what leave looks like. But we all have to be responsible members of parliament and perhaps step back from our original positions and see if there is compromise so we can move forward and agree something prior to the deadline that is approaching.” The Brexit drama of this week has led to renewed calls for another referendum on Scottish independence. The front page of the Scottish National paper has the headline: “Independence is the only way out of this mess”. The Scottish Herald publishes a poll showing 56.55% of people think Scotland should have a referendum on independence if the UK leaves the EU of 29 March. Yvette Cooper has also thrown her support behind the idea of citizens assemblies as a way of widening the Brexit debate, which is one of the suggestions Lucas says she is going to take into her meeting with Theresa May tomorrow. Good evening, political-people, this is Kate Lyons taking over from Mattha Busby, which means this blog has now come full circle – I launched it about 18 hours ago, and will see it through until we put it to bed. If you’ve been reading the blog that whole time, firstly, thank you, we appreciate you, our wonderful, devoted readers. Secondly, you must be exhausted, please get some sleep. But before you switch off for the night, perhaps you may want to send Caroline Lucas a quick tweet. The Greens MP will be meeting with the PM at 9am tomorrow and is inviting people to get in touch with her to tell her what message they want to convey to May in their meeting. Lucas has said she will tell May “loud and clear” that “the threat of no deal Brexit must come off the table and that there should be a People’s Vote.” Any other suggestions? @ her. That’s all from me tonight. I will now hand over to my colleague Kate Lyons who will continue our coverage of political developments following events in Parliament today and Theresa May’s statement in Downing Street this evening. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has predicted that the opposition parties will now take the lead on delivering Brexit. “I think what will happen now is the Labour Party, along with the other opposition parties, and with other members of Parliament, will take the lead in this now because the Government significantly failed to come up with anything they can get through their own party,” he told Peston on ITV. Its live here if you would like to tune in: The main takeaways from the prime minister’s statement: She did not mention the prospect of no-deal, which most opposition parties are demanding. MP’s must set out what they want, rather than what they don’t want and ‘put self-interest aside’. The door remains open to talks with Jeremy Corbyn. May stressed the fact she recognises it is her duty to deliver on the British people’s instruction to leave the European Union. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg has been told that one former cabinet May loyalist has told her she is “deluded”. Meanwhile, on Newsnight, Liam Fox has said no Brexit would be “democratically unacceptable”. What makes the prime minister tick? I hear you ask. The Guardian’s political editor Heather Stewart has delved into what underpins Theresa May’s “extraordinary inflexibility”. Labour’s David Lammy, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign, has responded to the prime minister’s statement tonight: The prime minister is like a broken record. After two and a half years of damaging the country’s economy and international standing while failing to get consensus in parliament, her refusal to change tack is a historic mistake. If the prime minister really cares about the national interest, she would give the public the final say over this Brexit mess, with the option to stay in the EU. Here are some of tomorrow’s front pages: The Mail blames “wrecker Corbyn” for not attending May’s impromptu talks. The i reports that the UK is heading for close ties with Europe, according to ministers. The Times also leads on Corbyn’s apparent refusal to accede to May’s demand for cooperation. The National renews its call for Scottish independence. The Telegraph splash on the leaked recording of Hammond’s conference call with business leaders. Brexican stand off, says the Metro. The FT heralds the beginning of May’s search for Brexit inspiration. Theresa May’s full statement: This evening the government has won the confidence of parliament. This now gives us the opportunity to focus on finding a way forward on Brexit. I understand that people getting on with their lives outside of Westminster, the events of last 24 hours will have been unsettling. Overwhelmingly, the British people want us to get on with delivering Brexit, and also address the other important issues they care about. But the deal I’ve worked to agree with the European Union was rejected by MPs and by a large margin. I believe it is my duty to deliver on the British people’s instruction to leave the European Union and I intend to do so. So now MPs have made clear what they don’t want, we must all work constructively together to set out what parliament does want. That’s why I’m inviting MPs from all parties to come together to find a way forward, one that both delivers on the referendum and can command the support of parliament. This is now the time to put self-interest aside. I have just held constructive meetings with the Leader of the Liberal Democrats [Vince Cable], and the Westminster leaders of the SNP and Plaid Cymru, [Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts, respectively]. From tomorrow meetings will be taking place between senior government representatives, including myself, and groups of MPs that represent the widest possible range of views from across parliament, including our confidence and supply partners, the Democratic Unionist party. I am disappointed that the leader of the Labour party [Jeremy Corbyn] has not so far chosen to take part, but our door remains open. It will not be an easy task, but MPs know they have a duty to act in the national interest, reach a consensus and get this done. In a historic vote in 2016 the country decided to leave the EU. In 2017, 80% of people voted for parties that stood on manifestos promising to respect that result. Now, over two-and-a-half years later, it’s time for us to come together, put the national interest first – and deliver on the referendum. The chancellor Philip Hammond has reportedly told business leaders that the “threat” of no-deal Brexit could be taken “off the table” in a number of days. The Telegraph reported that Hammond said this could potentially lead to article 50 being rescinded – therefore extending the period of Britain’s membership of the EU, according to a leaked recording of a conference call. When asked for assurances from the head of Tesco that the government would not oppose such a motion, Hammond apparently suggested that ministers may even back the plan. He went on to explain how a backbench bill could stymie the prospect of no deal. The director general of the British Chambers of Commerce has tweeted: Here are some takes on Theresa May’s statement: This is the Labour party political broadcast that aired on the BBC tonight: The prime minister says she is disappointed Corbyn has chosen not to talk part in talks, “but the door remains open”. In her closing remark, she says: “In a historic vote in 2016 the country decided to leave the EU. In 2017, 80% of people voted for parties that stood on manifestos promising to respect that result. “Now, over two and a half years later, it’s time for us to come together, put the national interest first and deliver on the referendum,” she concludes, before immediately turning around and walking back into No 10. That’s it. The prime minister has kept it short and sweet, without creating much news. Full transcription follows. May says now is the time to put self-interest aside, noting that she has just held constructive meetings with Lib Dem leader Vince Cable and the Westminster leaders of the SNP and Plaid Cymru Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts. “From tomorrow meetings will be taking place between senior government representatives, including myself, and groups of MPs that represent the widest possible selection of views from across parliament,” she says. May reiterates that she understands it is her duty to deliver on the British people’s instruction to leave the European Union: “And I intend to do so.” May says she understands that people getting on with their lives outside of Westminster must have found the last 24 hours “unsettling”. The BBC’s news bulletin is in progress and the prime minister is expected to appear any moment. It is believed that Theresa May has held some talks with unspecified party leaders tonight. Laura Kuennsberg says she does not expect any “dramatic departure” from her established positions. May’s statement is due in the next few minutes at 10pm. This will be her fourth public appearance during what must have been one of the most testing days in her political career. The podium is erected in front of Number 10 Downing Street. You can watch it live if you click on the video feed at the top of this blog. Or here: Southampton’s third round FA cup replay with Derby has gone to extra time, meaning that BBC1 programmers have a small dilemma on their hands. It has now been reported - and this is unconfirmed – that May’s statement will now air on the BBC News Channel. How British. Here’s our live blog for the game: For anyone catching up on development’s tonight, here are several reports from the Guardian’s lobby team: And for anyone who fancies a giggle: A No 10 spokeswoman has confirmed that Theresa May is to make a statement in Downing Street at 10pm. Tom Newton Dunn, the Sun’s political editor, claims May will reassure the public that she’s still in charge, and is delivering Brexit. Labour’s shadow education secretary has her own prediction: The Scottish National party has called on Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn to support a people’s vote, saying it “must now be on the table” for cross-party Brexit talks to take place with the prime minister. Ian Blackford called on May to make concessions on her withdrawal deal after she survived tonight’s confidence vote, saying the the SNP want guarantees that ruling out a no deal and extending article 50 will be possible options. “The SNP is committed to working constructively with the prime minister, however the option of ruling out a no deal, extending article 50 and holding a people’s vote must now be on the table,” Ian Blackford the party’s Westminster leader said. “I have written to Jeremy Corbyn along with other opposition leaders calling on him to support a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal. “Last night’s historic vote, which saw the UK government humiliated, was a clear indication of the strength of opposition to the Prime Minister’s deal from across the House. We must see concessions from the prime minister, as well as Jeremy Corbyn, to break the Brexit impasse.” Ahead of any talks, the SNP wrote a cross-party letter with the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Greens to the Labour leader. It argues that “now that the government and the official opposition’s options have been tested before the House, we believe the only way now which presents a real chance of breaking the Brexit deadlock is to put the decision to the people by backing a people’s vote.” Nick Dearden, a spokesperson from Another Europe is Possible, has spoken to the BBC 71 Labour MP’s today signed a letter saying that they would support a second referendum – that amounts to around 28% of the parliamentary party. Dearden conceded that this does not amount to a majority, but he countered: “If you look at the opinion polls we see over and over again that the Labour party is overwhelmingly in favour of remain, still, and an increasing number of people in favour of another referendum. “And who can be surprised, we’ve left it to this government, we’ve left it to the politicians, they have failed to deliver anything which I think whether you voted remain or whether you voted leave, nobody voted for the constitutional crisis that we now have on our hands. “We have to put this back to the people and get a popular mandate, one way or another,” he added, saying that he believes most Labour members would vote remain if it was on the ballot paper. Robert Peston, ITV’s political editor, says May’s emergency statement tonight will take place at 10.03pm. Earlier this evening, Corbyn’s spokesman told reporters that Downing Street contacted the Labour leader’s office ahead of the vote about the prospect of a meeting, but said that he was not expected to go to Number 10 on Wednesday evening. Explaining why the Labour leader wanted no-deal taken off the table, the spokesman said: “The blackmail is that by attempting to run down the clock and hold the threat of the country going over a cliff-edge into a no-deal outcome... that makes it more difficult to reach a real and effective deal.” The spokesman said May must recognise the “reality” facing her Withdrawal Agreement. That deal is dead. No number of tweaks or sweeteners from Brussels are going to change that. That is absolutely clear. If there is going to be a deal that is going to work for the country and have a majority in Parliament, Theresa May is going to have to abandon her red lines. However, he acknowledged this would cause problems in her own party, saying: “Any change in the Government’s red lines is going to cause them internal splits. That’s the fundamental reason why they are unable to govern.” The spokesman said Labour was not ruling out another no-confidence vote, but refused to be drawn on timing. Vince Cable is likely to meet with Theresa May tonight, along with Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville Roberts, who is apparently set to demand a “people’s vote” from the PM face-to-face, according to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. Earlier she tweeted that the secretary of state for international trade, Liam Fox, has told her he has “consistently opposed a customs union”. Richard Branson, the business magnate, has urged Theresa May to abandon her red lines. Ian Lavery, the Labour party chairman, says May’s offer of talks and a degree of rapprochement on Brexit in the national interest is “a little too late” and that “she hasn’t listened until now”. Its two years since these negotiations started, and for the prime minister to make a claim to meet with the leaders of the party’s is a little too late. She hasn’t at any stage .. sought to seek the advice .. of the opposition parties at all. I find that very distasteful. Its probably why we’ve ended up in this situation. He went on to call May’s deal “the worst possible from Brussels” and that Labour will look to see what the government’s plan B will be on Monday. “We want to see some sort of remedy to this situation.” After obfuscating in his response to what has a credible chance of getting through the house, Lavery was asked whether there is any possible scenario where Labour could help get Brexit through. He reiterated Labour’s opposition to no deal and said: We want to ensure that there’s a Brexit for the people, we want to make sure that whatever Brexit is there for jobs, for the economy, for businesses. We will have one red line in these discussions with Theresa May, and that will be an absolute guarantee that there will not be a no-deal Brexit. So, everything’s on the table, it’ll be up to Theresa May to accept what the Labour party might wish to put forward. I hope she listens because she hasn’t listened until now. Christopher Hope, The Telegraph’s chief political correspondent, has tweeted: Here’s a reminder of Corbyn’s demand earlier: Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, has said tonight’s vote was a “big rejection” of Jeremy Corbyn, and that the Labour leader must change his position on the principle of a people’s vote. “It’s a big rejection of Jeremy Corbyn,” he told the Press Association. “Just as last night was a big rejection of her [Theresa May’s] Brexit. I think we are narrowing the options. I think the one step forward that we are looking for from Jeremy Corbyn is he has got to change his position and accept some movement on the principle of a ‘people’s vote’.” On Brexit talks with May, Cable said: “If she wants to reach out we are up for it.” Cable also told the BBC that while he would meet May he would have conditions on Brexit. “As I said in parliament this afternoon of course we will talk to the prime minister,” he said. “But I will make it absolutely clear that no deal has to be taken off the table and there has to be a sensible discussion about the ‘people’s vote’.” Theresa May’s spokesman has told reporters that the Westminster leaders of Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and Plaid Cymru have been invited to meet the prime minister later this evening. However, a no-deal Brexit will not be taken off the table, despite Corbyn’s insistence it was a prerequisite for talks, he added. The spokesman said: “The prime minister has been very clear that the British public voted to leave the European Union. “We want to leave with a deal but she is determined to deliver on the verdict of the British public and that is to leave the EU on 29 March this year.” A Number 10 source told the Press Association: “What we are talking about tonight is party leader-level talks between the prime minister and her opposite numbers in other parties, should they wish to accept that.” It is understood that the prime minister will be making a further statement at 10pm tonight. It is unclear what will be said. She may well reprise parts of her earlier speeches today, but the party talks – if they do indeed happen – could prove crucial in shaping her approach going forward. Caroline Lucas, the former Green party leader, has urged Jeremy Corbyn to hold a second referendum after his confidence motion was voted down. In a clip posted to Twitter, the Brighton Pavilion MP said: “The leader of the opposition was right to try to bring down this toxic, failing government. But now MPs have had their say on the Brexit deal, he needs to give the people a say over our future relationship with our nearest neighbours.” Lucas added that to do otherwise would be a “betrayal” of the “majority of his party’s members” and young supporters who were unable to vote in the referendum two years ago. Earlier this evening in parliament, she said: Nigel Dodds, the DUP deputy leader, has highlighted the fact the government would have been unable to command half the support of the Commons tonight without the support of the Northern Irish unionist party, with whom the Conservatives have a confidence and supply agreement. Its worth mentioning here that the DUP have 10 MPs, and the result of tonight’s vote was 325 to 306, out of 650 MPs overall. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, has renewed calls for a “people’s vote” and criticised Jeremy Corbyn for sitting on the fence. He tweeted: James Brokenshire, the communities secretary, is the first cabinet minister to give an interview to the BBC News channel following this evening’s vote. He said that tonight’s events show that Theresa May commands the “profound” confidence of the majority of MPs. Well the prime minister said yesterday that she wanted to test the opinion of the house, to see that we have the confidence of the House of Commons, which we profoundly do - that’s the vote we’ve had tonight. And therefore now to move on to discussions with other party leaders. As the prime minister said, wanted to work with other parties, parliamentarians, to test the support on the things that need to happen so we can ensure we make Brexit happen, and therefore following through as she said she would do. He then criticised Jeremy Corbyn, suggesting he does not want to act in the national interest, and saying that its “extraordinary” that the Labour leader sought to “attach some conditionality” to the prime minister’s offer of talks, beginning this evening. “I hope he reflects on that because otherwise it looks like this is all about party political manoeuvring, rather than acting in the national interest. That is what the prime minister is determined to do.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has tweeted: Here are the remarks Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn made in the House of Commons following the confidence vote, in full. The prime minister said: I’m pleased that this house has expressed its confidence in the government tonight. I do not take this responsibility lightly and our government will continue its work to increase our prosperity, guarantee our security and to strengthen our union. And yes we will also continue to work on the solemn promise we made to the people of this country to deliver on the result of the referendum and leave the European Union. I believe this duty is shared by every member of this house and we have a responsibility to identify a way forward that can secure the backing of the house. To that end I’ve proposed a series of meetings between senior parliamentarians and representatives of the government over the coming days and I would like to invite the leaders of parliamentary parties to meet with me individually and I would like to start these meetings tonight. Mr Speaker, the government approach is to hold these meetings in a constructive spirit and I urge others to do the same but we must find solutions that are negotiable and command sufficient support in this house. And I’ve said we will return to the house on Monday to table an amendable motion and to make a statement about the way forward. The house has put its confidence in this government, I stand ready to work with any member of this house to deliver on Brexit and to ensure this house retains the confidence of the British people. The leader of the opposition said: Thank you Mr Speaker. Last night the house rejected the government’s conclusion of its negotiations with the European Union. Heckles from Tory MP’s prompted an intervention from the Speaker, who said May was listened to in “relative tranquility”, suggesting Corbyn was not extended the same courtesy. Corbyn continued: Last night the house rejected the government’s deal, emphatically. A week ago the house voted to condemn the idea of a no-deal Brexit. Before there can be any positive discussions about the way forward the government must remove, clearly and once and for all, the prospect of the catastrophe of no deal and all the chaos that would come as a result of that, and I invite the prime minister to confirm now that the government will not countenance a no-deal Brexit from the European Union. Theresa May has comfortably won the no-confidence vote, by 325 to 306 - a majority of 19. The vote came after a debate in which Jeremy Corbyn accused her of leading “a zombie government”, and Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, closed the debate with a powerful speech saying May does not “possess the necessary political skills, empathy, ability, and most crucially the policy, to lead this country any longer”. (See 7.23pm.) Opposition party leaders have refused an invitation from May to join her for talks about an alternative approach to Brexit until she abandons some of her red lines. After the vote May said she would like talks to start tonight. But Corbyn and the Lib Dems said they would not engage with her until she ruled out a no-deal Brexit. And the SNP said she would have to be willing to discuss extending article 50 and holding a second referendum before they agreed to participate. Downing Street has flatly ruled out customs union membership, before the cross-party Brexit talks Theresa May promised on Tuesday night have even begun. May also delivered the same message in her speech in the debate. (See 4.14pm.) Michel Barnier has said Brexit is at a standstill after the crushing rejection of Theresa May’s deal by MPs but offered to return to the negotiating table if parliament forces Theresa May to shift her “red lines”. Business leaders have suggested the UK resembles a “supertanker heading for the rocks” that will not be saved unless factions in the Conservative party drop their own “red lines” for a Brexit deal. Investors expect a delay to Britain’s exit from the EU following the crushing defeat of the prime minister’s Brexit deal, the Bank of England governor has said. Half a dozen Labour MPs came out in support of a second referendum for the first time at a Westminster photocall, arguing it was the “the only logical option” if the party could not secure a general election. Jacob Rees-Mogg hosted a champagne party for Brexiter colleagues on Tuesday night following the Commons vote that inflicted the worst defeat in modern history upon a UK prime minister, it has emerged. That is all from me for tonight. My colleague Mattha Busby is taking over now. Tom Watson’s speech was one of the most gently damning anyone has delivered about Theresa May since she became prime minister. Here are some key extracts. First let me say very clearly that I am not one of those people who questioned [May’s] motives. I agree with [Tory MP Stephen Kerr] who claimed she was motivated by public duty. I don’t doubt that she has sincerely attempted to fulfil the task given to us by the voters in the referendum. I have no doubt that she has tried her best and given it her all. But she has failed. And I’m afraid the failure is hers. Hers alone ... Throughout history prime ministers have tried their best and failed. There is no disgrace in that. That’s politics. But this prime minister has chosen one last act of defiance – not just defying the laws of politics, but defying the laws of mathematics. It was a Disraeli who said “a majority is always better than the best repartee”. She is a prime minister without a majority for her flagship policy, with no authority and no plan B. Mr Speaker … that’s not a mere flesh wound. No one doubts her determination, which is generally an admirable quality, but misapplied it can be toxic. And the cruellest truth of all is that she doesn’t possess the necessary political skills, empathy, ability, and most crucially the policy, to lead this country any longer ... We know [May] has worked hard. But the truth is she is too set in her ways, too aloof to lead. She lacks the imagination and agility to bring people with her. She lacks the authority on the world stage to negotiate this deal. Ultimately she has failed. It is not through lack of effort. It is not through a lack of dedication. And I think the country recognises that effort. In fact the country feels genuinely sorry for the prime minister. I feel sorry for the prime minister. But she cannot confuse pity for political legitimacy, sympathy for sustainable support. Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem MP, says the Lib Dems also want May to rule out a no-deal Brexit before talks can start. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says he will only engage in talks with May if she is prepared to have extending article 50 and holding a “people’s vote” as options. Jeremy Corbyn says he does not want to start talks with Theresa May until she rules out a no-deal Brexit. Theresa May has just announced, on a point of order, that she wants to start talks with the leaders of the opposition parties tonight about a way forward on Brexit. The government has won by 325 votes to 306 - a majority of 19. This is from the BBC’s Joey D’Urso. Here is the Labour MP Lisa Nandy on Michael Gove’s speech. MPs are now voting on the no-confidence motion. It is a very simple motion. It just says: That this house has no confidence in Her Majesty’s government. The SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Green party have also signed it. You can read the signatories on the order paper here (pdf). Gove mentions investments that have been coming to Britain – all of those, “in the words of the BBC”, despite Brexit. The government is spending more on the NHS. And the country has two new aircraft carriers, he says. He says Corbyn wants to leave Nato and get rid of the nuclear deterrent. And he claimed that Corbyn once questioned why countries need big armies. Corbyn was present when a wreath was laid to commemorate those involved in the massacre of Israeli athletes. Corbyn said he was “present but not involved”, Gove says. Gove says that sums up Corbyn’s stance on national security. When the Commons voted to oppose Islamic State, Corbyn was also present but not involved. And Gove goes on to claim that Corbyn would not stand up to Putin. If he won’t stand up to Putin, how will he stand up for the national interest? Labour MPs are shouting “shame” very, very loudly. (The claims that Gove is making are to a large extent contested.) Gove finishes, with Tory MPs shouting “more” enthusiastically. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, is winding up for the government now. He says Tom Watson failed to mention Jeremy Corbyn in his speech. Gove and Watson have things in common, he says. They have both lost weight. And they both think Corbyn is unfit to lead the Labour party. Turning to the SNP, Gove says Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, did not say anything in his speech about the common fisheries policy, which is deeply unpopular with Scottish fishermen. Tom Watson’s speech is getting rave reviews on Twitter – deservedly, because it was very good. Here is some comment from other journalists. From CityAM’s Owen Bennett From the Evening Standard’s Joe Murphy From the BBC’s Jon Sopel From the Daily Mirror’s Kevin Maguire Watson says the question for MPs is whether it is worth giving May another chance to go back to Brussels, another chance to humiliate the UK, another chance to waste precious time. He says it was May who laid down impossible red lines. She refused to guarantee the rights of EU nationals. And she tried to shut out parliament. She has treated MPs with disdain, he says. He says parliament is now having to assert its authority. At every turn, May has promoted division instead of unity. She has chosen to placate the most extreme of her colleagues, he says. What happened to those burning injustices that May said she would fight: Racism? Classism? Homelessness? Insecure jobs? All these problems have got worse. May will forever be known as the “nothing has changed” PM. But something must change. May is too aloof, too set in her ways. She lacks the agility to bring people with her. It is not through lack of effort or dedication. The country feels sorry for the PM. Watson says he feels sorry for the PM. But that is not enough, he says. He says Tories may feel loyal to May. But they know in their hearts she is “not capable of getting a deal through”. That is why we need a general election, he says. Watson says he is not one of those people who questions Theresa May’s motives. He accepts she is motivated by duty, and that she is trying to honour the result of the referendum. But she has failed, and the failure is hers alone. He says he admires her resilience. Other people would not have been able to put up with the humiliations she has endured. But May has failed. He says she has no majority for her flagship policy, no authority, and no alternative. She lost the vote by 432 votes to 202. That is not a mere flesh wound, he says. He says May does not have the empathy or political skills to carry on as prime minister. Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, is winding up now for the opposition. He says the UK is “more divided and fearful for the future than ever before”. In Cardiff the Welsh assembly has passed a Plaid Cymru motion rejecting a no-deal Brexit in any circumstances. After the vote Adam Price, the Plaid leader, said: I’m very pleased that the Welsh government and our national parliament supported Plaid Cymru’s motion in rejecting in any circumstances an exit from the European Union with no deal. The agreement on our motion is a good sign that there is an emerging understanding in this place that we must come together to face problems that are crowding around Wales and the Welsh economy, threatening a perfect storm. According to the Times’ Sam Coates, Labour is considering giving its MPs a free vote on what should happen next over Brexit. He explains how this might work in a Twitter thread starting here. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Wesminster, has tweeted this picture of himself and Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, meeting Theresa May in the Commons earlier. On Radio 4’s PM programme Norman Lamont, the Brexiter former Conservative chancellor, said that Theresa May would split her party if she adopted a Brexit policy designed to appeal to Labour MPs, such as keeping the UK in the customs union. He explained: It would be suicidal for her to try to pass legislation of this kind, a measure of this kind, with a huge amount of Labour support, alienating perhaps 100 in her own party. I simply don’t think that she could survive that, I don’t think any prime minister of a Conservative bent could survive that. When Ken [Clarke, a fellow guest on the programme] says there is a majority for a customs union, there may be a majority for a customs union composed of a very large part of the Labour party. But there is no way a Conservative prime minister is going to survive on the back of the vote being largely Labour supported. That would be to destroy the Conservative [party]. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has put out this statement about her talks with Theresa May earlier. She said: We have had a useful discussion with the prime minister. These are critical times for the United Kingdom and we have indicated that first and foremost we will act in the national interest. Lessons will need to be learned from the vote in parliament. The issue of the backstop needs to be dealt and we will continue to work to that end. In keeping with our commitments in the confidence and supply agreement, which has benefitted every sector of society in Northern Ireland, the DUP is supporting the government this evening so that we can concentrate on the real challenges ahead of us. We will have further engagements in the coming days. Here are some more quotes from the no-confidence debate. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said the government should resign. The prime minister is beholden to the DUP but the DUP will only support her in very certain circumstances. This is not just about the defeat of the government last night on Brexit, it is a government that is stuck, that can’t get its legislative programme through. It has no majority support in this house, it is a government that [is] past its time. And if the government had any humility, had any self respect it would reflect on the scale of that defeat last night ... The government should recognise it has no moral authority, the government quite simply should go. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, said the DUP would be backing the government. We believe it’s in the national interest to support the government at this time so the aims and objectives of the confidence and supply agreement we entered into can be achieved. Much work remains to be done on those matters. I don’t think the people in this country would rejoice at the prospect tonight if a general election were to be called. I’m not convinced that a general election would significantly change the composition of the house and of course it doesn’t change, whatever the outcome, it doesn’t change the choices that lie before us all. The timing of this motion, as we well know, has got much more to do with the internal dynamics of the Labour party than a genuine presentation of an alternative programme for government. The Conservative MP Neil Parish, chair of the Commons environment committee, said people wanted the government to come together and deliver Brexit. We are the party of government, we were elected to govern this country and so therefore we have to make a decision. We can’t sit contemplating our navels forever as to whether we’re going to make the decision or not. John Woodcock, the former Labour MP who now sits as an independent, claimed some Labour MPs thought Jeremy Corbyn was unfit to be PM. With a heavy heart I have to tell the house that I cannot support the no-confidence motion tonight and some of my friends mutter disgrace, I hear some of them tutting. I have to say that many of them have privately said: ‘Thank God that you have got the freedom to actually not support this,’ because they are wrestling with their consciences, wanting desperately a Labour government, knowing that the leader of their party is as unfit to lead the country as he was when they voted against him in the no-confidence motion of the party those years ago. This is from the BBC’s Mark Devenport. The SDLP, Labour’s sister party in Northern Ireland, which used to be represented at Westminster until it lost its three seats in 2017, has criticised Labour’s stance on Brexit. In a statement released by the People’s Vote campaign, the SDLP Brexit spokesperson Claire Hanna said: The British Labour party in parliament say that membership of the customs union would mean there was no need for an Irish backstop. This simply is not true. There is no Brexit deal available that does not require a backstop. To be frank in the SDLP we are disappointed by the approach of the Labour leadership, who appear to place wooing DUP votes over protecting the Good Friday agreement. We absolutely acknowledge the concerns of many MPs about the impact of the withdrawal deal on their constituents, but the backstop does not fall into that category. The choices are between a deal with a backstop or a people’s vote with an option for the UK to stay in the EU, keeping the whole of the island of Ireland in the EU and removing any question of a backstop. Here is Emmanuel Macron’s take on where Britain stands after last night’s Brexit vote. He says the mendacious leave campaign has left MPs with the task of trying to implement the impossible. George Osborne, the Evening Standard editor who was chancellor until he was sacked by Theresa May, reckons Macron has come up with a more realistic summary of Britain’s situation than the prime minister. Here is the full transcript of what Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, told the European parliament this morning about the Commons Brexit vote, when he said: “The risk of a no deal has never been so high.” The transcript also includes the comments from Frans Timmermans, the European commission vice president, on the same subject. In the light of claims that a lot of the Brexit debate is driven by fantasy, it is appropriate that he ended his remarks with this (rather good) quote from CS Lewis. Let me end with a quote by CS Lewis: “We cannot go back and change the beginning. But we can start where we are and change the ending.” Another independent MP, Sylvia Hermon, who represents North Down in Northern Ireland, has said she will not be voting for the motion of no-confidence in the government, the New Statesman’s Patrick Maguire reports. John Woodcock, who was elected as a Labour MP but now sits as an independent after leaving the party because of his opposition to Jeremy Corbyn and over a disciplinary case, has told the Commons he will not be voting for the motion of no-confidence in the government this evening. He said he thought Corbyn and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, were not fit to hold high office. The Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who delayed her caesarean section so that she could vote in last night’s division, and who had to be taken through the lobby in a wheelchair, will be “nodded through” tonight. That is a procedure normally used for MPs who are seriously ill. As long as they are on the parliamentary estate at the time of the vote, and witnessed by a whip, their vote is counted as if they had gone through the division lobby in person. In a series of Tweets, Siddiq said she was doing this because she had received a personal assurance from the prime minister that the Tories would honour the system. At his regular press briefing in Brussels earlier today, Margaritis Schinas, the spokesman for the European commission, said it was up to London to decide what happened next in the Brexit process. He said: The next move has to come from London. There is nothing else we can do from here at this stage. What matters at this stage … is that we know what to expect from the UK, and that we don’t know. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said Theresa May should resign – but also argued that if she survives the confidence vote she ought to be given a few days to find a way through the impasse. Speaking in the Senedd in Cardiff, Drakeford said: We need a new House of Commons and a new government to find a fresh way forward. That approach should rule out a no-deal exit and protect jobs and the economy here in Wales. Any prime minister who finds herself defeated in the way this prime minister has been when attempting to discharge the single most important responsibility that will ever fall to her should resign. That is the constitutionally proper form of action. The greatest threat to Wales is that we crash out of the European Union with no deal at all, with all the damage that will cause to business, to jobs. He said the point may come when a people’s vote is the only way to break the impasse. But Drakeford also said May had told him in a telephone conversation that she would work with devolved administrations as well as parliamentarians to find a way through. He said: If she is in a position to do that after today, I think we have to allow her the few days at her disposal to see if that can be brought about. If there is a deal that she can do that meets the tests set out by my party, there may yet be a deal to be done. If that is not the case then I agree in those circumstances that the decision will have to go back to the people. Drakeford met today with members of Plaid Cymru and Welsh Tories to discuss no-deal contingencies. He said he had not met members of Ukip because they did not believe there was any need to prepare for no-deal. The Commons Brexit committee has published a report (pdf) saying MPs should be given a series of indicative votes on what happens next. Voting in the Commons is normally binary – MPs either vote for or against a proposition – but on Brexit there is increasing support for an alternative approach that would enable MPs to vote on a series of options, so as to show which had most support. The committee suggests MPs should be given a vote on four options. It explains them like this. 1. To hold another vote on the draft withdrawal agreement and framework for the future relationship. 2. To leave the EU with no deal on 29 March with no agreement on future relations in place and with no transition/implementation period. 3. To call on the government to seek to renegotiate the deal to achieve a specific outcome, be it a variation of the terms of the separation set out in the withdrawal agreement or providing clarity about the end state of future relations as set out in the political declaration. The main renegotiation possibilities would be: 1) Seeking changes to the text in the withdrawal agreement on the backstop arrangements; 2) Seeking a Canada-style deal: 3) Seeking to join the EEA through the EFTA pillar and remaining in a customs union with the EU or a variation on this. 4. In addition to these policy choices about the UK’s future relationship, parliament could decide to hold a second referendum to allow the British people to decide either which kind of Brexit deal they want or whether they wish to remain in the EU. The committee, which is chaired by the Labour MP Hilary Benn, agreed the report by a majority. Four pro-Brexit members – the Tories Sir Christopher Chope, Craig Mackinlay, John Whittingdale and the DUP’s Sammy Wilson – voted against. The government has not yet said when, or how, MPs will get to hold the debate that must take place following the Commons decision to vote down Theresa May’s Brexit deal yesterday. But in response to a point of order after the vote last night, John Bercow, the Speaker, indicated he would do what he could to ensure that debates and votes do take place. He said: Of one thing I am sure: that which members wish to debate and which they determine shall be subject to a vote will be debated and voted upon. That seems to me to be so blindingly obvious that no sensible person would disagree with the proposition. If MPs want to debate and vote on a matter, that opportunity will, I am sure, unfold in the period ahead. Anyone who thought that the first no-confidence debate in the Commons for almost a quarter of a century was going to be a vintage occasion will have been disappointed – at least by the opening statements. Jeremy Corbyn’s speech was a little rambling and definitely not one of his best. Theresa May’s was not hugely better, although she did seem to be enjoying herself more than the opposition leader (bizarrely, in the circumstances, but who knows how the May psyche works). It did not generate big news, but there were some interesting lines. Here they are: May signalled she is not willing to consider keeping the UK in a customs union for good (which is a Labour demand) when she opens cross-party talks on a new approach to Brexit. When asked about this explicitly by Labour’s Yvette Cooper, May replied: What I want to see is what the British people voted for. They voted for an end to free movement, they voted for an independent trade policy, they voted to end the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. And it is incumbent on this parliament to ensure that we deliver on that. Being in the customs union would be incompatible with an independent trade policy, because the UK would not be free to strike its own trade deals. When the pro-European Tory Ken Clarke tackled her on the same issue, saying he had not met anyone who said they voted leave because they wanted to leave the customs union, May made a similar point. She said: When they were [voting in the EU referendum] I believe they did vote to ensure we continue to have a good trading relationship with our nearest neighbours in the EU but also to improve our trading relationships with others around the world. May was accused of being in denial about the extent of her difficulties over Brexit. Corbyn said the government was “not recognising the scale of the defeat they suffered last night”. Cooper said: “The problem is the prime minister seems to be talking as if she lost by 30 votes yesterday, not 230.” Labour’s Angela Eagle criticised May for “just repeating the lines to take that we have heard for the last five months ad nauseam” instead of accepting the need to change tack. And the SNP’s Pete Wishart said: She’s lost a quarter of her cabinet, 170 members of her backbench want her gone, she’s experienced the biggest defeat in parliamentary history - what shred of credibility has her government got left? For goodness’ sake, prime minister, won’t you just go? Corbyn revealed that, despite May saying she wants to hold cross-party talks with senior parliamentarians, she had not been in touch with him. He said: There has been no offer of all-party talks, there has been no communication on all-party talks – all the prime minister said was she might talk to some members of the house. That isn’t reaching out. Corbyn accused May of heading a “zombie government” and said any previous government would have resigned if it had lost as badly as May’s did last night. He said: Last week they lost a vote on the finance bill, that’s what’s called supply. Yesterday they lost by the biggest margin ever, that’s what’s regarded as confidence. By any convention of this house, by any precedence, loss of both confidence and supply should mean they do the right thing and resign … This government cannot govern and cannot command the support of parliament on the most important issue facing our country. Every previous prime minister in this situation would have resigned and called an election and it is the duty of this house to lead where the government has failed. May said holding an election was “not in the national interest”. She said: It would deepen division when we need unity, it would bring chaos when we need certainty, and it would bring delay when we need to move forward, so I believe this house should reject this motion. At this crucial moment in our nation’s history, a general election is simply not in the national interest. May criticised Corbyn’s record on security and said he would bring “national calamity” to the country if he became PM. She said: This is the leader of the party of Attlee, who called for the dismantling of Nato, the leader of the party of Bevan, who says Britain should unilaterally disarm herself and cross our fingers that others follow suit, the leader of the party that helped deliver the Belfast agreement, invited IRA terrorists into this parliament just weeks after their colleagues had murdered a member of this House. His leadership of the Labour party has been a betrayal of everything that party has stood for, a betrayal of the vast majority of its MPs and a betrayal of millions of decent and patriotic Labour voters. I look across the house and see backbench members who spent years serving their country in office in a Labour government, but I fear that today this is simply not a party that many of its own MPs joined. What he has done to his party is a national tragedy; what he would do to the country would be a national calamity. David Cameron, the former Conservative prime minister, has told the BBC he does not regret calling the EU referendum. He said: I do not regret calling the referendum. It was a promise I made two years before the 2015 general election, it was included in a manifesto, it was legislated for in parliament. Obviously I regret that we lost that referendum. I deeply regret that. I was leading the campaign to stay in the European Union and obviously I regret the difficulties and problems we have been having in trying to implement the result of that referendum. Cameron also said he backed Theresa May and he supported “her aim to have a partnership deal with Europe”. He continued: “That is what needs to be put in place. That is what parliament needs to try to deliver now.” David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, has told the Commons European scrutiny committee there would be “quite visible anger” among the public if the UK has not left the EU or begun a transition process to withdraw by April. He told the committee: I think we will see quite visible anger from the public at large, and not just those who might be counted as leavers. I have met quite a lot of erstwhile remainers who have said to me ‘I have changed my mind and next time I will vote leave’ or ‘Why is this proving such a difficult process?’ If they don’t see a delivery on the vote of 2016, it will be really serious indeed. Appearing before the Commons’ education committee this morning, Damian Hinds, the education secretary for England, said he might have to second civil servants to other departments for no-deal Brexit planning. Asked about no-deal planning, he said: There’s a broader cross-governmental question about making sure that if there were to be a no deal, that those functions that are truly mission-critical, in the very sharpest sense, that government is collectively able to deliver. And that does involve departments like ours being asked to see who if needed we could release on a temporary basis to support those other departments. Is there a risk of civil servants being taken out of the DfE to go to other departments? On a temporary basis, absolutely. That is the reality of no deal – across government we would have to find resources to be able to make sure that mission-critical things for people’s way of life, supply of food and medicines and so on, that those things are protected. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, has said that it is not “automatic” that Labour would back a second referendum if it fails to trigger a general election. Speaking at a conference in Westminster this morning held by Social Enterprise UK, she said “all options are on the table and that includes a peoples vote”, although only in the event the party cannot first force an election. Describing the party’s Brexit policy agreed at the party’s conference, she said Now, it wasn’t an automatic let’s go straight to a people’s vote. It was a determination to consider all of the options. There will be a lot of discussion after tonight about what happens next. Long-Bailey, who said Labour was still working for a “successful outcome” in tonight’s vote, said she could “completely understand” why supporters of a second referendum were angry after two years of “chaos” from the government. However, she insisted Labour still needed to look at other options before throwing its weight behind the people’s vote campaign. I think our position certainly hasn’t moved dramatically from respecting the referendum and wanting to exhaust all of the possibilities that are available to us. But equally I think we’ve got a duty to make sure that we don’t hurtle towards a no-deal Brexit. We’ve got to do everything in our power to stop that as well. What we want to see is a general election. Because it’s not just Brexit that’s an issue, and managing to have a government that’s in power who can negotiate productively with the EU and get a deal that would provide consensus. It’s also about dealing with all the other issues – the economic flaws that we currently see in our economy. Here is a Guardian graphic showing the timetable if Theresa May wins her confidence vote tonight (as everyone expects she will): And here is the timetable in the unlikely event of her losing: Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s prime minister, has denied having secret plans to introduce checks at the border with Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit, my colleague Lisa O’Carroll reports. The Scottish government is stepping up its preparations for a hard, no-deal Brexit, including a public information campaign and contingency plans to ensure medicines, food supplies and transport are protected, its Brexit minister has said. Mike Russell, the Scottish constitutional affairs secretary, told MSPs in an emergency statement at Holyrood his devolved government was poised to expand its rapid response team of civil servants preparing for a hard Brexit. A public information campaign was in the final stages of development, he added. He continued: We’re making initial decisions on issues such as medicine, medical devices and clinical consumables stockpiling, emergency transportation, support for supply chains, diversion of local produce and a host of other issues. All of this activity has become a significant focus of our resources and efforts, as it has to be for a responsible government. However, it remains something that the UK could and should choose to remove as a risk, and as a cost, today. I will post a summary from the opening of the debate shortly. After that I won’t be covering all the speeches, but I will post any highlights, as well as keeping up with all the other Brexit developments. May says a general election will not help the country find a solution to Brexit. And a Labour government would not help either, she says. She says the government is fighting injustices, And, as it leaves the EU, the country must raise its ambitions. She is proud of what the government has achieved. The government has the confidence of the country. Now it is asking for the confidence of MPs too, she says. And that is it. May has finished her speech. Labour’s Liam Byrne says May has built “a cage of red lines” around her Brexit policy. That led to her deal being rejected last night. May says she will talk to a range of MPs across the Commons to find what will secure their support. She says Byrne intervened just as she was getting to the point in her speech where she was going to talk about the economy. Byrne was the Labour Treasury who left a note for the Tories saying there as no money left. Byrne says he was leaving a note for his successor in accordance with a tradition going back to Churchill. He was proud to be part of a Labour Treasury team that stopped a depression, he says. He says the Tories backed Labour’s spending plans. And now, under the Tories, the debate has double. May says, when Russia launched a chemical weapons attack on the streets of Salisbury, she said Russia should be held to account. Corbyn wanted the nerve agent to be sent to Russia so Moscow could say whether or not it was responsible. On the issue of launching a strike against Syria, May says she was in favour. But Corbyn wanted Russia to have a veto. She says, as a backbencher, Corbyn invited IRA terrorists into the Commons after they had bombed the prime minister. And she says he has tolerated antisemitism in the Labour party. Peter Kyle, the Labour MP, says May is talking about engagement with MPs, but she want to court to stop the Commons having a say on triggering article 50. May says she has frequently come to the Commons to answer questions about her Brexit policy. May says the government is building a country that is fairer and that works for everyone. It will carry on doing that, acting in the national interest, she says. She says she wants to engage with opposition MPs on Brexit. The question is, will the Labour leadership rise to the occasion. She fears that they won’t, she says. She says Jeremy Corbyn is not showing leadership. All he is offering is vague aspirations, she says. She says last night Corbyn said it was important, not just to be against something, but to be for something too. But Corbyn did not say what. And on Sunday, when asked what he would campaign for in regard to Brexit at an election, Corbyn refused five times to say, she adds. My colleague Jessica Elgot thinks that after the confidence vote is over Theresa May may be able to exercise more leeway. May says people voted for Brexit because they felt people were not listening to them. That is why it is important to implement the result of the referendum, she says. Outside the chamber, No 10 has been even more specific about customs union membership being ruled out, my colleague Heather Stewart reports. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, says no one has told him they voted leave because they wanted to leave the customs union. Isn’t it the case that there is nowhere in the world where two close countries have open borders without some form of customs union? May says people voted for a close trading relationship with the EU. But they also wanted the UK to forge new trading links with other countries. (That is a way is signalling that she is opposed to staying in the customs union. If the Uk were to do that, it would not be able to strike its own trade deals.) Labour’s Angela Eagle says May is offering nothing new. She is just repeating the lines to take she has been using for months. May says she has a duty to implement the referendum result. Labour’s Yvette Cooper says May seems to be talking as if she lost by 30 votes, not by 230 votes. Is May saying she will rule out under any circumstances the UK joining a customs union? May says the government must deliver what people voted for. May quotes some Labour MPs who have urged her to reach out to the opposition. Given what they have said, it would be odd for them to vote for an election, she says. May says the Commons delivered a clear message last night. She repeats the points she made in her response to the vote in the chamber. Asked by the SNP’s Stewart McDonald which of her red lines she will change, May says she answered this earlier. (See 12.36pm.) McDonald says May is guilty of “robotic fantasy”. May says that, however good the government’s Brexit deal was, Corbyn would vote against it. And however bad the EU’s Brexit offer was, Corbyn would support it, she says. James Morris, a Conservative, asks May to rule out a second referendum. May says the country has had a referendum. There is no guarantee an election would deliver a majority for any course of action, she says. Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter, says he and May do not agree on Europe. But he says that when the vote is called, the whole of the European Research Group (the Brexiter faction that has opposed May’s Brexit policy) will be voting with her. Theresa May is responding now. MPs are being asked a simple question, she says. Should there be an election? But that would deepen divisions, she says. She says the people want MPs to get on with implementing Brexit. An election would prevent this. It would mean article 50 having to be extended, she says, and it would create uncertainty. Corbyn says, if Labour wins this debate, then there will be a wide-ranging debate about the future. But if the Commons does not pass this motion, then MPs should keep all options on the table. They should rule out no-deal, and the PM’s deal, which was roundly defeated yesterday. He says “every previous prime minister in this situation” would have resigned. MPs have a duty to pass the no-confidence motion, he says. And that’s it. Corbyn says a general election would bring new impetus to the Brexit talks. And it might bring new solutions for the problems faced by constituents, including low pay and the scandal of social care. And homelessness is a particular scandal, he says. The homeless are looking to parliament for a better solution. Corbyn says all MPs have a duty to call out abuse. Too many constituents have faced that since the toxic debate in the EU referendum. And the government’s hostile environment policy has not helped, he says. Corbyn says both the Tories and Labour fought the last election on manifestos promising to implement Brexit. But he says any government would be in a stronger position if it had a mandate for Brexit now. Anna Soubry, the Tory, says Corbyn is making some valid points – although he is not making them well. But why did a poll at the weekend show Labour six points behind. Was it because he is the most hopeless leader of the opposition there has ever been? Corbyn says he looks forward to testing public opinion at an election. Labour’s David Lammy asks Corbyn to confirm that Labour would rule out a no-deal Brexit. Corbyn says he has ruled it out. And he says Greg Clark, the business secretary, agrees. Corbyn attacks the government’s record on welfare. He says only yesterday it used the Brexit vote to sneak out pension changes that could cost some pensioners thousands of pounds. The government is not meeting its cancer and waiting time targets, he says. Corbyn says May’s party is “fundamentally split” on the issue of Brexit. That is why the government can no longer govern, he says. He says May shook her head yesterday when he said she had treated this as a party matter. But he says about half an hour after this happened the Tory MP Nick Boles said that is what May was doing. The Conservative MP George Freeman asks, when the cross-party talks happen, which Scarlet Pimpernel will turn up: the Labour leader who campaigns against Brexit in London and the south, or the Labour leader who campaigns for it in the north. Corbyn says the blame for this mess lies with May. The Tories say they want parliament to be sovereign. But when parliament objects, they do all they can to obstruct MPs from having a vote. Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem, asks Corbyn if he will support a people’s vote if he loses the confidence vote. Corbyn says Carmichael knows Labour’s policy. All options would be on the table. Labour’s Catherine West asks Corbyn if he has received a call from Theresa May inviting him to cross-party talks on Brexit. Corbyn says he has not had such a call. Corbyn confirms May has not invited him to cross-party talks on Brexit. Corbyn says it was shocking that the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq had to vote last night despite being heavily pregnant. Anna Soubry, a Conservative, makes a point of order. Was Siddiq offered a pair? John Bercow, the speaker, says his understanding was that Siddiq was offered a pair. But MPs have expressed their concern nonetheless, he says. (The row was about Siddiq not being able to vote by proxy. A proxy vote would have meant she was recorded as voting against. Pairing just means that someone on the other side abstains too, which would have meant Siddiq being recorded as not having voted. And Siddiq expressed reservations about pairing, because the Tories have broken pairing arrangements in the past.) Jeremy Corbyn is opening the no-confidence debate. He says last night the government lost the Brexit vote by more than 200 votes. No other government has lost a vote by that many. And last week the government lost a vote on the finance bill. He says any PM who loses a vote like this should resign. He says this is what happened in the past. When the Liberal government lost votes on Lloyd George’s budget in 1910, it went to the country. (Corbyn is using arguments fleshed out in this Guardian article by Emily Thornberry.) The SNP’s Pete Wishart asks what will Labour’s Brexit policy be if there is an election: will it be for Brexit or against? Corbyn says Labour is a democratic party. The party will decide. The most interesting question at Westminster today is that raised by Nicola Sturgeon earlier this morning (see 9.58am); in her cross-party talks with MPs about an alternative Brexit plan, is Theresa May willing to abandon any of her rigid red lines? To his credit, Jeremy Corbyn homed in on this in his very first question, and the topic was raised repeatedly by other MPs. (Or at least those who raised Brexit; it was surprising how many MPs seemed happy to stick with run-of-the-mill questions less than 24 hours after May broke all records for parliamentary humiliation.) As usual, instead of properly engaging with the red lines question, May instead stuck to parroting the most recent line-to-take in her memory, the text of the statement she delivered to MPs last night about wanting “constructive” talks while still honouring the result of the referendum. She would not address the question about whether she might now agree to the UK remaining in the customs union for good in any meaningful way, but her tone conveyed the clear impression that her lines remain almost as red as ever and that she is not seriously contemplating a departure from what she has already proposed. But on one issue, she did hint that she is having a rethink. Her response to Ken Clarke about extending article 50 (see 12.30am) implied that, if she is not exactly keen on extending article 50, she is at least less hostile to the idea than she was. (Some people assume that extending article 50 would automatically amount to a move in the direction of a softer Brexit, but that is not necessarily the case; she might want to extend it just to allow more time for no-deal preparations.) Corbyn was probably at his best when he asked about Brexit. He quite successfully exposed the hollowness of May’s offer on cross-party talks. After that, he asked about poverty and other domestic policy issues, achieving some fairly easy hits but without saying anything especially memorable. The real debate about May’s domestic record will probably start shortly. Sarah Wollaston, the Tory pro-European, asks May to back a second referendum. May says MPs must accept the referendum result. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, welcomes May’s offer of cross-party talks. He says, as a former coalition colleague, May knows the Lib Dems will work with others in the national interest. But May should not even lift up the phone unless she is willing to rule out a no-deal Brexit and have constructive conversation about a people’s vote. May says the way to avoid no deal is to back a deal. And she says some MPs are unwilling to hold constructive talks with her. Labour’s Ian Lucas asks about the proposed Hitachi nuclear power station in north Wales in relation to her meeting with the Japanese PM last week. May says she did raise this topic. But it is for the company to make a commercial decision about whether or not to go ahead, she says. The Conservative Nicky Morgan asks May if she agrees that all MPs need to maintain maximum flexibility as they look for an alternative Brexit solution. May says she will approach the talks in a constructive spirit. But it is important to honour the referendum result, she says. Labour’s Ronnie Campbell says a recent survey said 4 million workers were living in poverty. Will May call a general election? May repeats the point about the number of people in absolute poverty being at a record low. The SNP’s Stewart McDonald asks May which of her red lines she is willing to give up. May says she will approach these talks in a constructive spirit. But the government has to deliver on the result of the referendum, she says. Phillip Lee, a Conservative pro-Euroepan who resigned as a minister because he opposed May’s deal, asks May if she accepts that she may now have to change her mind about her Brexit plan. May says she will be talking to a wide range of MPs. Labour’s Yasmin Qureshi asks about the drug primodos, and research showing it caused deformities. May says a minister is leading a review looking at what impact it had. That study will be considered very carefully. Tracey Crouch, a Conservative, asks about apprentices. May says she has met many young people who say that is the right approach for them. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, says he listened to many hours of the Brexit debate. He says the only proposals for which there was majority support were rejecting no deal, extending article 50, and some form of customs union with the EU. Just as he has had to accept the need to leave the EU, will May accept the need to modify her red lines too? May says it is because there are so many views that she is holding discussions with MPs. She says article 50 cannot be extended by the UK on its own. The EU would extend article 50 only if there were a plan moving towards a deal, she says. May appears to soften her opposition to extending article 50. When asked about this in the past, she has said the UK will leave on 29 March, but today she sounded open to the prospect of extending. For that to happen there would have to be agreement in the Commons on an alternative plan, she said. Labour’s Roberta Blackman-Woods asks about health inequalities. People in Durham have worse outcomes than people in Windsor. So why is spending on public health being cut? May says the public health budget will be decided in the spending review. But it is not just the public health budget that affects people’s health. Helen Grant, a Conservative, asks May if she agrees that if MPs fail to deliver on the referendum the public perception of politicians will be at an all-time low. May says she agrees. “We need to deliver Brexit for the British people.” Labour’s Seema Malhotra says last night May said she would hold talks with MPs in a constructive spirit. But now it seems she just wants to invite them in to tell them her deal is best. Is she prepared to change any of her red lines? Mays says she will meet with parliamentarians, and look to see what can get the support of the house. But what this house must have in mind is the importance of delivering on the referendum result. Trudy Harrison, a Conservative, asks May if she will meet with workers from the nuclear power plant in Copeland. May says she is aware of how important the nuclear industry is in Cumbria. She suggests Harrison meets with a business minister. Labour’s Peter Kyle says May’s defeat yesterday was historic and Titanic. Everything has changed, and May must change too. If May is not going to give people the power to have a say over this deal, then what has become of her promise to empower people. May says people voted to leave the EU in 2016. She thinks the government, and parliament, have a duty to deliver on that. Jeremy Lefroy, a Conservative, says the government has committed vast amounts of money to the NHS. But can May look at how money is allocated to CCGs [clinical commissioning groups]. May says changes have been made to the CCG allocations for 2019-20. Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, said yesterday the attorney general said any new deal would be much the same as the old one. Will she admit that plan B will be much the same as plan A? May says she wants to hold talks with parliamentarians to find out what will get the support of the house. But she repeats the point about honouring the result of the referendum. Blackford says May has failed. It is an omnishambles. Westminster may have failed, but Scotland is united. She says the PM must seek the confidence of the people. May should extend article 50 and ask the people if they want her deal or remain. She should legislate for a people’s vote. May says the Commons legislated for a people’s vote in 2016. Robert Goodwill, a Conservative, asks about the ”northern powerhouse”, and company selling exports to China. May says she has met this company. She cannot talk about its China contract, but this is what the northern powerhouse is about. Corbyn says May knows his Brexit policy – he wants a customs union with the EU. One of the problems with the government is its disregard for statistics. There are 21,000 fewer police officers. When May was home secretary, she would not accept police cuts had an impact on crime. Will she admit she got it wrong? May defends her Home Office record. Corbyn only talks about money, she says. What matters also is what powers the police get. She says Corbyn consistently voted against more powers for the police. Corbyn says a Labour government properly funded the police. Ask people if they feel safer now. We know that the answer will be, she says. He rattles of a list of areas where the government is failing, and it has failed on the most important issue, Brexit. Every previous PM would have resigned after last night’s defeat. May says Corbyn has been calling for an election for weeks. Yet on Sunday, when asked if he would campaign to leave the EU in an election campaign, Corbyn refused to answer. He has let antisemitism run riot in his party. He would abandon our allies and wreck the economy. We will never let that happen, she says. Corbyn says the Commons rejected May’s deal. Can’t she understand she needs to come up with something else? But it is not just on Brexit she is failing. Poverty is rising. When will it fall while she is in office? May says there are 1 million fewer people in absolute poverty, and 300,000 fewer children in absolute poverty. Labour would spend £1,000bn more, she says. Corbyn says May is in denial on a customs union, in denial on no deal, in denial on the amount of money spent on no-deal planning, and on poverty ... At this point Tory MPs jeer. Corbyn says this is significant. “Tell that to people queuing up at food banks,” he says. What is May’s greatest failure, he asks, listing various education policy problems. May says this is a government delivering on education. She says Corbyn has consistently failed to set out what his Brexit policy is. Jeremy Corbyn starts by saying he needs to correct the record. Last night he said this was the largest government defeat since the 1920s. In fact, it is the largest defeat in our democratic history. Is May ruling out the UK staying in the customs union in her cross-party talks? May says she wants to leave the EU in a way that respects the votes of the people in the referendum. That means ending free movement, getting control of laws and money, and having a good relationship with the EU. Corbyn asks May to confirm that we can’t have a no-deal Brexit. Greg Clark, the business secretary, said that in a call with business leaders yesterday, he says. May says she does not want a no-deal Brexit. MPs can avoid no deal by voting for a deal, she says. Charlie Elphicke, a Conservative, says he believes in more jobs, lower taxes and stronger services. Does May agree the Conservatives have delivered that? (I think we’re getting a preview of the no-confidence debate.) May says we have seen 3.4 million more people in work under the Tories. Under Jeremy Corbyn there would be more borrowing, more taxes and fewer jobs. Theresa May starts by condemning the Nairobi attack. PMQs is about to start. I normally post a snap verdict straight after the May/Corbyn exchanges, but today I will do it at the end of the session, because May v the Commons as a whole is probably more interesting. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question: The first ministers of Scotland and Wales, Nicola Sturgeon and Mark Drakeford, have urged Theresa May for an urgent meeting in an effort to jointly agree a way out of the Brexit impasse. As she arrived at Westminster to meet Scottish National party MPs, Sturgeon released a letter she had sent May, calling for the prime minister to host a joint ministerial committee involving all four of the UK’s governments (although Northern Ireland would be represented by UK civil servants since Stormont’s power-sharing government is suspended). Sturgeon said Drakeford was also calling on May to arrange a JMC, and told May: Your government has now clearly failed to bring the country together in support of your proposed deal. It is time to recognise that reality and change course, starting with a new approach which seeks to find a way forward by genuinely involving the four nations of the UK. Up until now, despite stated intentions, the UK government has taken little or no account of the views of the people of Scotland or the position of the Scottish government. [It] is important, contrary to our experience of the past two and a half years, that such a meeting must be more than window dressing. Urgent and meaningful discussions are needed in the next days to agree a way forward which can command a majority in the House of Commons, and which has the confidence and support of the devolved administrations. The Scottish government believes that the best way of resolving the current impasse is to negotiate an extension to the article 50 period and hold a second EU referendum. Given the rejection of your deal we will now be intensifying work towards the achievement of that aim. Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader, and Michael Gove, the environment secretary, will close the no-confidence debate tonight. Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May will open it, obviously. Seventy-one Labour MPs and 13 MEPs have signed a public statement calling for a second referendum on Brexit. They argue it is time for the party to commit to a second referendum and that a Brexit renegotiation, which at the moment is what Jeremy Corbyn is proposing, is “not a realistic prospect”. Here is an extract from the statement. We represent hugely diverse constituencies from the north to the south, from Wales to Scotland. Many of our constituencies voted to leave in 2016. We must listen to and respond to the reasons why people did so. But we now face a moment of national crisis, where the facts and the views of many people have changed – and are continuing to change. It is now clear renegotiation is not a realistic prospect. No deal would be a catastrophe which we must resolutely oppose. The government should seek an extension to article 50 to provide time for parliament to find a way forward. Theresa May has failed to bring this country back together. Labour’s conference adopted a clear policy for this situation. We must try and remove this government from office as soon as possible. But the removal of the government and pushing for a general election may prove impossible, so we must join trade unions, our members and a majority of our constituents by then unequivocally backing the only logical option to help our country move forward: putting the decision back to the people for a final say, in a public vote, with the option to stay and keep the deal that we have. Defeat of the Tory deal in a public vote would give us all a chance to campaign for the anti-austerity policies and a Labour government that deals with the true causes of the Brexit vote, and a reformed Europe that works for all people. The organisers say another 24 Labour MPs have publicly backed a second referendum, but haven’t signed today’s statement for administrative reasons. Here is a full list of the MPs and MEPs who have signed the statement. The initiative is intended to put pressure on Corbyn to commit the party to back a second referendum. Under the carefully negotiated compromise position agreed at party conference, the party is committed to calling for a general election first, with “all options remaining on the table” if an election does not happen, “including campaigning for a public vote”. Campaigners for a “people’s vote” believe that, if the government wins the no-confidence vote tonight, Corbyn will no longer have any reason not to back a second referendum, although Corbyn has serious reservations about this approach and he does not seem keen to commit the party to backing second referendum legislation in any great hurry. Speaking to the Guardian, the Greek MEP Stelios Koulouglou said Theresa May’s humiliating defeat last night highlighted the extent to which Britain had become a case study in the perils of nationalist demagogy. He said: It has become a case study of how nationalist demagogy can destroy a country. It will be taught in universities. It is dreadful to see what is happening. While insisting there was no desire whatsoever in Brussels for concessions, Koulouglou did not exclude Britain’s exit from the EU being extended. “Nobody wants to change the content of the agreement,” said the MEP, who represents Athen’s ruling leftist party Syriza. “There is absolutely no chance of that happening but there would be a will to extend the withdrawal if it meant avoiding the chaos of a disorderly Brexit.” The Greek media have watched the tortuous Brexit negotiations with dismay after its own near-brush with Grexit and today there is rare agreement that Britain has entered unchartered waters. “There is astonishment that a democracy as old as Britain has got itself into such a dead-end,” the prominent commentator told the Guardian. It’s the sort of mess that Greece would get into. The feeling across the media, with the exception of the eurosceptic press, is that London should reconsider other options, like putting the whole idea on hold. The Syntaktwn paper, which often reflects the views of prime minister Alexis Tsipras’s government, predicted that, while May would probably survive tonight’s confidence vote, the most likely scenario was an extension of the country’s exit date until July “in order to give London more time”. The conservative Kathimerini, in particularly pessimistic mood, said the prospect of an alternative solution for the UK was far from optimistic. Citing last night’s European parliament reaction to May’s humiliating defeat, it underlined the dangers of a disorderly Brexit. Here is Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, with her MPs outside the Houses of Parliament. Mairead McGuinness, the vice-president of the European parliament, has said it would be wrong to start blaming Ireland’s insistence on the backstop for Theresa May’s historic defeat. “We must not allow a narrative to evolve that this is an Irish problem and can be resolved by the backstop [being removed],” she told the Irish radio station Shannonside after chairing a debate in the parliament on Thursday morning. McGuinness, who is an Irish MEP, said it was not up to the EU to “decipher” what deal can emerge from a House of Commons riven with “hard Brexiters and ardent remainers and those in between”. In the radio interview, she said would not take lessons on the backstop from the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, a man who had power but refused to use it to help seal a Brexit deal. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, is to meet Scottish National party MPs in London later as they sketch out their tactics after May’s crushing defeat in the Commons, with the first minister urging May to extend article 50. Sturgeon tweeted earlier this morning she was travelling down from Edinburgh in advance of tonight’s confidence vote at Westminster, where the SNP will vote against May. (See 9.58am.) The prime minister called her on Tuesday evening after her Brexit deal was voted down, but it appears neither is shifting ground. Sturgeon has reiterated her demands for a second Brexit referendum – a proposal the SNP now formally backs after some prevarication, but also said the crisis at Westminster underscored the case for independence. The first minister’s trip to London is very largely presentational: the SNP’s position on Brexit has been fixed for some months and, unlike Labour and the Tories, there are no open splits on policy or tactics in her Westminster group that require Sturgeon’s hands-on involvement. And in keeping with the febrile atmosphere dominating UK politics, the Brexit crisis allows Sturgeon to shift the focus in Scotland away from her own deeply damaging crisis: the controversy over her government’s handling of the sexual harassment claims against Alex Salmond. Party sources acknowledge privately that the domestic crisis has knocked Sturgeon’s plan to capitalise on Brexit to reinvigorate the independence questions off course. And, talking about bills, the full text of Nick Boles’s EU withdrawal (number 2) bill has been published. It is also backed by fellow Tories Nicky Morgan and Sir Oliver Letwin, Labour’s Liz Kendall, Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn, and the Lib Dem Norman Lamb. You can read it here (pdf). Under the bill, if the Commons fails to pass a Brexit deal by 11 February, the Commons liaison committee would be asked to come up with an alternative plan by 5 March, to be put to a vote by 7 March. And if that plan were voted down, the government would then be obliged to ask the EU to extend article 50 until the end of the year. This is designed to ensure that there could be no no-deal Brexit in 2019. Speaking about the bill on the Today programme this morning, Letwin said it was important to come up with a plan acceptable to a majority of MPs and acceptable to the EU. He explained: There is no point in us discussing unicorns which are items that live in fanciful forests. We have to discuss real objects. He also criticised Theresa May for laying down firm red lines at the start of the Brexit process. He said: [May] put down right at the beginning of this process what she called red lines. This is not a terrain in which you can have things you will definitely never do. You have to sit down and talk and come up with a consensus. That means being much more flexible than we have been so far. As well as the no-confidence motion in the government, something else has been tabled for the Commons today – two new bills by ever-busy Conservative backbencher Dominic Grieve seeking to bring about a second Brexit referendum. The bills from the former attorney general call for “preparations for a referendum about the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union” and provide for that referendum to happen. Last week, Grieve joined with the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, and the Labour MP Chuka Ummuna in publishing draft legislation on a referendum. While Grieve last week successfully had his amendment passed to shorten the time in which May has to update MPs after losing the vote on her deal, these bills have no chance of success without official support – which is showing no signs of happening yet. Writing in the Evening Standard on Tuesday, before May lost her vote, Grieve said: As a strong believer that Brexit is a very damaging mistake that becomes more obvious every day, I see sound democratic reasons for asking the electorate to confirm what it wants to do. But in doing so I entirely accept that if the choice is to leave the EU then we must do so, and both choices are now implementable. Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister and deputy chair of the European Research Group, which represents Conservatives pushing for a harder Brexit, has drafted a statement that he thinks Theresa May should make to parliament. Under the EU Withdrawal Act, now that May has lost a vote on her deal, she is obliged to return to the Commons to say what will happen next. Here is a press notice (pdf) summarising the proposed Baker draft, and here is the full document (pdf). The statement has also been signed by 21 other Brexiter Tory MPs. Under his plan, the UK would commit to leaving the EU on 29 March and step up planning for a no-deal Brexit, while simultaneously, as an alternative, offering the EU (effectively on a take-it-or-leave-it basis) the legal text for an EU-UK free trade deal, including a customs facilitation agreement as an alternative to the backstop. Baker said: The Commons rejection of the withdrawal agreement and political declaration is a great opportunity to aim for a better deal that respects the referendum result and is focused on the UK’s trading priorities. We will offer the EU a better deal and we will be ready to trade on WTO terms with the EU if they decline. If we leave on WTO terms, we will no longer be faced with handing over £39bn for little in return, seeing our United Kingdom broken apart or being forced to follow EU laws with no say. This document sets out a firm plan to take up the EU’s March offer of a best-in-class trade agreement respecting UK priorities, the EU’s legal order and allowing the UK to develop a truly independent trade and domestic regulatory policy. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, is coming to London today for Brexit talks, she says. She has also posted a Tweet approving a point made by the Scottish journalist Kirsty Strickland. At the moment it is not obvious that Theresa May will be willing to abandon her red lines. As Politico Europe reports, asked what principles would govern her approach to these cross-party talks, May’s spokesman told journalists: We want to deliver an orderly Brexit with a deal. One that protects our union, gives us control of our borders, laws and money, and means we have an independent trade policy. It’s for others to set out their positions — but we want to identify what would be required to secure the backing of the house, consistent with what we believe to be the result of the referendum. That does sound like a restatement of the red lines, only in slightly fuzzier terms than declared previously. The reference to a new approach being consistent with the result of the referendum implies that May will continue to rule out a second referendum. It also suggests May would have objections to a plan to keep the UK in the customs union for good - because that would stop the UK being able to strike its own trade deals. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, was on ITV’s Good Morning Britain this morning. He said he thought parliament would not allow Brexit to happen on 29 March. He said: These are extraordinary circumstances. What you have got, probably for the first in the history of our nation, is a parliament that refuses point blank to accept the will of the people. We voted for Brexit, we backed it up in a general election the following year and a majority of the House of Commons don’t want it. Under the legislation, 500 MPs voted for article 50. It said explicitly if we don’t get a withdrawal agreement, we just leave on 29 March. That was backed up by the Referendum Act that just said we leave on 29 March. However, let me be honest with you, I do not believe that Mr Bercow as speaker and our parliament will allow it to happen. If you want my prediction, I believe the article 50 leaving date will be extended. He also said it was “bizarre” that Theresa May had not resigned. It is absolutely bizarre … the rest of the world is looking on with incredulity at what they think is a great country being led so badly, in such a shambolic way. It’s not good for our standing in the world, it’s not good for investment into Britain. We need a resolution, there is a way out. It is the legislation, we should leave on 29 March. Here is a Guardian Opinion panel on what should happen next in the Brexit crisis, with contributions from Matthew d’Ancona, Katy Balls, Aditya Chakrabortty and Gaby Hinsliff. Ireland would not object if Britain asked for an extension to article 50, the deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, told RTE. He also brushed aside comments caught on mic on an off-guard moment last night in which he warned a fellow politician not to talk about potential checks at the border in the event of no deal for fear of a backlash. “We need to hold our nerve this week,” he told RTE’s Morning Ireland. The ratification “didn’t go well, clearly.” We will have to wait and see. There is an onus on the British parliament and the British government to propose an alternative that is viable if we are going to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Asked about the gaffe by Shane Ross, the transport minister, at yesterday evening’s no-deal contingency planning briefing by the government, when Ross said he anticipated checks on lorries coming from Scotland across the border into Ireland, Coveney said Ross had meant that there would be “minimal checks” and these could be done at sea. In a private conversation with his transport minister caught on tape when he thought his mic was off, Coveney indicated ministers should not talk about the potential for border checks. He told Shane Ross: Once you start talking about checks anywhere near the Border, people will start delving into that and all of a sudden we’ll be the government that reintroduced a physical border on the island of Ireland. Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. The Andrea Leadsom Today programme interview, in which she played down the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn being included in the cross-party talks on an alternative Brexit plan that Theresa May is planning, does not seem to have gone down well. Here is some political reaction. From Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader: From Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the Commons home affairs committee (and exactly the sort of senior parliamentarian that May seemed to have in mind when she announced her plan for cross-party talks): And this is from Lucy Powell, another senior Labour MP: From the Labour party: And here is some comment from journalists. From the BBC’s Norman Smith: From the Daily Mirror’s Pippa Crerar From the Guardian’s Jessica Elgot The leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, has defended the government’s failure to discuss a compromise plan with Labour’s frontbench. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 Today programme, she said: The government has been collaborating across the house ever since the beginning of this parliament. It simply isn’t the case that the government isn’t engaging with senior parliamentarians. Asked why the prime minister had not spoken to Jeremy Corbyn about a compromise, Leadsom said: “She will be speaking with senior parliamentarians.” She also played down the prospect of Theresa May including Jeremy Corbyn when she reaches out to opposition MPs to discuss a possible way forward. She added: Jeremy Corbyn had the opportunity yesterday to put to the house exactly what his alternative proposals were. He clearly has none. He needs to come to the table and tell us what he wants to do. The country wants to know what the Labour party is actually proposing. Leadsom plays down prospect of May including Corbyn in her planned cross-party talks on an alternative approach to Brexit. Leadsom insisted that the withdrawal deal that was defeated last night remained the best “basis” for a way to avoid a no deal. And she claimed the government would not be seeking to delay or revoke article 50. Leadsom said: I have struggled with the prime minister’s deal but ultimately it is a deal that balances the various interests, the country has been divided on it but leaving the EU we have to deliver on that. And the prime minister has shown her determination to do that. She added that the legal default position is that we leave in March without a deal so it is “vitally important” that we put a deal in place Leadsom also insisted that whatever compromise was reached would not “not necessarily” involve a softer Brexit. Leadsom rejects claims government defeat inevitably makes softer Brexit more likely. Barnier added: It is up to the British authorities to indicate how we can take things forward towards an orderly withdrawal. The agreement that we reached with the British government is a good agreement. It is the best possible compromise. Protecting the rights of citizens will continue to be the priority whatever the outcome. The backstop must remain a credible backstop. An orderly withdrawal must remain our absolute priority. The scenario we have always wanted to avoid is a no deal. We are stepping up our preparations for that contingency. The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier has insisted that the Irish backstop must remain credible in any Brexit deal. Speaking in the European parliament in Strasbourg, he said “we regret profoundly” the Commons vote on Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement after two years of negotiation “based on the red lines of the British government”. Nathalie Loiseau, the Europe minister, told France Inter this morning: It’s bad news, because this withdrawal agreement negotiated for nearly two years is a good agreement and the only agreement possible. It’s for the British to decide what they want. We see there is no majority for this agreement, but we don’t know what there IS a majority for… they want to leave the European Union to do what? Asked why leaving the EU was proving so difficult, Loiseau said: “A certain number of British, including British politicians, didn’t realise what being a member of the EU meant.” She added that there had been “massive disinformation” during the referendum campaign. Can the agreement be renegotiated? The text cannot be reopened especially after we’ve gone 17 months with all the coming and going. It’s been one third of my work since I became minister, which is a bit excessive, and we have other things to do in Europe than busy ourselves with a divorce. She added: “Nobody thinks a no deal is a good situation, but we are preparing for that”, but warned: “We aren’t going to unknit the European Union because the UK wants to leave.” Sophie in ‘t Veld, a deputy leader of the liberal group in the European parliament, is sticking to the Brussels line that this crisis is for the UK to sort out. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she said: We got a lot of questions last night saying ‘what is the EU going to do now?’. Well, all the options have been on the table, it is for the UK now to decide what to do. I would strongly recommend all the parties to come together and unite in the interest of the UK. Asked if she would prefer if the UK remained in the EU, she said: We never wanted the UK to leave, so if they come to that conclusion then we will be very happy, but it is not for us to say, it is for the British people to say. But it will have to be a realistic, a workable solution, one that is taking into account the current arrangements within the EU, the Good Friday agreement, and the rights of citizens – the 3.5m Europeans living in the UK and the 1.5 million British people living in the EU 27. Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, says the ball is in Britain’s court to bring clarity to the chaos. “The MPs of the lower house have not made it known what they want, only what they don’t want,” he told the broadcaster Deutschlandfunk this morning. “That is not enough,” he said. He added he did not support the idea of renegotiating the deal, saying that many compromises had already been made by both sides. “If one had been able to offer more, we would have had to do that weeks ago.” He said the German government would follow closely the vote of confidence in Theresa May, but her fall would make the situation only more complicated. “For the negotiations we need a stable government,” he said. Extending article 50 would be complicated in the light of upcoming European elections, he said, and anyway, an extension would require a clear idea as to what London wanted. “It will only make sense if there’s a way which has as its goal to reach a deal between the EU and Britain and at the moment there’s not a majority viewpoint in the British parliament”. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has again ducked the question of whether the Labour frontbench will back a second referendum. He insisted it was for Labour’s membership to decide. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said: “If we secured a general election, our party then would have to decision about what goes into the manifesto. There is strong support that if there is an impasse we go back to the people. Our preference is a general election, if we get, there is also that view that there should be another referendum. “”My view is that it will be decided by the democratic wishes of our party members. The options will be: we put forward our own proposals on a deal, or you put forward those plus the possibility of a referendum. “What went through our Labour party conference last year was: seek to get a deal that protects jobs and the economy, if you can’t do that, then it’s a referendum to ask people to think again. I think if we do move to a general election that that the sort of debate that we will have.” McDonnell insisted a compromise deal could be reached with the government. My own view is that Theresa May could sort this now. If she had a real discussion, a real approach to compromise bring all the parties together I think there could be a compromise most probably on the basis of what Labour is advocating. But the problem that she’s got is that I don’t think people have any faith in her anymore to deliver that. Clearly extending article 50 is now on the agenda but that is for the government to decide. He appeared to concede that it was unlikely that the government would lose today’s confidence vote. “People don’t expect us to win that, but who can tell?” He added: If that goes down, parliament really has to take a strong role ... proper negotiations and discussions to see if there is a compromise that can be reached. Theresa May has said she is willing to enter into those discussions, but she hasn’t said she is willing to enter into them with Jeremy Corbyn. She has not contacted us. We haven’t been invited into those discussions yet. Then she’s set conditions, she’s ruling out by the looks of it a customs union which most of the opposition parties support. We believe we should have a permanent customs union. The relationship with the single market should be a close and collaborative relationship. That’s it from me, I’m handing over to my colleague Matthew Weaver now. Thanks for reading and tweeting, keeping following for updates. A few more front pages coming in from readers and I think Frankfurter Rundschau may be my favourite so far... The Labour MP Chuka Umunna has been on Good Morning Britain, arguing that Britain needs to get more time to “prevent ourselves falling off a cliff”. He says if the no-confidence motion fails today, Labour should immediately back calls for a second referendum, though as Piers Morgan points out, this is going to be difficult given “Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t want to do that”. Thanks for those tweeting in with Brexit headlines from newspapers around the world. We’ve got headlines in from media outlets in Israel, Bulgaria and China, so far. Keep them coming! Quite a few questions and witticisms coming in about the fact that also on the parliamentary agenda today is a 10-minute motion on the prohibition of low-level letter boxes. There is some irony in this issue being debated today, as this is about trying to get European standards to be added to UK Building Regulations. European standards require letterboxes to be between 70cm and 1.7m from the ground, thus reducing the risk of back injuries and risk of dog bite for postmen and women. The Communications Union have this summary of the issue, which they say they have been trying to get change on for years. The Communications Workers Union has been campaigning to outlaw low level letterboxes for many years. The CWU has been striving for the European Standard (EN13724) to be added to UK Building Regulations – this requires that letterboxes should be positioned at a suitably accessible height, accessible to postal delivery workers, significantly reducing possible injuries such as, dog bites, fingers being trapped or back strain caused when bending excessively to reach ground level boxes... The problem with low level letter boxes is that back injuries to postmen and women occur each year in Royal Mail and delivering to low level letter boxes at the base of a house front door forces postal staff to stoop to ground level repetitively to deliver mail items which can cause or exacerbate back strain and back conditions. Low level letter boxes also present an increased risk of dog bites when the mail is pushed through the aperture at ground level and fingers get trapped. In 2002 the European Standard EN 13724 was introduced and states that for “ergonomic and safety reasons” the centre line of the letter box aperture should be at a height between 700 mm (2ft 3.5 inches) and 1700mm (5ft 7inches). For some reason, the debate about car production in Solihull, currently slated for after the no-confidence vote, hasn’t generated quite the same interest as the letter boxes, though there are some who are keen. I am very interested to see how the news of the Brexit deal defeat was covered in newspapers around the world, so tweet me (@mskatelyons) with photos or screenshots of the front pages from wherever you’re reading from (and with English translations if you can!). Here are a few from around Europe. I’d like to particularly draw your attention to the headline on the dispatch from London by the reporter for Le Monde, whose story is headlined: “At St Stephen’s Tavern, shouts of victory, lukewarm beer and uncertainty for pro-Europeans”. Some stereotypes never die. Writing in the Spanish daily El País, Lluís Bassets warned that Tuesday’s vote had been far from decisive, despite the scale of May’s defeat. “To the misfortune of the British, and perhaps also the Europeans, this Tuesday was a historic day that does not preclude more historic days, all accompanied by the tragic storm clouds that tend to shadow history,” he wrote. Bassets said “the great shredding machine that is Brexit” was still hard at work, “fed by uncertainty, bitterness and rancour – the three dismal feelings that May evoked in her defeat speech, and the three evil spirits that only grow with each day that Brexit remains unresolved”. El Mundo’s main headline on Wednesday morning was equally gloomy: “A humiliating defeat for May leaves Brexit in limbo”. In an editorial, the rightwing ABC said that as neither May nor parliament had shown themselves capable of dealing with the crisis, the matter should be put to the people once more. It seems clear that the moment has arrived to put the decision in the hands of the people, and the most sensible thing to do would be hold another referendum just as voters get to grips with the true arguments rather than just the nationalist-populist propaganda of the pro-Brexit lobby. The online paper eldiario.es noticed that Michael Gove had invoked the famous Game of Thrones line, “Winter is coming”. “He was one of the heavyweights in the party that had the most influence in the Brexit referendum,” wrote Iñigo Sáenz de Ugarte. Gove and others like him brought winter to British politics and are now horrified at how cold things have got. Too cold for their fellow countrymen. Dominic Grieve, former attorney-general and advocate of a second referendum, will present two bills to parliament tomorrow regarding another referendum on the subject of “the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union”. This will happen after urgent questions and before business of the House and before business of the House and the vote on the no-confidence motion. Today’s papers are grim reading for the prime minister, variously describing her defeat as “historic”, “crushing” and “humiliating”. The Sun has gone all-out, delivering a classic. “Brextinct”, is its headline and they have pasted May’s face on to a dodo. The Guardian features a rare picture of the no lobby, which is packed with MPs walking through it to vote against May’s Brexit deal. The headline is “May suffers historic defeat as Tories turn against her” The Daily Mirror focuses on the no-confidence motion launched by Jeremy Corbyn, with the splash headline: “No deal, no hope, no clue, no confidence.” “A complete humiliation,” says the Telegraph. “May suffers historic defeat,” says the Times. “Dismay,” says the Express. “May’s Brexit deal crushed by Commons,” says the FT. “Historic humiliation,” says the i and “Crushed,” says the Scotsman. Even the paper most often in May’s corner, the Daily Mail, can only manage “Fighting for her life,” which does not bode well for the PM. In case you’re wondering what the former prime minister of Australia Tony Abbott thinks of the day’s Brexit events, he has tweeted to let you know, asking “What’s wrong with no deal?” The self-described Anglophile, who studied at Oxford and began his own downfall in Australian public opinion by reinstating the knighthood system in Australia, also posted a link to his Spectator piece on the subject. The article was published just after Christmas and was the magazine’s fourth most-read story of the year, and in it he argues that a no-deal Brexit is the way to go, saying that “if Europe knows what’s in its own best interests”, it would maintain entirely free trade and full mutual recognition of standards right across Europe and offer protection to British citizens living in Europe, if the UK makes similar overtures to the EU. The current prime minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, said the vote against May’s Brexit deal highlighted global uncertainty. “It does highlight the impacts of global uncertainty in the economy,” he told Sky News Australia. “We are already seeing some real tensions when it comes to trade. In 2019, the global economy is facing more uncertainty than it was this time last year.” There you go, the view from Down Under. How did the markets react? The comprehensive defeat of Theresa May’s Brexit vision subdued markets in Asia, with sterling expected to remain volatile until the result of Wednesday’s no-confidence vote in the prime minister is known. Sterling sunk to trading at $1.2855 on the dollar early on Wednesday, having steadied after a tumultuous overnight session. May’s crushing loss on Tuesday night and looming no-confidence vote triggered political upheaval that meant investors paused to assess their next options, putting pressure on UK-focused exchange-traded funds. A Tokyo-traded FTSE 100 ETF was down about one percent on Wednesday. “While the margin of May’s loss was a surprise, the defeat itself was something the market had been pricing in for a long time and it appears that participants covered shorts in the pound after the vote,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities. Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog. Well, the news just keeps on coming. After a crushing, humiliating, historic (pick your adjective, all of them were used on the papers’ front pages today) defeat for May in the “meaningful” vote on her Brexit deal yesterday, she is gearing up for the next challenge: a vote of no confidence, which will be held this afternoon. The vote will take place sometime this afternoon, after a ten minute rule motion on the subject of low-level letter boxes and before an adjournment debate on car production in Solihull. By that time, Andrew Sparrow will be back with you, carefully guiding you through the day’s political news. But for the next few hours, I’ll be bringing you news and updates as they come in. Feel free to get in touch via email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com) or on Twitter. Thanks for following along.

Think again, 22 September) presents a misleading impression of the alternatives to Hinkley Point C while ignoring the strengths of the project. Germany is not, as you suggest, a model that Britain should follow. It is true the country generates more electricity from renewables. But German consumers pay higher bills and the country produces more CO2 emissions as it continues to burn lignite, the most polluting fossil fuel of all. It is also forced to dump surplus electricity it can’t use. And far from being a debacle, Sizewell B, the last nuclear power station to be built in Britain, should be heralded as a success. It has been good value for consumers, with electricity generated at a low cost. If the UK had continued with its new nuclear programme, despite the gas price slump of the 1980s, we would now have a modern, efficient fleet producing low-carbon power at low prices. We support the development of alternative nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors, but they won’t be ready for many years. Hinkley Point C will be ready when it is needed to plug Britain’s energy gap. Hinkley Point C is good value for money. It is misleading to compare the price charged in the mid-2020s, when Hinkley will be competitive with other forms of generation, with today’s energy prices. Having new nuclear in the future energy mix will save consumers around 10% on consumer electricity bills compared to a low-carbon mix without it. Nuclear is affordable, reliable and low-carbon. It would be a shame if selective arguments were permitted to blur the bigger picture. Keith Parker Chief executive, Nuclear Industry Association • Your editorial cites George Monbiot, Mark Lynas and Chris Goodall as calling for the construction of modular nuclear reactors for home use and for export. It is to be hoped that they will read the article by Chris Busby, an expert on the health effects of ionising radiation, published on 19 September in The Ecologist, entitled “Nuclear power kills! The real reason the NRC cancelled its nuclear site cancer study”. The article explains that the US’s Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has just cancelled its study into cancer near nuclear plants. We learn that “despite the truly enormous amount of information that has emerged about the adverse health effects of releases of radioactivity since 1990, no official investigation will be carried out”. As the article explains, “If you don’t like the truth … suppress it”. Mr Busby claims that “The NRC and the NAS [National Academy of Sciences] have their equivalent cover-up artists in the UK”. Are Messrs Monbiot, Lynas and Goodall confident that cancers will not result in children and adults from proximity to their modular nuclear reactors? Jim McCluskey Twickenham, Middlesex • You link decarbonising power supplies with building nuclear power stations. Given the massive amounts of (mostly carbon-producing) energy needed to create the thousands of tons of concrete and steel in a nuclear plant, as well as the energy spent mining and refining the required isotopes, do we know how long it takes for a plant to generate more useful energy than it took to build it? I have never seen this calculation. Dr Brian Curwain Christchurch, Dorset • A few questions for George Osborne about his new nuclear reactor. 1) Where do people in fuel poverty fit into this “win-win-win” deal (Hinkley Point: Osborne seeks to ease doubts with £2bn guarantee, 21 September)? With electricity prices guaranteed to double in order to ensure that EDF makes a profit on Hinkley C, it is not only taxpayers who are expected to stump up £2bn but bill-payers, many of whom are too poor to even pay tax. 2) Who will believe in the government’s enthusiasm for “decarbonisation” when they have slashed every form of support for renewable energy, which is safer, and quicker to build, already cheaper, and plummeting in price? When they have destroyed carbon-saving insulation schemes, while thousands die in cold UK homes each year? “Reliable” low-carbon”? This EPR model of reactor is unproven: in the words of David Howell, speaking in the House of Lords, “no reactor of this kind has ever been completed successfully” (Letters, 21 September). 3) If it’s not to save money or carbon, then what is it for? The civil nuclear industry is known to provide key expertise and a skills pool for the UK to remain part of the military nuclear club; Sussex University’s Science Policy Research Unit suggests that this might explain the government’s unshakable commitment to this form of energy (Shining a light on Britain’s nuclear state, 7 August). Consumers are entitled to a full accounting. Exactly what is it that we are expected to contribute to through our bills? Ruth London Fuel Poverty Action • George Osborne will help underwrite the £25bn investment in Hinkley Point. This deficit-boost will in turn be underwritten by the Bank of England’s past (and future?) quantitative easing. Jeremy Corbyn should be half-pleased: the funding source is the same as his “people’s QE”. However, the asset will not be owned by UK taxpayers/customers, who will pay for this solid-fuelled nuclear power, but by the Chinese and the French, who, with the Canadians, are leading the world in the development of liquid-fuelled reactors. The government-sponsored EPD study of designs for a liquid-fuelled reactor has recommended the Stable Salt Reactor for the UK. Liquid-fuelled reactors will deliver power at about half the price of solid-fuelled reactors. They are safe, running at atmospheric pressure, and efficient, producing little waste, primarily short-lived. The UK’s SSR would burn our stockpile of nuclear waste and plutonium, turning our massive liability into a massive asset, and providing us with all our electricity needs for around 50 years. Liquid-fuelled reactors could then burn thorium and/or uranium indefinitely. If they would divert, say, 1% of the Hinkley Point funding into the SSR, they could be serious about phasing out fossil fuels. John McGrother Buxton, Derbyshire • Imagine the Daily Mail headline if a Labour government stumped up a £2bn guarantee from the taxpayer to persuade a heavily indebted French nationalised industry (whose current nuclear ventures are years behind schedule) and a communist government to proceed with a £24.5bn nuclear power station in the UK. This to be followed by years of bill-payer contributions to support a strike price of £92.50/MWh (excluding inflation) compared with £50 at present. This from a man who has presided over a 50% increase in national debt. Alan Rigby St Rogatien, France • We welcome the joint statement by messrs Monbiot, Lynas and Goodall regarding the proposed Hinkley C nuclear power plant. While we agree with their conclusions regarding Hinkley C, we disagree with them on one significant point: we submit that the concerns they raise are relevant to the wider question of nuclear power’s viability and desirability, and are not merely restricted to the viability of Hinkley C and other power plants like it, as they suggest. The fact is that nuclear cannot pass the five parameters test to which (we have suggested) all policy proposals should be subject, and Monbiot et al in their article provide some data in support of this. Of the five parameters of evidence, precaution, political economy, asymmetry and framing, nuclear power fails three: precaution, because it gambles with disaster; political economy, because a nuclear-powered state is necessarily an authoritarian state, in which power resides with governmental and business elites, because of the need to ensure payback on huge upfront financial investments, and because it is a hi-tech and dangerous power source; and Asymmetry, because nuclear imposes toxic (and economic) costs on voiceless, because non-represented, future generations and ecosystems, while its advocates’ short-termist voices are loud and heard clearly by policymakers. Phil Hutchinson and Rupert Read Authors, Five Parameters By Which to Judge Policy, in the Philosopher’s Magazine • It is scarcely surprising that the British government seems intent on inviting China to provide a nuclear power plant. This was predictable, and indeed predicted, as early as 1992. At that time it was already clear that western industrial countries were failing to provide the educational and other routes for keeping alive hard-won expertise in nuclear power plant design, construction, licensing and operation. University courses in relevant subjects were rapidly disappearing, as few students wished to enter a career path which was widely regarded with the contempt accorded to pariahs. Academic staff were almost all about to retire. In the industrial field there were no repeat orders to maintain the investment in production facilities nor to provide the arena in which the pioneers could pass on their knowledge. An early consequence was the disappearance of competition in supply of components, with a resulting increase in prices. Despite these “facts on the ground”, many governments claimed that they wished to expand nuclear’s contribution to electricity production. However, they did little if anything to prepare for the fulfilment of their dreams. The operating companies did wake up; the World Association of Nuclear Operators instituted a scheme to support training of the technicians they needed for their continuing operations but that did not fully respond to the need. The results of the lack of real thought for the future are now becoming apparent. The travails of French companies in providing new plants in Normandy and Finland are but one aspect of the bitter harvest. The need to rely on China for new capacity in the UK is another. Should we be concerned? Well I am. I have no technical competence with which to judge the expected efficacity of a Chinese reactor. There is no need to assume that it would be less good than a European, Japanese or American plant. I am worried, however, about introducing a totally different culture into the UK’s nuclear affairs. China is not known for having an open society, and yet that is what is essential for the sound conduct of a nuclear programme. It is not that long since the UK escaped from the authoritarian approach of the UKAEA; “daddy knows best” could have been their watchword (even at the time of the Chernobyl accident there were still elements of this attitude in their presentation to the public). I doubt that many of us want to go back to that environment where real, well-informed debate was not available. Given the intended reliance on Chinese finance as well as on their technology, there will be a need for bolstering the UK’s nuclear inspectorate not only with cash and other resources but with confidence to stand up to political pressures to soften judgments which will inevitably arise from a government eager to maintain good relations with China. I find it difficult to believe that sufficient moral fibre will be forthcoming.

India and Pakistan are also developing new systems capable of delivering nuclear weapons and are expanding their capacities to produce fissile material for military purposes. And there is an emerging consensus in the expert community that North Korea has produced a small number of nuclear weapons, as distinct from rudimentary nuclear explosive devices. These are the conclusions of the latest annual survey by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), which says nine states – the US, Russia, the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea – possess a total of approximately 4,000 operational nuclear weapons. A decrease in the overall number of nuclear weapons is due mainly to Russia and the US – which together account for more than 93% of all nuclear weapons – further reducing their inventories under the terms of the New Start treaty, the report says. \"Once again this year, the nuclear weapon-possessing states took little action to indicate a genuine willingness to work toward complete dismantlement of their nuclear arsenals. The long-term modernisation programmes under way in these states suggest their views that nuclear weapons will remain deeply embedded elements of their strategic calculus,\" said the Sipri researchers, Shannon Kile and Phillip Patton Schell. The US plans to spend up to $350bn (about £200bn) over the next decade on modernising and maintaining its nuclear forces, including designing a replacement for its existing Trident submarines beginning in 2031, the study says. This would have implications for Britain's future nuclear weapons programme. Russia is building a new class of nuclear missile submarines and replacing all its Soviet-era intercontinental ballistic missiles with mobile, multiple-warhead versions of the existing SS-27 system. China is expanding its conventional ballistic missile programme and has deployed dual-capable medium and short-range ballistic missiles. Mixing conventional and nuclear missiles poses a critical risk of mistaken escalation of a conflict, as an adversary would not be able to determine whether the missile fired was armed with a conventional or nuclear warhead, Sipri warns. Total nuclear warheads in 2014 US 7,300 Russia 8,000 UK 225 (160 deployed) France 300 China 250 India 90-110 Pakistan 100-120 Israel 80 North Korea 6-8 Total 16,300 Source: Sipri Yearbook 2014"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2016/aug/09/the-battle-for-britain-review-laura-kuenssberg-post-brexit-who-do-your-job-now","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-09T06:20:07Z","webTitle":"The Battle for Britain review – tears, fears and posh-boy betrayals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/09/the-battle-for-britain-review-laura-kuenssberg-post-brexit-who-do-your-job-now","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/09/the-battle-for-britain-review-laura-kuenssberg-post-brexit-who-do-your-job-now","fields":{"headline":"The Battle for Britain review – tears, fears and posh-boy betrayals","bodyText":"‘I definitely feel,” said Sam Adamson as she stood before the mighty Wearmouth Bridge, “that working-class people got their voice heard.” You remember Adamson. She was the woman in all the newspapers held aloft at Silksworth Tennis Centre by cheering Brexiteers on 24 June, when her city voted to leave the EU. She wasn’t exactly Brexit’s poster girl, but was nonetheless emblematic of mass loathing for elitist politics. Westminster? Brussels? For her and her mates, these are latter-day Versailles – decadent, irrelevant, and frequently wigged out, if not in a good way. Just over a month after Sunderland voted leave, Adamson told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg on Brexit: The Battle for Britain (BBC2), what the result meant. “For the working-class people, it was like, ‘Yeah, you heard us – now do something about it’.” But what is that something? Kuenssberg concluded that politics could not go on as before. She was light, though, on detail. She’s not alone in being sketchy: the new prime minister Theresa May has said that “a bright future awaits, where all our people can share in a new prosperity, freedom and democracy”. A tale told by an idiot, signifying nothing. Kuenssberg didn’t consider, either, how one consequence of Brexit may be Scottish independence, though that is surely a fascinating front in the Battle for Britain. Scottish independence would consign the remains of Britain to rule by an electorally unbeatable Conservatives, that party historically interested in destroying the working classes. Or so you might think. Instead, she anatomised the whole Eton mess of the last months – the tears, fears, posh-boy betrayals, lies and creative accountancy by means of which Britain has been torn into acrimonious shreds thanks to self-serving ghouls masquerading as our selfless betters. She had Nick Clegg fingering Michael Gove as the guy who leaked the lie that the Queen had told Clegg she backed Brexit. “[T]he idea that the Queen, of all people, would even bother to give someone as insignificant as a ‘here today, gone tomorrow’ deputy prime minister a tongue-lashing about Europe I just think is … so preposterous,” said Clegg, oleaginous even at his most faux self-deprecating. She showed how the rival campaigns’ figures didn’t add up. The leave campaign’s claim that £350m a week of British taxpayers’ money transferred into Brussels’ coffers was a house of cards that a single puff would flatten; pro-remain chancellor George Osborne’s claim that the average British family would lose £4,300 a year if we left the EU also bore scant scrutiny. She took Nigel Farage to task over that vile, cunning Breaking Point poster. Who did those crowds in the poster represent? Lithuanian plumbers? Syrians leaving hell? Wasn’t its message racist, she asked the ex-Ukip leader? I couldn’t tell you what Farage’s reply was: my late mother had to leave the room whenever Thatcher came on TV in the 1980s; Farage rampant has the same effect on me in 2016. If only it was Clegg and Farage who sent my Oleaginousness Meter into overdrive. But no. If I had a euro for every time Cameron’s former director of communications Craig Oliver asked and answered his own self-flattering question rather than Kuenssberg’s worthwhile one, I could stop sterling’s calamitous plummet. If the National Grid could harness leave campaign chief executive Matthew Elliott’s aura of self-satisfaction, nobody would be calling for a nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point. Kuenssberg was alive to the irony of Tory toffs (Johnson, Gove etc) indicting Britain’s elitist establishment. “The sheer nerve!” exclaimed Peter Mandelson. Think of it this way: which benefits more from Brexit – Boris Johnson’s career, or the British working classes? If you answered the latter, you’re not paying attention. What will happen to the working classes post-Brexit in cities such as Sunderland? Perhaps Theresa May’s bright future will include Sunderland’s largest private sector employer, Nissan, leaving the north east in the wake of Brexit. Certainly it’s not just me who fears that the working classes won’t so much be heard as screwed over. *** Here’s another post-Brexit scenario. Today, as you know, British tomatoes are picked by eastern Europeans. But who, asked Morland Sanders in Brexit: Who’ll Do Your Job Now? (Channel 4), picks theirs? He found that Polish tomatoes are picked by Filipinos, Bangladeshis – and North Koreans. That last ethnic group intrigued Sanders. What are they doing in Polish polytunnels? Sanders found that North Korea is cash poor and sends workers abroad to pick soft fruit to earn hard currency. Such is globalisation in practice. Once the Poles leave British farms to pick fruit and veg back home, there will be a vacancy. Perhaps, Sanders suggested, North Koreans will fill it, doing the back-breaking, low-paid work that our native workers, apparently, disdain. Picture the scene: in the future, our farm produce will be gathered by slave labour, their wages sent to Pyongyang and used to bankroll nukes that Kim Jong-un will use to menace – there’s no easy way to say this – us.

Jean-Bernard Levy said he regretted the “hastiness” of Thomas Piquemal’s departure as finance chief. Piquemal resigned because he believed pursuing the world’s most expensive nuclear project could threaten the group, whose finances are already stretched by rising debt. Piquemal’s departure increased the feeling of crisis surrounding the Hinkley project, which is seen as vital for Britain to keep the lights on. If the plan were to collapse, it would be a serious blow to the UK government, which has offered generous guarantees to build two reactors at the site in Somerset. EDF’s battered share price fell 6.5% on Monday after Piquemal’s resignation was revealed over the weekend. The company’s shares have more than halved from €22 to €10 in the past year as concerns have mounted about its finances. In a deal supported strongly by the chancellor, George Osborne, EDF joined forces with the Chinese utility CGN in October to construct the reactors. But many industry figures believe the project is on the verge of collapse. EDF, which is 85% owned by the French government, said in October it expected to take a final decision and start deploying engineers at Hinkley Point in November. But the company has still not signed a final contract as fears have mounted about its financial strength. In an emailed statement, Levy said: “With the support of its state shareholder, EDF confirms it is studying the investment in the two Hinkley Point reactors in the best financial conditions for the group, with the aim of announcing a final investment decision soon,” Reuters reported. On top of its large debts, EDF is grappling with a collapse in power prices, cost overruns on a nuclear project in France and upgrades costing tens of billions of euros on its domestic reactors. Piquemal’s resignation raises grave doubts about EDF’s ability to carry out the project, which the UK government is relying on to meet the country’s energy needs. Levy said last month a decision on Hinkley Point was “coming closer” as EDF reported a 68% plunge in annual profit and cut its dividend. The company said its net debt had increased by €3.2bn (£2.5bn) to €37.4bn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/27/from-the-nile-to-the-amazon-climate-change-threatens-hydropower","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-27T10:00:49Z","webTitle":"From the Nile to the Amazon, climate change threatens hydropower","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/27/from-the-nile-to-the-amazon-climate-change-threatens-hydropower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/27/from-the-nile-to-the-amazon-climate-change-threatens-hydropower","fields":{"headline":"From the Nile to the Amazon, climate change threatens hydropower","bodyText":"From the Amazon to the Nile to the Mekong, rivers are a lifeblood for many nations, filling taps and irrigation canals and generating hydroelectricity that is powering economic development. But a new study warns that changes to river flows caused by climate change threaten that. Thousands of hydrodams risk being left high and dry by mid-century as global warming takes hold. On the face of it hydroelectricity seems an obvious antidote to climate change. Hydrodams are among the world’s largest power sources and free of carbon emissions. They could replace the burning of fossil fuels in dozens of countries, allowing economic development without booming emissions of greenhouse gases. Brazil, Egypt, China have led the way. But there is a problem. Future droughts risk leaving reservoirs empty. Michelle van Vliet of the Austria-based International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, an influential east-west thinktank, has crunched the numbers to see how a range of standard climate models predict that river flows will change – and what this means for more than 24,000 hydroelectric power plants round the world. Her findings were published in Nature Climate Change this month. The findings are stark. She concludes that “climate change will reduce the existing power capacities of hydropower in most regions worldwide”. Up to 74% of current hydrodams will likely see reductions in useable electricity-generating capacity by mid-century. That is potentially a big threat to fast-growing economies like those in South America, which relies on hydropower for more than 60% of its electricity. Much of Africa, Australia, south-east Asia, the US and southern and central Europe can also expect significant declines in hydropower capacity, she warns. The future is far from certain. Climate models disagree about the hydrological future for many river systems. Depending on which climate model you choose they may get more water – or less. Such uncertainty should make governments and investors nervous. Hydroelectric dams have a design life of 80 years and more. Betting on river flows remaining secure over that timescale is high risk. And where dams are built, the risks of financial disaster, human suffering and even water wars are significant. Take the Nile. Egypt is heavily dependent on the river for both electricity from the High Aswan dam, and for irrigating its desert farms. Right now, upstream Ethiopia is building a giant new hydrodam, the Grand Renaissance dam, that Egyptians fear could jeopardise flows and threaten their power supplies. The two regional superpowers, along with the eight other nations on the world’s longest river, are trying to reach a deal for sharing the water. But any deal is likely to be based on current flows being maintained. Fat chance. Nobody has a clue what future flows of the Nile will be. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has reported that different model projections for the Nile for later this century range from 30% more water to 78% less. Meanwhile the Niger, which flows through nine nations across west Africa, skirting the arid Sahel region, also faces risks of lost rains, just as Guinea and others are planning major dams that threaten water supplies in downstream countries such as Mali. Likewise, China, Laos and others are building dams on the Mekong, the lifeblood of south-east Asia, even though van Vliet’s study suggests the river will suffer reduced flows in future. Some nations are heeding the warning signs of climate change. In South America, recent droughts in Venezuela and Brazil have dried up reservoirs and caused power outages. Partly as a result, Brazil is planning to reduce its reliance on hydropower in future. But for many countries, the temptation to exploit hydropower as an alternative to fossil fuels is strong. China has grown its hydroelectric capacity hugely in recent years and, with plans to scale back coal burning, is likely to invest in further hydro expansion. Hydroelectric dams are not the only electricity sources that require lots of water. Most power plants burning coal, natural gas or oil, as well as nuclear power plants, use water for cooling. Away from the coasts, that usually means taking water from rivers. But such plants face a double whammy, says van Vliet, because what water remains in the rivers will be hotter than today. So it won’t be so good at cooling. She finds that up to 86% of such power plants will see declining generating capacity as a result. There have been early signs of this already, notably in 2003, during a European drought and heat wave whose intensity climate scientists say was due to global warming. At its height, flows on the Loire, France’s longest river and home to many nuclear power plants, were reduced to a trickle. French electricity generators had to shut or power down 17 reactors for want of cooling water. River water is the little-noticed essential for much of our energy supply.

The prime minister personally intervened with proposals for households to get direct cash handouts in areas where fracking takes place, changing plans that would have given money to local communities. Announcing the plans on Sunday, No 10 said the cash model would be a “blueprint” for letting people benefit directly from other infrastructure developments as well. It raised the prospect that residents could also get cash handouts if there were housing or office developments in their areas, funded through the community infrastructure levy that is currently under review. The plans to reward people for accepting fracking in their areas provoked immediate criticism from Labour, the Green party and environmental charities. Barry Gardiner, the shadow energy and climate change secretary, particularly criticised the handouts for fracking developments when there was no such “bribe” for people to accept clean-energy wind farms. “Does Theresa May really hold the British public in such high esteem that she thinks they can be bribed into fracking and a fossil fuel future?” he said. “Appealing to people’s higher nature, Theresa May gives a £10,000-plus bribe if you live near a frack site. If you live near a wind farm, nothing … The asymmetry is amazing. Wind farms are subject to a localism veto but for shale gas, [the] government can override.” Public support for fracking hit a new low of 19% in April according to the government’s long-running public attitudes tracker - while the numbers against the energy source had risen to 31%. Support for renewable power in the survey stood at 81%, with only 4% opposing it. Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK chief scientist, said: “The government has tried to sweeten the fracking pill with cash payments before, and it didn’t work. Over the last two years, public opposition has soared and support for shale has tanked. People’s concerns about climate change and their local environment cannot be silenced with a wad of cash. “You can’t put a price on the quality of the air you breathe, the water you drink, and the beauty of our countryside. If Theresa May wants to show the UK is open for business, she should reverse the policies that have harmed our vibrant clean-energy sector and back the technologies that can supply cheap, homegrown energy for decades to come.” The Green party also reacted angrily to the proposal. Molly Scott Cato, a Green party MEP, said: “Theresa May is … offering individual payments, little more than bribes, to households in areas affected by fracking. This is bound to set household against household and can only exacerbate community tensions. “Following hard on the heels of the Hinkley fiasco, this misguided policy to encourage fracking demonstrates again that the government has no strategic energy policy. It is also another worrying indication of the failure of commitment to tackle climate change, first demonstrated by May in her abolition of DECC [the department for energy and climate change]. “The Green party is clear that our energy future must lie with the rapid investment in both energy conservation measures and new renewable capacity. This offers a clean, safe energy future and would also create many thousands of jobs.” It is the latest direct intervention by May over energy policy in the past few weeks. She has abolished Decc by wrapping into a new business and industrial policy brief, and ordered a review of the Hinkley Point nuclear power station, after it had been signed off by EDF, the French state-owned company, and its Chinese co-investors. Plans to compensate residents for fracking were first unveiled under the former chancellor George Osborne last year, who suggested there could be a £1bn shale wealth fund from up to 10% of the tax proceeds of shale drilling to benefit host communities. The new fund could deliver as much as £10m to each community where wells are sited. Downing Street declined to estimate how much payouts could be worth, but it is thought that individual households could receive between £5,000 and £20,000. Speaking ahead of a consultation on the fund, May said she wanted to make sure that individuals benefit personally from economic decisions. “The government I lead will be always be driven by the interests of the many – ordinary families for whom life is harder than many people in politics realise,” the prime minister said. “As I said on my first night as prime minister: when we take the big calls, we’ll think not of the powerful but of you. This announcement is an example of putting those principles into action. It’s about making sure people personally benefit from economic decisions that are taken – not just councils – and putting them back in control over their lives. “We’ll be looking at applying this approach to other government programmes in the future too, as we press on with the work of building a country that works for everyone.” A British Geological Survey study of shale gas across the north of England estimated total reserves of 1,300tn cubic feet – the equivalent of more than 500 years of UK gas consumption at current levels. However, it is still unclear how much of this will be economical to extract and whether it would prove too disruptive to many heavily populated areas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2017/nov/23/from-inboxing-to-thought-showers-how-business-bullshit-took-over","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2017-11-23T06:00:22Z","webTitle":"From inboxing to thought showers: how business bullshit took over","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/23/from-inboxing-to-thought-showers-how-business-bullshit-took-over","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2017/nov/23/from-inboxing-to-thought-showers-how-business-bullshit-took-over","fields":{"headline":"From inboxing to thought showers: how business bullshit took over","bodyText":"In early 1984, executives at the telephone company Pacific Bell made a fateful decision. For decades, the company had enjoyed a virtual monopoly on telephone services in California, but now it was facing a problem. The industry was about to be deregulated, and Pacific Bell would soon be facing tough competition. The management team responded by doing all the things managers usually do: restructuring, downsizing, rebranding. But for the company executives, this wasn’t enough. They worried that Pacific Bell didn’t have the right culture, that employees did not understand “the profit concept” and were not sufficiently entrepreneurial. If they were to compete in this new world, it was not just their balance sheet that needed an overhaul, the executives decided. Their 23,000 employees needed to be overhauled as well. The company turned to a well-known organisational development specialist, Charles Krone, who set about designing a management-training programme to transform the way people thought, talked and behaved. The programme was based on the ideas of the 20th-century Russian mystic George Gurdjieff. According to Gurdjieff, most of us spend our days mired in “waking sleep”, and it is only by shedding ingrained habits of thinking that we can liberate our inner potential. Gurdjieff’s mystical ideas originally appealed to members of the modernist avant garde, such as the writer Katherine Mansfield and the architect Frank Lloyd Wright. More than 60 years later, senior executives at Pacific Bell were likewise seduced by Gurdjieff’s ideas. The company planned to spend $147m (£111m) putting their employees through the new training programme, which came to be known as Kroning. Over the course of 10 two-day sessions, staff were instructed in new concepts, such as “the law of three” (a “thinking framework that helps us identify the quality of mental energy we have”), and discovered the importance of “alignment”, “intentionality” and “end-state visions”. This new vocabulary was designed to awake employees from their bureaucratic doze and open their eyes to a new higher-level consciousness. And some did indeed feel like their ability to get things done had improved. But there were some unfortunate side-effects of this heightened corporate consciousness. First, according to one former middle manager, it was virtually impossible for anyone outside the company to understand this new language the employees were speaking. Second, the manager said, the new language “led to a lot more meetings” and the sheer amount of time wasted nurturing their newfound states of higher consciousness meant that “everything took twice as long”. “If the energy that had been put into Kroning had been put to the business at hand, we all would have gotten a lot more done,” said the manager. Although Kroning was packaged in the new-age language of psychic liberation, it was backed by all the threats of an authoritarian corporation. Many employees felt they were under undue pressure to buy into Kroning. For instance, one manager was summoned to her superior’s office after a team member walked out of a Kroning session. She was asked to “force out or retire” the rebellious employee. Some Pacific Bell employees wrote to their congressmen about Kroning. Newspapers ran damning stories with headlines such as “Phone company dabbles in mysticism”. The Californian utility regulator launched a public inquiry, and eventually closed the training course, but not before $40m dollars had been spent. During this period, a young computer programmer at Pacific Bell was spending his spare time drawing a cartoon that mercilessly mocked the management-speak that had invaded his workplace. The cartoon featured a hapless office drone, his disaffected colleagues, his evil boss and an even more evil management consultant. It was a hit, and the comic strip was syndicated in newspapers across the world. The programmer’s name was Scott Adams, and the series he created was Dilbert. You can still find these images pinned up in thousands of office cubicles around the world today. Although Kroning may have been killed off, Kronese has lived on. The indecipherable management-speak of which Charles Krone was an early proponent seems to have infected the entire world. These days, Krone’s gobbledygook seems relatively benign compared to much of the vacuous language circulating in the emails and meeting rooms of corporations, government agencies and NGOs. Words like “intentionality” sound quite sensible when compared to “ideation”, “imagineering”, and “inboxing” – the sort of management-speak used to talk about everything from educating children to running nuclear power plants. This language has become a kind of organisational lingua franca, used by middle managers in the same way that freemasons use secret handshakes – to indicate their membership and status. It echoes across the cubicled landscape. It seems to be everywhere, and refer to anything, and nothing. * * * It hasn’t always been this way. A certain amount of empty talk is unavoidable when humans gather together in large groups, but the kind of bullshit through which we all have to wade every day is a remarkably recent creation. To understand why, we have to look at how management fashions have changed over the past century or so. In the late 18th century, firms were owned and operated by businesspeople who tended to rely on tradition and instinct to manage their employees. Over the next century, as factories became more common, a new figure appeared: the manager. This new class of boss faced a big problem, albeit one familiar to many people who occupy new positions: they were not taken seriously. To gain respect, managers assumed the trappings of established professions such as doctors and lawyers. They were particularly keen to be seen as a new kind of engineer, so they appropriated the stopwatches and rulers used by them. In the process, they created the first major workplace fashion: scientific management. Firms started recruiting efficiency experts to conduct time-and-motion studies. After recording every single movement of a worker in minute detail, the time-and-motion expert would rearrange the worker’s performance of tasks into a more efficient order. Their aim was to make the worker into a well-functioning machine, doing each part of the job in the most efficient way. Scientific management was not limited to the workplaces of the capitalist west – Stalin pushed for similar techniques to be imposed in factories throughout the Soviet Union. Workers found the new techniques alien, and a backlash inevitably followed. Charlie Chaplin famously satirised the cult of scientific management in his 1936 film Modern Times, which depicts a factory worker who is slowly driven mad by the pressures of life on the production line. As scientific management became increasingly unpopular, executives began casting around for alternatives. They found inspiration in a famous series of experiments conducted by psychologists in the 1920s at the Hawthorne Works, a factory complex in Illinois where tens of thousands of workers were employed by Western Electric to make telephone equipment. A team of researchers from Harvard had initially set out to discover whether changes in environment, such as adjusting the lighting or temperature, could influence how much workers produced each day. To their surprise, the researchers found that no matter how light or dark the workplace was, employees continued to work hard. The only thing that seemed to make a difference was the amount of attention that workers got from the experimenters. This insight led one of the researchers, an Australian psychologist called Elton Mayo, to conclude that what he called the “human aspects” of work were far more important than “environmental” factors. While this may seem obvious, it came as news to many executives at the time. As Mayo’s ideas caught hold, companies attempted to humanise their workplaces. They began talking about human relationships, worker motivation and group dynamics. They started conducting personality testing and running teambuilding exercises: all in the hope of nurturing good human relations in the workplace. * * * This newfound interest in the human side of work did not last long. During the second world war, as the US and UK military invested heavily in trying to make war more efficient, management fashions began to shift. A bright young Berkeley graduate called Robert McNamara led a US army air forces team that used statistics to plan the most cost-effective way to flatten Japan in bombing campaigns. After the war, many military leaders brought these new techniques into the corporate world. McNamara, for instance, joined the Ford Motor Company, rising quickly to become its CEO, while the mathematical procedures that he had developed during the war were enthusiastically taken up by companies to help plan the best way to deliver cheese, toothpaste and Barbie dolls to American consumers. Today these techniques are known as supply-chain management. During the postwar years, the individual worker once again became a cog in a large, hierarchical machine. While many of the grey-suited employees at these firms savoured the security, freedom and increasing affluence that their work brought, many also complained about the deep lack of meaning in their lives. The backlash came in the late 1960s, as the youth movement railed against the conformity demanded by big corporations. Protesters sprayed slogans such as “live without dead time” and “to hell with boundaries” on to city walls around the world. They wanted to be themselves, express who they really were, and not have to obey “the Man”. In response to this cultural change, in the 1970s, management fashions changed again. Executives began attending new-age workshops to help them “self actualise” by unlocking their hidden “human potential”. Companies instigated “encounter groups”, in which employees could explore their deeper inner emotions. Offices were redesigned to look more like university campuses than factories. Nowhere is this shift better captured than in the final episode of the television series Mad Men. Don Draper had been the exemplar of the organisational man, wearing a standard-issue grey suit when we met him at the beginning of the show’s first series. After suffering numerous breakdowns over the intervening years, he finds himself at the Esalen institute in northern California, the home of the human potential movement. Initially, Draper resists. But soon he is sitting in a confessional circle, sobbing as he tells his story. His personal breakthrough leads him to take up meditating and chanting, looking out over the Pacific Ocean. The result of Don Draper’s visit to Esalen isn’t just personal transformation. The final scene shows the now-liberated adman’s new creation – an iconic Coca-Cola commercial in which a multiracial group of children stand on a hilltop singing about how they would like to buy the world a Coke and drink it in perfect harmony. After the fictional Don Draper visited Esalen, work became a place you could go to find yourself. Corporate mission statements now sounded like the revolutionary graffiti of the 1960s. The company training programme run by Charles Krone at Pacific Bell came straight from the Esalen playbook. Since new-age ideas first permeated the workplace in the 1970s, the spin cycle of management-speak has sped up. During the 1980s, management experts went in search of fresh ideas in Japan. Management became a kind of martial art, with executives visiting “quality dojos” to earn “lean black-belts”. In their 1982 bestseller, In Search of Excellence, Tom Peters and Robert Waterman – both employees of McKinsey, the huge management consultancy agency – recommended that firms foster the same commitment to the company that they found among Honda employees in Japan. The book included the story of one Japanese employee who happens upon a damaged Honda on a public street. He stops and immediately begins repairing the car. The reason? He can’t bear to see a Honda that isn’t perfect. While McKinsey consultants were mining the wisdom of the east, the ideas of Harvard Business School’s Michael Jensen started to find favour among Wall Street financiers. Jensen saw the corporation as a portfolio of assets. Even people – labelled as “human resources” – were part of this portfolio. Each company existed to create returns for shareholders, and if managers failed to do this, they should be fired. If a company didn’t generate adequate returns, it should be broken up and sold off. Every little part of the company was seen as a business. Seduced by this view, many organisations started creating “internal markets”. In the 1990s, under director general John Birt, the BBC created a system in which everything from time in a recording studio to toilet cleaning was traded on a complex internal market. The number of accountants working for the broadcaster exploded, while people who created TV and radio shows were laid off. * * * As companies have become increasingly ravenous for the latest management fad, they have also become less discerning. Some bizarre recent trends include equine-assisted coaching (“You can lead people, but can you lead a horse?”) and rage rooms (a room where employees can go to take out their frustrations by smashing up office furniture, computers and images of their boss). A century of management fads has created workplaces that are full of empty words and equally empty rituals. We have to live with the consequences of this history every day. Consider a meeting I recently attended. During the course of an hour, I recorded 64 different nuggets of corporate claptrap. They included familiar favourites such as “doing a deep dive”, “reaching out”, and “thought leadership”. There were also some new ones I hadn’t heard before: people with “protected characteristics” (anyone who wasn’t a white straight guy), “the aha effect” (realising something), “getting our friends in the tent” (getting support from others). After the meeting, I found myself wondering why otherwise smart people so easily slipped into this kind of business bullshit. How had this obfuscatory way of speaking become so successful? There are a number of familiar and credible explanations. People use management-speak to give the impression of expertise. The inherent vagueness of this language also helps us dodge tough questions. Then there is the simple fact that even if business bullshit annoys many people, in most work situations we try our hardest to be polite and avoid confrontation. So instead of causing a scene by questioning the bullshit flying around the room, I followed the example of Simon Harwood, the director of strategic governance in the BBC’s self-satirising TV sitcom W1A. I used his standard response to any idea – no matter how absurd – “hurrah”. Still, these explanations did not seem to fully account for the conquest of bullshit. I came across one further explanation in a short article by the anthropologist David Graeber. As factories producing goods in the west have been dismantled, and their work outsourced or replaced with automation, large parts of western economies have been left with little to do. In the 1970s, some sociologists worried that this would lead to a world in which people would need to find new ways to fill their time. The great tragedy for many is that just the opposite seems to have happened. At the very point when work seemed to be withering away, we all became obsessed with it. To be a good citizen, you need to be a productive citizen. There is only one problem, of course: there is less than ever that actually needs to be produced. As Graeber pointed out, the answer has come in the form of what he calls “bullshit jobs”. These are jobs in which people experience their work as “utterly meaningless, contributing nothing to the world”. In a YouGov poll conducted in 2015, 37% of respondents in the UK said their job made no meaningful contribution to the world. But people working in bullshit jobs need to do something. And that something is usually the production, distribution and consumption of bullshit. According to a 2014 survey by the polling agency Harris, the average US employee now spends 45% of their working day doing their real job. The other 55% is spent doing things such as wading through endless emails or attending pointless meetings. Many employees have extended their working day so they can stay late to do their “real work”. One thing continued to puzzle me: why was it that so many people were paid to do this kind of empty work. One reason that David Graeber gives, in his book The Utopia of Rules, is rampant bureaucracy: there are more forms to be filled in, procedures to be followed and standards to be complied with than ever. Today, bureaucracy comes cloaked in the language of change. Organisations are full of people whose job is to create change for no real reason. Manufacturing hollow change requires a constant supply of new management fads and fashions. Fortunately, there is a massive industry of business bullshit merchants who are quite happy to supply it. For each new change, new bullshit is needed. Looking back over the list of business bullshit I had noted down during the meeting, I realised that much of it was directly related to empty new bureaucratic initiatives, which were seen as terribly urgent, but would probably be forgotten about in a few years’ time. One of the corrosive effects of business bullshit can be seen in the statistic that 43% of all teachers in England are considering quitting in the next five years. The most frequently cited reasons are increasingly heavy workloads caused by excessive administration, and a lack of time and space to devote to educating students. A remarkably similar picture appears if you look at the healthcare sector: in the UK, 81% of senior doctors say they are considering retiring from their job early; 57% of GPs are considering leaving the profession; 66% of nurses say they would quit if they could. In each case, the most frequently cited reason is stress caused by increasing managerial demands, and lack of time to do their job properly. It is not just employees who feel overwhelmed. During the 1980s, when Kroning was in full swing, empty management-speak was confined to the beige meeting rooms of large corporations. Now, it has seeped into every aspect of life. Politicians use business balderdash to avoid grappling with important issues. The machinery of state has also come down with the word-virus. The NHS is crawling with “quality sensei”, “lean ninjas”, and “blue-sky thinkers”. Even schools are flooded with the latest business buzzwords like “grit”, “flipped learning” and “mastery”. Naturally, the kids are learning fast. One teacher recalled how a seven-year-old described her day at school: “Well, when we get to class, we get out our books and start on our non-negotiables.” * * * In the introduction to his 2015 book, Trust Me, PR Is Dead, the former PR executive Robert Phillips tells a fascinating story. One day he was called up by the CEO of a global corporation. The CEO was worried. A factory which was part of his firm’s supply chain had caught fire and 100 women had burned to death. “My chairman’s been giving me grief,” said the CEO. “He thinks we’re failing to get our message across. We are not emphasising our CSR [corporate social responsibility] credentials well enough.” Phillips responded: “While 100 women’s bodies are still smouldering?” The CEO was “struggling to contain both incredulity and temper”. “I know,” he said. “Please help.” Phillips responded: “You start with actions, not words.” In many ways, this one interaction tells us how bullshit is used in corporate life. Individual executives facing a problem know that turning to bullshit is probably not the best idea. However, they feel compelled. The problem is that such compulsions often cloud people’s best judgements. They start to think empty words will trump reasonable reflection and considered action. Sadly, in many contexts, empty words win out. If we hope to improve organisational life – and the wider impact that organisations have on our society – then a good place to start is by reducing the amount of bullshit our organisations produce. Business bullshit allows us to blather on without saying anything. It empties out language and makes us less able to think clearly and soberly about the real issues. As we find our words become increasingly meaningless, we begin to feel a sense of powerlessness. We start to feel there is little we can do apart from play along, benefit from the game and have the occasional laugh. But this does not need to be the case. Business bullshit can and should be challenged. This is a task each of us can take up by refusing to use empty management-speak. We can stop ourselves from being one more conduit in its circulation. Instead of just rolling our eyes and checking our emails, we should demand something more meaningful. Clearly, our own individual efforts are not enough. Putting management-speak in its place is going to require a collective effort. What we need is an anti-bullshit movement. It would be made up of people from all walks of life who are dedicated to rooting out empty language. It would question management twaddle in government, in popular culture, in the private sector, in education and in our private lives. The aim would not just be bullshit-spotting. It would also be a way of reminding people that each of our institutions has its own language and rich set of traditions which are being undermined by the spread of the empty management-speak. It would try to remind people of the power which speech and ideas can have when they are not suffocated with bullshit. By cleaning out the bullshit, it might become possible to have much better functioning organisations and institutions and richer and fulfilling lives.

The Bank has cut interest rates, restarted its asset purchase programme and is encouraging banks to pass on the base cut to the real economy by providing them with £100bn of new funding. But this will not mean much unless the government, businesses and households take advantage. At least, that is what some bloke called George Osborne says. The MP for Tatton popped up on Twitter to say that the Bank’s actions “must be matched by permanent supply side reform: lower business taxes, free trade with EU and unambiguous message we’re open to overseas investment”. The former chancellor has not got much right in 2016, but business leaders will certainly agree with his latest comments. In fact, that is exactly what small- and medium-sized businesses were telling the prime minister, Theresa May, at a roundtable meeting on Thursday. The British Chambers of Commerce, which was at the meeting, called on the government to urgently address the “long-standing underinvestment in the UK’s infrastructure”. Investment in infrastructure will encourage businesses to stop sitting on their hands and get spending. Last week, the government announced it would review plans to build a nuclear power station at Hinkley Point, a project Osborne had championed. The decision to reconsider the Franco-Chinese-funded power station is correct given the potential £30bn bill for consumers. But if the project is scrapped, then the government must state the alternative route it plans to take. As my colleague Terry Macalister writes, there are other ways to ensure that Britain does not suffer an energy shortage. Likewise, now is the time for the government to decide whether to expand Heathrow airport, whether to press ahead with High Speed 2, and what major roads it wants to modernise. As the Olympic Games get started in Rio de Janeiro, Stratford in east London stands as a reminder that businesses are willing to invest when the government provides a platform. Critics may question the sporting legacy of London 2012 and the quality of the architecture at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, but Stratford and the surrounding area have been transformed by hosting the Olympics. The government’s commitment to improving the infrastructure in the area led to Australian company Westfield building a £1.4bn shopping centre through the financial crisis of 2008. Foreign investors are now helping to fund a £2.3bn office development, while a host of new local businesses have sprung up or expanded in the area. With Osborne’s target of returning government finances to a surplus by 2020 now scrapped, the new prime minister has a golden opportunity to get started with major infrastructure projects. The government can finance projects itself or with private investors, but it must ensure that the Bank’s efforts are rewarded. Former Tesco executive Mason hits out It is rare for any Tesco executive from Sir Terry Leahy’s era to comment on the state of the retailer today and what went wrong at the company, but when they do it is worth listening. Tim Mason was, along with Leahy, the brains behind much of what we recognise as Tesco today – Clubcard, Tesco Express convenience stores, Tesco Finest and Tesco.com. He went on to become deputy chief executive and head of its US venture Fresh &amp; Easy. However, he left under a cloud in 2012 when Leahy’s successor as Tesco boss, Philip Clarke, announced the company was pulling out of the failing US business. Mason has made some fascinating comments in an interview with trade magazine the Grocer. He gives his backing to Dave Lewis, the current boss of Tesco, describing him as a decent man doing a good job and revealing that he texted him recently to tell him that Tesco Finest’s fresh pasta with pine nuts was better than Marks &amp; Spencer’s. However, what really stands out is the quiet evisceration of Clarke. Tesco, remember, reported a record £6.4bn loss shortly after he was sacked and is embroiled in a Serious Fraud Office investigation into its pricing. When Mason is asked if he had a lucky escape because Clarke was chosen as Tesco chief executive ahead of him, he replies: “The external pressures were great, no doubt about that. But how you behave and how you perform under those pressures is the mark of the man. And it absolutely did not have to be the way it was.” Ouch. Adidas’s gains are Mike Ashley’s loss Poor Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods. The golfing superstars need to find themselves some new clubs now that Nike has announced it will stop making golf equipment. However, the biggest loser from the latest round of the battle between Nike and Adidas, the two biggest sportswear brands in the world, could be Mike Ashley. While Nike was announcing it is pulling out of golf, Adidas reported a 25% rise in sales in the second quarter of the year. This growth was underpinned by sales of football shirts, which increased thanks to Euro 2016. This is a problem for Ashley because Adidas refuses to supply Sports Direct with replica football kits, presumably because it does not like how the retailer presents them and cuts the price. If Adidas is managing to comfortably grow sales of its football shirts without dealing with Sports Direct, that is a worrying sign for Ashley and his business model."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/jul/17/economically-and-militarily-keep-trident-nuclear-deterrent","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-16T23:05:25Z","webTitle":"Economically and militarily, we must renew Trident | Tom Watson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/17/economically-and-militarily-keep-trident-nuclear-deterrent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/17/economically-and-militarily-keep-trident-nuclear-deterrent","fields":{"headline":"Economically and militarily, we must renew Trident","bodyText":"Tomorrow’s Trident vote is taking place even though parliament has already made the funds available to renew our nuclear deterrent. So this is little more than partisan political game-playing from the Tories. I make no bones about my belief that we need to replace Trident. But I am not wedded ideologically to Trident, come what may. I hope one day we will have no need of a nuclear deterrent and I believe we must plan for a future without one. Warfare is changing. In the US, the military is pursuing a “third offset” strategy designed to anticipate and respond to new threats. Some of the military challenges we will face in the future, including those posed by Russia and China, will feel familiar. Others won’t. As chair of the all-party group on drones, I saw how quickly defence technology is evolving and how rapidly military robotics is advancing. Those who criticised Emily Thornberry when, in her former role as defence spokesperson, she said unmanned vehicles might one day render an underwater deterrent obsolete, were too quick to do so. We must be mindful of the impact new technology could have on the effectiveness of our deterrent. But now is not the time to step away from our historic role as a nuclear power. When Attlee built Britain’s bomb, he did so because he knew our role in the world would be shaped by our capacity to defend ourselves and our allies; the logic of that Labour party position holds even truer today. This summer has been significant and confusing for the UK. It has felt like the finale to a big-budget American melodrama, packed with plot twists and the occasional dose of paranoia. We have been forced to confront questions about our identity and role in the world. For many, this has been painful. The referendum result renders many of the assumptions that underpinned British defence and foreign policy void. We can no longer depend on the EU to amplify our voice. We can no longer expect our goodwill and good neighbourliness to be taken for granted. Britain must find a way to live up to the promise, made by so many who campaigned for Leave, that while we may be leaving the EU we have not abandoned Europe. To our friends in Europe, we have the opportunity to demonstrate that our historic bonds of mutual respect and mutual aid will survive Brexit. I am pleased that the UK is committed to deploying our troops as part of Nato’s Baltic forces. Putin’s Russia looms, a mafia state built on chauvinism. Britain must play its part in holding it at bay. To abandon our deterrent in that context would be a grotesque abandonment of our friends at a time of great peril. Trident is not merely an instrument of our sovereign national interests – it is the protective curtain behind which freedom and democracy have flourished in countries across eastern Europe. And what would we say to our constituents in this country who would be hurt by a decision not to replace? The construction and maintenance of Trident’s replacement will directly support more than 30,000 jobs in the UK, including 6,000 at BAE Systems’ facility in Barrow-in-Furness. Unite, my union, has said a failure to renew would lead to the “obliteration” of thousands of its members’ jobs and warned many communities would become “ghost towns”. That is an economic catastrophe we cannot afford and one we cannot ask those communities to pay. Labour’s policy on Trident is clear, but our MPs have been offered a free vote because there is a difference of opinion in the shadow cabinet. I support that. But those MPs who vote against Trident should be in no doubt that they are voting to put tens of thousands of defence engineers out of work, many of them members of Unite and the GMB. If you are a union general secretary supporting a unilateralist politician, you do so in the knowledge that thousands of your members may lose their jobs. Some argue that Labour should abstain tomorrow, citing the current Labour defence review as justification. Yet to do so is an abdication of responsibility. No matter what low cunning has engineered this vote, MPs have a duty to take a position. We cannot say to the country that we haven’t made up our minds on strategic defence. On security, on jobs and on Britain’s role in the world the evidence is stacked in Trident’s favour. When that evidence shifts, so will my position. Until it does, to oppose Trident’s replacement is to be in favour of inflicting real harm on this country’s defences and the livelihoods of thousands of skilled British workers.

So it seems fitting the planned Hinkley Point nuclear power site is where contemporary political bridges may be burned, too. If you believe the story going around Westminster, the collapse of the controversial reactor project, heavily backed by George Osborne, would end his campaign to take over at Number 10, given the recent tax credit U-turn and pension retreat. But, however much the chancellor needs Hinkley, its fate will actually be decided not in Bridgwater, or London Bridge, but in the Avenue de Wagram, Paris: the headquarters of Électricité de France (EDF). It is here that the future of the £18bn scheme, a main part of infrastructure strategy and the key to Conservative Party energy policy, will be decided once and for all. Jean-Bernard Lévy, the EDF chief executive, is the man who is pushing for more financial help from the French government and to tie up a few more loose ends that would allow him, finally, to press the green button on Hinkley. Friends of Lévy describe him as a “dictator overseeing a democracy” but the stakes are high for him, too. His job is surely on the line from François Hollande’s government, given Hinkley is meant to provide a French technology showcase. Yet City analysts in Britain have described the project as “insane” for a company that is already buried in a host of other problems, most of which require solving with money it has not immediately got. The temperature reached boiling point last week, when it was revealed that EDF’s own finance director, Thomas Piquemal, had resigned, saying Hinkley should be postponed for at least three years while more cash was raised. Rarely has one energy project received so much attention in Britain and bystanders could be forgiven for thinking that the only thing that stands in the way of the lights going out is this one nuclear project. But Hinkley would only provide 7% of the country’s electricity. If Lévy did finally plug the plug on Hinkley, rather than going ahead next month as his people indicate, it would be lights out for Osborne or Tory energy policy credibility, rather than UK plc. It is certainly a sign of the extraordinary frenzy around Hinkley that some peers have been demanding that Swansea Bay tidal lagoon must be built as the government’s Plan B. Swansea Bay is a fascinating project that would be good to push forward. But it is small – 320 megawatts compared to Hinkley’s 3,200MW – and is based on a largely untried technology, rather than half a century of experience in nuclear power. It is also being undertaken by one entrepreneur, Mark Shorrock, and a doughty team whereas, for all its faults, EDF oversees a massive power empire and is 85%-owned by the French state. There are other UK nuclear projects – planned by two different consortia, led by Toshiba and Hitachi. They would not fall over just because Hinkley bit the dust but they are further behind in planning and confidence would surely be badly damaged. Plan B for the Conservatives would, undoubtedly, involve more fossil fuels – more gas-fired power stations – with all the implications for breaking the country’s carbon emission targets. But the government has been trying to get power companies, such as Centrica, to build new gas plants by offering subsidies through the “capacity mechanism” and has so far failed. Ministers, who have set their faces against subsidising onshore wind and quite a lot of solar, as well as dismantling energy efficiency schemes, would have to throw more cash at the gas power operators. They might also finally realise what Andrew Adonis’s national infrastructure commission has realised: the answers partly lie in demand reduction, in interconnectors with those countries who have too much power, and technical innovation on storage. In the meantime, the smell of burning comes again from Bridgwater. Celtic tiger’s roar is more of a miaow Irish economic growth in 2015 was a supersonic 7.8%, according to official figures, outpacing China, India, and every other developed economy in the world. What’s more, in the final quarter, moved up yet another gear, to a breakneck 9.2% growth rate. The Celtic Tiger is roaring again. Except that it’s not, really. If it were, taoiseach Enda Kenny would be enjoying a bumper majority in the Dáil. Instead, he was booted out in last month’s election, following an ill-judged campaign around the message of “keep the recovery going”. Beyond Dublin, the response from the electorate was: “What recovery?” Ireland’s Central Statistics Office is not making up the data. But the dubious behaviour of the multinationals that dominate Ireland’s economy render many of the figures meaningless. Take the figure for “gross fixed capital formation”, which tells you how much an economy is investing. It rose by a huge 28.2% to €46bn in 2015, the chief reason why domestic demand in the Irish economy is powering ahead. Yet, nearly all of that increase was down to the Irish subsidiaries of multinationals buying intellectual property from their own shell-company subsidiaries, usually in Bermuda or the Caymans. Ironically, they are hauling these “assets” into Ireland, the home of European tax piracy, ahead of an expected international clampdown on the offshore shell companies. The headline export figures are just as bogus, argues economics blogger Michael Hennigan of Finfacts.ie, who says that around a third of these may merely be transfer pricing by multinationals. An assessment of the real economy would note how Dublin’s restaurants and malls are packed, how the M50 is at bursting point and how office vacancies are plummeting. But it would also note that many rural towns remain deeply depressed, blighted by emigration and a still moribund property market. Ireland’s recovery is real, but it’s not the poster-child for austerity some claim. Growth is probably running above 3%, maybe 5%. But 7.8%? Pure blarney. What bonus season should really be like When bonus season rolls around in the City of London, chatter around the watercooler – and later in the Square Mile’s historic drinking dens – turns to sports cars, exotic holidays and ski chalets. At the John Lewis Partnership – owner of the famous department store chain and Waitrose supermarkets – excited staff at the flagship Oxford Street store spoke instead of paying off credit card debts and saving for a family holiday. Each year the staff gather at shops around the UK to hear what percentage of their salary they’ll be getting as a bonus. This year’s 10% was the lowest in more than a decade but still the unbridled delight was palpable. One reason for this is that everyone gets the same proportion of salary. Instead of nervously measuring their success against what colleagues have got, John Lewis employees celebrate their windfall in an atmosphere of collective joy. That’s why they call it a partnership."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/jul/14/industrial-strategy-welcomed-as-part-of-governments-new-business-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-14T18:25:27Z","webTitle":"Industrial strategy welcomed as part of government's new business policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/industrial-strategy-welcomed-as-part-of-governments-new-business-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/jul/14/industrial-strategy-welcomed-as-part-of-governments-new-business-policy","fields":{"headline":"Industrial strategy welcomed as part of government's new business policy","bodyText":"Business leaders have overwhelmingly welcomed Theresa May’s decision to merge the government’s business and energy departments and add the phrase “industrial strategy” into the title, claiming it could allow the UK to build a long-term economic plan. The new Conservative prime minister has appointed Greg Clark as the secretary of state for the new department of business, energy and industrial strategy. Clark replaces Sajid Javid, the former business, innovation and skills secretary, who has been moved to communities and local government to take over Clark’s old job. The decision marks a change of direction for the Conservative government and its approach to business. Javid, a former investment banker, had expressed his dislike at the phrase industrial strategy, suggesting the approach of his Liberal Democrat predecessor Sir Vince Cable had alienated industries that were not part of the plan. However, Clark said he had been “charged with delivering a comprehensive industrial strategy”. The EEF, the trade body for manufacturers, said the changes demonstrated a “new, serious purpose”, while the CBI said it had long called for an industrial strategy. Jürgen Maier, the UK chief executive of Siemens, said on Twitter: “Like the emphasis of new business department -business, energy and industrial strategy. Looking forward to getting stuck in.” Before becoming an MP, Clark worked for Boston Consulting Group, the global management consultancy firm, and the BBC, where he was controller of commercial policy. Clark, who was born in Middlesbrough, has previously served as cities minister, financial secretary to the Treasury, universities minister and the communities and local government secretary. He was elected as MP for Tunbridge Wells in 2005, replacing Archie Norman, the former Asda boss and ITV chairman. Clark said on Thursday night: “I am thrilled to have been appointed to lead this new department charged with delivering a comprehensive industrial strategy, leading government’s relationship with business, furthering our world-class science base, delivering affordable, clean energy and tackling climate change.” His first tasks will include resolving the crisis in the steel industry and making a final decision about whether to build a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of the EEF, said: “This is a welcome move and demonstrates a new, serious purpose to this government reflective of the times. “Now that energy and business policy are merged, we have the makings of an industrial strategy that will focus on UK competitiveness and will provide support to our sector as it seeks to overcome the challenges and seize opportunities from the decision to leave the EU. “In light of the challenges ahead, this move is all to the good and should prove to be a powerful tool in driving growth and delivering a more balanced economy. We look forward to working with the new secretary of state to ensure that our sector continues to deliver jobs, growth and prosperity throughout the UK.” The CBI said an industrial strategy is needed to boost investment and innovation in the UK and support small and medium-sized businesses. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: “Our manufacturers will welcome the new government’s emphasis on delivering a true partnership with businesses across all sectors. “We look forward to working with the new secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, the chancellor and their colleagues across the government to deliver the very best environment for British business to create jobs, growth and prosperity for everyone, across the country.” However, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned that it was vital that the new government department closely worked with Liam Fox’s international trade department. It also called for stability in the government’s dealings with business. Clark is the third business secretary in just over a year, following in the footsteps of Javid and Cable, who held the role while the coalition was in government between 2010 and 2015. Adam Marshall, acting director general of the BCC, said: “Businesses like continuity. They will hope that the people being appointed now will be in place for some period of time.” Javid, an advocate of free markets, had frustrated business leaders by reining back Cable’s industrial strategy and its focus on expanding Britain’s high-technology engineering sectors, such as aerospace and car manufacturing. Javid was accused of keeping industries at arm’s length, although he said that he had simply shifted from an industrial strategy to an “industrial approach”. Javid said in March at the Lord Mayor’s trade and industry dinner that Cable’s approach was “well regarded among those it benefited” but was also “strictly limited”. He added: “I’m not trying to pick winners. I’m working to create the conditions in which all British businesses can thrive. My approach can best be described as non-interventionist but highly engaged.” However, Javid was forced to intervene in the steel industry after Tata Steel announced in March that it was considering pulling out of the UK, putting 15,000 jobs at risk. Javid was heavily criticised for not doing to more to help the steel industry in the run-up to Tata Steel’s announcement. He was in Australia with his daughter when the Indian company revealed its intentions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2015/dec/10/ice-and-the-sky-review-climate-change-pioneer-antarctica","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-10T22:15:00Z","webTitle":"Ice and the Sky review – a climate change pioneer's passion for Antarctica","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/10/ice-and-the-sky-review-climate-change-pioneer-antarctica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/dec/10/ice-and-the-sky-review-climate-change-pioneer-antarctica","fields":{"headline":"Ice and the Sky review – a climate change pioneer's passion for Antarctica","bodyText":"The title of this nature documentary says it all – all about scientific data mined from the Antarctic telling you what is happening up there in the sky or in the air around us.

Lorius was able to take samples deeper and deeper in the ice, which effectively contained fossilised records of its ambient temperature hundreds or thousands of years ago: the evidence showed an unmistakable upswing in the last century, and Lorius realised that mankind’s CO2 emissions were heating up the atmosphere. He has lived long enough to see these insights accepted as mainstream fact (the movie shows the remarkable footage of Margaret Thatcher’s 1989 speech to the UN in which she declares that manmade climate change exists – she was arguing for nuclear power) though bruised by the aggressive dissidents.

For years, intelligence officials – in particular the electronic surveillance centre GCHQ – have warned that Chinese hacking attacks are one of the most substantial threats to Britain’s cybersecurity. When the Foreign Office announced in 2011 that it had repelled an attack on its internal communications from “a hostile state intelligence agency”, officials briefed that China was the culprit. Now George Osborne says Britain wants to be “China’s best partner in the west”, and to that end Chinese companies will be permitted to build a nuclear power station in Bradwell, Essex, possibly the first of several such ventures. The dissonance has not gone unnoticed. “All western countries are torn between their desire to cash in on China’s rise and their fears about China’s longer-term intentions,” said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “The United States goes to great lengths to try to protect their critical infrastructure from China – from stopping China from investing in oil companies and windfarms to placing limits on telecoms companies like Huawei. Americans are slightly horrified by the open-door approach of the UK government, which welcomed Huawei to protect the London tube and to run its nuclear power stations.” China already owns a significant slice of the UK’s strategic infrastructure. The state-owned China Investment Corporation owns roughly 10% shares in Heathrow airport and Thames Water. Chinese investors have bought up British ports and a third of the UK passenger train fleet. Nor is this the first time Chinese companies have been involved in highly sensitive technology. In 2013, parliament’s intelligence and security committee complained about a “disconnect between the UK’s inward investment policy and its national security policy”. It said a cybersecurity unit set up to check Huawei equipment being sold to the UK should be staffed by GCHQ. However, a subsequent review allowed Huawei staff to stay in place, with greater UK oversight. Matthew Cottee, a non-proliferation and disarmament researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the construction of a nuclear reactor raised specific security issues. “Obviously there are measures in place to protect nuclear plants against cyber-attacks, but whether those present a risk or not at this stage is going to be a pretty controversial issue amongst the British public. Imagine having Chinese contractors on a British nuclear site. The potential for insider threats is pretty massive. “Having talked to Chinese officials, the general response is that you don’t have to worry about that because our political system means we don’t suffer from that kind of threat. Obviously in Britain the regulatory environment is somewhat different, so how they cope with that will be interesting to see.” Speaking at the Royal United Services Institute on Tuesday, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, said: “What is important is that we are open for international investment including Chinese investment and we encourage other countries involved in nuclear power to get familiar with our regulatory regime, which is one of the strictest in the world.” When asked whether he could envisage Russia being given a similar nuclear contract, Fallon said it would be “hard to imagine”. Prof Steve Tsang, a senior fellow of the China policy institute at Nottingham University, said: “It clearly shows that the UK’s China policy and energy policy are now made by the Treasury, not by the Foreign Office and energy department.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/sep/16/george-osborne-centrist-pro-european-rival-to-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-16T09:13:31Z","webTitle":"George Osborne poses as centrist pro-European rival to Theresa May","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/sep/16/george-osborne-centrist-pro-european-rival-to-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/sep/16/george-osborne-centrist-pro-european-rival-to-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne poses as centrist pro-European rival to Theresa May","bodyText":"George Osborne has warned Theresa May that he will be the champion of “the liberal mainstream majority” as he questioned her policies on grammar schools and her “wobble” on the “northern powerhouse” initiative. In his first broadcast interview since being sacked as chancellor by the new prime minister, Osborne signalled his ambition for a return to high office and made a series of pointed remarks about policies. Osborne said May had made a “strong start” as prime minister but offered her only lukewarm support and signalled that he would fight her from the backbenches on grammar schools and any moves towards a hard Brexit deal. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said he voted for May in the leadership race, but pointedly added: “I think she is the best person for the job of the candidates who put themselves forward.” In the earlier interview, Osborne said he was not ready to follow David Cameron out of frontline politics. “I don’t want to write my memoirs because I don’t know how the story ends and I want to hang around and find out,” he said. He suggested he would resist May’s plan for grammar schools from the backbenches. He said: “I have always thought with the debate about grammars that 80% of the political discussion is about where 20% of children go, when in fact we should be focusing on where 80% of the children go in a selective system. I think the real focus of education reform remains the academy programme, transforming the comprehensive schools that most people send their children to.” He positioned himself as a pro-European centrist rival to May’s government, saying: “I will be championing ... the liberal mainstream majority of this country … who do not want to be governed from the extremes, who want Britain to be internationalists, outward-looking, free-trading, who want a socially just society. That is the cause that I believe in.” He denied he disliked May after the former energy minister Ed Davey claimed he had repeatedly clashed with her when they were cabinet colleagues. After being played a clip of Davey’s remarks, he said: “I have worked with Theresa for 20 years in opposition and in government. I think she is a person of real integrity and intelligence and, frankly, in a cabinet that included Ed Davey she was one of the grownups.” In Manchester to launch the new Northern Powerhouse Partnership on Friday, which he will chair, Osborne said the idea was “here to stay”. May has barely mentioned the “northern powerhouse” idea since becoming prime minister. She has spoken instead of a broader “proper” industrial strategy, nationwide, rather than a regional focus solely on the north. Osborne said: “To be honest, there was a little bit of a wobble, when we had the new administration about whether they were still committed to the concept of the northern powerhouse.” “We need to support economic development across the whole of the country. I sweated blood to get a [directly elected] mayor for Birmingham ... but in the north of England there is a particular opportunity.” Osborne said May was “perfectly entitled to take a pause” over big decisions such as the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant. But he pointed out that the revised deal the government announced on Thursday was essentially the same as the one he had struck. “I am very pleased we are going ahead with the Hinkley power plant. I don’t think anything has fundamentally changed from the deal that we put together in government just a few months ago,” he said. Osborne said he would “not necessarily” be a distraction to May’s government. And he said being out of a job had given him a chance to reflect on past mistakes and the future challenges. He said: “I was shadow chancellor at the age of 33 and for over 11 years I’ve been travelling at about 100 miles an hour every day. “I’m not pretending this is where I thought I would end up this summer. But actually plan B is quite enjoyable and it has given me chance of doing something that is very difficult to do in government, which is think again about where I made mistakes, think about the big problems that lie ahead for our country and the big challenges.” He said he did not regret making dire economic warnings about Brexit. “I definitely did not get right my judgment of the national mood. I don’t think I properly understood the alienation that many people felt, not just from the European Union, but the establishment. Later, speaking at the official launch of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, his business-backed thinktank, he revealed he had not spoken to May about the project, but insisted she supported rebalancing power away from London towards the northern cities and counties. Asked by the Guardian whether May had met him to discuss the project, Osborne said: “No, I’ve spoken to Sajid Javid, who is the communities secretary, about this initiative and talked to him about that.” He insisted it wasn’t a concern that he had not spoken to or met May to discuss her views on the initiative. “Having spent six years in Downing Street, that’s not the way it works. You approach the relevant cabinet minister, which is Sajid Javid, and you speak to him about it.” He added: “Of course, when you get a new government, a new administration, you want to see what are the ideas on the table, do they want to proceed with them all. And they thought about the northern powerhouse but they have now committed to it. Theresa May has committed to it, Sajid Javid has committed to it and across the government there are people whose previous roles were involved in building the northern powerhouse.” During the event at Manchester town hall, Osborne awas asked whether he felt that as a lowly backbencher he wouldn’t be listened to, and had concluded he would have more power if he founded the thinktank. He said. “I think as a backbench MP and a member of parliament for the north of England, I can help as well bring the private sector together, bring civic leaders of the north of England together. Because in the end if we are just going to rely on Whitehall for all the decisions then that is not going to work for the north of England.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2016/aug/16/werner-herzog-lo-and-behold-film-lessons","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-16T12:00:33Z","webTitle":"Trolls, Terminator and telepathic Tinder: five lessons from Werner Herzog's new film","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/16/werner-herzog-lo-and-behold-film-lessons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2016/aug/16/werner-herzog-lo-and-behold-film-lessons","fields":{"headline":"Trolls, Terminator and telepathic Tinder: five lessons from Werner Herzog's new film","bodyText":"In Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World, Werner Herzog shines a light on the internet and the way it has transformed how we communicate, work, date and entertain ourselves. The documentary takes a tour of some of the world’s top laboratories exploring robotics, artificial intelligence and space travel while also digging into the dark underbelly of connectivity, including malicious hacking and trolling. Here’s what we learned. It’s very hard to make the inception of the internet sexy The film opens at the “birthplace of the internet”, in a nondescript corridor at UCLA. There, in 1969, a team led by computer science professor Leonard Kleinrock sent the very first message – the word Lo – over the Arpanet, a computer network that would later become the internet. Despite rousing music and dramatic storytelling from Kleinrock, it is strikingly apparent that there is nothing sexy about the first node of the internet: a fridge-sized machine called the Internet Message Processor. Kleinrock tries to inject some pizzazz, describing the machine’s innards as having a “delicious old odour”. Things don’t improve when the film-maker cuts to a shot of the International Space Station (because space is always sexy) as a bit of light relief from the monotony of server farms, chalk-scrawled equations and old white guys talking about the underlying principles of the network. Humans are the weakest link in security There’s a lot of fearmongering about the internet, but one of the most engaging and enlightening interviews within the documentary is with Kevin Mitnick, a notorious hacker who broke into the networks of companies such as IBM, Nokia and Motorola. Brimming with pride, he describes the cat-and-mouse game he played with the FBI and the social engineering he used to crack Motorola. This involved calling an employee at the company to convince her to send him the source code for a new cellphone. He relied on the gift of the gab to pull off the heist rather than code wizardry. Mitnick explains that it doesn’t matter how much money a company spends on firewalls, antivirus and other intrusion prevention systems: humans are always the weakest link in security. “People, not the technology,” he insists. Elsewhere in the film, it’s the technology that’s the villain. There’s a gut-wrenching account of the harassment of the Catsouras family, whose daughter Nikki was killed in a car crash. Trolls anonymously emailed graphic photos of Nikki’s body at the scene of the accident to her father, Christos. Her mother Lesli blames the internet itself, describing it as the “manifestation of the antichrist”. If the internet goes down you could join Elon Musk on Mars If a solar flare takes out satellites and power, it won’t just be cat videos we’ll miss. The internet is now so fundamental to our food supply chain, financial system and transportation network that “modern civilisation would collapse” and the world would become “unimaginably ugly and difficult”, in the words of cosmologist Lawrence Krauss. There is an escape plan: Elon Musk wants to colonize Mars. But after seeing him interviewed in Lo and Behold, you might think twice about taking him up on the offer. When Herzog asks him what he dreams about, there’s a long pause where his eyes dart from left to right as he apparently defragments his hard drive before revealing that he only remembers his nightmares. Later, he reveals a Bond-villain-esque plan for an artificially intelligent hedge fund that would short consumer stocks, buy long on defence stocks and then start a war. “And that would obviously be quite bad,” he says, with all the emotion of a vacuum cleaner. We’re a long way off from a Terminator/Skynet scenario There’s a charming array of robots showcased throughout the film, including a team of football-playing bots; self-driving cars; and a rescue droid called Chimp. The latter, we are told, could have used its gripper to open a valve and prevent an explosion at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Later, there’s a philosophical discussion about us needing to more clearly define what it means to be human so we can encode ethics into robots and artificial intelligence as they start making decisions on our behalf. There’s an accompanying shot of Honda’s Asimo robot, a startlingly cute humanoid that is seen serving a drink to a female companion. But there are some downsides: it takes half a day to set up, requires two people to control it and has a battery that lasts around an hour. It also has a tough time dealing with stairs. Telepathic Tinder is going to be extremely awkward The most terrifying moment in the film is the showcasing of a system that uses an MRI scanner to essentially read a person’s thoughts, regardless of which language they speak. The scanning data is combined with software that maps patterns of electrical activity in the brain to specific concepts. While the system is currently fairly crude and reliant on massive specialised equipment, in the future it’s likely we’ll have lightweight personal brain activity monitors. This opens the possibility for brain-to-brain wireless communication – ie telepathy. (“You could essentially, in the not too distant future, tweet thoughts,” says neuroscientist Marcel Just.) Herzog has something else on his mind: “Could you detect this woman who is passing by and spots you is just about to fall in love with you?” he asks. “Now that would be the killer application,” replies Just’s colleague, computer scientist Tom Mitchell. The prospect of a telepathic Tinder, where our unedited thoughts are broadcast to prospective suitors, is utterly dreadful and not too far away.

An issues paper released by the Department of Industry, which will inform an upcoming energy white paper, states that the need for low-carbon fuels means that nuclear is an option that can be “readily dispatched into the market”. The UK, the paper notes, has announced plans for new nuclear power generation, although Germany is looking to shut down its nuclear capacity in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in Japan. “A growing area of global interest is in the use of small modular reactors, which have the potential to reduce the cost uncertainties and construction timeframes associated with current generation reactor designs,” the paper states. “These reactors could be factory built, highly standardised and even used in locations without advanced infrastructure. “The smaller size of the reactors may allow for more flexible deployment, making nuclear electricity available to isolated areas or countries with small or distributed electricity grid systems that cannot support conventional large-scale nuclear power.” The paper adds that while the government recognises that the cost of renewable energy, such as wind and solar, will continue to fall, it is seeking comments on how “the uptake of high-efficiency, low-emissions intensity electricity generation can be progressed”. While nuclear power isn’t as carbon intensive as coal, there has been longstanding bipartisan opposition to developing the energy source in Australia. The Howard government banned domestic nuclear energy, despite Australia having some of the largest uranium deposits in the world. A spokeswoman for the industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, told Guardian Australia the government’s position was unchanged despite the paper’s seemingly warm words for nuclear. “The government’s energy white paper process will be comprehensive. However, the Coalition has no plans to pursue nuclear energy,” she said. “Nuclear energy won’t become part of Australia’s energy mix without bipartisan and community support.” The risks of the processes involved in nuclear energy have been highlighted recently by the spill at the Ranger uranium mine in Kakadu. The incident, anti-nuclear activists claim, is a stark reminder of why Australia should remain nuclear-free. “I think the Coalition is trying to keep the door open to the option of nuclear, although it can see politically and economically it doesn’t add up,” said Dave Sweeney, nuclear free campaigner at the Australian Conservation Foundation. “There’s no doubt there are people within the Coalition who would want to embrace nuclear. We are aware of that and that sort of ideology concerns us, so we aren’t complacent. But it’s quite unthinkable that any private company would want to fund nuclear in Australia due to the huge start-up cost. “The government doesn’t want to critique nuclear because it raises the question ‘why then are we digging it up and having spills in the Kakadu?’. But there are huge political and economic hurdles to bringing in nuclear power. The numbers just don’t stack up, in dollars or votes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/apr/19/calls-for-ability-to-prosecute-exploitation-of-whitehall-contracts","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-19T17:15:00Z","webTitle":"Calls for ability to prosecute exploitation of Whitehall contracts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/19/calls-for-ability-to-prosecute-exploitation-of-whitehall-contracts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/apr/19/calls-for-ability-to-prosecute-exploitation-of-whitehall-contracts","fields":{"headline":"Calls for ability to prosecute exploitation of Whitehall contracts","bodyText":"Former ministers and civil servants who exploit their Whitehall contacts without clearance should face prosecution, the head of a lobbying watchdog has said. Angela Browning, the chair of the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba), called on Tuesday for new powers that would allow the criminal pursuit of those who deliberately ignore the committee’s instructions. Her intervention came after revealing that a record number of former ministers are seeking permission to take jobs in sectors they used to regulate. David Cameron’s government has been accused of failing to give the committee powers to stop exploitation of the “revolving door” between Whitehall and big business. More than 25 former government ministers are being paid thousands of pounds a day working as directors, advisers and chairs since leaving their posts in government. Appearing before the public administration and constitutional affairs committee on Tuesday, Lady Browning was told by several MPs that her committee was “toothless” and unable to keep ministers and civil servants in check. She said she could only work within her remit and called for new powers to help her and the committee do their jobs. “At present, I can only work within the current regulations,” she said. Paul Flynn, a Labour member of the committee, raised the decision by former energy minister Ed Davey to take up five new jobs in the private sector since losing his seat at the last general election. Flynn claimed that Davey’s negotiations to provide a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point meant he was in a prime position to exploit his knowledge. “[Davey] negotiated what was described as one of the worst contracts – he gave us the most expensive electricity in the world; three times the going rate,” said Flynn. “He’s now lost his seat in the house, formed a consultancy and he does deals with four companies that stand to benefit from this crazy contract that he settled as a minister. “Isn’t there a suspicion that his decision to sign this generous contract, which was very much against the public interest, might have been influenced by his future prospects of earning money when he left the house from these four businesses?’ Browning said her committee was conscious of the problem and had sought assurances from Davey that he would not work on the Hinkley Point contract at all. Browning said: ‘If he does, that is a real problem because I do not have any powers to bring them to court.’ Asked whether she would like such powers, she said: “Yes I would.” Responding to Browning’s calls, Davey told the Guardian that he would welcome any decision to give additional legal powers to Acoba. However, he said it was ridiculous to claim that might have he set out to exploit his contacts in Whitehall, as Flynn claimed. “Paul Flynn is, not for the first time, making deeply misleading claims about me and the contract I negotiated, which is much better than he claims,” Davey said. “I was very disappointed to lose my seat which I fought to win.” The committee questioned Browning over her own credentials to oversee former ministers’ outside interests. Browning told the committee that she is able to earn up to £800 a day as a consultant to the private sector, but said she only worked two days last year. She also confirmed that all other members of Acoba have outside interests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/defence-and-security-blog/2016/apr/04/from-the-cost-of-trident-to-special-forces-in-libya-britain-is-silent","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-04T16:02:57Z","webTitle":"From the cost of Trident to special forces in Libya, Britain is silent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/defence-and-security-blog/2016/apr/04/from-the-cost-of-trident-to-special-forces-in-libya-britain-is-silent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/defence-and-security-blog/2016/apr/04/from-the-cost-of-trident-to-special-forces-in-libya-britain-is-silent","fields":{"headline":"From the cost of Trident to special forces in Libya, Britain is silent","bodyText":"Terrorism, in or out of the EU, migrants and refugees, and tax dodging, may have been dominating the headlines. But significant moves relating to military force - from Trident to special forces - must not be allowed to pass by. The Ministry of Defence suggested it had little or no idea how much replacing Trident will cost. It was not going to tell us anyway. “The government needs a safe space away from the public gaze to allow it to consider policy options for delivering the deterrent in the most cost-effective way, unfettered from public comment about the affordability of particular policy options...”, it said. The MoD’s confession - if that is what it was - came in response to a freedom of information request from Reuters news agency. Previously, the MoD has said replacing the existing four-submarine Trident nuclear missile fleet would cost £31bn though it had set aside an addtional £10bn contingency fund. £3.9bn has already been spent on submarine design work. Crispin Blunt, Tory chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, has calculated, on the basis of parliamentary answers, that a new Trident system would cost £167bn over a 30-year lifespan. Meanwhile, Britain’s steel industry is in danger of collapsing and the government is struggling to finance nuclear power stations for civil use. Jon Thompson, the MoD’s then top official, told the Commons public accounts committee last year that Trident was the programme that most kept him awake at night. “It’s the single biggest future financial risk we face. The project is a monster”, he said. Thompson added that it was an “incredibly complicated area to estimate future costs”. Defence ministers simply describe all estimates put them as figures they “do not recognise”. Defence officials said protection against cyber attacks on British and US Trident submarines is to be upgraded, confirming earlier reports in the Guardian about potential vulnerabilities. Potential vulnerablites of the estimated 1,800 tonnes of nuclear material stored in 24 countries was discussed at last week’s “nuclear security conference” in Washington. The final communique opening words state: “The threat of nuclear and radiological terrorism remains one of the greatest challenges to international security, and the threat is constantly evolving.” The British government, meanwhile, increased its commitment to Gulf states by signing a defence cooperation agreement with Qatar and leading a “joint maritime force in the Gulf to deter piracy, tackle terrorism, and disrupt smuggling”. The MoD said Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, also visited Saudi Arabia “to help strengthen the UK-Saudi Defence relationship.” The human rights group, Reprieve, said Saudi Arabia executed 82 people so far this year, according to new research, suggesting the country was on course to behead twice as many prisoners as last year. Reprieve noted that the British government had previously raised the cases of three people sentenced to death as children over their alleged involvement in political protest. And as the MoD announced further air strikes by Typhoon and Tornado aircraft on Isis positions in Iraq, the Guardian reported that British special forces were operating on the ground in Libya. This was something on which the government refused to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/apr/28/arrested-myself-supporting-nuclear-power-george-monbiot","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-04-28T10:00:01Z","webTitle":"Today I arrested myself for supporting nuclear power.

They are: \"deportation or forcible transfer of population\", \"imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law\", and \"enforced sterilisation\". I've always been pretty good at managing my time, and I've succeeded in fitting these in between writing books and articles, childcare and campaigning. Or so I've discovered from a new website, promoted by The Ecologist magazine, called Arrest Monbiot. It's not a joke; they really mean it. And, if you're interested, they're offering real money as a bounty. The website, set up by a group (or person?) called Radiation Free Lakeland, explains that by arguing in favour of nuclear power, I have \"knowingly and systematically violated\" the Rome statute of the international criminal court and have been deporting, imprisoning and sterilising the world's people. Some of the rules for performing a peaceful citizen's arrest on me bear an uncanny similarity to the rules for apprehending Tony Blair on the Arrest Blair site I set up. Arguing against abandoning our primary source of low-carbon energy during a climate change emergency is, it seems, directly comparable to launching an illegal war in which hundreds of thousands died. There is one crucial difference. While Arrest Blair invites public donations, then pays out a quarter of whatever's in the pot to successful claimants, all of whom so far have received over £2,000, ArrestMonbiot offers only £100 for an attempt to bring me to justice. £100! Don't they know who I am? Insulted hardly begins to describe it. I merit a price on my head of at least, oh I don't know, £120. But thinking it over, I realised that for £100 I could buy a white cat to stroke, or another shark for my pool. Moreover, there's no limit to the number of potential bounty payments: the founders of the site appear to have agreed to keep shelling out – from their own pockets – however many times I'm nabbed. So, at 0724, this morning, I duly arrested myself. As the website advised, I took myself by the shoulder and explained that this is a citizen's arrest for \"nuclear crimes against humanity\" and invited myself to accompany me to the nearest police station to answer the charge (I declined for the time being, as I'm a bit busy, but I might turn myself in later). I have now applied to Arrest Monbiot for £100. If anyone else wants a go, I will come quietly for 50%. I will use the money, if they agree to send it to me, to help finance research into the development of integral fast reactors, which could (an estimate endorsed by a government chief scientist suggests) transform our nuclear waste pile into enough energy to power the UK for 500 years, without carbon emissions, thus solving three problems (nuclear waste, our future energy supply, and most of our contribution to global warming), all at once. It all makes perfect sense. But now a terrible thought strikes me.

The video, purportedly filmed by a bystander during a protest in Toulouse on Thursday, shows the woman crossing a pavement before the officer pushes her shoulder and seemingly grabs her by the neck. Her head is thrown back and she is rammed against a railing before falling to the ground. The protests are against François Hollande’s planned labour bill, which aims to make it easier for companies to hire and fire workers, and which was forced through parliament without a vote this month. Fuel shortages sparked by days of nationwide refinery strikes and blockades are easing across the country after several fuel depots were liberated by police, but the transport minister, Alain Vidalies, told journalists that although “the situation is getting better”, the crisis wasn’t over. On Friday riot police swept away a blockade of burning tyres at an oil depot near a Total refinery in Donges, western France. Police have cleared all 15 blockades around the country, leaving only one depot still shut by a strike. “Unblocking these depots will allow an increase in delivery capacity to resupply more and more petrol stations,” a transport ministry spokesman said. Six of France’s eight oil refineries were still either closed or operating at reduced capacity due to ongoing union action. Hollande said he would not give in to unions’ demands to withdraw the measures, which he has said will loosen France’s rigid labour market, cut red tape and tweak rules that deter employers from hiring. “I will stand firm because I think it is a good reform,” Hollande said at the G7 summit in Japan. “Our primary duty … is to do everything to maintain the supply of fuel to the public and to continue to provide essential public services.” In Paris on Thursday riot police arrested 16 people and fired teargas at about 100 people on the edge of a protest march. Several masked people smashed shop windows and cars were damaged near the route of the march. There were skirmishes at Place de la Nation as riot officers cordoned off protesters, some of whom complained of heavy-handed policing. Police estimated that between 18,000 and 19,000 people took to the streets in Paris, while unions put the figure at 100,000. Street marches took place in other towns and cities including Toulouse, Bordeaux and Nantes. A recent poll found that seven out of 10 people in France still oppose the labour reforms, but Parisians’ patience for strikes appeared to be running dry. “The CGT [union] presents itself as representing the people, but they are only 3% of the workforce,” pensioner Genevieve de Maud’huy told AFP. Carine Zarkout, an engineering student, said: “We are suffering the collateral damage. Lots of people … are losing money every day.” Benjamin Pastor, an estate agent, said: “I don’t know who is being polled. If they call people’s homes, it’s people who are either unemployed or who aren’t affected.” France is due to host around 2 million visitors at the Euro 2016 football championships in two weeks’ time. Unions have called for rolling strikes on the Paris Metro to start on the day of the opening match on 10 June. British motorists taking road trips to France this bank holiday weekend were advised they should “fill up to the brim” at the last petrol station in Dover. France’s civil aviation body appealed to airlines to fuel up abroad before arriving in Paris from European destinations to ensure they could make the return flight. Air France said the measure was precautionary. “There is no shortage at this stage,” the airline said. Strikes at nuclear power stations– which provide three-quarters of the country’s electricity – have so far failed to affect supply, authorities said. The employers’ federation Medef expressed growing anger over the effect the strikes were having on France’s fragile economic growth. Medef’s chief, Pierre Gattaz, condemned the “thugs’ methods” of the unions and urged the government to “resist their blackmail”. The prime minister, Manuel Valls, has insisted the legislation will not be withdrawn, but said it might still be possible to make changes or improvements."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/sep/15/brexit-liberalism-post-liberal-age","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-15T19:16:38Z","webTitle":"Brexit was a revolt against liberalism.

We’ve entered a new political era","bodyText":"Six weeks ago, the British government unexpectedly turned down the dimmer switch on the Hinkley Point nuclear power station project. Today it insouciantly turned the switch right back up again. The deal – colossal in terms of its £18bn cost, UK energy needs and relations with sovereign investors like China – is still exactly the same in most of its essentials as it was in July. Yet while it now turns out that there will be no U-turn over Hinkley, the delay has involved something a bit more substantial than a governmental summer screen break. In today’s announcement, the business secretary, Greg Clark, highlighted that the go-ahead for Hinkley was subject to two conditions. One is that the UK government keeps a golden share in Hinkley and similar projects; the other is that ownership of key national assets will be subject to a national security test. These conditions should be seen as more than mere window dressing. True, similar conditions are the norm in many other major economies. True also, the British government possesses some powers of this kind already. Most people are likely to see them as utterly sensible. What is different, however, is the new political saliency given to such thinking, which accords to government an ineradicable place to act in the national interest. This suggests something bigger and deeper is changing in our politics. The insistence that government needs the power to exercise judicious control over the ownership of an industry in the national interest may seem sensible and moderate to most people. Yet it also seems revolutionary and radical. It is a break from a recent past in which global market forces have routinely been treated as the only secure basis for ownership decisions. Much the same goes for a requirement that a national security consideration be given to large infrastructure projects. This too sounds like common sense. Yet it needed saying. The UK’s appetite for inward investment is now so large that even national security is being increasingly relegated to the margins. The re-examination of Hinkley is actually less important in terms of the substance of the deal than for these wider signals. It is one sign among many that the economic liberalism of the political right, which has been in such ascendancy since the 1980s, no longer eclipses all other considerations, including the human cost. Clark didn’t bury George Osborne’s wish to be open for business – what a vacuous phrase it is – even in sensitive sectors this week. But he drew a line under it and, in a limited way, began to push back. Not before time, many will say. Not yet enough, lots will add. Both observations are right. But we should nevertheless see this moment in our history for what it is. At the end of the 20th century, the triumph of capitalism and democracy seemed at one stage so complete that an era of global economic liberalism appeared to beckon. Today the folly of that delusion has been made obvious by the financial crisis and its political consequences. But it is not just the economic liberalism of the 80s that has hit rough water. So too has the socio-cultural liberalism of the 60s, with its belief in universal rights and the meaninglessness of difference. That form of liberalism has not been able to withstand the challenge of militant Islamism, with its denial of any universality except its own dogmas. The impact on liberal politics and liberal nation states continues to be immense, visible in Britain in everything from Brexit to the rise in state investigatory powers. Liberalism is a Hydra-headed and extremely resilient creature. There are also few words in the political dictionary that mean so many different things in different contexts. Most of us consider ourselves liberals in some respects but not in others. Adherents of 60s social liberalism are not necessarily adherents of 80s economic liberalism, or vice versa. Nor is either liberalism quite as absolutist as is sometimes claimed. Most people are somewhere on a spectrum of views, whether on social issues or economics. We should not pronounce the death of liberalism prematurely. Just because it is full of contradictions and cannot solve the problems of the age, it does not follow that liberalism is ignoble or that it is doomed to collapse – still less that there is some self-evidently superior alternative. Most people, at least in Britain, still seem prepared to support the liberal democratic order and many of the important liberal social and economic ideas on which it rests. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly useful to see ours not as a liberal age but as a post-liberal one. There has been a rumbling discussion about post-liberalism for some years, triggered not least by concerns about the weakening impact of migration on national social democracies. But it is striking that this week saw the publication of a book by John Milbank and Adrian Pabst, which takes post-liberalism as an established reality and as the starting point for the examination of a new kind of politics based on a vision of social and personal virtue and what the authors dub conservative socialism. In Britain, the arrival of Theresa May in Downing Street in the wake of the Brexit vote is the most striking example of this shift. May is not an economic liberal like Margaret Thatcher or a social liberal like David Cameron. In fact, liberalism of any kind seems almost a marginal consideration in her thinking and her policy making. These are still early days, but May’s speeches, both before and after becoming prime minister, are unified by post-liberal thinking. All of this poses a particular problem to the one party in British politics that proudly defines itself as liberal. The Liberal Democrats have more immediate hand-to-mouth concerns as they gather for their conference in Brighton than whether liberalism is in terminal eclipse. Nevertheless, in government between 2010 and 2015, the Lib Dems were the victims both of the crisis of economic liberalism, in the shape of austerity, and the crisis of social liberalism, in the rise of anti-migrant feeling articulated by Ukip. Liberals need to get real as well as feel sorry for themselves. As Milbank and Pabst stress, liberalism is certainly not inherently bad, but it does have defects and inherent problems. Brexit is in part a revolt against a set of characteristics of modern liberalism. We have a new political agenda that no political party can afford to ignore. Whether we consider ourselves liberal or not, we increasingly inhabit post-liberal times."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"science/2016/may/21/francis-aston-nobel-medal-forgotten-chemist-predicted-atom-bomb","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-21T23:05:00Z","webTitle":"Nobel medal sale highlights work of forgotten chemist who predicted the atom bomb","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/may/21/francis-aston-nobel-medal-forgotten-chemist-predicted-atom-bomb","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2016/may/21/francis-aston-nobel-medal-forgotten-chemist-predicted-atom-bomb","fields":{"headline":"Nobel medal sale highlights work of forgotten chemist who predicted the atom bomb","bodyText":"The Nobel prize awarded to one of the world’s most colourful scientists – Francis Aston, an Edwardian surfing fanatic and early pioneer of motorcycle racing – is to be auctioned in London next month. The medal, a 200g disc made of 23-carat gold, was given to Aston in 1922 in recognition of the British chemist’s discovery of isotopes, elements with the same chemical properties but different atomic masses. His Nobel prize for chemistry is being sold by his family and is expected to fetch between £200,000 and £400,000, Bonhams said. The sale, which will also include bundles of letters, notebooks and other medals won by the Cambridge researcher, will highlight the work of a scientific genius who is largely unknown today, even in his own country. His research paved the way for the creation of modern nuclear physics and the atom bomb, developments that were predicted by Aston with remarkable foresight almost a century ago. In the Nobel acceptance lecture that he gave in December 1922, Aston argued that the discovery of isotopes showed that the nucleus of an atom must be bound by a force of enormous energy. “Should the researcher of the future discover some means of releasing this energy in a form which could be employed, the human race will have at its command powers beyond the dreams of scientific fiction,” he told his audience in Stockholm. Doubtful at the time if it would be possible to control nuclear energy, by 1936 he had become much more certain. “One day man will release and control its almost infinite power. We can only hope he will not use it exclusively in blowing up his next door neighbour.” Aston died in Cambridge at the age of 68 in November 1945, three months after Hiroshima was destroyed by an atomic bomb that his pioneering work had helped to create. Born to a well-off Birmingham family, Aston carried out most of his pioneering work at the Cavendish laboratory in Cambridge, where he worked from 1909. His early work suggested that atoms of one or two rare elements might have different isotopes – in other words they exist with different masses – and so he designed a highly accurate mass spectrograph to pinpoint these differences. Far from showing that the existence of isotopes was rare, however, his research indicated they were commonplace. “Respected atoms like chlorine and mercury have fallen to pieces into a shower of isotopes during last week alone,” he wrote to his sister in December 1919. The nucleus of the atom was more complex than previously realised. As one German physicist wrote to Albert Einstein to tell him of Aston’s work: “The era of nuclear speculation begins!” In the end, the explanation for the existence of isotopes was provided in 1932 with the discovery of the neutron. Different numbers of neutrons in an element’s nucleus explained the existence of isotopes, an understanding that was crucial in the subsequent harnessing of nuclear power. Apart from his painstaking scientific work, Aston was a fanatical cyclist, on one occasion cycling 200 miles in 22 hours. He built one of the very first motorcycles and later competed in some of the world’s first motorcycle races. He also travelled to Hawaii and learned how to surf – which probably made him the first, and only, surfer dude of Edwardian society. He was an accomplished climber and also proved to be an expert on the stock market, turning his Nobel prize money into a substantial portfolio. He never married – “probably because he never gave himself time to settle down,” said Matthew Haley, of Bonhams. As a result, most of his estate went to Trinity College, Cambridge. As to the purchaser of Aston’s medals and notebooks, these are likely to go to a private investor, Haley added. “The techniques that he developed are now crucial to understanding climate change, locating oil deposits, forensics and many other modern technologies. There will be no shortage of entrepreneurs who would like to have his medals and notebooks in their possession.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"community/2016/feb/12/japan-tsunami-five-years-on-share-your-experiences-and-memories","type":"article","sectionId":"community","sectionName":"Community","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-12T12:15:42Z","webTitle":"Japan tsunami five years on: share your experiences and memories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2016/feb/12/japan-tsunami-five-years-on-share-your-experiences-and-memories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2016/feb/12/japan-tsunami-five-years-on-share-your-experiences-and-memories","fields":{"headline":"Japan tsunami five years on: share your experiences and memories","bodyText":"Japan is preparing to mark five years since a massive earthquake triggered a tsunami that devastated much of its north-east coast, killing more than 18,000 people and leaving many still unable to return to their homes. In the run up to planned memorials, we’d like to collect some of your memories. Shocking images of 10m-high waves reverberated around the world on 11 March 2011 as the scale of the disaster became clear, with survivors describing the agonising moments relatives were swept from their grasp as livelihoods crumpled. After death and destruction followed panic and confusion as both Japanese and global media struggled to make sense and communicate the implications of damage done at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Conflicting advice on the radiation risk led to distrust in governments as aid agencies scrambled and infastructure nationwide ground to a crawl, with the waters muddying further in the days and weeks after the initial tragedy. We know many readers – whether Japanese or not and both within the country and abroad – will have memories of that day and the events following: if you are able to share them we want to make your voices and experiences part of our ongoing coverage. Were you living in Japan or even specifically the areas hit? What are your memories of that day, and how do they relate to your longer-term experiences five years on? How have you been personally affected? Even if you weren’t directly affected by the earthquake and tsunami, did you leave Japan because of events or ongoing anxiety, or move to a different part of the country? Maybe you weren’t in the country but had family or friends who were? Perhaps you were one of the thousands working and volunteering to help with the recovery efforts. There has been frustration at the slow pace of rebuilding but also pockets of hope: how have you been involved?

Terrorism is at a record high and the effects of conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa have been felt far beyond the region. Worldwide, a record 65 million people were forced to flee their homes last year, with one in every 113 men, women and children a refugee, internally displaced or seeking asylum. What are the implications of all this for development? Can the global goals be realised if countries are beset by conflict? Is progress impossible without greater emphasis on peace-building? We asked students to give us their views. Below is a selection of the best responses. International collaboration on peace-building is paramount In developing countries, peace and development often coincide. [My country], Pakistan, was conceived out of a struggle for independence against the British followed by a bloody separation from India. At present, the country’s peace is severely compromised by Taliban attacks, sectarian violence and the international military operations of the US. Pakistan developed a strong military and strove to become a nuclear power, often at the cost of social development. Like me, many would argue that conflict prevention, or preparation for war, has made the government take a narrow view of development and prevented it from realising its potential in terms of industrialisation and social development. I believe engaging in the problem of chicken and egg, with respect to development and peace, is a digression. The need to collaborate on an international level to promote peace-building cannot be stressed enough, whether or not it is a condition of growth and development. Zahra Khan, London School of Economics, UK Development is on the back foot in Kashmir As [the Indian economist and philosopher] Amartya Sen famously noted, “Freedoms are not only the primary ends of development, they are also among its principal means.” Development should be assessed by access to factors such as political and economic freedom, social opportunities, and protective security. The [long-running conflict in] my homeland, India-administered Kashmir, has meant education, healthcare and environment haven’t been able to develop soundly. Unemployment is rampant; there is a lack of jobs for university graduates, and a lack of business investment. Kashmir is under a curfew [imposed early in July] due to unrelenting unrest that has claimed more than 68 lives, with thousands wounded. Scores have received pellet injuries in one or both eyes, leading to loss of vision. Development is on the back foot. Educational institutions have been closed, people can’t go to their jobs, the economy has plummeted and NGOs are being charged with sedition. Unless there is some form of peace and stability, no human endeavour, however powerful and well-meaning, can lead to progress and development. Madeeha Mukhtar, Government College for Women, Srinagar, Kashmir Peace-building is less costly than relief efforts Peace fosters conditions conducive to economic development. To promote an inclusive, sustainable and harmonious society, it is necessary to take peace-building measures. These measures should focus not on imposing solutions, but on the creation of economic, social spaces within which local people can identify, develop and employ the resources necessary to build a peaceful, prosperous and just society. Peace-building programmes are less costly than relief programmes, and should be considered an investment for future development and a tool for steering the peace-building process. Vaibhav Mishra, National University of Advance Legal Studies, Kochi, India NGOs must tackle causes of conflict Peace is a fickle and fleeting thing. Where I’m from – Belfast in Northern Ireland – peace is intrinsically linked to the cooperation of nationalists and unionists, Protestants and Catholics. It is tied to the idea of a peace process, whereby the Good Friday agreement, a treaty tied to the European convention on human rights, has defined how two opposite sects can live alongside each other in harmony. But this peace is neither universal nor solid, as dissident groups and individuals seek to undermine it daily. Brexit has potentially catastrophic implications for the peace in Northern Ireland, first for the validity of the peace process itself, and second if there is further separation from the Republic by a physical border. As such, the region’s peace is at risk, as well as its development. If sustainable development is to progress in poverty-stricken countries around the world, peacemaking must play its part. Money diverted to arms, and aid funding used to to repair the damage caused by conflict, takes away from investment in hospitals, schools and young people’s futures. However, it is the attitude that comes with war that is most significant, the placing of personal ambitions and strategies for power over the progression of the lives of your people. In Northern Ireland, rejecting this doctrine has so far enabled the fragile peace to endure. Until this power-hungry perspective changes, NGOs must focus on how to control the cause of the conflict. Lucy Keown, University of Glasgow, UK Working collaboratively in conflict zones is vital Development occurs in conflict. Local organisations can, in many instances, act more effectively than international organisations during conflict. Establishing trust and building relationships through transparent negotiations with other local groups allows workers certain access and protections that international organisations do not have. Relationships can be built with military forces, who are often less suspicious of local workers than international agencies. In Syria, for example, locals have persuaded military powers to focus their attacks on legitimate military targets rather than civilians. They have also asked that schools take priority over hospitals – which will inevitably draw shelling – so that future fighters have at least some education. If international organisations wish to contribute to development in areas of conflict, they need to focus their resources on supporting the needs and efforts of local people and workers, providing capability building, logistical aid and mental health support to those who experience death and destruction on a daily basis. Alex Kirby-Reynolds, Goldsmiths, University of London, UK Only peace can safeguard development There is an indisputable connection between peace and sustainable development. History has shown that whenever a state’s peace has been threatened or suppressed, the recovery process has involved significant efforts to rebuild a stable society and repair interstate relations damaged by conflict. Peace can guarantee the human security of today, but also the sustainable development of tomorrow.

No wonder the police monitor us","bodyText":"Elected Greens are being systematically monitored by the Metropolitan police because we do not buy into the ideas that uphold the establishment status quo. We ask difficult questions, we often support people who are causing waves, and we promote policies that mainstream politicians feel threatened by. We are part of a wider movement for change and we do our bit to defend people whose right to protest is under threat. For example, I have been a big defender of the monthly Critical Mass bike ride in London, the peaceful protesters at G8 and the student demonstrations. However it’s worth noting that I’ve also sat down with senior police officers to discuss issues such as how they deal with people trafficking, FGM, wildlife crime and hit-and-run drivers, and how they catch all sorts of other criminals. I’ve helped steer policing policy and earned respect from the senior ranks. Unlike most people on their domestic extremism database, I am known to them personally. We sit down for coffee, and we generally get on well. I hope that the police see us as reasonable people, but I also hope that Greens at City Hall will continue to have a proud record of asking difficult questions about the anti-terrorism strategy Prevent, deaths in custody, stop and search and all the other civil liberties issues that other parties sometimes get cold feet over championing. Above all, elected Greens have become effective at what we do. In the London Assembly, we have continued to ask difficult questions on numerous topics, including the excessive use of stop and search or the weak push for solar power in London, that have gradually become the basis for a cross-party consensus on what is going wrong. People I have met and championed in the early days of their campaigns, such as the women betrayed by undercover officers, have become well known as their stories get more coverage and traction. Policies that were seen as fringe, like cycling in London, or air pollution, have become part of the mainstream political agenda. Unlike many of the fringe groups and parties to the left of Labour, we can no longer be dismissed as merely a party of permanent protest. Anyone who looks at the series of pragmatic initiatives put forward by the Greens in the London assembly and our long list of achievements, big and small, has to accept that we have got things done. That doesn’t mean that we have gone soft on wanting fundamental change. These achievements and the way that we have shifted City Hall’s priorities are part of a larger vision of a different kind of society and a very different kind of economy. Perhaps the biggest reason why the police monitor the Greens is because we oppose many of the vested interests that exert undue influence over the running of our country. Nationally, Greens oppose nuclear power as an expensive, dinosaur technology. We have supported communities using nonviolent direct action to stop fracking, or big new roads being built. We support people making a clear moral case for animal welfare, or against arms fairs and nuclear weapons, such as Trident. All of this makes us a threat to the state, and to the less caring businesses linked to the government. In London we propose breaking the monopoly of big developers being given control over public land. They have failed to solve the housing crisis under the patronage of either Boris Johnson or Ken Livingstone. Greens are anti-establishment because we just don’t think the establishment does a very good job of running things. Elected Greens will act in the interests of the common good, not just the richest 1%, and that is why the Met police can’t take their eyes off us."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/feb/20/climate-change-dirty-air-pollution-global-warming-save-lives","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-20T07:00:41Z","webTitle":"Climate change politics is blinding us to the devastating effects of dirty air | John Vidal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/20/climate-change-dirty-air-pollution-global-warming-save-lives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/20/climate-change-dirty-air-pollution-global-warming-save-lives","fields":{"headline":"Climate change politics is blinding us to the devastating effects of dirty air","bodyText":"It is the greatest environmental hazard of the age. Nothing focuses our concern for the future more, divides rich and poor, exercises science, business, politicians, old and young. It is an existential threat, a generational battle. All political and financial resources must be concentrated on stopping climate change. But now that governments have signed up to the unambitious Paris climate agreement and pledged to try to limit greenhouse gas emissions, we must ask whether we have lost sight of everything else. Is the environment just about carbon and parts per million of gases in the atmosphere? What about the environment that we can smell, see and touch today? For 20 years or more concerns about nuclear waste, food production, the quality of river water, the health of our soils and seas, the fate of our forests, the impact of road-building and many other important ecological issues have been steadily marginalised, starved of resources or pushed off the agenda by climate change. Climate has become for government an excuse to build nuclear power and ditch other green policies. Money for biodiversity has been slashed, planning laws revoked, pollution and waste controls weakened and sustainable development policies rejected. Most popular and ministerial attention has been focused on energy companies and big carbon polluters, and the wider environment has visibly deteriorated. Seeing trees as sticks of carbon, air as gas, or forests as sinks is abstract, esoteric and emotionally stultifying. Most heinous of all the sins of emissions is what has happened to our air quality since climate change climbed the political agenda 20 years ago. No government wants us to know that far more people will suffer grievous illnesses and will die from the filthy air shrouding our cities than from any warming of the atmosphere in the next 30 years. Climate change may give us a glimpse of the terrifying future we are heading towards if we don’t change our ways, but toxic air is already here, and killing us in ever greater numbers. New estimates from the Global Burden of Disease project and the World Health Organisation state that between 5.5 and 7 million people die from air pollution every year. That’s more than die from malaria and HIV/Aids put together; more than the population of Scotland. In the next 10 years we can expect as many people to die from breathing poisonous air as were killed in the second world war. Most of those deaths will be in China and India which, in the name of extreme poverty eradication, have been transforming their cities and are now having to pay for a health crisis of their own making. But we in rich countries do not have the same excuses. Our industries and governments have known for well over a century the health effects of polluted air. Yet they have fought in Europe to be allowed to continue polluting, and people have been encouraged to switch to diesel and more polluting fuels because they emit less CO2. In Britain, 29,000 people die a year from breathing in particles of unburned carbon and construction dust, and an estimated 23,500 more as a result of nitrogen dioxide. To condone these deaths is unforgivable; to actively seek to carry on polluting is like declaring war on the public. It’s saying, “We know that the whole of Christchurch or half the city of Worcester will be asphyxiated next year, but there is nothing we think we should do about it.” But those 50,000 or more deaths a year are just the tip of the iceberg, hiding hospital wards full of people with heart disease, cancers and respiratory and lung problems caused by lifetimes spent breathing toxic air. No one counts the heartbreak when parents die young, or when children are unable to breathe properly or when Granny develops dementia – which is now linked to air pollution too. Nor does government want us to tell us how much air pollution really costs. This is reckoned by the European environment agency to be over £10bn a year in damage to people’s health, buildings, soil and water. That is dozens of new hospitals and schools, thousands of extra nurses and teachers, and enough left over to protect most of Britain’s premier conservation sites. After 20 years of battling to get government to take the climate seriously, we must wake up to the fact that the very air we breathe is killing us and making us bankrupt, yet governments are deliberately making the situation worse. Despite the Volkswagen scandal – the German car giant admitted that it cheated emissions tests in the US – new pollution limits for diesel cars have been delayed until 2019. On the drawing board in Britain are a new runway and hundreds of thousands more planes every year in the southeast, a massive national road-building programme, several new road crossings for east London taking air pollution into the heart of some of the poorest areas, the £50bn HS2 rail line, fracking, giant infrastructure projects from nuclear power stations and new ports. All will add to air pollution and to climate emissions. The government has developed tunnel vision. Because it sees environmental problems as many separate issues, it does not understand the links between them and the benefits of addressing them together. Yet the science shows that if air pollution is addressed, there will be a significant decrease in climate emissions. Restoring peat bogs and investing in conservation will not only improve biodiversity, reduce flooding and make for a healthier environment, it will also reduce greenhouse gases. We have been distracted by climate change and have let governments dictate the agenda. Now we must return to basics, and address all those issues that have been conveniently dropped. Who will get angry about the degradation of water quality, the plague of plastic in our seas? Mining? What about computer and smart phone waste? Litter? Population control? Endangered species? Unless we address mass consumption – the root of our environmental crisis – climate change will not only worsen, we will be left with a degraded world. Rather than solely trying to tackle the vast problem of climate change, we must address all the many factors which make it worse. It’s a case of looking after the green pennies and letting the green pounds take care of themselves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2016/may/17/rafsanjani-daughter-criticised-meeting-leader-banned-sect-iran","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-17T16:52:08Z","webTitle":"Rafsanjani daughter criticised for meeting leader of banned minority","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/17/rafsanjani-daughter-criticised-meeting-leader-banned-sect-iran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/may/17/rafsanjani-daughter-criticised-meeting-leader-banned-sect-iran","fields":{"headline":"Rafsanjani daughter criticised for meeting leader of banned minority","bodyText":"The daughter of a former president of Iran has been heavily criticised after she met one of the leaders of a persecuted religious minority. Faezeh Hashemi, a former MP and the daughter of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, broke ranks with the ruling establishment last week when she went to visit Fariba Kamalabadi, who had been given five days’ leave after eight years in jail. Kamalabadi and six other leaders of the Bahá’í faith, which is banned in Iran, are each serving 20 years in prison. Hashemi’s acquaintance with Kamalabadi dates from a period in 2012 when they were both held in the women’s ward of Tehran’s Evin prison. Hashemi, a reformist politician, spent six months behind bars for “spreading propaganda against the ruling system”, and has since described it as one of the most enlightening experiences of her life. The criticism started after a picture surfaced online showing Hashemi, wearing a hijab, sitting next to an unveiled Kamalabadi. Their meeting made front pages, and hardliners have called for Hashemi’s arrest. Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi, an influential cleric, said Hashemi had committed a religious crime and should face prosecution, while the judiciary chief, Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, labelled her behaviour as antisocial. Rafsanjani, who had been under pressure to comment on his daughter’s visit, described the Bahá’í faith as “a deviant sect” created by colonialists, which “we disavow and have always done”. Hashemi sounded unrepentant when speaking to Euronews later, saying she had been visiting a friend and had no regrets. Hashemi comes from a family closely connected to the 1979 Islamic revolution, when the authorities stepped up persecution of Bahá’ís. As many as 219 members of the faith were executed in the following years, and in 2014 officials started demolishing the Bahá’í cemetery in Shiraz, where many of the victims are buried. Rafsanjani played a key role in the revolution and later served as president for two consecutive terms. One of Iran’s great political survivors, he has continued to hold high-level positions even though two of his children have been jailed in recent years and in spite of a growing rift between him and the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Some analysts have suggested that the criticism of Hashemi is in fact aimed at undermining her father because of his success in recent elections for the assembly of experts, which is tasked with appointing the next supreme leader. The Bahá’í faith was founded in Iran in the 19th century by its prophet, Bahá’u’lláh. Iran has banned the faith since 1981 and deprived its members of many rights, including access to higher education and the right to own businesses. Iranian leaders are suspicious of the Bahá’í faith and often accuse its members of having links with or spying for Israel, mainly because the Bahá’í governing body is based in Haifa. There are about 300,000 Bahá’ís believed to be living in Iran, and about 6 million worldwide. Maziar Bahari, an Iranian journalist and campaigner, has launched Not a Crime, a global street art project with the aim of fighting for education equality in Iran, especially for Bahá’ís. His campaign has painted more than 20 murals about the issue in New York, London, Rio de Janeiro, Sydney, Cape Town, Delhi and other cities. “Most young Iranians today have Bahá’í friends, despite the fact the government continues to harass them and portray them in such a negative light,” he told the Guardian. “For me, and this is one of the reasons I started the Not A Crime campaign, the Bahá’ís are a barometer for what’s going on in Iran. When Iranian society is more repressed, it’s the Bahá’ís who are the first victims. It amazes me that a nation that wants to be a nuclear power is afraid of a group that are peaceful and quiet.” Between 70 and 80 Bahá’ís are currently in jail in Iran. In February a court in the northern province of Golestan sentenced 24 Bahá’í men and women to lengthy prison terms because of their religious affiliation. Iran’s judiciary chief has denied that Bahá’í citizens have been imprisoned on the basis of their religious faith. Iran recognises Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians as religious minorities. They all have parliamentary representative, and the captain of Iran’s national football team is a Christian, but the country is sensitive about citizens converting from Islam to other religions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2016/jun/04/what-are-french-strikes-about-and-will-they-affect-euro-2016","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-04T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"What are the French strikes about and will they affect the Euro 2016?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jun/04/what-are-french-strikes-about-and-will-they-affect-euro-2016","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2016/jun/04/what-are-french-strikes-about-and-will-they-affect-euro-2016","fields":{"headline":"What are the French strikes about and will they affect the Euro 2016?","bodyText":"What are the latest French strikes about? French workers are angry about employment law reforms in the so-called El Khomri bill, named after the employment minister Myriam El Khomri. The Socialist government and employers say the legislation makes the country’s strict employment laws more flexible – including allowing companies to negotiate the 35-hour maximum working week and cap severance payments if they need to shed staff in times of financial difficulty. It is hoped this will encourage firms to take on more staff, helping to lower the country’s high unemployment rate, now hovering above 10%. Workers oppose the law, claiming it makes their situation more precarious and undermines hard-won privileges and rights. The law has sparked the industrial action, but unions are also airing other grievances about working conditions and salaries. How are the strikes affecting France? It is a lot of sound and fury, plus slogans, with noisy demonstrations and some ancillary hooliganism, but daily life goes on, if a little more slowly. Strikers have blocked fuel depots, ports and power plants, and 16 of France’s 19 nuclear power stations have been hit by walkouts, but some protests have petered out and so far there have been no power cuts. There were fears of petrol shortages, but the government authorised the use of the country’s petrol reserves, which can theoretically last for three months. Long queues at some fuel stations last week were mostly caused by French drivers panic-buying for fear of a shortage. Train journeys are taking longer, with some services cancelled, but the strikes have yet to really bite. This may be about to change, with more widespread action planned in the next few weeks. Will they affect the Euro 2016 championships? “We’re not trying to block the Euros. It’s not transport strikes that will stop people going to matches,” says Philippe Martinez, leader of the CGT union – the oldest and most powerful in France – and a Barcelona fan. But, he adds, “it’s all in the government’s hands”. At the same time, the CGT has threatened to paralyse Paris and other cities. The reality for football fans is likely to be more complicated. The CGT has called for a rolling strike, and the SUD, whose members work on the Paris transport system, has asked its workers to begin similar open-ended action on 10 June, the first day of Euro 2016. Most disruption is expected on 14 June, when the unions have called for a national day of industrial action. Most petrol depots have been unblocked, but they could be the focus of further protests. Not all unions support the campaign. What should fans be aware of when they travel? It is hard to say how many workers will heed the strike call, or how affected transport will be. The government is likely to make promises of concessions to avoid major disruption to this showcase sporting event, but there will inevitable delays to air, sea and rail travel. Fans travelling to matches are advised to allow more time. Since 2007, rail workers have been required to give 48 hours’ notice of their intention to go on strike and assure a minimum service, so there will be trains. Exactly how many is anyone’s guess. What effect are the strikes having on François Hollande’s government? Hollande had already hit a record low in popularity, so it can hardly get much worse. The prime minister, Manuel Valls, has said it is his “responsibility” to make sure the bill is enacted. The government used an emergency constitutional clause to push the bill through the lower house of parliament without a vote. Is striking part of the French DNA? French historian Stéphane Sirot said it was an element of the French character: “It’s part of the long French tradition of taking to the streets,” Sirot told the Local publication. “The protests can be violent, which only increases the media attention and fuels the reputation, but when you look at statistics of the number of days lost to strikes in different countries during the past 100 years, France is generally in the middle of the table. In other countries, strikes often follow failed negotiations. In France they precede talks as a way of flexing union muscles. The French complain about disruption to their daily lives, but on the whole, they feel industrial action is for the greater good. The current round of strikes have elicited mixed feelings, with various polls showing that half the country supports the labour law being changed or withdrawn, but also roughly half support the industrial action."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/mar/31/port-talbot-steelworks-closure-would-be-fatal-short-termism","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-31T18:30:29Z","webTitle":"Port Talbot steelworks closure would be fatal short-termism | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/31/port-talbot-steelworks-closure-would-be-fatal-short-termism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/mar/31/port-talbot-steelworks-closure-would-be-fatal-short-termism","fields":{"headline":"Port Talbot steelworks closure would be fatal short-termism","bodyText":"It is hard not to be too cynical about the government’s approach to the steel crisis (Nationalisation not the answer to steel crisis, says David Cameron, theguardian.com, 31 March). It is unwilling to make any long-term commitment to save the industry. Instead, it looks to a series of short-term fixes to stave off closure of plants such as Port Talbot until after the May elections. If as expected no saviour for the industry appears, the government will adopt its preferred option of allowing the industry to close, selling off those assets that can be sold and converting the old sites into shopping centres, warehouses or theme parks. The folly of this approach can be shown with reference to the trade deficit, which at 6% of GDP is the highest of any in the developed world. This will only worsen when all steel in future has to be imported. There is a very real danger that the lost British steel will be replaced by imported Chinese steel of an inferior quality. I can cite as an example a British engineering firm whose American owners decided to import Chinese components for the products they produced. These cheap Chinese components were of such poor quality that they had to be re-engineered, prior to being used in production. The British government is as short sighted as these American owners, preferring the cheap option regardless of long-term damage to the economy that will result from its actions. Derrick Joad Leeds • Current political confusion in Britain should not blind us to the difficult strategic choices needed to get our economy moving in the right direction. Pent-up needs for much better infrastructure and affordable housing should enable Britain to build its way out of a hole, as Germany has done so well. But Larry Elliott (Key is sticking to an industrial strategy, 31 March) misses the key roles played by the state investment bank KfW, the cooperative savings banks, and the federal political system. We should use the crises over our steel, energy (and no doubt railways) to overhaul the way major development and infrastructure decisions are taken. The answers include devolving power over infrastructure investment to European-style regions and local investment banks. We also need a municipal investment corporation to vet the projects, rather than emergency cabinet meetings. Dr Nicholas Falk Director, London office, Urbed (Urbanism Environment and Design) Ltd • Stephen Kinnock MP is quoted as suggesting the government is “rolling out the red carpet to get market status at the World Trade Organisation” and suggested Britain is the “ringleader” in blocking European commission attempts to improve anti-dumping policies (on Chinese steel) because our commercial and overall policy is being “dictated by Beijing” (Ministers in “disarray” over steel industry, 31 March). This analysis needs to be spelled out more explicitly. It seems our steel is being sacrificed on the atomic altar of keeping China sweet over its investment in the planned Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, confidence in which is eroding even in France (Member of EDF board urges power plant delay, 31 March). British engagement with China over nuclear power dates back to the autumn of 2013, when chancellor George Osborne visited Beijing to seek investment in the Hinkley C project from the Chinese government and was finalised last September. The trade unionists now rightly defending their jobs and the steel industry should have words with the leadership of the Unite union, who are even more gung-ho for Hinkley C to go ahead than Conservative ministers, and point out they are not prepared to sacrifice their livelihoods for this astronomically expensive atomic white elephant, just to keep the Chinese on side. Dr David Lowry Senior research fellow, Institute for Resource and Security Studies, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA • Nils Pratley comments (Analysis, 31 March) that the UK government cannot be blamed directly for foot-dragging in Brussels over the application of import tariffs to dumped Chinese steel. The time being taken to settle this issue is not the only concern. You reported a couple of weeks ago that the UK government was lobbying for the lowest possible tariff to be set; a mere 16% or so, which would doubtless be shrugged off by China (compare the US’s 266%). If this is indeed the government’s position, it deserves to be widely known, as undermining its feeble pleas that it is doing “everything it can” to preserve a UK steel industry. Valerie Bayliss Sheffield • When the banking industry was close to collapse eight years ago, banks were nationalised speedily and with the full support of Conservative MPs including David Cameron. This saved many jobs. It secured the future of the industry and that of many who benefit from it. Today the steel industry faces a similar existential threat but Cameron says nationalisation is not the answer. Can anyone explain to me why our steel industry today deserves less prompt and effective action than our banking industry did then? Nigel Lindsay Bo’ness, West Lothian • Comforting to know that at least we’ll have Trident even if we can’t even roll a sheet of steel any more. Martin Jeeves (Ex-Steel Company of Wales, Port Talbot, 1967), Cardiff • Tata corporation – Indian global conglomerate – is closing Port Talbot steelworks. No great surprise since these global businesses are only interested in making money; no interest at all in maintaining employment in any particular country. Port Talbot is said to be losing £1m a day. Reasons given are cheap Chinese imports, high energy costs – some 50% higher than in France and Germany – and high business rates. All of these are to some extent a consequence of government policy or neglect. Conservative governments are not interested in protecting heavy industry that employs very large numbers of ordinary workers and where unions are potentially strong; look at what happened to coal mining, shipbuilding, British owned car manufacturing, etc. The present government is dependent on French and, it hopes, Chinese money to finance Hinkley Point nuclear construction and for many infrastructure projects, so it doesn’t want to annoy the Chinese by doing anything about their “dumping” of cheap steel. The government also argues that, even if it wanted to, it cannot use taxpayers’ money to save Port Talbot because of EU restrictions on state aid; curious how the EU is apparently to blame. How is it possible therefore for Germany, France and Italy to have state involvement in so much of their manufacturing industries? Thousands of millions of pounds, were used without question to rescue banks from the mess they had created. Why then cannot smaller sums be used to rescue a heavy industry whose problems are not of its own making, which employs a large number of ordinary workers, and which is of strategic importance to the future of British manufacturing? Clearly if there were a will there would be a way. Unfortunately this government is only interested in short-term policies that protect the well-off and reduce the role of the state. Fred Rogers Sparkford, Somerset • Although the UK has moved forward in the relationship between business and the union movement (unlike my home country Australia) there is still this belief that we can work in a global marketplace and continue with our workplace conditions and pay. When will we realise that we can’t compete in manufacturing with the likes of China, because we all want to buy or goods at home for the cheapest price? So governments/unions need to decide whether to continue in the global marketplace and import cheaper goods than manufactured at home, or to tax imports at a rate that provides an equal selling price to those we manufacture. Phil Wallbank Hobart, Australia • Your paper is right to make the case for an active industrial policy (Editorial, 31 March). The challenges facing Tata Steel show the importance of an industrial strategy to both companies and workers. Many comparable countries are already taking steps to support industry. The US has been quietly subsidising and protecting manufacturing industries, including car production. But this is not just a rich country problem. Industrial policies are equally – if not more – important for poorer countries. Yet the terms of many global trade deals and World Trade Organisation rules stop developing country governments from supporting their emerging industries. Decision-makers and opinion formers calling for the support of UK industry should be equally open to making the case for developing countries searching for a sustainable route out of poverty.

The UK routinely topped the annual league table for attractiveness to clean energy companies, run by consultancy Ernst &amp; Young (EY), in the mid-2000s. For the first time, however, it has slid to 13th in the global rankings. Investors in renewable energy are being put off the UK by political posturing hostile to renewables and green efforts, and the slashing of government support for clean power supplies, in favour of potentially more expensive alternatives such as shale gas and nuclear power. Renewable energy investment worth tens of billions a year, and thousands of jobs, is likely to be lost by the UK as a result, the report found. Ben Warren, energy corporate finance leader for EY, said the results showed the government had a long climb if it wished to restore the UK’s leadership in gaining new energy investment. “A non-committal approach is putting the attractiveness of the UK’s renewable energy sector on a landslide. The current approach is going against the grain of almost universal global support for renewables, and is masking the UK’s advantages of a growing energy imperative as ageing power plants are retired, strong natural resources, and efficient capital markets.” If current policies, or government attitudes, prevail, then “the only way for the UK is down” in terms of renewable energy, he said. However, wind energy companies said they were “confident” that the UK’s renewable energy market would continue to grow. Hugh McNeal, chief executive of RenewableUK, which represents wind companies, told the Guardian: “The government has made it clear that the UK’s energy needs will be met by gas, nuclear and renewables, but not coal. While in office, the government will oversee a doubling of wind energy’s contribution to at least 20% of UK power needs by 2020. With onshore wind now the cheapest source of new power generation, and with our country by far the world’s biggest offshore wind market, we’re confident about growth in the UK market.” The EY report found there were reasons for optimism on UK renewables in the next few months, as auctions of the licences to operate new offshore windfarms take place, but that the conditions the government was placing on the licences, and the track record of policy U-turns, left “some uncertainty”. The turn against green energy in the government’s rhetoric began in the later days of the coalition government, when ministers began to voice anti-green sentiments, in contrast to the environmental commitments made by David Cameron when in opposition and in the early days of his first premiership. From claims to be “the greenest government ever”, the prime minister went on to be reported in 2013 as ordering ministers to “cut the green crap”. Cameron’s administration went on to slash support for wind and solar energy; remove obligations on housebuilders to make new homes greener, although the Committee on Climate Change has said this may mean new homes must be retrofitted; and scrap the flagship green deal home insulation scheme without a replacement. Lisa Nancy, Labour’s energy and climate change shadow secretary, said: “This damning analysis [by EY] shows how the Tories’ ideological crusade against green energy is destroying jobs, damaging investment across the country, and making Britain’s power crunch worse. Conservative MPs are voting to block windfarms that enjoy local support and offer value for money, while defending generous handouts to fund more expensive alternatives.” A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change told the Guardian: “We are dedicated to reducing our emissions and moving to low carbon energy, but this has to be done in the most cost-effective way for households and businesses. The UK remains an attractive location for investment in renewable energy. “In the last Budget we helped to give investors the long term certainty they need by announcing £730m of funding for renewables contract auctions this parliament to drive further investment, building on the record levels we saw last year.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/oct/21/chinese-deal-hinkley-puts-west-somerset-heart-nuclear-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-21T15:30:01Z","webTitle":"Nuclear debate: 'It doesn’t matter where the money comes from'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/21/chinese-deal-hinkley-puts-west-somerset-heart-nuclear-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/oct/21/chinese-deal-hinkley-puts-west-somerset-heart-nuclear-debate","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear debate: 'It doesn’t matter where the money comes from'","bodyText":"Fishing boat skipper Steve Yeandle was in no doubt. “Bring it on. We all want the lights to work when we press the switch. We need secure energy. Yes, I’d prefer it if it was our government putting the money in, but you can’t have everything. Nuclear seems to be the viable way to go, and if it is Chinese money making it happen then so be it.” Yeandle was working on his boat – Scooby Doo Too – in the harbour at Watchet, a modest town on the Somerset coast a few miles west of Hinkley Point. For more than 30 years, he has escorted anglers on to the Bristol Channel in search of cod, skate and whiting. They tend to quiz him briefly about the squat towers of the Hinkley A and B nuclear power station as they chug away from the harbour – and then get on with their fishing. “People don’t get upset about Hinkley around here. We’ve lived with it for years. Actually, what more people get upset about is the emissions from the Aberthaw coal-fired power station [across the water in south Wales]. That’s like a yellow snake streaking across the sky. Nobody around here worries about Hinkley.” Yeandle’s friend George Reeder, who works at the chandlery at Watchet, agreed. “Hinkley is a good thing. I would say that, I know, because my son works there. But this area needs those sort of good jobs.” Reeder pointed to the stationary harbourside crane. “Only me and one other person know how to work that now. Skills in engineering are being lost in this country. If we can get some of them back by creating jobs at places like Hinkley, that’s a good thing. It doesn’t matter where the money comes from.” West Somerset is a picture-postcard kind of place. Just inland from Hinkley are the rolling Quantock Hills; further west, past Watchet, Exmoor plunges into the sea. It is a landscape that inspired the romantic poets William Wordsworth and his friend Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who lived briefly in a cottage a few miles from where many thousands of tonnes of soil are now being moved to prepare the way for Hinkley C. “It’s beautiful,” said West Somerset council leader Anthony Trollope-Bellew, “but there are areas of hidden deprivation.” As far as the council is concerned, too many of its able, ambitious young people tend to move away to find well-paid, challenging jobs. Which is why West Somerset, neighbouring authorities and the Somerset Chamber of Commerce is working hard to make sure that local businesses – from bakers to skilled technicians – will benefit from the vast building project when Hinkley C gets the final go-ahead. Asked if he worried about Beijing being involved in West Somerset, Trollope-Bellew said: “That’s not in my remit. That’s for central government. But it will be used as a stick by the anti-nuclear lobby.” Sure enough, on the roundabout at the site’s gates, a hardy band of protesters had set up camp to protest against nuclear power in general – and Chinese involvement in particular. Nelly, a giant blow-up white elephant (borrowed from Friends of the Earth Scotland), poked its head above the camp fence. A poster stuck to Nelly’s side read, in Mandarin: “Nuclear power the wrong investment.” Protestor Theo Simon, from Shepton Mallet in Somerset, said it was deeply disturbing that the Chinese would be so closely involved with Hinkley. “George Osborne has had to go to China to get them to bail out this project, hitching our nuclear energy future to the Chinese state for 100 years,” he said. “We can have no confidence that will always be a good relationship, but they will be at the centre of our most hazardous electricity generation.” Another protestor, Nikki Clark, who lives down the road in Bridgwater, the nearest town to Hinkley, said she did not swallow the line that the project would create 25,000 jobs. “Most of those jobs will be short term. There may be 25,000 tasks to carry out, but there aren’t 25,000 sustainable, long-term jobs.” Simon and Clark claim opposition to Hinkley C is growing in the area. “We’ve had people come to us and tell us privately that they are against it, but can’t speak out because there are so many vested interests here,” said Simon. “We’ve been given more cakes and supplies than we can eat. That shows the level of support for us.” Up the road at the village of Nether Stowey, retired health managers Gordon and Margaret Alexander, 84 and 78 respectively, were admiring the flowers outside Coleridge’s old cottage. “I think it’s disgusting that Chinese money is being used,” said Margaret. “Why can’t our government find the money?” her husband said. He would much rather money be ploughed into renewable energy sources. “We’re storing up problems for future generations,” he said. Nether Stowey butcher Andrew Pope, who lives on a farm next door to the site, was more relaxed. “You grow up with Hinkley, you get used to it. My father used to work there, and I know loads of people who are still there. The new plant will be good for business, good for the area. Yes, it does seem strange to think of Chinese investment coming in, but that’s the way of the world now. We’ve just got to get on with it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2016/jun/14/g4s-security-firm-orlando-attack-omar-mateen","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-14T21:37:49Z","webTitle":"G4S did not psychologically re-evaluate Omar Mateen after FBI questioning","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/14/g4s-security-firm-orlando-attack-omar-mateen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2016/jun/14/g4s-security-firm-orlando-attack-omar-mateen","fields":{"headline":"G4S did not psychologically re-evaluate Omar Mateen after FBI questioning","bodyText":"The security company that employed Orlando gunman Omar Mateen, G4S, only psychologically evaluated him once, at the start of his nine-year employment with the company and not again after the company was made aware he had been interviewed by the FBI, the Guardian can report. Mateen, who murdered 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando on Sunday in America’s deadliest mass shooting, was subjected to a Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory [MMPI] test, a widely utilized psychometric test, in September 2007 when he joined the company. According to records seen by the Guardian, he received an “above average rating” with “no clinical interview required”. He was also subjected to a host of other background checks, including a criminal records check and an employment and education check at that time. The 29-year-old was employed as an unarmed G4S guard at a gated retirement home in Port St Lucie at the time of his death. He had been moved to this role in October 2013 after working as an armed guard at a St Lucie county court. Mateen was interviewed twice by the FBI in 2013, after he falsely claimed to be associated with the brothers who mounted the Boston marathon bombing. Although the company was later made aware of these interviews, it elected not to put Mateen through another MMPI test when he was re-screened, opting only to run a criminal background check. A G4S spokesman said the company was not aware the FBI had interviewed Mateen at the time the second background check took place. The FBI also determined Mateen did not pose a security threat. The company, one of largest and most controversial security providers in the world, saw their stock price plunge on Monday after confirming the killer was an employee. On Wednesday, a G4S spokesman told the Associated Press the company received only one complaint about Mateen during his nine yeas of employment, made by a colleague at the St Lucie courthouse in 2013. The complaint was made before the FBI investigated Mateen and G4S did not provide any details of the complaint’s nature. Daniel Gilroy, a former colleague of Mateen’s at the Port St Lucie retirement home told the New York Times on Monday that he had raised concerns on numerous occasions about the gunman’s disturbed behavior, describing him as having “issues and just constant anger” and making frequent homophobic and racist remarks. In a statement, G4S said it had “no records of any complaints” made by Gilroy and screenings in 2007 and 2013 yielded “no adverse findings”. Mateen spent time working as a G4S guard at the St Lucie juvenile assessment center before moving to the county court position in 2012. A G4S spokesman said Mateen was never employed at the St Lucie nuclear power plant, where the company also manage security. He was previously employed by the state corrections department at the Martin correctional institution, a high-capacity prison holding male inmates. The London-based firm, one of the world’s largest private security companies, has been embroiled in numerous scandals involving its personnel and has often been criticized for not adequately training and screening frontline staff members. In 2009 Danny Fitzsimons, a G4S security guard stationed in Iraq, shot dead two colleagues in Baghdad after displaying signs psychological imbalance. A BBC investigation found that G4S had been warned on multiple occasions that Fitzsimons was not fit for duty but continued to employ the British national. A coroner’s inquiry in the UK found that G4S had not adequately vetted Fitzsimons. In the UK, three G4S guards were charged with manslaughter over the death of Jimmy Mubenga, an Angolan national who died after he was forcibly restrained during an immigration removal. Mubenga’s death prompted widespread calls for reform of the forced removal process, after a Guardian investigation found serious issues with restraint techniques used by private guards. The three men were later found not guilty. In Australia, G4S operated one of the country’s controversial offshore immigration detention centers in Papua New Guinea, and faced severe criticism after one detainee was murdered in violent rioting at the centre during 2014. The company was heavily criticized for not adequately training local guards, many of whom participated in the rioting itself. The company lost the contract later in the year. G4S’s presence in Florida has also courted numerous controversies, where the company manages a large portfolio of contracts, including over two dozen juvenile detention centers. In 2015 a grand jury report into the G4S managed Highlands Youth Academy in Avon Park described conditions as a “disgrace to the state of Florida” and accused the company of providing “multiple factual errors and misstatements” to the inquiry. Daniel Gilroy, Mateen’s former colleague, told the Guardian on Tuesday that he stood by the comments he made on Monday.

The hot, dense moments after the Big Bang produced protons, and a few small clumps of at most seven protons and neutrons bound together - that is, the elements hydrogen, helium and a tiny bit of lithium. These elements came together under gravity, ignited under their own pressure as fusion reactors – the first generation of stars – and produced the heavier elements. The heaviest elements were produced in the final stages of the stars’ life, as they ran short of helium and hydrogen and eventually exploded, distributing oxygen, carbon, silicon and the rest into space. Eventually some of that condensed again, with more hydrogen and helium, forming not just the next generation of stars, but also planets and, on at least one of them, life. All the above is ‘common knowledge’, albeit of the somewhat jaw-dropping variety. But there is more, it turns out. In December I was at a meeting organised by Durham University at the Royal Society, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the discovery¹ of atmospheric neutrinos. Talking with two Durham colleagues over drinks afterwards about a new ‘Saturday Morning Physics’ programme they are running, Prof Paula Chadwick described how, in preparing for her talk to school children, she had learned something astonishing. Paula is a world expert in astronomy using gamma-rays – very high-energy packets of light. But when giving a public talk, you don’t usually just talk about your speciality, you broaden out a bit. In this case she was going to talk about how stars are born and how they die, how we know about that, and what the consequences are. She’d talked about this before, including the story in my first two paragraphs of how the heavier elements are made. But she thought she would just do some reading to make sure she had the details right. She discovered that things had moved on. There’s a problem with making heavy elements in stars. Stars shine because fusing light elements together releases energy. But this only works as far as nickel and iron, with 56 or so protons and neutrons. To get heavier elements than those – such as gold, for example, with nearly 200 protons and neutrons – energy has to be put in. This is understood in terms of the balance of the forces which hold nuclei together, and it is the reason that nuclear power stations can release energy by breaking up heavy elements – fission – while stars (and terrestrial fusion reactors, if we ever work out how to build them) release energy by fusing them together. Both are moving along the energy curve toward iron and nickel. If you want to do anything to change iron or nickel – fission or fusion – you have to put energy in. This all means that in ‘normal operation’, stars won’t make anything heavier than iron. Heavy elements can, however, be made in the maelstrom of a supernova, when a star finally explodes and there is so much energy around that zooming up the nuclear energy curve is no problem. But it turns out there’s another way, which is probably more important. That’s what Paula read about during her preparation. Of the many weird things going on in space, gamma ray bursts are one of the weirder. These are short bursts of high-energy photons² which are detected fairly frequently and come from beyond our galaxy. The best guess as to their cause is the merging (that is, catastrophic ultra-violent collision) of two neutron stars. Neutron stars are the superdense leftovers of supernovae. Quite recently, astronomers working with the Hubble Space Telescope zoomed in on a gamma ray burst detected by the Swift satellite, and spotted an infrared afterglow – essentially a hot dot, in the place where the burst had occurred. Studying the pattern of this radiation – the wavelength and brightness, and how they changed over time – fitted the “neutron star” hypothesis very well. It also implied that in the process of these collisions, heavy elements were being made. In fact, if the estimates of the masses involved and the rate of these events are right, they are the main source of heavy elements. Including gold, platinum and uranium. This means that by breaking up uranium, nuclear power stations are releasing energy that was stored in neutron star collisions billions of years ago. It also makes me look at my wedding ring with a new sense of wonder. It was probably made in a neutron star collision. Hmm. The study of those observations by Swift and Hubble was released in 2013, and there is a good article with some more detail here. But there is more recent news too, or at least rumour. In order to actually collide and fuse together, a pair of orbiting neutron stars has to get rid of the energy and momentum of the rotation. They do this, according to general relativity, by radiating gravitational waves. These waves, distortions in space-time, have never been directly observed, but they are the same gravitational waves about which rumours are currently flying. Whether or not these particular rumours stand up, we may soon see the emissions from nature’s ultra-violent gold factories. ¹ That is, neutrinos produced in collisions between the upper atmosphere and high-energy particles from outer space. The discovery was made by groups from Durham, India and Japan, in an Indian gold mine, coincidentally. ² There are longer-duration bursts too, which have a different origin, see comment. Jon Butterworth’s book Smashing Physics is available as “Most Wanted Particle” in Canada &amp; the US and was shortlisted for the Royal Society Winton Prize for Science Books."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/dec/20/remember-our-miners-as-industrial-heroes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-20T18:23:51Z","webTitle":"Remember our miners as industrial heroes | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/20/remember-our-miners-as-industrial-heroes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/dec/20/remember-our-miners-as-industrial-heroes","fields":{"headline":"Remember our miners as industrial heroes","bodyText":"It is appropriate that the Guardian had a quote from Dennis Skinner before the last shift at Kellingley colliery (Last bow for King Coal, killed by cheaper, greener options, 18 December), although I feel sure that he would leave the last word to the miners. The march on Saturday was an attempt at lasting community solidarity, which Skinner knows all about, having served the pit villages of Bolsover through the same upheaval of closures and moving to new pits to the ultimate closure of an industry and a very different and challenging world. We import cheap and cleaner coal rather than invest in clean coal technology and support for our own industry in thrall to the market. George Osborne has removed the subsidy for carbon capture and storage, while the government supports fracking beneath national parks and we seek investment from China to build a nuclear power station while they plan hundreds of coal-fired stations at home. Did our prime minister negotiate for less restrictive competition laws in Europe in order to subsidise our industries?

We all have our own special beefs. Mine include the current obsession with “British interests” at the expense of foreign excellence, and the pathetic press clamour for knighthoods and damehoods for favoured medal winners. But there are plenty more. Simon Jenkins duly delivered a devastating arraignment of this kind in these pages this week. Part of me could scarce forebear to cheer. Yes, the Olympics are too inflated, too nationalistic, too full of hypocrisies about drugs and corruption, and some of the coverage is infantalising. A single look at the picture of the five-year-old Omran Daqneesh in that ambulance in Aleppo puts all the hyperbole into perspective. But the fact remains that Britain has been doing well not because Brits are best, but for a crunchy material reason called money. That reason should not be dismissed. On the contrary it should be respected and celebrated – because all those medals have come as a direct result of a government decision to prioritise and invest in elite sport. Admittedly it is a fair bet that someone as brilliant as Mo Farah possesses the sheer talent to ensure that he would have won his medals in any Olympic year, even without help from the taxpayer. But that isn’t true of all the 50-plus British medal winners who have prospered in Rio. Success in cycling is fundamentally down to dosh as much as dash. Ditto with gymnastics. Britain’s swimmers have done well this year because swimming was deemed to have underperformed in 2012 and was given special priority this time. There is no mystery about any of this. As Rio 2016 has unfolded, the name of John Major has crept back into the news, exactly as it did during London 2012, and for the same good reason. Faced with a dismal UK performance at the Atlanta games of 1996, during his premiership, the sports-loving Major insisted that lottery funding should be targeted on doing better next time. London and Rio have been the harvest of that seed. Some will say that all this is a huge waste of money. Sure, there is a case to make for that. Others will say it would be better spent elsewhere. On a day when childhood obesity is again in the news, it’s obvious that sports facilities for the many are at least as much of a priority as handouts for the elite few. But the two are not inherently incompatible, especially in a prosperous country like Britain. Beware the tedious old trap of making the best the enemy of the good. The truth is that the Olympics is good national value. Putting £350m into winning medals once every four years may sound a lot, but it’s a tiny proportion of total public spending over the same period. Feeling good about ourselves as a nation because of sport seems money pretty well spent to me. If part of that feelgood factor is that Britons embrace people with disabilities more readily because of the Paralympics, or that people of all backgrounds feel included in a British nation that is good at all these things, then that is, as they say, priceless. Moreover, there is a much larger lesson from all this. For if government can make a conscious decision to achieve a desirable end by investing intelligently in elite sport, why should it not do the same thing with other public goods too? In the end, elite sport is just a highly specialised industry. Yet in both principle and in practice, what is true of sports applies just as much to many other areas of industry. This ought not to be a difficult stretch. Many industries get financial support from government, though government is not often keen to advertise the fact. Everything from the arms industry to the arts, from graphene to the garden bridge, is underpinned by the public purse. It is hard to imagine where agriculture, steel or banking would be without public subsidy. Taxpayer funds support them all, just as they support Laura Trott and Jason Kenny. Nevertheless, the idea that government should be involved in “picking winners” was one of the principal ideological casualties of the Thatcher era, and has only been very tentatively rehabilitated at any point during the past 35 years – Michael Heseltine, Peter Mandelson and Vince Cable all tried. But picking winners in industrial policy can be first cousin to backing losers. Postwar government spending on many parts of heavy industry was as often triggered by those industries’ decline as by any possibility of expansion. Public money is precious. Raising more of it is politically difficult, especially if the economy contracts. So it is important, as with the Olympics, not to be sentimental. That’s why those whose vision of industrial strategy begins and ends with nationalisation are as much a menace to good policy as the Thatcherites were with their reflexive hatred of any state spending. The last thing that Britain needs is taxpayers propping up industries with no future. That’s as bad as ensuring no industry has a future by insisting on spending nothing at all. Yet if the British economy is ever to be rebalanced away from its overdependence on financial services, the nettle has to be grasped. If Theresa May’s speech in Birmingham in July is to be believed, the new prime minister is a supporter of something she described as “a proper industrial strategy”. In that speech, May said that workers, local communities and even sometimes the whole country have a stake in the development and the defence of successful companies. Government should be able to step in to defend key sectors, she said. That is one way of reading May’s pausing of the Hinkley and Sizewell nuclear power deals. It is also getting close to a strategy of supporting winners. Let’s hope so. For a prime minister to talk about industrial strategy as a principle is certainly refreshing. Perhaps talk is all that it will ultimately prove to be. May and her new business secretary, Greg Clark, will need to get serious about the industries that Britain can’t do without and those it needs to develop once politics resumes in the autumn. But they could hardly have a more pressing incentive. In the post-Brexit world, they may have little alternative."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/iran-blog/2015/jan/15/iran-hardliners-say-nuclear-negotiators-loading-enemys-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-15T13:15:03Z","webTitle":"Iran's far right say nuclear negotiators 'loading the enemy’s weapons'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/jan/15/iran-hardliners-say-nuclear-negotiators-loading-enemys-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/iran-blog/2015/jan/15/iran-hardliners-say-nuclear-negotiators-loading-enemys-weapons","fields":{"headline":"Iran's far right say nuclear negotiators 'loading the enemy’s weapons'","bodyText":"Incensed by a report Iran would transfer most of it enriched uranium to Russia, conservatives in Tehran have levelled new criticisms against Iranian negotiators for not standing firm against United States’ demands over the nuclear programme. The Associated Press news agency on 2 January, quoting two anonymous diplomats, claimed Iran had agreed in talks with world powers to send a large portion of its enriched uranium to Russia, presumably for processing into fuel for power generation. The conservative-aligned website Nuclear Iran, which covers the nuclear negotiations including their technical aspects, noted with alarm that exporting fissile material had previously been regarded as one of the country’s “red lines”. Critics of talks in Iran were not appeased by a denial of the AP story by Marzieh Afkham, spokeswoman of the foreign ministry, especially as she did not comment on whether the US had suggested such a transfer during the talks. Two days after the AP report, in an interview with the conservative website Raja News, parliamentary deputy Javad Karimi Ghoddousi claimed the Americans had presented an eight-page set of proposals that the Iranian negotiators considered “the worst yet”. Karimi Ghoddousi said deputies had questioned members of Iran’s negotiation team, and while he did not explicitly say he had been given details by one of the Iranian team, readers of Raja News would know that Karimi Ghoddousi is a member of the parliament’s national security and foreign policy commission, which often has confidential briefings with negotiators, including Mohammad Javad Zarif, the foreign minister. Among the demands the Americans had made, said Karimi Ghoddousi, backing up the AP story, was the export of Iran’s enriched uranium (which is enriched to under 5%, Iran’s 20% enriched uranium, nearer to weapons grade, has been diluted or converted under the 2013 Geneva interim nuclear agreement) to a third party, which they suggested should be Russia. The deputy also claimed the US had demanded the right to supervise Iran’s missile tests, which he said crossed another of Iran’s red lines. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, said last May that the west’s requests over Iran’s missiles were “idiotic”, and Iran’s negotiators have repeatedly said in public that the missile programme would not be included in the talks. Karimi Ghoddousi was outraged. “Even if such a deal were to beat all the odds and actually pass,” he argued, “the Iranian people would set fire to it before the negotiating team had a chance to parade it around Azadi Square” in Tehran. Entering the fray on the same day, Mahmoud Nabavian, a member of the conservative parliamentary faction Front of Islamic Revolution Stability and a pupil of Ayatollah Mohammad Taghi Mesbah-Yazdi, told clerics and researchers at the Imam Khomeini Education and Research Institute that the Iranians had agreed to western supervision of the missile programme. Nabavian said he had asked Abbas Araghchi, a deputy foreign minister and leading nuclear negotiator, two weeks earlier if Wendy Sherman, the lead US negotiator, was correct in claiming Iran had twice agreed to western supervision of its missile programme. According to Nabavian, Araghchi had made no response. Nabavian also claimed that the west was continuing to demand the closure of Fordo, Iran’s fortified underground enrichment plant near Qom, and that Zarif had said in a confidential meeting that Iran no longer wanted to enrich uranium at Fordo. Nabavian conceded that the Iranian team had not accepted the west’s demands, but he argued that just continuing the negotiations acted as a barrier to Iran’s nuclear development and subjected the country to further economic pressure as international sanctions continued. Nabavian expressed disdain that the Americans, during negotiations, had gone out shopping in Muscat, Oman, for lamps and left Iranian negotiators waiting. This compared unfavourably, he said, with the conduct of the previous negotiation team led by Saeed Jalili, who had once told him: “At one point, after the Americans made us wait for 20 minutes before showing up, I myself went out and stood on the balcony to show them that I wasn’t in love with the idea of talking to them, either.” While the government of president Hassan Rouhani has undertaken discrete discussions about the nuclear talks with various power brokers across the Iranian political landscape, it has shown little interest in being completely transparent. Throughout the nuclear negotiations, the Rouhani government has faced steady criticism from the far right of the political spectrum, but with the talks intimately tied to many domestic political and economic issues in Iran, the tone of domestic discussion is sharpening. When Rouhani called in early January for a national referendum on “important matters”, interpreted primarily as a reference to the nuclear negotiations, the far-right newspaper Kayhan accused him of “loading the enemy’s weapons for them.” Media Watch is presented with our partner Digarban"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/aug/15/third-party-candidate-vote-jill-stein-gary-johnson-evan-mcmullin","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-15T17:01:42Z","webTitle":"This isn't the year for ideological purity.

Don't vote for Jill Stein","bodyText":"I get nauseous every time I hear the name Ralph Nader. If all those votes cast for him for president in 2000 had gone to Al Gore, we might have been spared the Iraq war, the frat-boy alliance of George W and Tony Blair, and other horrors. So I hate so-called third parties. I prefer to call them “fringe”. I don’t believe that voting has anything to do with the so-called likability of the candidates. Who cares which of them is the one you’d rather meet in the pub? Nor should voting be an act of protest. The Green party zealots who went for Nader because they said there wasn’t a dime of difference between Bush and Gore were tragically wrong. Voting is a sacred duty of US citizenship and as such, the presidential contest is about one central question: in whose hands is the country most likely to prosper, be safe and come closest to the American promise of equal rights for all? Because Trump and Clinton are such disliked and polarizing candidates, I understand why alternatives might appeal. Many voters do want to support someone who most purely mirrors their ideals. They don’t want to vote pragmatically or settle for the lesser of two evils. This is a real dilemma. But 2016 isn’t the year for purity. Casting a vote for any of the alternative party or independent candidates in November could have truly disastrous effects. With Trump on the ballot, the risk of unintentionally helping elect an unstable man who is clearly not prepared for the job is too big. After the past two weeks, it’s tempting to conclude that the pugnacious real estate tycoon has spontaneously combusted, like Old Krook in Dickens’ Bleak House. But by November, as has been true in most recent American elections, the gap between the two candidates will narrow. Even with all the self-inflicted wounds, Trump still starts out with a likely base of 170 electoral votes. Getting the next 100 needed for election will be extremely hard but not impossible. If Clinton is to win the swing states she needs to get to 270, she can’t have too many votes siphoned away by fringe candidates like the Green party’s Jill Stein or Libertarian Gary Johnson. When I combed through their platforms and records, I, too, found a lot to like about Stein and Johnson, especially after I listened to their one hour, back to back interviews with Boston radio host Tom Ashbrook. Stein’s sincerity and smarts were evident. Since she twice ran for governor of Massachusetts and once before for president in 2012 (she received 469,000 votes, more than separated JFK and Nixon in 1960), she was more seasoned as a politician than I expected. Her calls for free college tuition and a 15% federal minimum wage mirrored those of Bernie Sanders, some of whose followers are using the Twitter hashtag #jillnothill. As would be expected of a Green candidate, her top issue is protecting “Mother Earth”, by dramatically reducing dependence on fossil fuels and banning nuclear power. Her central message is a direct play for disaffected Democrats: “The [Democratic party] boat is sinking and it’s taking us down with it. This is the time to get off of that boat. We [progressives] have a lifeboat. It’s called the Green party, so let’s not sink together, let’s sail together!” Johnson, the genial former Republican governor of a Democratic state, New Mexico, was popular in office, lowering state taxes, expanding jobs and attracting more businesses. Although he says he’s personally against abortion, he believes it’s the woman’s right to decide. His antipathy to stricter gun laws isn’t surprising for a libertarian, but will turn off liberal voters in urban areas. He’s for legalizing marijuana. His low-tax mantra will appeal to Republicans who think Trump’s economic plan is voodoo, to use an old Geroge HW Bush word. Johnson does seem a viable alternative to Trump for Republicans who just can’t stomach Clinton and perhaps for Sanders Democrats. Maine senator Susan Collins suggested recently that she’s considering voting Libertarian. “I hope that people will see that we don’t have to sit by the sidelines and watch as the two major parties limit their choices to slightly different flavors of the status quo. It is, in fact, possible to join the fray, stand up for principles and offer a real alternative,” Johnson has said. I’ve also watched some television appearances by Evan McMullin, a 40-year-old factotum of the Republican party, who is running as an independent candidate. Virtually unknown, he is hardly the GOP’s answer to finding a viable Trump alternative. I do give him credit for having the guts to try to drain Republicans away from Trump, but he just won’t be a factor in November. None of this occasional likability translates into anything meaningful, however. None of these candidates could possibly win. So a casting a protest vote for any one of them is akin to throwing your vote away. The most influence they would hope to wield is if any of them reach 15% in national polls. That way, they could be included in the presidential debates, gaining much wider national exposure. Johnson probably has the best chance to make it in, but Trump opposes anything but a direct one-on-one with Clinton. Some suspect this is a ruse to withdraw from the debates altogether, rather than get creamed by Clinton. This extraordinary election is definitely a two-horse race. But the questions raised by the candidacies of both Sanders and Trump point to an uncertain future. A politically savvy friend of mine, who works for one of the American TV television networks, told me he thinks Trump may be the last GOP presidential nominee. This friend, a Republican, believes the party will never recover from the Trump disaster. It will splinter into various other entities, some of them to sit it out on the fringe. And what of those Democrats alienated by Hillary’s pivot away from the left as she moves into territory vacated by Trump, courting Republican establishment figures such as Henry Kissinger? If there is no realignment, no recalibration, then the risk is that the angry voices on both left and right find no meaningful outlet. Third parties will never be a significant feature American politics, but after this election, the future shape of the two main ones is a question that cannot be neglected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-deal-rip-off-labour-theresa-may","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-29T16:15:24Z","webTitle":"The Conservatives have realised too late that Hinkley Point is a rip-off | Barry Gardiner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-deal-rip-off-labour-theresa-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/29/hinkley-point-deal-rip-off-labour-theresa-may","fields":{"headline":"The Conservatives have realised too late that Hinkley Point is a rip-off","bodyText":"One would imagine that the phone call from the Élysée Palace yesterday went something like this: François: My dear Thérèse, what in the name of Sacré-Cœur do you think you are doing?

The manner and impact of this ill-advised decision will bedevil British-French relations for years to come. There was a time for sober reflection on what had been a badly negotiated nuclear power contract, which left UK customers paying £92.50MW/h for electricity 35 years into the future, when the cost of onshore wind is already down to £70 and offshore is being delivered for £80. Had the government radically renegotiated the contract two years ago, I would have applauded them. By leaving it to this late stage they could insist on tweaking the contract to secure a reduced price every year the project is further delayed beyond 2025, but to risk 25,000 jobs and send such an appalling signal to investors about the reliability of the UK as an investment partner is an act of recklessness, as damaging for the manner in which it was done as for its substance. In 2006, when Labour first gave the go-ahead for new nuclear to secure our energy supplies with low-carbon electricity, there was a bipartisan approach to energy and climate change policy. That consensus has begun to unravel over the past six years with a government obsessed with locking us in to a gas-fuelled future even if that meant fracking under national parks. I support the development of new nuclear as part of the energy mix we need to deliver a low-carbon future. Hinkley Point C itself can provide the UK with 7% of our total expected electricity needs. But providing EDF with a 35-year guarantee of £92.50 per unit of power, with bill-payers topping up the difference if wholesale prices fell below that level, was a catastrophically bad deal. With wholesale prices now half that level, and the costs of other low-carbon power from wind and solar falling dramatically, this rip-off deal can no longer stand. The National Audit Office earlier this month projected that bill-payers will have to stump up nearly £30bn for Hinkley in “top up” payments, to make up the difference between this guaranteed price and market prices – five times the original estimate of £6bn. This is an outrageously bad deal, particularly as the government has secured no guarantee that Hinkley will start generating power when we really need it in 2025. With all coal power plants scheduled to shut down by 2025, the UK faces a power crunch if alternative plans aren’t put in place in time. The government’s scheme to incentivise investment in gas power stations has resolutely failed to get any new major gas plants in the infrastructure pipeline. And the constant changing of rules has led to the UK plummeting out of the Ernst &amp; Young index of the top 10 countries for investment in renewables. For two years, Labour has been calling for the government to develop a plan B, but ministers have told us they didn’t need one. This latest delay could mean the government and public will pay through the roof for expensive back-up capacity to ensure the lights don’t go out. The EU referendum delivered a shockwave to investor confidence, with the manufacturers’ federation EEF reporting that confidence in the sector has slumped across the country since the vote to leave. The government’s decision to postpone a final sign-off on contracts sends an appalling signal to investors, whom ministers have been so desperate to reassure that Britain is “open for business”. This action will speak to investors louder than all their words. If ministers fail to introduce a taper that would see the guaranteed price drop for every year the project falls behind that 2025 deadline, the government will be giving EDF a blank cheque to delay the project – and guaranteeing that the public will pick up the tab to pay premium price at a time when we do not have the premium need. Any renegotiation would likely need sign-off from EDF’s board, who have just been rebuffed in a very public humiliation by the UK government. After seven members out of 17 board members yesterday opposed the project, with one of the directors Gérard Magnin resigning in protest at what he called a strategic mistake for the company, it’s far from sure EDF would agree to new terms when the company is facing its own financial problems. Philip Hammond, the new chancellor, earlier this month called the project a “prerequisite” for a modern economy, stating a firm commitment to making sure the project goes ahead. Perhaps it will. But the price of his new boss’s actions will come back to haunt his balance of payments for many years to come."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/aug/13/rising-power-of-china-new-political-fissures-in-west","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-13T23:05:19Z","webTitle":"The rising power of China will create new political fissures in the west | Gideon Rachman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/13/rising-power-of-china-new-political-fissures-in-west","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/13/rising-power-of-china-new-political-fissures-in-west","fields":{"headline":"The rising power of China will create new political fissures in the west","bodyText":"Whether he wins or loses the US presidency next November, Donald Trump has already come up with one of the defining slogans of 2016 – “Make America great again”. Trump’s vision of an America in precipitous decline is all-encompassing. At home, he points to falling living standards for many Americans and the disappearance of well-paid manufacturing jobs. Overseas, he claims the world is laughing at the US and laments that “we don’t win any more”. Many in Europe are tempted to see Trump as an “only in America” aberration. Yet the fear of economic and geopolitical decline that Trump is capitalising upon is widely visible across the west. The coalition of frustrated working-class voters and nostalgic nationalists that the Republican has put together is uncomfortably reminiscent of the alliance that voted for Brexit in the UK. Trump’s “make America great again” mantra has an echo of the Brexit campaign’s winning slogan – “Take back control”. Nor is this is just an Anglo-American phenomenon. Across the EU, including in France, the Netherlands, Italy and Poland, protectionists and nationalists are gaining ground. As Trump might put it: “Something’s going on.” That something is a historic shift in economic and geopolitical power that is bringing to an end a 500-year period in which western nations have dominated global affairs. This erosion of the west’s privileged position in world affairs is creating new economic, geopolitical and even psychological pressures in both the US and the EU. The driving force of this change is the extraordinary economic development of Asia over the past 50 years. In 2014, the IMF reported that, measured in purchasing power, China is now the world’s largest economy. The US had held this title since 1871, when it displaced the UK; now China is number one. The rise of China is just part of a broader shift of economic power towards Asia. The IMF reports that three of the world’s four largest economies are now in Asia. China is first, the US is second, India third and Japan fourth. It is true that if you measure economies at current exchange rates the US is still the world’s largest economy – and European nations also rise up the pecking order. But growing Chinese and Asian economic weight is demonstrable in many other ways. China is now the world’s largest manufacturer and the largest exporter. It is also the world’s largest market for vehicles, smartphones and oil – and the biggest single market for many western companies such as Daimler and KFC. But it is not just Mercedes and fried chicken that are being consumed in Asia. In 2012, for the first time in over a century, Asian countries spent more money on armaments and troops than European nations. The world’s two largest arms importers are now India and Saudi Arabia. Conventional economic theory holds that the growing wealth of Asia should be a boon to the economies of the west, since it offers new markets and sources of investment. But it is also clear that particular communities in Europe and the US, especially manufacturing workers and the less educated, have had their living standards badly hit by competition from Asia. Economists call this the “China shock” and the effects have been profound. By the end of 2008, the US had lost one third of its manufacturing jobs from peak and most of those had gone in the previous decade. Italy, whose industrial heartlands have suffered particularly badly from competition with Asia, has lost 25% of its industrial capacity since 2008. Researchers at Bocconi University in Italy have shown that across Europe it is the areas that have been hit hardest by Chinese competition that are most likely to move towards political parties advocating “identity-based nationalism”. China’s increasing economic weight is also leading to tricky strategic and political choices for western nations. Britain’s current dilemma over the proposed nuclear power station at Hinkley Point is illustrative. With Brexit looming, investment from China looks ever more crucial to the UK. But China is not just an enormous economy. It is also a rising power with strategic aims that have led to a rise in tensions with its neighbours and with the US, Britain’s most important military ally and the bedrock of the Nato alliance. Given the rising tensions between the west and China, it was all but inevitable that the May government would have to consider whether it is sensible to hand over the management of such a strategic chunk of the UK economy to Chinese companies. The trade-off between security and economics when dealing with China is likely to be a recurring dilemma for the UK – and it is not just a problem for Britain. A few months ago, Australia faced its own Hinkley Point moment when it blocked a Chinese consortium from buying a company that owns more than 1% of Australia’s landmass. Since then, tensions between the Aussies and the Chinese have risen. A few days ago, the Global Times, a subsidiary of China’s People’s Daily, suggested that if the Australian navy joined the US in patrolling waters claimed by Beijing in the South China Sea, Australia would be “an ideal target to warn and strike”. The shrill tone of such Chinese pronouncements underlines the fact that the shift in global economic power has not just altered attitudes in the west, it has also produced an increasingly assertive nationalism in Xi Jinping’s China. Over the past year, Beijing has asserted its claims in the South China Sea by building artificial islands across the ocean. In response, the US navy has sent patrols through waters claimed by China. Both a Trump and a Clinton presidency would probably lead to increased tensions with China, but by very different routes. Hillary Clinton is regarded in Beijing as a dangerous hawk who would be likely to be more determined in pushing back against China’s maritime claims. President Xi is a tough-minded nationalist, so a Clinton presidency would increase the chances of a clash in the Pacific between the US and China. Trump, by contrast, seems relatively uninterested in America’s strategic role in the Pacific, but his vociferous protectionism has led him to propose swingeing tariffs on Chinese goods. Any such policy would be regarded as an act of economic warfare by Beijing. Either way, the era when globalisation seemed like a process that could create only common interests between China and the west is over. It is now giving way to an epoch that looks altogether darker and more dangerous."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/07/european-diplomats-criticise-un-plan-to-curb-airline-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-07T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"European diplomats criticise UN plan to curb airline emissions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/07/european-diplomats-criticise-un-plan-to-curb-airline-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/07/european-diplomats-criticise-un-plan-to-curb-airline-emissions","fields":{"headline":"European diplomats criticise UN plan to curb airline emissions","bodyText":"A draft UN plan to offset the air industry’s surging growth in emissions contains too many exemptions to be credible and too little detail to be trustworthy, European diplomats say. Aviation is one of only two sectors not covered by the Paris climate agreement and many diplomats are optimistic that the UN International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) blueprint can be whittled into shape before a Montreal conference this September. But several loopholes in the text present serious obstacles to a signing ceremony, with China and other countries still dragging their heels over core concepts such as “carbon neutral growth” in the industry after 2020. If an adequate deal is not done, the EU will be obliged to restart its “stopped clock” on bringing international airlines into its more punitive Emissions Trading System (ETS). Without a pact, this will happen automatically at the end of the year. One European diplomat involved in the negotiations likened the chances of the European commission and parliament agreeing to keep the clock on ice to a “one billion dollar question”. He told the Guardian: “It depends on three big elements: carbon neutral growth after 2020, a review clause to increase ambition over time, and robust accounting that is consistent with UNFCCC [the UN body that oversees the climate talks] reporting guidelines. Those three big things are still missing from the text.” Under the plan, developed countries would start offsetting their emissions growth from aviation with carbon cuts elsewhere in the world in 2021. They would be joined five years later by “upper medium income states” such as Brazil, Mexico and China. More than 100 poor countries and small island states would be excluded from the system altogether. Unless rich world airlines compensate for their carbon output, curbs are unlikely to slow aviation emissions which have been predicted to grow up to 700% above 2005 levels by mid-century. Measuring these curbs though would be complicated by the lack of a “negative list” of non-eligible projects in the draft, for which offsets could be claimed. Without this, even nuclear power projects might be considered for offset credits as a low carbon energy source, some officials privately say. “For now we can’t be sure which credits will be used so we can’t have a 100% guarantee of the environmental integrity of the scheme, which is is absolutely necessary if you want to achieve carbon neutral growth,” a diplomat said. Eighty campaign groups have taken a stand against ICAO’s plan, arguing it would allow the double counting of existing climate programmes, while aforestation projects could force indigenous peoples from their land or create other land use problems. Hannah Mowat, a campaigner for the conservation group Fern, said: “ICAO’s own standards rule forests and land offsets out from the start, because they need to be permanent emissions reductions, which is impossible to prove for forests because the removals are reversible.” Some European negotiators believe that these concerns will be satisfied in an eventual resolution, the first draft of which is expected later this month. But the current proposal to end the ICAO scheme after 15 years will need amending, if it is to square with the Paris agreement’s mechanism of reviewing and ratcheting up carbon targets every five years. These are meant to increase carbon cuts until a world warmed by 2C or less is in sight. “The [planned] global market-based mechanism foresees a termination of the system in 2035, which is completely contradictory with the need to increase the ambition of greenhouse gas reductions over time,” a diplomat said. An ICAO consultation in Utrecht on Tuesday was said to have made progress in shining a light on contentious issues. An updated text is expected later this month, ahead of a high level meeting on 11 May to prepare for the September Icao council meeting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/nov/03/french-energy-giant-edf-buys-dungeness-britains-only-desert","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-03T18:08:53Z","webTitle":"French energy giant EDF buys Dungeness Estate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/03/french-energy-giant-edf-buys-dungeness-britains-only-desert","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/03/french-energy-giant-edf-buys-dungeness-britains-only-desert","fields":{"headline":"French energy giant EDF buys Dungeness Estate","bodyText":"Dungeness Estate, the windswept stretch of shingle coastline where the film-maker Derek Jarman spent his final years, has been bought by EDF Energy, the French company that owns a nearby nuclear power station. The sparsely populated, barren headland on the south Kent coast, home to disused railway coaches and sometimes inaccurately described as “Britain’s only desert”, has been snapped up by EDF for an undisclosed amount after being put up for sale in the summer for £1.5m. Maurice Ede, trustee for the estate, said on Tuesday: “After the decision was made to sell the estate, it was important the purchaser would have the ability, track record and correct intentions of maintaining an estate such as this. We are very happy to be passing that responsibility to EDF Energy.” The energy company, which owns Dungeness B nuclear power station adjacent to the estate, said in a statement that it was the biggest employer in the area, boosting the local economy by more than £40m each year. Martin Pearson, station director at Dungeness B, said: “We’re delighted to be the purchasers of the estate and want to reassure the community that it is our intention to be a responsible owner of the land. “Dungeness B has been a huge part of the community for over 30 years; many of our employees live in the area and we bring business to local suppliers,” Pearson added. “We’ve always worked alongside the local community to preserve and enhance this unique environment and EDF Energy is committed to this.” The announcement of the sale of the estate, part of a family trust since 1964 and a registered national nature reserve, took residents by surprise. At the beginning of proceedings, inhabitants of the 99 homes on the estate were worried by the lack of consultation. Paul Schwartfeger, chair of the Dungeness residents’ association, told the Guardian: “EDF is a close neighbour with whom we have shared Dungeness for many years. As of yet we do not know how the relationship between EDF and residents will be managed. However, I am optimistic about the future of this relationship and the estate, given that EDF has already begun engaging with residents about the sale and has working knowledge of the land and the relevant conservation designations that apply to this remarkable part of Kent.” The estate had generated an annual income of more than £130,000 from ground rents of long-term residential leasehold properties, commercial fishing agreements and licences allowing the movement of shingle to protect the power station and nearby coasts. The barren area has become one of the country’s most recognisable landmarks and an unlikely tourist destination, attracting around a million visitors each year. The deal does not, however, include the power station, pub, lighthouses and narrow-gauge railway. The 468-acre estate is formed largely of a shingle beach that shields the low-lying land of Romney Marsh. The area has been designated as a site of special scientific interest due to its shingle ridges. Dungeness also featured on the cover of Pink Floyd’s 1981 album A Collection of Great Dance Songs. It has also appeared in music videos for Lighthouse Family, the Thrills, the Prodigy, Athlete, Aled Jones and Turin Brakes, and in the 1981 film Time Bandits. Will Whittaker of Strutt &amp; Parker, the estate agents, said: “Despite the great interest generated from around the world, the trustees and Strutt &amp; Parker are delighted to have agreed a sale to a neighbour who is already familiar with and committed to the area.” This article was amended on Tuesday 3 November 2015 to remove an incorrect reference to Roger Waters’s departure from Pink Floyd."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/jul/14/philip-hammond-there-will-be-no-brexit-budget","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-14T08:17:06Z","webTitle":"Philip Hammond: there will be no Brexit budget","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/philip-hammond-there-will-be-no-brexit-budget","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/jul/14/philip-hammond-there-will-be-no-brexit-budget","fields":{"headline":"Philip Hammond: there will be no Brexit budget","bodyText":"The UK’s new chancellor, Philip Hammond, has said there will be no emergency budget to deal with the economic effects of Brexit, adding that he will deliver an autumn statement as normal. Hammond’s commitment on his first day at the Treasury is a dig at his predecessor, George Osborne, who had warned before the EU referendum that there would need to be a crisis budget involving tax rises and swingeing budget cuts, including £2.5bn taken from the NHS. Hammond also said no decision had been taken on when to trigger article 50 to begin formal negotiations with the EU. The prime minister, Theresa May, is expected to make more appointments on Thursday morning, including jobs at the education, health, work and pensions, international development, energy and agriculture departments. Arriving for his first day at the Treasury, Hammond said: “The prime minister made clear we will do an autumn statement in the usual way – in the autumn – and we will look carefully over the summer at the situation. “I’m seeing the governor of the Bank of England this morning and we will take stock. The markets do need signals of reassurance, they need to know we will do whatever is necessary to keep the economy on track.” Hammond told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the British economy was entering a new phase. Following the decision to leave the EU, “our economy will change as we go forward and it will require a different set of parameters,” he said.There were challenges to face in the short term because of the cause of the economic shock of the leave vote on 23 June leading to a pause in investment decisions, Hammond said. He defended his warnings of a “chilling effect” on the British economy, which he made as he campaigned for remain during the referendum. “The challenge for us is to send signals of assurance as quickly as we can to the international investment community, to British businesses and consumers so we can get those decisions made,” he said. The chancellor added that the UK would leave the European single market as a result of the Brexit decision but would then negotiate access to it. “We will come out of the single market as a result of our decision to leave the European Union,” he told LBC radio. “The question is how we negotiate with the European Union, not from the point of view of being members but from the point of view of being close neighbours and trade partners.” The timing for deficit reduction had to be reconsidered, Hammond said, and ratifying a new deal with the EU would have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments so would take some time. He had previously suggested it would take more than six years but refused to repeat this estimate of the timing, only saying he hoped it would be “sooner rather than later”. He continued: “If there is one thing that is damaging our economy today it is uncertainty … [businesses] want to know on what terms they will be able to sell to the single market.” The chancellor said the new government had not yet discussed Heathrow expansion but he was bullish on plans for a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point following warnings from the government spending watchdog that the project would cost an extra £30bn in “top-up payments” from consumers. “Delivering a reliable power supply is an absolute prerequisite for a modern, dynamic, functioning economy, and we have to make sure we generate power needed for the UK grid. We have to make sure that project goes ahead,” he said. Key positions of state were filled on Wednesday night, with Boris Johnson appointed as foreign secretary, Amber Rudd going to the Home Office and leading Brexiters Liam Fox and David Davis responsible for international trade and Brexit negotiations respectively. Johnson said he was both humbled and proud to be given the Foreign Office, despite some incredulity at the appointment from world leaders and observers because of the former London mayor’s gaffe-prone attempts at diplomacy. They include in the past year alone calling Barack Obama “part-Kenyan” and implying that led him to dislike Britain, as well as writing an offensive poem about Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Mark Toner, spokesman for the US Department of State, could not hide a smile when told about the appointment. “Frankly, this is a relationship that goes beyond personalities,” he said. Overnight, May took calls from several world leaders, the first from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. She also spoke to the French president, François Hollande, and Ireland’s taoiseach, Enda Kenny. A Downing Street spokesman said May had “emphasised her commitment to delivering the will of the British people to leave the European Union”. “The prime minister explained that we would need some time to prepare for these negotiations and spoke of her hope that these could be conducted in a constructive and positive spirit,” the spokesman added. Speaking from Kyrgyzstan, Merkel invited May to Germany and indicated they would meet for talks at the G20 summit in September. The spokeswoman added: “They agreed that they wanted to establish a constructive relationship, recognising the importance of close cooperation between the UK and Germany.” May spoke to Hollande about the importance of security, defence and joint work on border controls in Calais, as well as offering her best wishes for Bastille Day. Kenny and May “both agreed that the strong collaboration between our countries should continue and the taoiseach offered to visit London soon for talks on how they could best work together to achieve this”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2016/mar/14/love-waste-incinerator-bjarke-ingels-copenhagen","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-14T15:17:38Z","webTitle":"How I learned to love a waste incinerator | Patrick Barkham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/14/love-waste-incinerator-bjarke-ingels-copenhagen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/14/love-waste-incinerator-bjarke-ingels-copenhagen","fields":{"headline":"How I learned to love a waste incinerator","bodyText":"I was mooching through the centre of Copenhagen last week when my architect friend spotted two chimneys sticking from a sensuous steel building going up just across the water. This is Denmark’s new waste-to-energy plant, which in Britain would be called an incinerator. The Danes are annoyingly incapable of designing anything horrible, and this vast factory, which will burn a quarter of all Denmark’s rubbish when it opens next year, is wrapped in a ski slope for the citizens of the capital. The chimneys will periodically emit huge rings of steam (not smoke) to elegantly demonstrate how much carbon dioxide is being released into the atmosphere by the plant – at one ring per tonne. There are obvious concerns about waste-to-energy plants emitting toxic pollution and not encouraging us to reduce consumption, but the plant’s architect, Bjarke Ingels, hopes it will change our perception of “public utility” buildings. (Ingels is a hotshot. He’s in charge of this year’s Serpentine Gallery pavilion and is designing a “canyon” outside Battersea power station in London.) The contrast with my bit of Britain is instructive. Norfolk county council recently squandered £30m on developing plans for an incinerator that public protests and government subsidy changes caused it to scrap. The council is now paying £68m over four years to ship waste from my home and every other in Norfolk to Germany and the Netherlands, where it will be burned. Strolling past the ancient wood of Finemere in Buckinghamshire recently, I encountered a monstrous incinerator that began burning rubbish this spring. The only thing done to soothe outraged locals has been to paint it in green and grey stripes. A ski slope and smoke rings might not convince us to love waste-to-energy – the practice of providing municipal heating via burning rubbish in Copenhagen is long established and relatively uncontroversial – but Ingels’s genius is to jolt us into demanding more from unpopular new public buildings. How about the world’s biggest funfair at Hinkley Point? The riches of grey salt marsh A visit to Scandinavia usually triggers a bout of very British self-loathing but one thing we’ve excelled at is saving our shores. Despite the occasional nuclear power station, we’ve turned much of our coast into contemporary common land via grassroots efforts and charities such as the National Trust (which now protects 775 miles of coast). Even governments have helped: the creation of an English coast path by 2020 could be the current and previous administrations’ most enduring positive legacy. The coast looks good. But it’s more than that. National Trust volunteers have conducted 24-hour “bioblitzes” – hunting for everything from oil beetles to otters – at 25 locations. They found the richest place for wildlife was not the stunning Cornish coast but a flat, grey salt marsh at Brancaster in Norfolk – an understated landscape that is teeming with 1,018 species of insect, plant, mammal and bird. Tiny island ideals I’m writing a book about small islands and wondering how small should I go. Tiny islands attract idealists and none more so than Roughs Tower, a fort built off Essex to repel a potential German invasion. Here, nearly 50 years ago, Major Roy Bates established his fiercely independent micro-kingdom of Sealand (motto: “From the Sea, Freedom”). “Prince” Roy died in 2012 and now Princess Joan of Sealand has passed away, aged 86. Another remarkable quality of small islanders is their longevity. So Sealand will thrive under the reign of their son, Prince Michael, for many years yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2015/oct/19/nothing-off-the-table-in-talks-with-chinese-president-says-no-10","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-19T12:28:22Z","webTitle":"Nothing off the table in talks with Chinese president, says No 10","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/19/nothing-off-the-table-in-talks-with-chinese-president-says-no-10","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/oct/19/nothing-off-the-table-in-talks-with-chinese-president-says-no-10","fields":{"headline":"Nothing off the table in talks with Chinese president, says No 10","bodyText":"Nothing will be off the table in David Cameron’s talks this week with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, Downing Street has said, as it defended its decision to roll out the red carpet for the Chinese leader, whose lavish four-day state visit begins late on Monday. Cameron is facing criticism from human rights campaigners, British security sources and some foreign governments over Britain becoming too close to China in a naked bid to win commercial contracts. The government is hailing a new golden era in Anglo-Chinese relations, and is clearly trying to push itself ahead of its European partners with the Chinese government after relations hit the deep freeze over Cameron’s apparent support for the independence of Tibet. But Downing Street said on Monday before the visit: “By developing a strong and engaged approach based on a constructive engagement we are able to raise issues on which we differ, frankly, and to do so with mutual respect. We will take this approach this week and nothing is off the table.” Cameron is due to hold two major sessions of talks with the Chinese leader, first at Downing Street alongside senior cabinet ministers, followed by a press conference. The home secretary, Theresa May, the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, the development secretary, Justine Greening, the energy secretary, Amber Rudd, and the chancellor, George Osborne, are all due to attend the talks in the cabinet rooms on Wednesday. The talks are likely to lead to a series of contracts being signed, including help with the nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, at the weekend said the expected deal to build the new nuclear power plant was “in the best interests of Britain and also in the interest of partnership between China and UK”. “UK people want to have a better life, want to have clean energy,” he said. It is unlikely Xi will attend the Wednesday press conference, but Downing Street declined to confirm that the Chinese president would refuse to take questions from the British press throughout his visit. On Thursday, Cameron will shift the government focus towards a broader foreign policy agenda with a further round of talks scheduled to take place over dinner at Chequers. The visit is riddled with potential diplomatic pitfalls ranging from Tibet, cyber-security, human rights, the security of British infrastructure and even whether Cameron should wear a poppy on Thursday in the run-up to Remembrance Day next month. The Chinese regard the red poppy as unacceptable since it has links to the Chinese opium wars. In 2010, Cameron’s delegation to China was asked not to wear poppies because they were a symbol of China’s humiliation at the hands of Europe in the wars that took place in the middle of the 19th century. The British delegation refused to do so. The prime minister’s spokesman said Cameron had set out his position defending Chinese sovereignty over Tibet and would not change that stance on this visit. Before the visit Downing Street announced that Cameron has appointed Jack Ma, China’s wealthiest businessman, to join the UK government’s business advisory board to give advice to British exporters on how to strike commercial deals with the Chinese. Ma, a Chinese national, has made billions from his giant online commerce site Alibaba."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/apr/07/engineers-defend-hinkley-point-reactor-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-07T17:31:03Z","webTitle":"French nuclear engineers defend Hinkley Point reactor plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/07/engineers-defend-hinkley-point-reactor-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/apr/07/engineers-defend-hinkley-point-reactor-plan","fields":{"headline":"French nuclear engineers defend Hinkley Point reactor plan","bodyText":"Engineers working in France’s nuclear power industry have issued an impassioned defence of EDF’s £18bn plan to build two reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset.

But 100 nuclear engineers in France – which has 58 reactors compared to the UK’s 15 – put their name to a letter in Le Monde newspaper on Thursday, insisting that Hinkley should proceed. “We are convinced that EDF is able to build and deliver the two Hinkley Point reactors on time,” they said, pointing out that the Hinkley reactors would be the fifth and sixth of their kind, benefiting from previous experience. “Hinkley Point is politically, economically and industrially, one of the most significant projects of our time,” they said. “Working with our British colleagues is an additional motivation because we and our supply chain will emerge stronger and able to compete internationally. “Like all projects of that magnitude, there are uncertainties, but it is our job to manage these. We are confident in our ability to succeed,” the letter concludes. The open letter follows the recent leak of a note blanche – the French term for an unsigned memo – suggesting even engineers believe the projected completion date of 2025 should be put back by two years. Disagreement over Hinkley has already triggered the departure of EDF’s finance director, Thomas Piquemal, with his frustration over Flamanville understood to have been a key factor in his resignation. Industry sources said Piquemal had been wounded by the repeated delays and had eventually lost faith in the ability of the firm’s engineers to deliver projects such as Hinkley on time and on budget. But senior EDF engineers are understood to be quietly confident that the lessons learned at Flamanville will prevent similar problems at Hinkley. The French energy giant has developed a computer-based 3D modelling tool that it believes will make construction run much more smoothly. Flamanville suffered delays as engineers repeatedly discovered that crucial “anchor plates” had been installed in the wrong place. While Flamanville engineers were also using 3D models, the technology available at the time did not allow them to simulate the actual construction process to identify potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies. The French reactor also ran into trouble when the steel dome covering the reactor’s pressure vessel, which contains the radioactive material, was found to have too high a level of carbon. High levels of carbon decrease the life of the reactor because the metal ages more quickly. Domes designed by EDF’s French partner Areva were destined to be used at Hinkley but have since been sent back for testing, as part of an effort to gauge the seriousness of the flaw discovered at Flamanville. In the meantime, EDF has ordered new domes for Hinkley made at the Japan Steel Works, whose manufacturing process makes it easier to avoid high carbon content. EDF has also found a way to improve the construction method of a metal liner that would help contain radioactivity in the event of a meltdown. It will build the cylindrical liner by stacking ready-made rings on top of one another, rather than building it in segments. Around 60 French expatriate staff employed on the Hinkley project have previously worked on Flamanville, giving them some insight into what obstacles might arise. EDF is expected to make a long-awaited final investment decision on Hinkley in early May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2016/aug/12/sarcasm-trump-obama-isis-cnn","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-12T12:40:55Z","webTitle":"Don't take me so seriously, says 'sarcastic' Trump | The daily briefing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/sarcasm-trump-obama-isis-cnn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2016/aug/12/sarcasm-trump-obama-isis-cnn","fields":{"headline":"Don't take me so seriously, says 'sarcastic' Trump","bodyText":"Trump retracts Isis accusation, mocks Clinton Donald Trump has tweeted a retraction of comments he has made repeatedly this week claiming Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were the co-founders of Isis. “Ratings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) ‘the founder’ of ISIS, &amp; MVP,” he tweeted at 3.26am on Friday. “THEY DON’T GET SARCASM?” In Florida on Thursday night, the Republican candidate implied Clinton lacks mental stamina, and twice got the day wrong. “Look, what happens, she gives a short speech then she goes home, goes to sleep, she shows up two days later.

Now, though, it is Fukushima, not Kyoto, that has come to define Japan’s energy policy, and with potentially grim consequences for its already stalled attempts to reduce CO2 emissions. It was telling that in the same week as a court blocked the restart of two nuclear reactors on the Japan Sea coast – citing concerns over their vulnerability to a major earthquake – the government released emissions data showing just how far Japan has regressed since the more hopeful days of the Kyoto summit in 1997. Environment ministry data showed that Japan’s CO2 emissions rose to the second-highest level on record in the year to March 2014. Local media reports said that Japan, the world’s fifth-largest greenhouse gas emitter, aims to reduce CO2 emissions by about 20% from 2013 levels by 2030 – a much lower target than other major developed economies. In earlier climate talks it pledged a more ambitious reduction of 25% by 2020 from 1990 levels. The new targets, if as unambitious as reported, are expected to draw criticism when Japan and other G7 countries meet in Germany in June, and at the UN climate conference in Paris in November. “The Fukushima disaster had a huge impact on Japan’s emissions reduction target, practically and politically,” said Tetsunari Iida, director of the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies in Tokyo. As Britain and other countries push for more ambitions reductions, Japan has been accused of reneging on its climate change commitments as it ramps up fossil-fuel use, with plans to build more coal-fired plants in the absence of the nuclear option. All of Japan’s 48 working reactors went offline after Fukushima, and attempts by the pro-nuclear prime minister, Shinzō Abe, to push for restarts risk being held up by months, perhaps years, by legal wrangling. “The Abe administration is very close to big industry and the power monopolies and they have very low ambitions in terms of climate change policy,” Iida said. “I expect that the new mid-term target, which has to be announced by the time the G7 meets, will be rather low.” The March 2011 Fukushima disaster shattered the public’s faith in the “safety myth” surrounding nuclear energy, which once accounted for almost 30% of Japan’s energy needs, with plans to raise its share to about half with the construction of more reactors. Keith Henry, an analyst and founder of Asia Strategy, a government policy consultancy in Tokyo, said sensible discussion of CO2 emissions was being lost amid a highly emotive debate over the future of nuclear power post-Fukushima. “Depending on which side you believe, nuclear power is the saviour that will return Japan to a stable, secure energy supply and reduce its balance of payments deficit, or will be the potential source of another nuclear meltdown,” Henry said. “The threat of a nuclear meltdown overrides concerns about an increase in CO2 emissions.” Before an earthquake and tsunami sent three of Fukushima Daiichi’s six reactors into meltdown, nuclear was at the core of Japan’s emissions strategy. But the turning of the popular tide against nuclear has sent policymakers back to the drawing board, and risks leaving Japan’s climate change efforts in tatters. With all of its reactors idle, Japan has been forced to import record quantities of expensive coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) that have dramatically increased CO2 emissions and, the business community says, are putting the country’s economic recovery at risk. Climate change campaigners have accused Abe and his allies of talking up nuclear power to avoid confronting hard choices about its future energy mix. “The government is using this as an opportunity to make excuses not to do more about CO2 reductions,” said Hisayo Takada, climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace Japan. “If it did everything possible to tackle climate change, then things would eventually change for the better. But instead, it is hanging on to the old ways of thinking, and barely gives any thought to renewables and energy efficiency. “Is it right to keep spending money on something that is old and has no future, or to invest in something new and watch it grow? The answer to that is obvious.” The industry lobby, too, is pushing to switch idled nuclear reactors back on, despite opinion polls showing that most voters oppose restarts. As long as they hold out hope for even a limited role for nuclear, the impetus for serious investment in renewables will be lost, said Aileen Smith of Green Action. “The utilities are saving grid space for nuclear, which effectively blocks suppliers of renewable energy. In turn, that dampens investment in renewables because investors can’t be sure which way the wind is blowing politically,” said Smith. “It’s clear that far from being good for climate change, nuclear power is actually contributing to higher emissions of global warning gases.” Paul J Scalise, a senior research fellow at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany, said the nuclear shutdown and higher dependence on coal and LNG “doesn’t help Japan’s CO2 targets in any way at all. But you have to bear in mind that climate change is a secondary issue for the power utilities. They want nuclear reactors back online for financial reasons.” Scalise, an expert on Japanese energy policy, added: “Japan is stuck in a trade-off between economic efficiency and environmental friendliness, and currently there is no political answer to that. In that sense, Japan is right there with everyone else in having this problem.” Abe’s enthusiasm for reactor restarts is proof that Japan’s “nuclear village” of politicians, utilities and regulators is re-establishing its influence more than four years after Fukushima. But amid public opposition to nuclear restarts and resistance to the extra investment needed to promote renewables, industry’s priority now is ramping up the use of fossil fuels. “The strongest opposition to a major policy shift towards renewables is coming from industry,” said Mika Ohbayashi, director of the Japan Renewable Energy Foundation in Tokyo. “Since Fukushima, the utilities have faced huge difficulties because they can no longer use nuclear, so that they’re losing an important asset. They want to protect their coal use because in the future, nuclear capacity could fluctuate depending on the political situation. “They know that Japan won’t be able to switch all of its nuclear reactors back on, and that means coal is their main concern now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/jul/20/fukushima-exclusion-zone-art-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-20T14:02:42Z","webTitle":"Apocalypse no!

Why artists should not go into the Fukushima exclusion zone","bodyText":"It is no surprise that art is drawn to politics. The drama and emotion of a conflicted world can make for moving, haunting images. But is art really capable of useful commentary on world events – or does it encourage fatuously emotional responses? An exhibition in the Fukushima exclusion zone in Japan is an example of what I am talking about. That’s right, the Fukushima exclusion zone – the 20km zone surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which was damaged in Japan’s devastating 2011 earthquake and leaked radiation. Artists including Ai Weiwei, Taryn Simon, Miyanaga Aiko, Meiro Koizumi, Takekawa Nobuaki, Ahmet Öğüt and Trevor Paglen are showing their work in a poisoned atmosphere, in a deathly post-apocalyptic realm. You get the picture. Or not. I’ve no doubt all these artists will make interesting works but the “exhibition” is a mere stunt, a gesture. Literally no one can visit this art show. It is real, but can only be visualised. The art is effectively invisible, like radiation itself. So it makes us think, right? Actually, no. In mourning the Fukushima disaster and drawing attention to the supposed horror and scandal of this radiation leak, this exhibition stops thought instead of inviting it. A nuclear exclusion zone certainly is a strange, unearthly place, but does it mean what the soul-searching artists want us to agree that it means: is it an image of human folly and sinister science? It’s interesting that Fukushima draws more headlines four years on than the earthquake and tsunami themselves that ravaged Japan in 2011. This natural disaster took 15,890 lives. It caused many injuries and huge structural devastation. But it was beyond human control: there is no one to be angry at. The earth itself is at fault. The damage to a nuclear power plant was just part of that huge natural disaster – but it has become “iconic” and the stuff of art exhibitions because it arouses the intense emotions that nuclear power always provokes. No one has died as a result of the Fukushima radiation leakage, and the World Health Organisation says even staff were exposed to no significant radiation. It is, in fact, an example of a well-managed and successfully contained nuclear accident. In one of the worst natural disasters of modern times, a cataclysm that shook a sophisticated modern society inside out, the nightmare of a lethal nuclear accident was actually avoided. If we looked at nuclear energy rationally, Fukushima would not be a byword for sci-fi scariness. It would instead be a glowing beacon of optimism about our ability to use this form of energy in a safe way – even under the most severe tests. George Monbiot scandalised the Green movement by pointing this out in the Guardian in 2011. A rational debate may be more useful than just feasting, once more, on the apocalyptic image of nuclear disaster. The artists showing in the Fukushima exclusion zone would do more good starting a discussion with science about the pros and cons of nuclear energy as a solution to global warming. Instead, this and other exhibitions about Fukushima – a recent show inspired by it included Sigmar Polke’s eerie photographs of green globs made by exposing uranium to sensitive paper – dwell on a stereotypical, cliched imagery of nuclear catastrophe that has not changed since the Cold War. The tragic history of Japan – the only nation ever to have been attacked with nuclear weapons – of course adds to that unease. But civil nuclear power is not the same thing as nuclear warfare. It may even be part of a better future for our planet. We need at least a more open-minded debate – and ever since Andy Warhol’s atom bomb paintings, artists have hindered that debate. Politics, I am starting to think, needs less art and more science."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2016/may/13/russias-state-owned-nuclear-group-keen-to-break-into-uk-market","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-13T18:31:27Z","webTitle":"Russia's state-owned nuclear group keen to break into UK market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/13/russias-state-owned-nuclear-group-keen-to-break-into-uk-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2016/may/13/russias-state-owned-nuclear-group-keen-to-break-into-uk-market","fields":{"headline":"Russia's state-owned nuclear group keen to break into UK market","bodyText":"A Russian nuclear group is hoping that the potential meltdown of French plans to build new European pressurised reactors at Hinkley Point could offer an opportunity to break into the British nuclear market. Deeper concerns about the future of the Somerset scheme were raised by the French energy minister, Ségolène Royal, who warned of the “colossal” cost, which EDF admitted could be £18bn or even £21bn. Recent talks have been held between state-owned Russian nuclear group Rosatom and the UK’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) despite the chilly political relations between London and Moscow over Ukraine, Moscow sources claimed. These discussions centred on whether Russia could help Britain with removal of uranium from old reactors – but Rosatom is understood to have a wider agenda of trying to resuscitate earlier plans to build its own reactors in Britain. “There is still an appetite to enter the UK market,” said a senior Russian nuclear industry source who claimed Rosatom’s London-based representatives still maintained contacts with the Department of Energy and Climate Change. “If the French decided to abandon its EPR design then there is a tiny chance that Rosatom could join forces with the French, and say a British company such as Rolls-Royce, to offer a Russian-designed reactor. “EDF has been pushing the [UK] government to consider a portfolio of reactor designs, not just Areva’s [EPR] but Chinese technologies. So why not use Russian designs? Technically speaking its doable.” The Russians accept that sanctions and other political considerations make it difficult for such a plan to progress, but they point out that Rosatom still supplies uranium to UK and US nuclear plants. The NuDA confirmed that it had held a series of talks with Rosatom. “We have met with them. We are a recognised global authority and we meet with a lot of organisations,” said a spokesman. The DECC said it had not held meetings with Rosatom and poured cold water on the likelihood of the Russians being invited back into such a process. A spokesperson said: “There are absolutely no plans for Russia to build a nuclear reactor in the UK.” The Russians boast of having the only third generation nuclear plants up and running in the world and so should be able to fast forward a generic design assessment in Britain similar to the one gone through by the EPR. It is not just the Russians who are hoping to prosper if EDF does eventually pull the plug on its own troubled Hinkley plans. China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN), a financial partner of EDF at Hinkley, is also considering its options should the existing plans collapse. The state-owned Chinese company has denied a claim that it would step in and take over in Somerset should EDF back out. But CGN is dusting off its own plans to fast forward attempts to win a design assessment on its Hualong reactors for a similar project at Bradwell in Essex. China wants to use Britain as a showcase for its Hualong technology and agreed to take a third share in EDF’s Hinkley scheme in return for being allowed to proceed with Chinese-owned technology at Bradwell. CGN had intended to submit its reactor for generic design assessment in Britain this summer following an expected final investment decision by EDF and itself at Hinkley. But the French have put this decision back until at least September amid a welter of concerns within EDF about the cost of building Hinkley and the state of its own fragile finances. CGN says it continues to be committed to the EDF partnership on Hinkley, but Chinese industry experts with contact to the Chinese say CGN is looking at whether it can move ahead more quickly with Bradwell if EDF concludes it must abandon Hinkley. Those worries were given extra weight with Royal’s comments in an interview with the Financial Times in which she said: “I am wondering if we should go ahead with the project. The sums involved are colossal.” And they added to fears about the future of the Somerset project earlier this week when the company’s management was pilloried by shareholders at its annual general meeting and credit agency Moody’s downgraded EDF debt. John Sauven, Greenpeace’s executive director, said the downgrading was just “a long line of massive red flag warnings” the UK government had received over the Hinkley nuclear project. He added: “Hinkley power station must not become ‘too big to fail’ because of politicians’ egos that are too big to back down.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2015/sep/25/george-osborne-presses-on-with-hinkley-power-station-despite-criticism","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-25T18:48:58Z","webTitle":"George Osborne presses on with Hinkley power station despite criticism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/25/george-osborne-presses-on-with-hinkley-power-station-despite-criticism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/sep/25/george-osborne-presses-on-with-hinkley-power-station-despite-criticism","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne presses on with Hinkley power station despite criticism","bodyText":"Nuclear power returned to the top of the political agenda this week when George Osborne used his visit to China to underline the government’s determination to push through the Hinkley Point C power station project. There are expectations that the energy company behind the proposed plant, EDF of France, will announce a final investment decision on the £24.5bn scheme during the visit of Chinese premier Xi Jinping to London next month. Beijing holds the key to Hinkley because state-controlled EDF wants two of China’s nuclear companies to commit as investors before it gives the green light. But even as governments in Britain, France and China push for a commitment from EDF, there is a growing army of critics who want to halt what they argue is the most expensive power station ever planned. Industrialists and City analysts have joined traditional opponents Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth in saying the scheme is a white elephant. At £24.5bn, Hinkley will cost more than the London Olympics, the Crossrail project and a new terminal at Heathrow airport combined. It will produce 7% of Britain’s electricity needs, or 3,200 MW of nuclear power, which comes in at around £7.6bn per gigawatt. Some argue that the government could create 20,000 MW of onshore wind-powered electricity or 50,000 MW of gas for the same price. Furthermore, under the subsidy regime promised by George Osborne, householders and businesses will need to pay £92.50 per MW hour for Hinkley electricity compared to a current wholesale price of £40. To make matters worse, the £92.50 will rise in line with the consumer price index (CPI) rate of inflation, meaning that, by 2030, the guaranteed price could be as high as £150. Peter Atherton, utility analyst at Jefferies investment bank, calculates that Hinkley will be producing annual pre-tax profits for its owners of £2bn, rising to £5bn by the end of the agreed 35-year contract. He believes the chancellor is gambling that world oil and gas prices will more than double over the time it takes to build the Somerset plant. “If they don’t, its going to look like financial insanity,” he said. Rival analysts are also in agreement that the plant is a potential financial risk. Analysts at HSBC cite “ample reason for the UK government to delay or cancel the project”, while RWE, one of the big six power companies, believes Hinkley is “an expensive mistake”. So why does it appear that George Osborne, who has been trumpeting his support for the project to its Chinese backers in Beijing this week, would lock British consumers into some of the highest priced electricity in the world? Firstly, EDF supporters argue it is misleading to compare a £92.50 guaranteed price for nuclear with current wholesale power prices because the latter are artificially low due to the depressed value of coal. They make the point that wholesale power prices were £80 per MW hour in 2008 – double their current level – and could return to this level when Britain’s coal-fired power stations are phased out due to old age and greenhouse gas regulations. Friends of atomic power also claim renewables such as wind and solar are also unable to guarantee constant energy production, unlike nuclear, while noting that gas is a fossil fuel which exacerbates global warming. And they insist that some wind projects backed by the government under a scheme running till 2021 could cost £137 per MWh. Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF, told the BBC on Thursday that nuclear energy is worth the investment because it provides “baseload” power which is available round-the-clock. “It will save customers at least 10% on their bills and above that, it will create 25,000 jobs up and down the country. It will boost the industrial stamina of this country. All in all it is worth it, believe me.” The department of energy and climate change argues that many of the calculations on the cost of building gas-fired plants fail to factor in operating and fuel costs. If these are taken into account, it says nuclear power will be able to hold its own in terms of cost with competing. “The UK is committed to meeting our climate change targets in the most cost-effective way. As a low-carbon, reliable and affordable energy source, nuclear is a fundamental part of our plan to reach these targets and to power the country in the decades ahead,” said a DECC spokeswoman. “We are confident in the economic case for new nuclear power stations and we expect Hinkley Point C to be competitive with other forms of low-carbon power generation in the 2020s when it is powering our homes and businesses with low-carbon electricity.” But it is not just the £92.50 MWh level of “strike price” agreed with the Treasury that rankles. After all, offshore wind farms have cost as much as £155, and the Swansea Bay tidal power company is said to be demanding £168. EDF argues that the risk of the project is being borne by private investors, but the British state – the taxpayer – could be liable for £17bn of the £24bn through a government infrastructure guarantee scheme. The nuclear industry also has a poor reputation for delivering its enormous projects on time. Hinkley is already behind schedule and the industry’s image has been further tarnished by two key plants currently being constructed in Finland and France. The European pressurised reactor (EPR) at Olkiluoto in Finland was started in 2005 and meant to be ready by 2009, but the start date has been repeatedly put back, quadrupling costs. The expected completion date is now 2018 . EDF started work on an EPR in Flamanville, Normandy, eight years ago and had said it would be up and running in 2012. Three years later, EDF can only say it is aiming to start generating electricity in 2018. The costs at Flamanville have tripled already. The French nuclear engineering group, Areva, is involved in both of them and is meant to be providing the same design work at Hinkley. This has made EDF’s mission to sell Hinkley to the British public much more difficult. These problems have led to significant losses at Areva, also controlled by the French state, which unveiled a €4.8bn (£3.5bn) annual loss and said it would cut 6,000 jobs. The French government has since backed a proposed merger between EDF and Areva. Hinkley is being touted as a vital energy project, but its status as a prized private sector investment, relying on the support of politicians in China, is less easy to justify. Ultimately, ministers in Beijing want to showcase their own nuclear technology to the world by building their own plant at Bradwell in Essex, something agreed by Osborne in return for the Hinkley investment. The French state also wants to use the Somerset plant to sell its nuclear prowess globally, while the British government has too much political credibility to lose by pulling the plug now. With those stakes, the £24.5bn price tag may not matter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"inequality/2017/jul/04/is-inequality-bad-for-the-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"inequality","sectionName":"Inequality","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-04T09:41:24Z","webTitle":"Is inequality bad for the environment?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/jul/04/is-inequality-bad-for-the-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/inequality/2017/jul/04/is-inequality-bad-for-the-environment","fields":{"headline":"Is inequality bad for the environment?","bodyText":"That equality matters in terms of health and happiness has been clear for some years. But it is also better for the environment. The evidence (which is still emerging) suggests the most unequal affluent countries contribute more to climate change via pollution than their more equal counterparts. A large section of their people may suffer more, too. A new report predicts the United States will see its levels of economic inequality increase due to the uneven geographical effects of climate change – resulting in “the largest transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in the country’s history”, according the study’s lead author. In a 2016 report, Oxfam found that the greatest polluters of all were the most affluent 10% of US households: each emitted, on average, 50 tonnes of CO2 per household member per year. Canada’s top 10% were the next most polluting, followed by the British, Russian and South African elites. In more equitable affluent countries such as South Korea, Japan, France, Italy and Germany, the rich don’t just pollute less; the average pollution is lower too, because the bottom half of these populations pollute less than the bottom half in the US, Canada or Britain, despite being better off. In short, people in more equal rich countries consume less, produce less waste and emit less carbon, on average. Indeed, almost everything associated with the environment improves when economic equality is greater. Consumption and waste When you buy an item, you don’t think about junking it. But you will eventually throw away almost everything you buy. Some of it you may recycle, but recycling is not only never fully efficient, it also uses a great deal of energy and hence generates pollution itself. Not buying things you don’t need is far better, but in a world where the main function of advertising is to get you to buy things that you could live without, that is hard. In more unequal societies, there is a proliferation of products that are designed not to last, so as to allow greater profits to be made. Producing endless must-have new versions exploits the higher levels of emotional insecurity that living with great inequality generates. The success of the clothing industry is an interesting example. People buy far greater quantities of cheaper clothes and throw them away more frequently in the most economically unequal countries. A recent UK survey of 2,000 women suggested that the majority of clothes are bought because they are seen as fashionable and are worn, on average, just seven times before they are discarded. A third of women see them as old after they have been worn three times. The chart above, in which each country is sized according to its population, tracks an environmental indicator (the vertical axis) against levels of inequality (the horizontal one). Countries to the right are more unequal, while countries that are high up produce more waste. If the correlation between the two were perfect, they would all line up along a line drawn from the bottom left to the top right. Inevitably there are outliers that don’t fit – in this case Denmark and Switzerland, and this could be because they do a better job of collecting data on waste than other countries. But the tendency of the more unequal countries to produce more waste is still striking overall – and would be even more so if the 50 US states were included separately as smaller circles. In Japan people on average buy and throw away half as much as people in the US – of everything! In economically unequal countries the pressure to buy items to keep up with your peers, with “people who count”, is enormous, especially when it comes to clothes, fashion, new cars and other status symbols. We are encouraged to be aspirational, to better ourselves, not for the greater good, but for selfish reasons – ultimately to be able to get all that stuff. A good job is no longer one which benefits society, but one that pays you well. Eating meat Eating a lot of meat is not good for you or the planet. The amount of crops that have to be grown and transported to feed the animals that we eat is far greater than the amount that would be needed if we just ate the crops themselves. So, the more meat per person that is eaten in a country, the less environmentally friendly the people of that country collectively are. By weight (if we ignore insects and fish), most of the animal life on our planet is now intensively farmed for our own consumption. Those animals produce enormous amounts of greenhouse gases during their short lives, with cattle being the worst polluters of all. The most common bird on the planet is now the domestic chicken, reared solely because so many of us in the rich world have become so used to eating cheap meat. This chart suggests that the more unequal countries (again sized according to population) tend to consume more meat. Again, there are a few outliers – notably Australia and New Zealand/Aotearoa, possibly because their cultural histories are bound up with the rearing of sheep and cattle and their high levels of meat production. But the general trend is clear. Increasing meat consumption has not made us healthier. In some countries, we are now eating so excessively that it is making many of us obese. Obesity rates are much higher in affluent countries that are more economically unequal. One theory as to why is that the poor in such countries have to resort to cheap fast food, which is advertised to them aggressively and often includes lower-grade meat. Another theory is that in more equitable countries, the population tends to be better educated and so can more easily see through the folly of fast-food advertising and gluttony. What we do know is that people in more economically unequal countries in general eat more meat per person by weight. Whatever the reason, the world needs human beings to eat less meat if we are to avoid depleting our soils, increasing greenhouse gases and also reducing the biodiversity of the planet to such an extent that monocultures prevail and we lose habitats. Water We mainly extract water for agricultural uses, to water the crops that we then feed to the animals, but we also use water for industries that produce more stuff and more packaging for that stuff than we actually need. The final use we have for water is for ourselves, for domestic use, and here, just as with meat, we can see huge variations between countries that are otherwise similarly wealthy. And again the variations appear to be related to economic inequality. In more unequal affluent countries, people on average consume more water for personal use – or are far more wasteful over their use of water. This chart measures domestic water consumption against economic equality for the 25 most affluent countries in the world. Again, the excessive use in the US stands out: consumption per person there is about three-and-a-half times higher than in Germany. It is not as if the US has ample rainfall: you can look at the US Drought Monitor any week of the year to see their ongoing problems. The relationship between water consumption and inequality seems clear, though there is quite a lot of variation. The UK may use a little less water than might be predicted from its levels of economic inequality, partly because the climate of the UK makes it less useful to have private outdoor swimming pools if you are rich. In contrast, more water is used per head in Australia than might be expected from its level of inequality, presumably because of its warmer climate. So why are people in Canada, Singapore and the US using so much more water for domestic purposes than those in Germany, France or Japan? Possibly there is a lot less concern about wasting water in more unequal countries. Toilet cisterns may be less “eco-friendly”, people may worry a little less about watering the garden with a chlorinated supply designed for human consumption, not for plants. It is not that people are cleaner and wash more often in the more inequitable countries (per person, the Japanese buy the most soap worldwide), and it is certainly not that they are drinking more water. What is happening is that they are wasting more, and that may be related to a more general ethos that people should be free to do as they wish and damn the consequences for others – an ethos that appears to be far more prevalent in more inequitable countries. Carbon dioxide The most damaging form of pollution (in terms of absolute effect) is the carbon dioxide (CO2) we are responsible for releasing into the atmosphere. Residents of the US contribute more emissions of CO2 than any other of the 25 rich countries featured. US emissions per person are almost twice those of the Japanese, and more than three times those of the French. In general, the more economically unequal a rich country is, the more CO2 it emits. There are exceptions of course: the UK is a relatively low emitter because it currently has access to natural gas from the North Sea and has already mined and burned its most accessible coal; 75% of France’s electricity production derives from nuclear power, which emits less CO2 but creates much longer-lasting radioactive waste. In contrast, Australia mines and burns a great deal more coal (and also, incidentally, mines a large amount of uranium). In 2016 Oxfam reported in detail on why emissions from some countries were so much greater than others (see chart above). Collaborating with economists including Thomas Piketty, it discovered that what drove excessive consumption in any particular affluent country was economic inequality, because the best-off in a country tend to waste more energy, heat their homes more than they need to, drive more than they need to in bigger gas-guzzling cars, take more flights and require more cement and other materials to construct their larger-than-needed buildings – while at the same time buying and throwing away more items. Globally, half the CO2 emissions associated with individual lifestyles are due to the actions of the richest tenth of humanity, who disproportionately live in the more unequal of the world’s most affluent 25 countries. Transport Our excessive use of motor vehicles contributes not only CO2 but also other damaging gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, as well as pumping particulate matter into the air we all breathe. Among the most affluent 25 countries, three stand out as extreme in this regard: the US, Canada and Australia. These three are among the least-densely populated countries in the rich world, and driving distances between homes and workplaces are often long, but they have chosen to arrange their cities in this way. That choice was again affected by economic inequality and the beliefs associated with it: that individual aspirations should trump the collective good, and that “the car is king”. Relatively low petrol/gasoline use in the UK, Singapore and Israel shows that very unequal countries need not necessarily use huge amounts. In these three cases, there are large dense urban areas that can only function with good public transport such as underground trains, buses and trams. But it is worth noting that no relatively equal affluent country consumes more than half as much gasoline as people in Canada and the US do each year. All of us will have to consume far less fossil fuel in the near future, and those reductions will be far more easily achieved in a country that sees the provision of efficient, low-polluting public transport as a collective good rather than a dangerous precedent. Consider the proportion of people who cycle or walk to work in each country. This ranges from 50% (in the Netherlands) to less than 5% (in the US). Everything is connected. People are fatter in the US because they eat more food; because they sit in cars more often and for longer; because they are exposed to more advertising and eat more and buy more cars as a result; because they live in greater fear of crime and so are afraid of not driving; and because they are surrounded by other obese people and therefore don’t feel so unusual if they are also fat. But behind all of these factors lies the basic difference in how human beings are ranked. Rank them sky high by paying them many times more than other people, and they can become so conceited that they more easily treat others who are less well-off poorly, with no respect and with little empathy. When pay differentials are less and no-one’s income is out-of-this world, people realise they have far more in common with others. They then argue for cycle routes, pavements, good public transport, and to be able to afford to live near where they work. Even in the US, there is still much hope – new learning occurring and new understanding growing – but it is happening locally rather than nationally. In Seattle, a 20mph limit was agreed in 2016 for all residential streets in the city. The downtown arterial roads in that city will now be limited to 25mph, making it far safer to cycle along those roads and to cross them as a pedestrian. Such measures, of course, also encourage people not to believe their car will get them from place to place more quickly than others can travelling by bus or, where it is available, by light rail. Air travel One way in which the residents of affluent countries can pollute less is by flying less. Many of the flights we undertake are unnecessary, but we take them because we can. Of course, most people – even in affluent countries – will not fly in any given year, while a few will fly often. Those who pollute the most (per person) are executives flown around in private jets. It is at take-off that aircraft use most fuel, so this chart shows the average number of airplane take-offs per person per year in each country. Again there is a relationship with inequality – and again, a few of the outliers can be explained by the presence of many remote settlements, or by a country being an island (in the case of New Zealand/Aotearoa). The US dominates, and if circles for all its separate states were drawn, the overall pattern would look even more obvious. It could instead have chosen to develop a series of high-speed rail lines across its land, as other affluent countries have done and as even less affluent ones such as China are now doing. The US is notable for the number of people living there that have never left their own country, so most of its air flights are internal. It is also well known for preferring free enterprise and competition to social planning. High-speed rail lines require planning and timetabling. In the majority of the 25 countries, less than one plane takes off per year for every 100 people living there. In the UK it is nearer two planes, in the US three, in Canada four and in Norway five. Norway is famously equitable, but it is also remote and has access to relatively cheap aircraft fuel from its oilfields. Being more equitable is no guarantor of better environmental behaviour, but it tends to be associated with it. So what now? In 1443, Shinto priests who lived on the edge of Lake Suwa in Japan began recording the day when the lake froze over in winter and when the temperature changes created a ridge of ice across the surface. They believed the ridge was formed by the feet of the gods as they walked over the lake, and so they carried on recording the day the ridge was formed each year after that, to the present day. In the first 250 years of the priests’ recordings, the lake only failed to freeze over three times. Between 1955 and 2004, it failed to freeze over 12 times. Between 2005 and 2014, it failed to freeze over five times – every other year. Since 2014 it has not frozen over. There are many different records of global warming, but the Lake Suwa records are the longest and most striking. It is only since the late 1970s that the 25 rich countries focused on in this article have begun to diverge widely in their levels of economic inequality. Because they have done so, a set of natural experiments has been set up which today allows research into the effects of these differences. The preliminary conclusion, based on these natural experiments, is that the more economically equitable countries tend to perform better across a wide range of environmental measures. Once we know what the driving forces are, and become fully aware of the damage that is done by inequality in environmental as well as social terms, we will know how necessary it is to embrace change.

Nuclear and fracking for shale gas are key planks of the Conservative government’s energy policy, but the polling published on Tuesday shows just one in five people now support shale gas and one in three support nuclear. Government sources warned last week that fracking plans could be delayed for 16 months after Lancashire county council rejected applications by shale gas company Cuadrilla to drill and frack wells in Fylde. Plans for a new nuclear power station at Hinkley in Somerset have also come under fire recently, with the Conservative peer Lord Howell of Guildford warning of rising costs of the “elephantine” project and HSBC criticising the £25bn cost for Hinkley’s new reactors. Green campaigners and renewable trade bodies said the polling showed the government was at odds with the public. Daisy Sands, Greenpeace UK head of energy, said: “The government’s own survey shows ministers’ priorities on energy are at the polar opposite of what the British public wants. Popular technologies like wind and solar are having their support axed, whilst the more-unpopular-than-ever fracking industry keeps getting preferential treatment.” Friends of the Earth senior energy campaigner, Donna Hume, said: “It’s little surprise that the more people find out about the risks of fracking, the more they oppose it.” The latest version of the Department of Energy and Climate Change’s (Decc) public attitudes tracking survey, which has been running for three years, has also temporarily dropped polling on public support for renewable energy. The government has recently announced several cuts to subsidies for renewables. Maf Smith, deputy chief executive of the trade body RenewableUK, said: “It’s disappointing to see that the Department of Energy and Climate Change hasn’t included crucial data showing the high level of public backing for onshore and offshore wind in this particular wave of polling. “We hope the government will bear that in mind when it comes to formulating its energy policy so that it starts to take a balanced approach to all technologies, including renewables”. The survey has consistently shown around two-thirds of people support onshore windfarms, one of the first targets of the Conservative government, which is ending subsidies for them in 2016. The poll has also regularly shown even higher levels of support for solar power, and tiny levels of opposition. Last month, Decc signalled it was cutting support for smaller solar farms, having already ended subsidies for larger ones. However, Decc said that a decision had been taken at the start of the year to shorten this edition of the survey, and that polling on renewables would return in the next release of the survey, due in November. “New nuclear power and home-grown shale gas are vital to build a clean, affordable, safe and reliable energy system that can keep the lights on and heat our homes for decades ahead,” a Decc spokeswoman said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/sep/15/nuclear-power-limits-compromise-editorial","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-15T22:54:48Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power: limits of compromise | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/15/nuclear-power-limits-compromise-editorial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/15/nuclear-power-limits-compromise-editorial","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power: limits of compromise","bodyText":"Honest and informed people disagree passionately about nuclear power. Supporters maintain that nuclear power offers affordable low-carbon electricity and is thus a vital tool in attempts to curb climate change. Opponents say the technology is inherently too dangerous and that the financial and environmental costs of waste are almost infinite. Climate change has forced many who were against nuclear power to reconsider their position in the argument. A disaster like the Fukushima meltdown, which took place in a hi-tech, risk-averse democratic society, can swing the argument back in the other direction in an instant, for compelling reasons. That argument remains unresolved. Public opinion fluctuates with the news. Green voices find it harder to get a serious hearing. After Fukushima, global anti-nuclear sentiment was high. In Germany, it prompted Angela Merkel, who is both a scientist and a politician, into a U-turn commitment to phase out nuclear power by 2022. More recently, public opinion has fallen back, in this country at least. A recent poll found almost half the population in favour of government investment in nuclear power, with the rest either opposed or don't-knows. Yet enthusiasm for renewables remains at much higher levels than support for nuclear. Trying to resolve these dilemmas is anything but straightforward, because this is a policy area where compromise is difficult. On Sunday at their conference in Glasgow, the Liberal Democrats performed their own U-turn, in the opposite direction to Mrs Merkel's. Having been for decades Britain's principal nuclear-power sceptics, the party eased themselves into the position of conditional supporters, leaving only the Greens as outright opponents. The motion adopted in Glasgow accorded nuclear power stations a \"limited role\" in power supply on condition that \"concerns about safety, disposal of radioactive waste and cost\" are properly addressed and provided there is no public subsidy for new-build. Politically, the argument for a mix of energy sources is sensible. The problem is that this does not withstand much serious scrutiny. How limited is a limited role? How can concerns about safety be addressed when Fukushima – where the cleanup is costing tens of billions of pounds and is likely to take 40 years – remains a living example of the difficulty of addressing them in practice? And how can nuclear power ever be built except by public subsidy when commercial companies have fled the nuclear scene and the only serious players are those backed by the Chinese, Russian and French governments? None of these questions is easily answered, but the Lib Dems took a bad decision on Sunday, which leaves the public debate all the poorer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2016/may/09/solar-bright-future-despite-uk-conservative-government","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-09T12:02:11Z","webTitle":"Solar has a bright future in the UK despite Tory efforts to cloud the picture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/09/solar-bright-future-despite-uk-conservative-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/may/09/solar-bright-future-despite-uk-conservative-government","fields":{"headline":"Solar has a bright future in the UK despite Tory efforts to cloud the picture","bodyText":"King Canute is alive and well in Britain. While solar energy has become a global success story over the past few years, with tumbling costs and exploding deployment, Britain, which was keen on the technology, has slammed on the brakes, casting a shadow over a sector which employed more than 30,000 people but is now shedding jobs by the thousand. The big picture on solar is, well, big. Last year $161bn (£111bn) was invested around the world, more than gas and coal combined. Europe will reach a 100GW peak of solar deployed this year, enough to supply about one-fifth of the European Union population with clean power. Britain experienced a surge and now has 10GW, with 800,000 homeowners enjoying the technology’s indisputable benefits. We now produce 25% of our electricity from renewables – 10% from solar, with the rest mainly wind power. This is more power than we get from coal, something unthinkable just a few years ago. Solar is jobs-intensive and many small and medium-sized firms have grown to meet the demand and build up skills they are now deploying around the world – a success story at every level. But the government ditched support for solar farms last year, worrying they might push some Tory voters in the shires into the arms of Ukip. Once rid of the renewables-friendly Liberal Democrats, the new Conservative government got out the wrecking ball. It also slashed support for roof-mounted solar, leading installation volumes to collapse by 80% so far this year. The only renewable left standing was offshore wind, although it is much more expensive than onshore wind or solar, and receives a lot of government largesse. I am a fan of all renewables, but the government justifies its slashing of support for onshore wind and solar due to the cost of “subsidies”, as it wrongly labels the feed-in tariff or renewables obligation – mechanisms which have driven huge cost reductions. Subsidies in the true sense keep prices high and industries inefficient. Remember the EU wine lakes and butter mountains. Think, too, of the huge price being offered to Hinkley Point C nuclear station for its power up until 2060. That’s a massive subsidy, as well as a burden on future generations, which will do nothing to bring costs down; quite the reverse. The energy secretary, Amber Rudd, says solar must stand on its own two feet. We in the industry agree and have all been merciless in bearing down on costs, which are down 80% over the past five years. But it is downright dishonest of the government to call for free markets without support but reserved solely for solar or onshore wind. The truth is that Britain is not a free market economy. It remains a corporatist economy run by big firms that love big solutions such as offshore wind farms (no SMEs there) or nuclear power stations. Conventional energy corporations, scared to death of the massive drop in the cost of solar, tell ministers that renewables can never be the solution. Pity the facts belie this nonsense, but the Tories have swallowed it. Solar is only a couple of years away from not needing any support at all, but still the government wants to prevent it even surviving that far. They are allocating £12m a year support for the next three years – only about 1.5% of the support available to other technologies under the so-called Levy Control Framework, the details of which the government scandalously refuses to reveal. The government is not the only problem. In 2013 the EU mandated a minimum price for Chinese solar panels. This has prevented costs falling rapidly in lockstep with incentives reductions and slashed margins. Moreover, wholesale electricity prices have tumbled along with oil prices and so solar plants can earn less from the power they sell. Britain’s electricity grid is a problem too. It is weak and has little capacity left for renewables to connect. Thus grid connections are scarce and expensive. Will solar survive in the UK? Well, storage technology is rapidly advancing and costs are falling. With the grid a mess, solar with storage will enable lots of warehouses and factories to be provided with clean power where and when they need it. The next couple of years will be tough, and deployment a fraction of recent levels. But fear not – the tough, innovative, solar industry will be around long after this Canute-like government has been and gone. •Ashley Seager is director of Sun4net Ltd and a former Guardian economics correspondent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/sep/18/we-are-pro-nuclear-but-hinkley-c-must-be-scrapped","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-18T15:01:17Z","webTitle":"We are pro-nuclear, but Hinkley C must be scrapped","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/18/we-are-pro-nuclear-but-hinkley-c-must-be-scrapped","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/sep/18/we-are-pro-nuclear-but-hinkley-c-must-be-scrapped","fields":{"headline":"We are pro-nuclear, but Hinkley C must be scrapped","bodyText":"As committed environmentalists, our conversion to the cause of nuclear power was painful and disorienting. All of us carried a cost in changing our position, antagonising friends and alienating colleagues. But we believe that shutting down – or failing to replace – our primary source of low carbon energy during a climate emergency is a refined form of madness. Because atomic energy provides a steady baseload of electricity, it has great potential to balance the output from renewables, aiding the total decarbonisation of the power supply. The dangers associated with nuclear power have been wildly exaggerated, all too often with the help of junk science. Climate breakdown presents a far greater hazard to human life. The same goes for the air pollution caused by burning coal. Now, however, we are about to antagonise a different faction, by arguing that the UK’s only proposed nuclear power plant, Hinkley C in Somerset, should not be built. Hinkley C bears all the distinguishing features of a white elephant: overpriced, overcomplicated and overdue. The delay that was announced recently should be the final straw. The government should kill the project. The new delay should not surprise anyone who’s aware of the technological issues. Tony Roulstone, who runs the masters programme in nuclear engineering at Cambridge University, argues that the plan for Hinkley C is like “building a cathedral within a cathedral”. It is, he concludes, “unconstructable”. Attempts to build to the same design – the European pressurised reactor - are underway at two other European sites, Olkiluoto in Finland and Flamanville in Normandy. Olkiluoto, where construction began in 2005, was supposed to have been finished by 2009. Now the promoters say it should be ready by 2018, but even that is not guaranteed. The design is so complex that at one point 5,000 workers were on site. The workers had to be drawn from all over northern Europe; communication problems have been so severe that different teams appear to have been building to different specifications. Its costs have more or less quadrupled. Already the plant is bogged down in lawsuits, as the different contracting parties blame each other for the delays and costs. Work at Flamanville began in 2007, with the promise that it would be finished by 2012. Now it won’t be completed until 2018 – all being well. The costs have risen, so far, threefold. The European pressurised reactor is a proven design all right – a proven formula for chaos. So how do the operators, the French company EDF, expect Hinkley C – even if it can be built – to be economically viable? By extracting from the government a price guarantee of £92.50 per megawatt hour for the electricity it produces, index-linked for 35 years. This is simply astronomical. It is more than twice the current wholesale price of electricity, and more than the government is now paying for solar power, whose costs are expected to fall greatly during the lifetime of the nuclear plant. Against current prices, the government’s guarantee represents a subsidy of over £1 billion a year. One of the reasons that the cost is so high is that the plant is being built with private cash, on the expectation of a 15% return. This is a classic example of market fundamentalism trouncing value for money. If the government were building this plant, it could borrow at 2.5% across 30 years. It’s not as if the risk is wholly born by the investors anyway. The government is underwriting much of the cost of the project through its infrastructure guarantee scheme. If the project fails, it could mean that taxpayers had to cover £17bn of the £24.5bn construction cost. EDF argues that, as it learns from experience elsewhere, the cost of construction will come down. But the problem with the design is that these plants have to be built almost entirely on site, so each power station is, in effect, a one-off. The costs of technology fall when modular construction is possible: turning out identical units in a factory. But perhaps the greatest problem Hinkley C imposes is energy blight. As the project is delayed, the power it would otherwise have generated is likely to be supplied instead by fossil fuel plants. If it does indeed turn out to be unconstructable, the result is likely to be a panicked scramble back into gas and even, perhaps, coal. We urge the government to scrap this plant, and to use the money promised to its investors to accelerate the deployment of other low carbon technologies, both renewable and nuclear. We would like to see the government produce a comparative study of nuclear technologies, including the many proposed designs for small modular reactors, and make decisions according to viability and price, rather than following the agenda of the companies which have its ear. Some fourth-generation designs, if governments are prepared to invest in sufficient research and development, could answer three needs at once: for low carbon energy, energy security and the disposal of nuclear waste. But Hinkley C commits us to 20th-century technologies for much of the 21st. Yes, we are still pro-nuclear. But not at any price."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/nov/18/is-uk-climate-and-energy-policy-hypocritical-or-just-incompetent","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-18T16:23:05Z","webTitle":"UK climate and energy policy: hypocritical or incompetent? | Craig Bennett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/18/is-uk-climate-and-energy-policy-hypocritical-or-just-incompetent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/18/is-uk-climate-and-energy-policy-hypocritical-or-just-incompetent","fields":{"headline":"Is UK climate and energy policy hypocritical or just incompetent?","bodyText":"It’s difficult to decide which characteristic best describes the government’s approach to climate and energy policy since 8 May; hypocrisy or incompetence. If that seems harsh on a day when the energy secretary has announced a phase-out of coal, the most polluting of fossil fuels, then let me explain. First, if today’s promise to phase out coal power stations by 2025 does what it says on the tin, then that would be a very good thing. But Amber Rudd added two caveats. Firstly, her department is going to consult on the policy (which is to be expected, but could change the outcome) and secondly, it will only go ahead if they’ve managed to build enough gas power in the meantime to replace old coal. And therein lies the incompetence-hypocrisy conundrum. First, gas is not the only alternative to coal. And yet, time and again, over these past six months, ministers have evoked language and principles in their crusade against renewable energy, which they blatantly then fail to apply to gas, its ugly sister fracking and the white elephant of nuclear power. In June, David Cameron said he wanted local communities to “have more of a say” in their local area as he sought to justify tougher planning controls for onshore wind. Yet just a few weeks later he made it clear that his government would be very happy to overrule local communities when it comes to fracking. Rudd has, time and again, justified the decimation or complete removal of short-term, modest subsidies for the relatively new technologies of solar and wind energy, by saying that it is time for “renewable energy to stand on its own two feet” while negotiating a brand new subsidy regime lasting 35 years for Hinkley Point nuclear power station. Cameron has signalled support at international meetings such as at the G7 meeting in Germany in June for “the elimination of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”, while presiding over the only government in the G7 to dramatically increase taxpayer handouts to oil and gas majors and cut support for clean energy. I could go on and on. The examples of this government’s apparently double-edged approach on climate and energy policy are not hard to find. Indeed, it would be hard to find a week since May without examples. But what about incompetence? The evidence is equally abundant. First and foremost, there has been a wholesale dismantling of climate and energy policies before alternative policies have been put in place. New governments sweep with new brooms. That’s democracy, and that’s politics. But this government has junked whole areas of energy policy that have taken years to put in place, and before they’ve developed any real thinking on what’s needed instead. Take, for example, energy efficiency. If the problem – as articulated by this government - is rising consumer bills, then the only surefire solution is to invest in home insulation to bring down permanently the amount of overall energy households need by reducing heating costs (especially as our demand for electricity is still increasing). The policy the government relied upon until recently was called the green deal and while it left a lot to be desired, it’s now gone altogether. As is the plan, negotiated between government, housebuilders and NGOs over many years for new homes to be “zero carbon” from next year, meaning that a whole generation of first-time buyers will be locked into higher energy bills. There are rumours that remaining policies to help poorer households insulate their properties are also destined for the chop. If this happens, it means there are practically no policy measures left to promote energy efficiency, and no signs yet of any coming any time soon. That’s incompetent – energy efficiency saves households and the economy money. So too is the gap opening up in new, homegrown power generation, because the government has killed off the quick and cheap new renewable sources such as onshore wind, and is now depending on new nuclear and shale gas, both of which are very unlikely to make any real difference to our energy security until well into the 2020s. So why is the government’s energy policy in such a mess? Well, it’s because it’s no longer being run from the Department for Energy and Climate Change, it’s being run from HM Treasury. Rudd, whose original appointment was warmly welcomed by Friends of the Earth, is mouthing the words but the voice is that of effective prime minister, George Osborne. And Cameron, who hugged huskies and put a wind turbine on his house while in opposition, is now just a distant chair of the board."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2016/sep/01/tokyo-2020-olympic-games-crisis-management-earthquakes","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-01T06:10:01Z","webTitle":"Olympic task: Tokyo is already in crisis management mode for 2020 Games","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/sep/01/tokyo-2020-olympic-games-crisis-management-earthquakes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2016/sep/01/tokyo-2020-olympic-games-crisis-management-earthquakes","fields":{"headline":"Olympic task: Tokyo is already in crisis management mode for 2020 Games","bodyText":"With four years to go until it hosts the Olympics, Tokyo has already had to contend with several crises. Controversy over the cost and design of the main stadium forced the organisers to invite submissions for a second design; the original logo had to be scrapped amid plagiarism claims; and the Guardian revealed that the city’s Olympic bidders had made suspicious payments to a secret bank account. And in June, just as Tokyo’s preparations were picking up speed, its governor, Yoichi Masuzoe, resigned over an expenses scandal, leaving the city momentarily rudderless until his replacement, Yuriko Koike, was elected at the end of July. The Rio Games will at least have provided Tokyo’s delegation to Brazil with a pleasant diversion while they await the results of a French investigation into the financial probity of the 2020 bid. An investigation set up by the Japanese Olympic committee said on Thursday it had found no evidence of illegality in the payments, which were made to a firm linked to the son of the disgraced former world athletics chief Lamine Diack. But the organisational mishaps and rows over cost – seemingly a rite of passage for any city preparing to host the biggest sports event on earth – have overshadowed issues that potentially pose an even greater threat to Japan’s first summer Games since 1964. While under pressure to make good on their promise to deliver the most environmentally friendly Olympics ever, the organisers must also confront the possibility of a two-pronged attack in the form of cyber warfare and a catastrophic earthquake. Preparing for natural disasters Japan accounts for a large share of the world’s most powerful earthquakes and is still far from making a complete recovery from the triple disaster that struck the Tohoku region on its north-east coast in March 2011. While that quake set in motion a tsunami that would sweep away entire towns and villages, the skyscrapers of Tokyo swayed and creaked, but emerged largely unscathed. Living with the ever-present threat of the Big One – a huge quake that experts say is due to strike Tokyo in the coming decades – has turned the city into the world capital of disaster readiness, according to 2020 organising officials. “Japan has developed the world’s most advanced construction technologies and has the strictest anti-earthquake requirements and earthquake resistance construction standards in the world – these will apply to all venues to be used at the Tokyo 2020 Games,” said Hikariko Ono, spokesperson for the Tokyo 2020 organising committee. Disaster countermeasures include seismic retrofitting for existing facilities so that they meet the country’s stringent earthquake-resistance standards, the construction of earthquake-resistant buildings, including accommodation at the athletes’ village, emergency response drills and the stockpiling of food and other essentials. Natural disasters aside, Tokyo’s bid benefited from its reputation for public safety; in 2015, the Economist Intelligence Unit named it the safest city in the world, even though it is also the most populous. Ono said Tokyo’s Olympic organisers were “delighted by the result”, adding, “as far as Tokyo 2020 is concerned, we will exert our utmost efforts into delivering a safe and secure Games and contribute to enhancing Tokyo’s and Japan’s reputation for safety”. Christian Dimmer, an assistant professor in the urban studies department at Tokyo University, said the city could even enhance its reputation for safety, provided a major earthquake didn’t strike over the next four years. “With growing socio-political tensions in many other megacities around the world, Tokyo should not only retain its lead in the global safety rankings but actually move further ahead of its rivals,” he said. Dimmer, who has written extensively about the reconstruction of the tsunami-hit north-east coast, noted Japan’s complex and sophisticated engineering solutions to disaster mitigation, but said other countries could learn from its centuries-old experience in community-based disaster risk reduction and preparedness. “There is a long tradition of community organisations, non-profits, local governments and neighbourhood associations closely collaborating in disaster risk management and awareness building,” he said. “Such strong social networks, in turn, have come to be recognised as key to foster community resilience.” The threat from cyberspace While it continues to improve its ability to ride out whatever seismic disasters might come its way, Japan is less adept at countering potential manmade threats to the smooth functioning of the 2020 Games. It was given a foretaste of what happens to vulnerable computer networks last year, with a massive leak of personal information by the Japan Pension Service that was blamed on hackers. In response, the government revised cybersecurity laws to dramatically expand the scope of networks that require monitoring and, if necessary, a quick response. Ensuring cybersecurity will be a multilateral effort, involving the central government, the 2020 organising committee and the Tokyo metropolitan government, as well as the city’s police and fire departments, according to a spokesperson for the Tokyo metropolitan government. Minimising the risk of crippling cyber-attacks will be the job of a newly formed cybersecurity strategy team led by the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, and staffed by experts from the public and private sectors. Japan’s communications ministry will train 50,000 people in cybersecurity over the next four years to guard against a range of eventualities, including attacks on the official Olympic website and, more importantly, online ticket sales. David Murakami Wood, Canada research chair in surveillance studies at Queen’s University in Ontario, believes the biggest threat comes from hackers targeting Tokyo’s infrastructure and critical systems. “So much now relies on digital systems. Security practices are generally poor and all kinds of things could result, from the embarrassment of a ransomware type of attack, which pulls down websites and holds them hostage, to something serious like a trojan inserted into the systems that control the electrical grid,” he said. Despite engaging in “security theatre” by increasing its pool of cybersecurity rapid responders, Japan will be largely dependent on US expertise, he added. “The US, and therefore the National Security Agency, is effectively running Japan’s cybersecurity. It’s not an option available to every country, or indeed something that many countries would want.” Towards sustainability The countdown to 2020 has presented Tokyo with its best opportunity yet to confront its energy use, an area in which Japan has struggled to make progress since the Fukushima disaster forced the closure of all its nuclear power plants and deepened its dependence on imported fossil fuels. While the national energy mix adjusts to post-Fukushima realities, Tokyo’s environmental masterplan, published in March, is an ambitious attempt to put the capital on the path towards sustainability as the Games approach, including a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030, from 2000 levels. In addition to the permanent venues for the 2020 Games, Tokyo’s organisers plan to create 433 hectares of new green areas across the city and plant 1m roadside trees. Officials say the addition of large areas of greenery will enhance the Olympic experience for overseas visitors who are already flocking to the city’s clean, safe streets in record numbers. “Regardless of whether or not we can maintain [the Economic Intelligence Unit] ranking until 2020, as a city, we will work to ensure that our residents are as safe and secure as possible,” the government spokesperson said. “And as a result, we would be delighted to continue to be recognised for our efforts.” Talk to us on Twitter via @Guardianpublic and sign up for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2015/apr/15/how-much-of-the-liberal-democrats-2010-election-manifesto-was-implemented","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-15T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"How much of the Liberal Democrats' 2010 election manifesto was implemented?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/15/how-much-of-the-liberal-democrats-2010-election-manifesto-was-implemented","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/apr/15/how-much-of-the-liberal-democrats-2010-election-manifesto-was-implemented","fields":{"headline":"How much of the Liberal Democrats' 2010 election manifesto was implemented?","bodyText":"The Liberal Democrat manifesto launched on 14 April 2010 was built around “four steps to a fairer Britain”. Many of its pledges have gone nowhere, particularly in areas like education, and a number of high-profile ones have been ditched, like scrapping tuition fees and opposing nuclear power. However, perhaps more have been adopted than might have been expected for a minor party in a coalition. Economy 1) The first £10,000 people earn will be tax-free. The party makes that a tax cut of £700 for “most people”. Met – This has been delivered under the coalition. 2) Introduce a “mansion tax” at a rate of 1% on properties worth more than £2m. Not met – This was blocked by the Conservatives although taxing higher value properties is still party policy. 3) Break up the banks and “get them lending again”. Not met – The banks are still intact and there are still questions over whether efforts to get them lending to small businesses have been effective. 4) Cut the deficit with £15bn of savings in government spending, including a £400 cap on pay rises for public sector workers, a banking levy and not renewing the Trident nuclear deterrent system. Partially met – The public spending cuts have been steeper than this, the banking levy remains and public sector workers have been subjected to an extended pay squeeze. But the decision on Trident has been delayed and it will probably be renewed. 5) Create a Council on Financial Stability with representatives of all parties, the governor of the Bank of England and the chair of the Financial Services Authority to work on the timing and scale of a deficit reduction plan. Not met – This did not happen. Deficit reduction remains the responsibility of the chancellor. Education 1) Increase funding for the most disadvantaged pupils by £2.5bn. Met – The coalition brought in a pupil premium giving schools extra money for each pupil on free school meals. 2) An extra £2.5bn to cut class sizes to 20 in primary schools, increase one-to-one tuition and provide catch-up classes for 160 pupils in each secondary school. Not met – Class sizes have slightly risen and one-to-one tuition scaled back. 3) Workplace scheme for 800,000 pupils to give them the opportunity to gain skills and experience. Not met – This does not seem to have been launched. 4) 15,000 extra places on foundation degree courses, which can lead to undergraduate courses. Not met – This does not seem to have happened. 5) Raise the adult learning grant from £30 to £45 a week. This grant is to encourage poorer students to return to college. Not met – This is still £30 per week. 6) The cleverest students from the lowest-achieving schools are guaranteed a degree place. Not met – No evidence of this being proposed under the coalition. 7) Scrap university tuition fees for undergraduates by 2016. Not met – The party famously voted for an increase in fees under a new post-degree repayment system. 8) Replace academies with schools that are accountable to local authorities, but that have a charity or parent group as sponsor. Not met – There has been an expansion of academies and introduction of free schools under the coalition. 9) Slim down the national curriculum and scale back Sats. Bring GCSEs, A-levels and vocational courses under a single diploma qualification. Not met – The curriculum was reformed by education secretary Michael Gove in a very different way. Health 1) Cut the Department of Health in half. Scrap strategic health authorities and limit managers’ pay. Partially met – The Department of Health was not cut by half. Strategic health authorities were scrapped under then health secretary Andrew Lansley’s reforms. 2) Local health boards would work with councils to take over from primary care trusts. Partially met – Primary care trusts were abolished and replaced with clinical commissioning groups, alongside health and wellbeing boards. 3) Patient entitlement to diagnosis and treatment on time or the right to go private. Met – If patients are not seen with 18 weeks, the NHS body that commissions the care must investigate and offer a range of suitable alternative hospitals or community clinics. It is not clear if this happens in practice. 4) Patient right to register with any GP and access GP by email. Not met – You may still have to live in the GP surgery’s catchment area and there is not requirement for access by email. 5) Require hospitals to be open about mistakes. Met – Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative health secretary, has made hospital transparency a major theme in the aftermath of the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal. 6) Compulsory language and competence tests for doctors working in UK. Met – The General Medical Council has new powers to conduct language tests for doctors working in the UK. Crime, immigration and civil liberties 1) Recruit 3,000 more police officers, paid for by scrapping ID cards, electronic fingerprints on passports, the prison building programme and Whitehall plans to track all emails and internet use. Not met – There were 127,909 police officers in March 2014, compared with 143,734 in 2010. 2) Replace prison sentences of six months or less with community penalties and cancel the £800m prison-building programme. Not met – Short sentences remain and several new prisons have been ordered under the coalition. 3) A freedom bill to regulate CCTV, end the collection of DNA from innocent citizens, scrap ID cards, the children’s contact database and anti-terrorist control orders. Halt the creation of new criminal offences. Partially met – ID cards never went ahead and there was a “protection of freedoms act” but a number of new criminal offences have been created, such as forced marriage. 4) Immigration: a regional points-based system to ensure migrants can only work where they are needed. Not met – This is now close to Ukip party policy of wanting an Australian points-based immigration system. 5) An independent agency to decide asylum claims and an end to the detention of children. Partially met – There is no independent agency but the coalition promised to end child detention. This has not always been successful. 6) Effectively, an amnesty for illegal immigrants who entered the country before 2010. Prioritising deportation efforts on criminals, people-traffickers and other high-priority cases and letting law-abiding families earn citizenship. Not met – The Conservatives would not have supported this. 7) Immediately reintroduce exit checks at all ports and airports. Partially met – This has only just begun at ports and cross-channel rail stations after five years of coalition. Defence and foreign policy 1) There would be a full judicial inquiry into allegations of British complicity in torture and state kidnapping. Not met – This has been under taken by the intelligence and security committee of parliament which has frequently been accused of being too close to the authorities. 2) No like-for-like replacement of the Trident nuclear missile system. Not met – The decision has been delayed to the next parliament 3) The Lib Dems say it is in Britain’s long-term interests to join the euro, but only after a referendum. Ditched - The Lib Dems are no longer promoting entry into the euro. 4) There should be a “strong and positive” commitment to Europe. Met – This has not happened at a coalition level because the Tories have signed up to a referendum but Clegg always makes clear his commitment to staying in the EU and debated Nigel Farage on the issue. Families 1) Fathers to get the right to time off work for antenatal appointments. Met – This was brought in by business minister Jo Swinson in October. 2) Extend shared parental leave to 18 months, allowing parents to share their allocation of maternity and paternity leave. Partially met - Extended parental leave was championed by Nick Clegg and implemented from April this year but only for a year, not 18 months. 3) The right to request flexible working for all, especially grandparents looking after children Met – This was introduced under the coalition. 4) A move to 20 hours free childcare for every child from the age of 18 months. Not met – There is only 15 hours of free childcare for three- to four-year-olds and some two-year-olds. 5) Immediately restore the link between the basic state pension and earnings. Met – This happened under the coalition’s triple lock for pensions. 6) Scrap compulsory retirement ages, allowing those who wish to continue in work to do so. Met – People are no longer obliged to retire at a certain age. Environment 1) Create a UK infrastructure bank Met – The coalition set up a Green Investment Bank that has invested in dozens of projects and has capital funding of around £3.8bn. 2) Work for a global deal to limit temperature rise to 1.7C, based on equalising emissions between developed and developing countries. Partially met – Lib Dem energy secretary, Ed Davey, has pushed climate change policy internationally but the international target is still 2C. 3) National road pricing offset by axing vehicle excise duty. Zero emissions targets for cars from 2040 through the EU. Not met – This has not happened. VED still exists. 4) Tax on aircraft to replace air passenger duty. Scrap Heathrow expansion and all south-east airport expansion. Not met – This has not happened. APD still exists and south-east airport expansion is being examined by the Davies Commission. 5) A zero-carbon economy by 2050. Not met – The target is an 80% reduction relative to 1990 levels by 2050. 6) No to a new generation of nuclear power stations. Not met – The Lib Dems U-turned and support nuclear as long as it is not subsidised. 7) Home energy improvements to get £400 cash in first year, and special loans of up to £10,000. Met – This is quite similar to the coalition’s green deal. 8) A rolling programme to insulate all public buildings, starting with schools. Partially met – The government’s energy efficiency strategy sets out £90m for improving the energy efficiency of public buildings, including schools and £540m for an energy efficiency scheme, which included public buildings. 9) Below-inflation rail fare rises, and one-third refunds for bus replacement services. Not met – Rail fares have risen and travel disruption continues without refunds. 10) Designate gardens as greenfield sites in order to make it harder to build on them. Met – This was one of the first acts if the coalition, changing in June 2010. 11) Target zero waste to landfill. Partially met – A plan for a zero-waste economy was launched but obviously not achieved. • This article was amended on 15 April 2015 to make clear that the freedom bill and a programme for insulating public buildings were both partially met, and the home energy improvements policy was met."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2015/oct/19/uk-steel-david-cameron-xi-jinping-dumping","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-19T15:59:55Z","webTitle":"UK steelmakers urge PM to confront visiting Chinese president over 'unfair' dumping","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/19/uk-steel-david-cameron-xi-jinping-dumping","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2015/oct/19/uk-steel-david-cameron-xi-jinping-dumping","fields":{"headline":"UK steelmakers urge PM to confront visiting Chinese president over 'unfair' dumping","bodyText":"David Cameron was accused of putting economic engagement with China ahead of the long term interests of the UK, as the president of the world’s most populous country arrived in London for a lavish four-day state visit. Downing Street said the visit from Xi Jinping would “unlock” £30bn of trade deals that would lead to 3,900 new British jobs - but critics said that the prime minister was ignoring China’s impact on UK steel , its poor record on human rights and any risks of allowing it to invest in nuclear power. The economic centrepiece of Xi’s visit is likely to be a multi-billion pound Chinese investment in Britain’s new generation of nuclear power stations and there will also be trade in the creative industries, retail, health and technology, financial services, aerospace and education. But the president’s trip, which began with an overnight stay in London’s Mandarin Oriental hotel will, include a royal procession, an address to parliament and banquet with the Queen. Labour and trade unions called on Cameron to confront Xi about allegations China is responsible for anti-competitive behaviour, as a third British steel maker, Caparo, admitted it was in trouble. However, the new jobs announced in the deals are less than the more than 5,000 that are expected to be lost in the current UK steel industry crisis, which has been blamed on Beijing flooding the market with cheap produce. Pressed by Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, to get the Chinese president to address the steel issue, Cameron said he would discuss the problem. However, China’s ambassador, Liu Xiaoming, told ITV News it was the UK’s fault for having an old and unprofitable steel industry. “If you continue to stay with your old, traditional business, you’re losing money and opportunities … China is making adjustments – why not Britain?” he said. Gareth Stace, director of the industry body UK Steel, urged the prime minister to “send a powerful signal to Beijing that he is prepared to stand up for British steelmakers”, while Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, warned that one in six UK jobs in the industry could go without more intervention from Cameron. Labour MPs also questioned why Osborne had advertised £11.8bn of contracts in China for the construction of HS2 high-speed during a trade trip last month, while steelmakers are being allowed to fail at home. The HS2 contracts advertised to the Chinese are for construction of chunks of tunnel, bridges and track beds, some of which will require the procurement of steel at a later date. Cameron stressed in parliament that every effort would be made to ensure UK infrastructure projects are supplied with UK steel and accused the opposition of “playing politics” over a serious issue. Kevin Brennan, a shadow business minister, questioned Cameron’s eagerness to do deals with the Chinese that are likely to “give Beijing a bigger strategic stake in British infrastructure than the British government itself”. “Yes, we must trade with China, but [the] policy seems to be that Britain should have an utterly laissez-faire economic policy as far as steelmaking is concerned and should rely on the Chinese government to take a stake in the British economy. What does that mean for Britain’s economic independence? ” he said. The prime minister is attempting a remarkable turnaround in UK-China relations by giving Xi an especially ostentatious welcome, just three years after Beijing froze relations over his meeting with the Dalai Lama. However, Cameron’s approach has frustrated campaigners and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn who want him to censure China over its detention of hundreds of human rights activists and lawyers during Xi’s visit. Amnesty International are among the campaign groups planning to demonstrate against China’s record during the visit, with its UK head of policy Allan Hogarth saying Cameron should ignore “ China’s threats that trade deals will only be won in return for staying quiet over human rights”. Corbyn has pledged to raise China’s human rights record during a private meeting ahead of the state banquet. On top of that, Cameron has faced criticism from British security sources and some foreign governments over Britain becoming too close to China in a naked bid to win commercial contracts. On Monday, Maria Eagle, the shadow defence secretary, accused the government of putting national security at risk by allowing China to invest in Britain’s nuclear power plants. Downing Street’s approach is in marked contrast to that of the White House. Xi’s state visit to the US in September was marked by tensions over security, and a threat by Barack Obama to pursue sanctions against Chinese entities carrying out a series of cyberattacks. The visit is also riddled with potential diplomatic pitfalls, including the issue of whether Cameron should wear a poppy on Thursday in the runup to Remembrance Day next month. The Chinese regard the red poppy as unacceptable since it has links to the Chinese opium wars. In 2010, Cameron’s delegation to China was asked not to wear poppies because they were a symbol of China’s humiliation at the hands of Europe in the wars that took place in the middle of the 19th century. The British delegation refused to remove the poppies. However, Xi himself has given a rare interview over the weekend signalling that China is very appreciative of the UK’s efforts to position itself as China’s best friend in the west. The president landed in the UK at Heathrow on Monday evening, where he was greeted on behalf of the Queen by the Viscount Hood, Lord-in-Waiting, followed by foreign secretary Philip Hammond. The official visit gets going on Tuesday morning, when Xi will met by the Prince of Wales at his hotel and then honoured by a royal procession down Horse Guards Parade to Buckingham Palace for a private lunch with the Queen. He will address MPs in the royal gallery of the Palace of Westminster in the afternoon, before he is hosted for a state banquet back at the palace. On Wednesday, Cameron is due to hold a major session of talks with the Chinese leader at Downing Street alongside senior cabinet ministers, followed by a press conference. The home secretary, Theresa May; the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond; the development secretary, Justine Greening; the energy secretary, Amber Rudd; and the chancellor, George Osborne, are all due to attend the discussions in the cabinet rooms. It is unlikely Xi will attend the Wednesday press conference, but Downing Street declined to confirm that the Chinese president would refuse to take questions from the British press throughout his visit. On Thursday, Cameron will shift the government focus towards a broader foreign policy agenda, with a further round of talks scheduled to take place over dinner at Chequers. The final leg of Xi’s visit will involve a day in Manchester on Friday as part of Osborne’s push to create a so-called Northern Powerhouse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/may/17/japans-coal-fired-plants-to-cause-thousands-of-early-deaths-greenpeace","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-17T08:32:04Z","webTitle":"Japan's coal-fired plants 'to cause thousands of early deaths'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/17/japans-coal-fired-plants-to-cause-thousands-of-early-deaths-greenpeace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/may/17/japans-coal-fired-plants-to-cause-thousands-of-early-deaths-greenpeace","fields":{"headline":"Japan's coal-fired plants 'to cause thousands of early deaths'","bodyText":"Plans by Japan to build dozens of coal-fired power stations will cause at least 10,000 premature deaths, according to a study, as the country struggles to fulfil its climate change obligations five years after the Fukushima disaster closed down almost all of its nuclear plants. Greenpeace and the environmental group Kiko Network said in a joint report that Japan’s determination to press ahead with a massive expansion in fossil fuel-based power production, with at least 43 plants to be built over the next 12 years, would come at a price to human health and “lock in carbon emissions for decades”. The warning comes after a meeting of the G7 environment ministers in Toyama at the weekend, at which Japan repeated its pledge to cut carbon emissions by 26% from 2013 levels by 2030 – a target campaigners have derided as woefully inadequate. “Six large coal-fired power plants are planned within 100km of Tokyo. This massive expansion of coal power generation so close to huge urban areas like Tokyo is simply insane,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, a senior coal campaigner at Greenpeace. “We could save thousands of lives cut short from air pollution if the government chose to embrace renewable energy over dirty coal. Japan is already considered the worst performer among the G7 when it comes to phasing out coal. If we are to have any chance of limiting average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, fossil fuels must be kept in the ground – not pumped into the air over our cities.” Using atmospheric modelling to gauge the potential effects on public health, the groups projected that between 6,000 and 15,000 people would die prematurely in the Tokyo area over the new plants’ average operating life of 40 years. Additional plants near the Osaka and Hyogo regions in western Japan would cause 4,000-11,000 premature deaths over a similar period. Projected particle pollution emissions from the new power plants around Tokyo would be equivalent to that from 13m passenger cars, the report said. A study published last week by Oxford University’s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment said Japan risked being saddled with a fleet of worthless coal-fired power stations due to overcapacity and lower energy costs. The school’s sustainable finance programme said overcapacity, combined with global moves to cut carbon emissions and the shift towards more cost-effective renewables, could leave the country with a stranded investment in coal plants worth $56bn “The expansion of coal in Japan appears to be predicated on a benign environment for incumbent utilities,” the programme’s director, Ben Caldecott, said. “The reality is that disruption in the power sector is accelerating. The idea that the power sector will remain relatively static and ‘safe’ for new coal-fired power stations is counter to the evidence we see internationally across the G20.” The G7 environment ministers’ meeting ended on Monday with a pledge that countries would not wait until the deadline of 2020 – set at last year’s UN climate conference in Paris – to decide how they will achieve their long-term emissions cut of 80% by the middle of the century. But there are growing doubts that Japan, the only G7 country investing in new coal plants, will even achieve its 2030 target. In contrast to the US, Britain and other developed nations that are abandoning coal, Japan has turned to fossil fuels to fill the energy gap left by the closure of dozens of nuclear power plants in the wake of the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in March 2011. All but two reactors remain offline while they undergo safety checks, while potential reactor restarts have encountered strong opposition from residents concerned about the facilities’ vulnerability to powerful earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Japan relied on nuclear for about 30% of its energy needs before Fukushima and, despite the shutdowns, the government says nuclear will generate 20-22% of total electricity by 2030. Its enthusiasm for coal is at odds with sections of the business community, however. Japanese trading house Mitsui said last week it would trim its thermal coal investments amid growing pressure worldwide for firms to lower their dependence on fossil fuels. “Considering the result of the global climate summit (in Paris), we basically plan to reduce thermal coal assets,” Mitsui’s chief executive, Tatsuo Yasunaga, told analysts. Kimiko Hirata, the international director of Kiko Network, said: “Governments that have signed the Paris agreement must now legislate to keep fossil fuels in the ground and strongly support policies which lead to 100% renewable energy. “Following the Fukushima disaster and subsequent shutdown of its nuclear fleet, Japan has been setting global records for energy consumption reduction, while renewables such as solar, have been booming. “Japan needs to give renewables priority access to the grid and stop wasting resources trying to restart nuclear plants and expanding dirty coal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/mar/20/energy-efficient-street-lights","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-20T00:05:24Z","webTitle":"Let there be light!

Futuristic street lamps tap into the oldest energy source: the sun","bodyText":"Not far from the House of Commons, a stone’s throw from Westminster bridge, two streetlamps will soon be erected. Paid for by Transport for London, these are no ordinary lights. According to their manufacturer, they could play a major role in tackling Britain’s energy crisis. The Monopoles, unveiled at a German trade fair last week, convert sunlight to streetlight via photovoltaic (PV) panels. The energy they generate can then be stored in a battery and used during the night to power the lamps. As a result, the “zero-emission streetlight” eliminates electricity costs. But not only do they generate enough energy to light themselves, they create a surplus which can be sold to the National Grid, potentially making millions of pounds for Britain’s local authorities, for which running streetlights costs an estimated £300m a year. Many councils are now dimming their streetlights or switching them off, raising fears of an increase in accidents and crime. A survey of 141 of 150 councils found that 50 have switched off all their lamps, while 98 confirmed that they have dimmed at least some. According to Scotia, the company behind the new technology, the average local authority operates 33,000 street lights, whose energy usage equates to emitting 7,600 tons of carbon dioxide a year. A freedom of information request to Greenwich council in south-east London revealed that in 2010 it spent £925,810 operating 22,000 lights. There are 7 million streetlights in the UK. Scotia claims that if they were all replaced with lamps equipped with solar technology they would generate more than 4 terrawatt hours of energy a year – half the output of Sizewell B nuclear power station. That would cut the UK’s CO2 output by more than 2m metric tons a year. “Instead of being a drain on the National Grid and a huge expense for local authorities, Monopoles turn streetlights into mini-power stations,” said Steven Scott, Scotia’s chief designer. “They’ve already proved to be hugely successful in our pilots in Copenhagen, Abu Dhabi and Riyadh and we anticipate demand will be high from around the world. A small Monopole can be erected by just two people, without the need for machinery, in under five minutes.” Sceptics may point to Britain’s drab weather and ask whether the lamps will be much use in the dark winter months, but Scotia insists that the lamps can function even in the bleakest conditions. The pilot scheme by TfL is part of a wider drive to equip Britain’s infrastructure with energy-producing solar panels. Proponents of the technology believe many sites around the UK are ripe for development. “With over 17, 000 car parks in the UK, there is a great opportunity for this sector to reap the benefits of solar PV panels, particularly now with falling costs and technical advances that enhance performance outputs,” said Jonny Williams, director of the BRE National Solar Centre. But some question whether the technology can compete against rival energy sources. The current low oil price is unlikely to stimulate demand for solar energy. And cash-strapped councils and governments may be wary about committing to a fledgling innovation that could be manufactured more cheaply by other companies in the future as economies of scale kick in. Nevertheless, energy experts believe solar technology has an increasingly significant role to play. In 2014, the International Energy Agency issued two reports claiming that the sun could be the world’s largest source of electricity by 2050, ahead of fossil fuels, wind, hydro and nuclear. Energy Watch Group, an independent, non-profit global network of scientists and parliamentarians, suggests that, as the cost of PV panels continues to decline, it will stimulate growth in the number of installations of the technology worldwide. “At the same time more financial investors are turning their back on fossil and nuclear projects in favour of renewable energies,” the group argues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/apr/24/green-news-roundup-earth-day-chernobyl-and-hungry-killer-whales","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-04-24T16:18:35Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: Earth Day, Chernobyl and hungry killer whales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/24/green-news-roundup-earth-day-chernobyl-and-hungry-killer-whales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/apr/24/green-news-roundup-earth-day-chernobyl-and-hungry-killer-whales","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: Earth Day, Chernobyl and hungry killer whales","bodyText":"Keep it in the Ground – the Guardian’s climate campaign Dear Wellcome Trust ... the best of your letters on fossil fuel divestment BP renewable energy archive still closed despite promise to open to public Columbia University faculty members call for divestment from fossil fuels Biana Jagger: The fossil fuel industry is condemning us to climate disaster Earth Day: scientists say 75% of known fossil fuel reserves must stay in ground What does a world responding to climate change look like?

The academic authors have a fine record in identifying the causes and consequences of climate change, but their proposed solution simply doesn’t make sense. The main problem is that, contrary what many think, nuclear power is a poor method of reducing carbon emissions: its uranium ore and fuel processes have heavy carbon footprints. Indeed, of the ways to reduce carbon emissions in the energy sphere, nuclear is by far the most expensive in terms of pound per tonne of carbon saved. Renewables, especially wind and solar, are now less expensive, quicker to install, and much safer: with them one does not have to worry about the spectres of Chernobyl and Fukushima. But perhaps most important of all is the moral dimension. Given the technical and political obstacles to dangerous spent nuclear fuel, should we be passing these problems to future generations? What about the Irish Sea, still the most radioactively contaminated sea in the world due to Sellafield’s discharges? What about the sheep farms in north Wales still subject to food controls due to radioactive contamination from Chernobyl almost 30 years ago? The climate change negotiators in Paris should think hard before recommending nuclear as a solution. It isn’t. Dr Paul Dorfman Dr Ian Fairlie Dr David Lowry Jonathon Porritt • In his speech to COP in Paris, Prince Charles said “We must save our forests” and “There is no plan B to tackle climate change without them.” I agree our forests are vital; but there is a plan B that would save them – and mitigate climate change. It would also greatly reduce hunger, malnutrition and poverty. To save tropical forests we first have to reduce the pressures from tropical agriculture. This involves simple and inexpensive biological approaches to rehabilitate degraded farm land and improve crop yields from the current 10-15% of their biological potential. Then we need to plant local, highly favoured, traditionally important food trees to reduce hunger and malnutrition – species like safou, marula, shea, eru, baobab, and hundreds of others producing tasty, nutritious and marketable fruits, nuts and edible leaves. This diversification also restores ecological health and, importantly, generates income from the sale of their products in local markets. The final step is to set up new cottage industries to process and add value to these products, creating business and job opportunities to further improve household livelihoods. Of course, this is the antithesis of conventional modern agriculture and is not understood by policymakers, but where it has been done it has been a huge success – see “Living with the Trees of Life – Towards the Transformation of Tropical Agriculture” (CABI, 2012). If you don’t believe me, ask the poor farmers of Africa. They fully understand it, and make the importance of this abundantly clear when they apply to us at the International Tree Foundation for funding. Prof Roger Leakey International Tree Foundation • News about the airstrikes in Syria is in danger of overshadowing developments at the climate conference in Paris. Some environmentalists may view this as regrettable, but the upside is that it should serve to highlight that the two are actually linked. Between 2006 and 2009 Syria experienced its worst recorded drought. It left up to 1.5 million people refugees in their own country. This placed severe demands on urban centres to employ, house and feed rising populations that were largely ignored by the Assad government. Protests and the subsequent uprising in 2011 led to the current civil war and the rise of Daesh. A study by Kelley et al published this year in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (doi: 10.1073/pnas.1421533112) makes a convincing case for the initial drought to be associated with human-modified climate change. Increasing conflict, mass migration and geopolitical instability are the real impacts of unmitigated climate change. Prof John Dearing University of Southampton • I sat in my house in Kendal on Saturday night watching the floodwaters creep up the road to a level never seen before. I was terrified, as were friends and townspeople. My neighbours had to evacuate, their homes waist-deep in water. The floodwaters stopped one house away from mine. Storms hitting north-west England, particularly Cumbria, are becoming more common. They cause terror and disruption to us and our infrastructure on a scale that terrorists could never hope to achieve. Why is the government not waging war on climate change? The implication of climate-induced disruption and terror for people in their everyday lives is huge. Surely we should be dealing with this threat as a priority and making our infrastructure more resilient to such weather extremes. Cumbria county council is facing another round of enormous cuts. How are we supposed to get back on our feet after these catastrophic floods when there is no money to fix the roads and railways, to fix flooded schools and day centres, and pay staff to do so? There is of course money to bomb Syria, despite the fact that severe climate change-induced weather events are significantly more of a threat to our way of life than Daesh.

Wallerberdina Station near Barndioota, just under 500km north of Adelaide in the Flinders Rangers, was one of six sites nominated for the proposed dump last year. It is now the only site under consideration. The resources minister, Josh Frydenberg, said on Friday that the site had been “shortlisted” following a four-month consultation process and that the final decision would be made within 12 months. “While encouraging levels of support were identified across a number of these sites, Barndioota displayed a broad level of community support for moving to the project’s next phase,” he said. But the local Indigenous community do not support the proposal. Adnyamathanha traditional owners asked the federal government to reject the nomination of the site in November, saying that the proposed dump site was near significant cultural sites, including Hookina Creek, which is a women’s place that is also a registered heritage site. Adnyamathanha Traditional Lands Association (ATLA) chief executive Vince Coulthard said he was “totally disgusted” by the announcement. “This is our land, we have been here forever and we will always be here and we are totally opposed to this dump,” he said. Coulthard said there had been minimal consultation with traditional owners and described the decision as “cultural genocide”. “ATLA is disgusted that the only contact they have had is a short meet and greet-type session at the last AGM,” he said. “We believed they were going to meet with the board in an official capacity, prior to any announcement happening. But this certainly didn’t happen.” Adnyamathanha woman Regina McKenzie said that hearing the site had been earmarked felt like hearing news of a death. “It was shock and then a lot of emotion, myself and my sister said it’s like getting news of a death, that’s the kind of emotion we felt,” McKenzie told ABC news on Friday. “Our culture in that area is being ignored, it’s not good for our area, I don’t think, it’s something we will fight against, we don’t want a waste dump in our area whatsoever.” She told Guardian Australia last month that proposing to build the site was an attack on the Indigenous belief system. Nearby Yappala station was declared an Indigenous Protected Area in 2014. Frydenberg said an independent Indigenous heritage assessment, conducted in consultation with traditional owners, would be undertaken as part of the next phase of the project, and that the government would talk to Indigenous stakeholders “to explore local ecotourism opportunities.” He said the resources department would set up a local office to conduct the detailed design, safety, environmental and technical assessment, and to conduct further community consultation. The community will also get $2m for local projects. If it is confirmed as the final site, it will get $10m. Kokatha-Mula elder Sue Coleman-Haseldine, co-chair of the Australia Nuclear Free Alliance, said the decision was devastating. “We’ve already been poisoned through the Maralinga bomb tests,” Coleman-Haseldine said on Friday, referring to the British nuclear tests in the Woomera Prohibited Area, 675km west of Barndioota, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. “Do we really need any more nuclear, whether it’s low level or not? There’s always the chance of accidents. “I feel really sorry for the [Aboriginal] people who have to go through this and the other people who have to live under a nuclear cloud.” The site would store low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste, such as material left over from medical procedures. That waste is currently stored at 100 small facilities around the country and federal governments have been trying, unsuccessfully, to find a site for a central storage facility since the 1990s. Former South Australian senator and current state Liberal party director, Greg Chapman, who part-owns the Wallerberdina Station, told ABC radio in Adelaide that he was surprised the federal government had narrowed its options down to one site. While in parliament, Chapman chaired the select committee that recommended the country’s low-level nuclear waste be stored in a single facility. “So it’s taken some 20 years to get to this stage and they’re still considering a decision,” he said. The preliminary findings of the South Australian royal commission into the nuclear fuel cycle found that nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities could provide a substantial economic benefit to the state, but recommended against the state having its own nuclear power plants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2019/may/09/federal-election-2019-shorten-morrison-labor-coalition-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2019-05-09T07:18:04Z","webTitle":"High-income taxpayers would receive more than $88bn under Coalition plan – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/may/09/federal-election-2019-shorten-morrison-labor-coalition-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2019/may/09/federal-election-2019-shorten-morrison-labor-coalition-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"High-income taxpayers would receive more than $88bn under Coalition plan – as it happened","bodyText":"With the campaigns resting (at least publicly) for the night, we are going to take the opportunity to tuck the blog up for the night. We’ve got a big day (and weekend) ahead of us, so grab the early night where you can is my rule. Big thank yous to everyone who came along for today’s ride and for all the input. We’ll be back early tomorrow morning for the beginning of the final stretch of the 2019 campaign. Just eight and a bit days to go. See you soon and take care of you. Labor is very excited to be handing down its costings tomorrow. That’s because it feels like it has a good story to tell. Bigger surpluses in the short term. More debt paid down. It has more money to spend than the government, partly because of its plan to raise more revenue through tax reform. That’s why we are getting the costings, comparatively, so much earlier than usual. These things usually get handed down a day before the end of the campaign. This is all coming a week beforehand and given Labor is in control of when it hands down its costings, it is because Chris Bowen is happy with the story he gets to tell. The campaigns have gone down for the night. It looks like the Liberal party are also headed north, to Queensland, where Michelle Landry is in trouble in Capricornia. Bill Shorten is still in Queensland. I would imagine he will be looking at heading further north from Brisbane at some point, but we never really know. Penny Wong was in Brisbane with Bill Shorten today and addressed that moment at the end of the South Australian Press Club discussion, when she did not shake Simon Birmingham’s hand, after Birmingham brought up Paul Keating’s comments about China: I just want to make this clear – I will always look to Australia’s national interest. I understand, as shadow foreign minister, the risks of playing domestic partisan politics with the relationship with China. The answer I gave reflected that understanding. I did not give a partisan answer in that debate. What I’d say about Senator Birmingham is he regrettably did not follow the same approach. As a senior trade minister, as a senior minister in this government, he ought to have done so. Question: Is it not in relation though … Wong: The national interest matters, and it matters to me very much, and it matters to the Labor party very much. I’ve explained the reasons why that is the case. Question: Has Mr Birmingham asked for an apology? Wong: No, we’ve got a good relationship. We’ve had robust exchanges over the years. You know, you live in Adelaide, so we know how to deal with that. He hasn’t asked for an apology and I wouldn’t expect him to do so. Question: Is it right, though, for Labor to criticise the negativity in politics at the moment when you do see those images, such as you refusing to shake his hand after the debate? Wong: Well, I think that the issue here is the national interest. As I said, I understand the risks of playing domestic, partisan politics with the China relationship, and we chose to take a different approach and it’s regrettable Senator Birmingham didn’t. A rare statement from a minister during the election campaign but, given the topic, completely understandable. From Marise Payne’s office: The Australian government is deeply concerned by the statements made by Iran in relation to its compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The Australian government reviewed our approach to the Plan of Action last year, following which prime minister Morrison made clear that Australia supported the Plan of Action as long as Iran remained in compliance with its provisions. We have made our concerns regarding Iran’s destabilising activities well-known. While I note that Iran has said it is not withdrawing from the Plan of Action, Australia continues to urge Iran to exercise restraint and to comply with its commitments. The nuclear non-proliferation objectives of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action are worthy and serve the best interests of peace, stability, and regional security. Australia strongly supports these objectives, and encourages parties to the plan to redouble their efforts to honour its provisions. In line with caretaker conventions, the opposition has been briefed on this matter. Finally, we come to this: Faine: So, how can you get people with such extreme views into preselected positions on federal campaigns? Frydenberg: Well, can I say to you. Those views are not the views of the Liberal party. Now, of course… Faine: Just your candidate, after candidate, after candidate. Frydenberg: Not candidate after candidate… Faine: Well, you’ve lost three now… Frydenberg: And as I said, you’ve seen Greens candidates and Labor candidates also lose their preselection or endorsement for this election… Faine: So, where is the due diligence? Frydenberg: Well, that is a very poignant question and that is one that I… Faine: Pertinent or poignant? Frydenberg: Both. It’s a pertinent question and it’s one that we will be revisiting after this election because in today’s modern age of technology where you can’t check every blog site, we do need to have measures in place so that anyone who puts their hand up for endorsement by the party has all the proper checks and balances done to ensure that everything is known before they’re endorsed. And then the pair moved on to how the Liberal party in Victoria preselected some of its candidates: Faine: More importantly, what does it tell us about the Victorian branch of the Liberal party where Karina Okotel, who is a strong opponent of not just same-sex marriage, she wants to revisit things like voluntary assisted dying, abortion, all of these issues. She’s committed to reopening all of those closed debates. What is it when you’ve got a branch who is controlled by someone who is installing candidates like Gurpal Singh, like your candidate in Wills, like your candidate in Isaacs. In a way, it taints the rest of the Liberal party, does it not? Frydenberg: Well, again, I don’t accept the premise of your question… Faine: Which part of it? Frydenberg: When you said they’re controlling the Liberal party. Faine: Well, she was the chair of your selection committee and she’s on the admin committee… Frydenberg: Let me say, I’m the deputy leader of the Liberal party. Scott Morrison is the leader… Faine: Parliamentary leader, I’m talking about the admin wing. Frydenberg: And we work extremely closely with the organisational wing. But our party is about 10,000 strong here in Victoria… Stay with me, because this interview is still going. The pair tussled over why the Liberal party was holding on to its Scullin candidate: Faine: In the seat of Scullin, safe Labor seat, Andrew Giles holds that, the Liberal party endorsed a man up near Whittlesea called Gurpal Singh. He has in an SBS radio interview linked gay marriage to paedophilia and has said that “it’s beyond comprehension how the children of a same-sex relationship could cope with life”. You’ve not disendorsed him. Why not? Frydenberg: Well, that decision was taken a couple of weeks ago. You’re right. He made those comments on SBS Punjabi radio. He apologised unreservedly for those comments and… Faine: He hasn’t been disendorsed. Frydenberg: He hasn’t been disendorsed… Faine: Why not? Frydenberg: But those comments are not the views that he holds. He… Faine: Well, he said them. Frydenberg: He did say them back in… Faine: No one was holding a weapon to his head. Frydenberg: He did say them in 2017 and he was a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage and that issue of same-sex marriage has now been dealt with, again, an achievement of the Coalition. Faine: So, Scott Morrison said the behaviour you walk past is the behaviour you accept. He was having a go at the Labor party candidate for the inner-city seat of Melbourne. But, you’ve got a bigger problem and you’re not dealing with it. Frydenberg: Well, we don’t accept those comments and again, as I said, he has apologised. But you are right to point out that other parties across this state have also lost candidates. We lost a candidate in Isaacs, we’ve seen the Labor party lose their candidate in Melbourne, it took three days for Bill Shorten to come around to that… Faine: You lost another one in Wills… Frydenberg: And then the Greens have lost their candidate in Lalor for their comments… The Melbourne ABC interview then moved on to the government’s climate change policy and environment minister, Melissa Price: Jon Faine: OK. Is Melissa Price, the environment minister, is she going to come along? Josh Frydenberg: Look, I don’t know, but Melissa Price has the biggest electorate in the southern hemisphere… Faine: Yeah, but she’s been completely unavailable to the media, she’s in witness protection. Frydenberg: She has been working diligently, as you would expect her to do, in her electorate. Faine: Not a word to say, publicly, on her portfolio or her area of responsibility… Frydenberg: That is not correct. She’s made… Faine: The UN put out a report saying we’re facing a climate emergency, that species are facing extinction, not just one or two but a million; the environment spokesperson for your party, not available. Frydenberg: And that report also made it very clear that we can take action and we need to take action and that is why this government is investing significantly in meeting its Paris commitments. That is why we’ve seen a record amount of renewable energy on our watch, that is why Snowy 2.0 will be built… Faine: Do you accept the UN report that a million species face extinction? Frydenberg: I accept that there are real threats to both flora and fauna… Faine: Do you accept the UN report? Frydenberg: Well, I do accept the science, absolutely… Faine: How come you’ve just said more than your environment minister? Frydenberg: No, I accept the science and I accept… Faine: That is more than your environment minister has said publicly… Frydenberg: That’s not true. We as a party accept the science and we accept that action needs to be taken. That’s why we’ve got to be part of a global agreement. But, when it comes to threatened species, we were the party that appointed Australia’s first threatened species commissioner, developed Australia’s first threatened species strategy, partnered with the private sector to fund a whole series of threatened species programs across the country and again, we recently announced some initiatives through this election campaign. The pair then moved into why the launch was in Melbourne and why safe Liberal Victorian seats were in danger. Jon Faine: How is it and why is it that what were once regarded, in fact forever have been regarded, as super-safe Liberal seats are now under threat? Josh Frydenberg: Well, my view is that no seat is safe today in politics because John Howard said this to me, Jon, that when he first went into politics there were 40% of people at every election who was rusted-on Liberals, 40% rusted-on Labor and there was a 20% in between who are up for grabs. Faine: And now it’s actually 35/35 and the rest are up for grabs. Frydenberg: Well, he said by the time he left politics it was 30 Liberal, 30 Labor and 40 are up for grabs. And I think now with modern technology and everyone having a megaphone with their iPhone, I think it’s a very different political debate. The other thing is you’re seeing a lot more pre-polling. You’re seeing a lot more pre-polling … Faine: Sure. Frydenberg: And the whole dynamic of the election campaign has changed. We have become more presidential, I also think … Faine: Does it not suggest that in fact, and the polls back this up, that your party has become, it’s out of touch and become, in some ways, unelectable with its stance on climate change, its position in relation to equality for women, and some of the other hostilities that have emerged from some of your more fringe candidates, some of them who have lost preselection. Frydenberg: Well, John, that sounds like a partisan comment, not a question … Faine: It is a question … Frydenberg: With the greatest respect, it sounded like a partisan comment and not a question. If you ask me what does the Liberal party stand for, I will tell you it’s about our values and our philosophy. It’s about personal responsibility, encouraging the individual and their enterprise, providing a safety net for those who need it. That is what is reflected in our policies and the great contrast at this election is around economic management because it is from economic management that you can provide the social dividend with increased funding in hospitals and schools. And it’s our economic management that sees Australia growing faster than any G7 country except the United States. It sees us having created 1.3 million new jobs since coming to office and it sees in the budget a plan to pay back Labor’s debt, to create more apprentices, to spend $100bn on infrastructure, including significantly here in Victoria, and to deliver record funding on hospitals, schools, disability support and aged care. Faine: So at the Liberal launch, which is on this weekend, I assume that you, as a senior Victorian, will be sharing the stage with Scott Morrison. Malcolm Turnbull, not coming. Tony Abbott said he’s not coming. Julie Bishop, Peter Dutton, Michael Keenan, Eric Abetz, Steve Ciobo, Chris Pyne. Might be able to hold it in a coffee shop, Josh Frydenberg. Frydenberg: Good try. The fact is, the prime minister and I and others will be speaking and we will be, again, reaffirming our commitment through this election to the policies that are important to strengthen Australia. Faine: Let’s confirm. Malcolm Turnbull is not coming, he’s in New York. Tony Abbott said he’s not coming. Julie Bishop, she’s not coming. Peter Dutton, you’re not going to bring him down for the launch in Melbourne, are you? Frydenberg: Well, as I understand it, Peter Dutton won’t be there. But, again, it’s not a question of those people, it’s a question of what is the message to the Australian people. And it’s the prime minister and myself and the rest of our team that have made it very clear that this election is a clear choice. It continued: Faine: No, there’s an issue here between the Labor party and the Murdoch media. It’s nothing specifically to do with the Liberal party. But it has opened up media relations as an issue in this campaign. Are you aware that both Bill Shorten and the Greens leader Richard Di Natale will be speaking at an ABC Friends rally this weekend in Melbourne? Frydenberg: Good luck to them. Faine: Are you aware that they may well be making announcements to make the ABC and further media issues a live point of difference in this campaign? Frydenberg: Well, from our perspective you know we believe the ABC plays a vital role in the public debate and I certainly … Faine: But you’ve starved it of funds? Frydenberg: Well, that’s not actually correct. You know it’s receiving more than a billion dollars of taxpayer’s funds. And as you know Ita Buttrose is the new chairperson of the ABC and she brings a great deal of media experience to that role and a new CEO has just been appointed of the organisation. And I feel that the ABC plays a vital role, particularly in our regional communities as well and everyone turns on to listen to you at times of a fire and flood and drought. And I think that the ABC, not only contributes to the public and political debate, but also plays a very important role in informing the public about issues of relevance to them. Faine: So, you’re going to have an even sharper contrast. You’re going to have I presume announcements; I don’t know. But I’m expecting if they’re turning up those political leaders of the Greens and the Labor party it’s to turn up to say something of significance to the adoring ABC loveys. So, there’s going to be this even sharper contrast between the Liberal party who are hostile to the ABC … Frydenberg: You’ve just heard the deputy leader of the Liberal party and say how important the ABC is to political debate. So … Faine: And I’ve been given an uplift by the Murdoch media at every opportunity and the contrast couldn’t be clearer then could it? Frydenberg: Well, I don’t accept the premise of your question, because the premise is that we as a party are attacking the ABC. We’re not. We’re actually funding and encouraging the ABC. But if we don’t see a balanced reporting, regardless of the medium, regardless of the organisation, it’s only fair that we point it out. Faine: And you’re welcome to and from time to time… Frydenberg: And it is our ABC after all. I missed it this morning, but the transcript of Jon Faine’s interview with Josh Frydenberg has just dropped and the ABC Melbourne interview seemed like an absolute doozy. Per the transcript: Faine: So, the Daily Telegraph and the Courier Mail yesterday ran a front-page story about the leader of the opposition Bill Shorten’s mother. Was it an own goal by the Murdoch media? Frydenberg: Well, clearly those articles, in my view, should not be written because the public debate in political debate is coarse enough, there’s enough toxicity in our debate without having to bring in families. So, I can understand how Bill Shorten felt yesterday and I feel in that sense our families are off limits. Faine: Your family’s been dragged down in as well, but it’s the view of people who are Labor party campaigners that the Murdoch media were briefed after Q&amp;A on Monday night. They were briefed by the Liberal party dirty tricks unit about that. Frydenberg: That is absolutely false. Faine: You can categorically say that? Frydenberg: I can say to you the Liberal party is not at all connected to that story and you heard the prime minister’s comments yesterday. Faine: There’s a… Frydenberg There’s nowhere for you to go after that one. And the Australia Institute, which was dismissed by the government as being “Labor-aligned”, has responded to the Fact Check analysis: The Australia Institute have always said the assumptions in our model were on the conservative side and that our research showing $77bn of the Coalition’s income tax cut goes to those earning over $180,000 was a low-ball figure. ABC Fact Check now confirms that: the Coalition’s tax measures would reduce the progressivity of Australia’s income tax system; and the Australia Institute’s $77bn figure goes to those earning over $180,000 is, in fact, an underestimate and likely to be much higher – between $88bn and $89bn. The ABC Fact Check project has looked at Bill Shorten’s use of the Australia Institute analysis that the government’s high-income tax breaks would cost $77bn over the next 10 years and found it to be an “underestimate”. From the Fact Check: The $77 billion figure he cites is an underestimate according to two leading tax and economic modellers consulted by Fact Check. Their analyses, using tax and welfare models similar to Treasury’s, found that, over a decade, taxpayers earning more than $180,000 a year would receive between $88 billion and $89 billion under the Coalition’s tax plan. Both experts confirmed that the Coalition’s tax measures would reduce the progressivity of the tax system. According to the Grattan Institute’s Danielle Wood, the share of tax paid by the top 20 per cent of income earners would fall from 68 per cent to 65 per cent under the Coalition’s proposal, while the share of tax paid by middle income earners would rise. As with all economic models, the results depend on various assumptions and forecasts. Fact Check acknowledges that the figures cited in this Fact Check are forecasts only. Labor has not ruled out adjusting tax rates or thresholds over time to suit future economic and budget conditions. In a similar vein, there are no guarantees that a re-elected Morrison Government would be able pass the measures in the Parliament as proposed. As Associate Professor Ben Phillips, from the ANU’s Centre for Social Research and Methods, put it: “Tax analysis over a long period such as to 2029-30 on the assumption that tax thresholds and rates will not be altered by future governments makes little sense.” That looks like it is in relation to this story from 2017 Speaking to Perth radio 6PR, here is how Christian Porter sees the last week of the campaign playing out: I mean it’s always the case in big campaigns like this that things always happen in the last 10 days and you can’t predict all of those, but I would agree with this, like the lines of distinction are really clear. Bill Shorten’s got a very radical, I would argue, tax and spend agenda and there are massive uncertainties and lack of detail and significant hits that people will take because of that tax agenda, particularly in my electorate on the value of their home; retirees are going to get pinged – anyone who ever earns a capital gain; I mean this is quite a radical agenda. And we are a party of economic orthodoxy who is offering people further job growth, further tax decreases and a stronger economy, and a country returning to surplus. The transcript of Tanya Plibersek’s comments on the Malaysia solution from this morning’s AM interview has dropped – this is one of the reasons border security became a big issue today (that and last night’s debate questions). Question: Let’s turn to another topic: refugees. Bill Shorten said in last night’s debate that he would revisit the offer from New Zealand to resettle some of the refugees on Manus Island and Nauru. New Zealand, though, is only offering to take about 150 people so what are the – Plibersek: A year, each year. Question: So you think that all of the remaining refugees on Manus and Nauru could eventually go to New Zealand or are there other third countries that Labor could approach? Plibersek: We would continue to work with the United States in the hope that the United States would take the total number that they have offered and perhaps more. We’d work with New Zealand to accept their offer. It is beyond me why the government has not accepted their offer before this time. Question: But basically everybody would go to either New Zealand or the United States? Plibersek: We would work with third countries. You would recall that we had, when last in government, an arrangement with Malaysia that the Liberals teamed up with the Greens to vote against, that would have resettled people in Malaysia with work rights, with education and health care, able to live in the community while they were assessed. So there will be third-country options pursued as well. We do have to get people off Manus and Nauru. Kim Carr is in Melbourne, outside the Nissan factory, talking about Labor’s plan to “establish a $57m Electric Vehicle Manufacturing and Innovation Strategy, so Australia grows the jobs and companies of the transport future”. We have got to maintain capabilities and build upon it. I want to see as many vehicles driven on Australian roads made in Australia as possible. It may not be that we can full vehicles made here, but we want to keep as many parts made in Australia as possible, develop our part of the global supply chain, have research and development undertaken here, and ensure that we keep the jobs in Australia,” he told the ABC. Adam Bandt said Peter Garrett was right: “The beds are burning and Peter Garrett is right,” Bandt said in a statement. “A million species are at risk of extinction and our world is sinking, burning and drowning simultaneously. Our government needs to respond. “The climate emergency requires an emergency response, not business as usual. “Garrett’s call for an immediate moratorium on new coal, oil and gas is exactly what is needed. “Paul Keating and Peter Garrett are showing more leadership on climate change than Bill Shorten or Scott Morrison. “The Greens will move to declare a climate emergency when parliament resumes and the new government must back us. “I urge Bill Shorten to join the Greens, Paul Keating and Peter Garrett by taking the climate emergency seriously.” Peter Garrett has called on a future Labor government to call climate change “a bona fide national emergency”. From Katharine Murphy’s report: The former environment minister Peter Garrett has urged an incoming Labor government to convene a climate emergency summit to plot a transition to zero carbon, and create a super department aligned to Treasury, like the Department of Post War Reconstruction after the second world war, to implement the transition. In a speech overnight in Melbourne, Garrett – a former environment minister in the Rudd and Gillard governments – said Bill Shorten should create a standalone “war” cabinet committee, charged with the responsibility of overseeing the new initiatives and ensuring Australia meets its emission-reduction goals. If Bill Shorten wins on 18 May, he should “declare runaway climate change a bona fide national emergency” and call for bipartisan action, Garrett said. If that isn’t forthcoming he should court Liberals prepared to cross the floor and independents who have campaigned this election on climate change with a view to building a standing parliamentary caucus on climate. This was kinda a gimme: Question: A record number of people have already voted – more than one million. Are you concerned that these people have already made up their minds about your government? And, secondly, do you think the early voting period is too long? Some of your colleagues have indicated that that is too long. Do you agree? Morrison: Well, what happens after every election is the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters takes submissions from around the country. I used to be the deputy chair of the committee after I was elected in 2007. As part of that process, they’ll consult, consult colleagues and make recommendations. That’s the appropriate forum for those issues to be canvassed. We’ll see what report that comes back. Ever since pre-poll voting opened, is the feedback I’ve had from my colleagues, whether it’s down there in La Trobe or Deakin or Corangamite or up to Townsville, over in Western Australia, or down in Tasmania, where I have been, or the seat of Boothby over there in South Australia, what I have been really encouraged by has been the feedback our people have been getting on pre-polls, wanting to see me continue as prime minister. I really appreciate that feedback. And I – it is very humbling, and I thank them for it. And we are continuing to set out what the choices and more people will make that choice as we get closer to the day. And ultimately everyone will do it on 18 May. But the choice is very clear. And here on the mid-north coast, I want to thank Pat, as a former police officer, as someone who is part of this community and has put himself forward for service, he’s someone that I know can take things forward. We’re fully committed to the Coffs Harbour bypass. Eighty per cent of that funding, 80% of that project we’re committed to. We’ll continue to work out the details of that with the state government, where we’re working together on so many projects around this state. That’s a big commitment to this community, and we’re committed to it. And the way to support the Coffs Harbour bypass is to vote for Pat Conaghan, the National Party candidate, in Cowper on May 18. Question: [On the lack of former Liberal PMs and some ministers at the launch] What kind of message does that send? Morrison: The Liberal launch will be on the weekend and you’ll see what happens on the weekend. But, see, on Sunday all I’m seeking to do is have a direct conversation with Australians about the future. It’s not a party hoopla event. It’s not an event where, you know, the party comes together and there’s lots of backslapping and all those sorts of things. We saw that with the Labor party. That just showed that the Labor party are more interested in themselves than they are in the future of this country. This event on the weekend is all about laying out very clearly what the choice is for Australians, and what my plan is taking Australia forward. Now I have been outlining that ever since I became prime minister. We outlined that in the budget, each day as I’ve stood here before you, and each of the measures that we have been talking about in all parts of the country. And this is an important choice. It’s not about who used to be around, it’s about who’s going to be around on 19 May this year. There are only two people who can be prime minister on 19 May – me or Bill Shorten. And that’s the choice Australians are going to make. Whether they get up on 19 May, on Sunday morning, wherever they happen to be and look at that front page of the paper, will they see Bill Shorten as prime minister or will they see me as prime minister? And that is the choice that Australians are seeking to make, particularly over these last nine days. And so, on Sunday, that’s what I’ll be focusing on. (I am pretty sure that Sunday is not just Mother’s Day, it is also Bill Shorten’s 52nd birthday. Scott Morrison turns 51 on the Monday.) Question: Have you spoken to Joe Hockey about finishing up his term as US ambassador? And on that role, do you think Julie Bishop would be a suitable candidate? Morrison: Well, no, I haven’t had the opportunity to talk to Joe, and I’m sure Joe would understand that. Joe has been through many political campaigns himself. And Joe has made that announcement. And I really want to thank Joe. It’s a good opportunity, in relation to the question you’ve posed today, for me to thank Joe for the great work that he has been doing as our ambassador. Joe was very much involved in relation to the agreement that we were able to conclude with the United States regarding the resettlement. He also did outstanding work in ensuring that our government, and particularly under the former prime minister, was able to secure the great trade outcome for our aluminium and our steel producers. And Joe has done a great job on that. The other thing Joe has done while he has been in the United States has been that centenary of partnership and alliance between Australia and the United States, having served on the battlefield over those last hundred years together. He’s really built the camaraderie of that relationship. I really want to thank Joe for the great work he’s done. He’s served as a great ambassador. He will continue to do that in that capacity until the end of his term. At that time, if I’m successful at the next election, if the people of Cowper vote for Pat Conahan as the Nationals candidate here, then I’ll be in a position to make a decision later in the year about who should be the next ambassador. Question: Why are you in Cowper? Are the polls telling you the seat is potentially at risk with Rob Oakeshott back in the fray? And should Rob Oakeshott be re-elected? Are you prepared to speak with him if you need his support? Morrison: I am here because this is a very tight contest. And we make no bones about that. The people of Cowper will decide whether, not only, whether they’ll get the opportunity for a great new local member like Pat to take over from Luke, who’s done a great job here on the mid-north coast over 18 years. But they will also decide who the next prime minister is. The people of Cowper will decide who the next prime minister is, and only by voting for Pat Conaghan can you ensure that I, as the Liberal-National prime minister, will be able to continue in that job. A vote for Rob Oakeshott is a vote for Bill Shorten, at the end of the day. Last time Rob ... And I know Rob. You know, I’ve known Rob for a long time. And I’ve got on very well with Rob. But the truth is, last time he was in the parliament, he voted 75% of the time with the Labor party. And he put Julia Gillard into the prime ministership. Now, if people want a Labor prime minister, well, they’ll vote for Rob Oakeshott. If they want a Liberal prime minister in me. If they want Bill Shorten, well, Rob’s your guy. But if you want me as prime minister and you want a Liberal-National government to continue, and the certainty of that for people’s jobs and the economy here on the mid-north coast, then Pat is the choice. Question: This morning Tanya Plibersek says she would like to see the US deal to take more refugees off Manus be expanded, and that’s what they would consider doing if they were to win government next week. What do you make of that? Should this US deal be extended to take more asylum seekers off Manus? Morrison: There is a lot of scope in the current deal. We are continuing to have people take up the offer to go and be relocated and resettled in the United States. It does strike me as passing strange that the Labor party, in particular Tanya Plibersek and Bill Shorten, who have been fairly colourful in their descriptions of the Trump administration, would think that they would be in a stronger position to achieve a better arrangement... I find that a little odd. We have a very strong relationship with the United States. We have been able to practically implement the agreement we came into. It is – it’s a difficult arrangement to work through. You have to manage the issues both on the US side and ours, but we really appreciate their support and cooperation. The national security issues that are addressed in dealing with those transfers are not simple. We just work through the program and hundreds of people have been – and will continue to be able to be relocate and resettled under that program. Question: You say there’s a scope. How big would that scope with? Morrison: We’ve still got hundreds of positions that can be filled under that arrangement. Question: Prime minister, industrial relations. Yesterday you said you had not raised a white flag on labour market reform. But then you were evasive when you were asked repeatedly if you would consider making the market more flexible and making it easier for companies to hire and fire. So can you be fair dinkum with us? Is this something that you will be willing to work with companies towards, to make the labour market for flexible and less complex, or is reform dead under your leadership? Morrison: Well, there was a lot of commentary in the question. I’m not going to agree with the presumptions, I’m simply going to say this. I was talking to the owners of the business that are actually building this place right here. You know what flexibility in the workplace means? It means that you can employ apprentices in workplaces like this and we’re providing a 75% subsidy for their wage in year one and then 50% and 25%. We are doubling down on the incentives we give to employers, which gives them more flexibility to actually employ people. We have got half ... half a billion dollars we’re putting in to a new program to ensure we will employ, including 80,000 apprentices in building trades. Making sure things are flexible is about a relationship between employers and employees. It’s also about having the supports and incentives around the tax system, and the industry policies, which gives those employees the ability to take people on. Now the proof of our success in managing that issue is the fact that we’ve seen 1.3 million jobs created. The same policies that enable us to put so many people in work, enable us to put so many young people in work, they are the policies we’re going to continue with. Question: For many swing voters the environment is one of the most important issues. It’s been 15 days since we have seen your environment minister. We are in [an election campaign] we like ... This is a chance to ask people questions. Is she being hidden from the campaign? Will you give us a chance to ask her questions while she stands by your side before this campaign is over? Morrison: If that opportunity presents itself, then that will happen. She’s over in Western Australia, campaigning in the biggest electorate in the country. And ... the other day I made it pretty clear that she would be issuing a statement on the matter you are referring to, and she did. Question: Are you comfortable – Morrison: No concerns about that issue whatsoever. (Referring to anti-vaccination.) Question: The other day, responding to the UN report on climate change, you said that the government had introduced and passed legislation through the Senate dealing with that very issue in the last week of parliament. What legislation was that? Morrison: Well, on that occasion, I was actually referring to the animal protection legislation, but there was also in the course of that week, the budget measure, which was the environmental $100m restoration fund, which deals with that issue as well. (The reporter asks what bill.) Morrison: I was referring to different legislation. But in the same week there was the budget measure. To clear that up, that’s what I was referring to. Jono? Question: Prime minister, on the issue of vaccinations, Clive Palmer – one of his candidates has questioned the need for immunisation and Clive Palmer’s spokesperson says the party is undecided on the merits of vaccination. You have said that the standard you walk past is the standard you accept. Is this acceptable for you, that you’re preferencing a party that doesn’t believe that you need vaccinations? Morrison: Labor is preferencing the anti-vaxxer in the seat of Richmond. Our policy, on anti-vaxxing is very, very clear. I am the minister – when he was I was social services minister – that introduced no jab, no play. I’m the one who actually did that, and implemented that policy. We have record levels of vaccinations. So, when it comes to ensure that we have the herd vaccination in place for Australians, we’re the government that has delivered that. And so there will be no change to that policy, only to make sure that it’s even better in the future. And there are no arrangements that we’ve entered into that would in any way, shape or form impact on that policy. None whatsoever. Question: On the superannuation, you spoke a lot about it this morning. It’s been reported today that a lot of – hundreds of thousands of – Australians are getting benefits from IFM advisory investment fund, based in the Cayman Islands. Is that a legitimate use for Australians to benefit on their super from the Cayman? Morrison: I would have to take further advice. I’m not aware. I’m not in a position to be able to comment. Asked to comment on the Cayman’s more broadly, he moves on. Question: What about a guarantee from you? Can you categorically rule out you have not struck a deal or discussed the possibility with Clive Palmer of revisiting tax cuts for big business in the next parliament? Morrison: I can absolutely rule that out. Absolutely 100% – 100% rule out that we will not be increasing or reducing taxes for businesses of more than $50m in the next term of parliament. Never had a discussion with the UAP about it. Weren’t looking to have one. They didn’t ask for one. So that is a thing I can categorically completely rule out. That’s what ruling something out looks like, Bill, you don’t say, “I have a plan”, or use mealy-mouthed words. I am not going to do it. Can you say the same about the price and the value of people’s homes that they have saved hard for, whether it’s the investment property – we’re standing in one here. This is a property that has been developed and built and paid for by someone down in the city, who is investing in this property and this is creating jobs here in the mid-north coast. Bill Shorten wants to stop that. (For the record, Morrison has previously said he has “no plans” to do anything on IR.) Electing the Liberal candidate in Cowper is now the only way to ensure Scott Morrison wins the election. Earlier this week, it was Gilmore. Anyone would think all 151 seats are important in a political party reaching a majority. Ali France has responded to Peter Dutton’s claims she is taking down Bill Shorten posters in the electorate of Dickson: Sarah Hanson-Young has responded to this story this morning: Scott Morrison has been caught out trying to mask the Government’s inaction on the extinction crisis. “The legislation he claims addressed the serious warnings outlined in the UN’s biodiversity report this week does not exist,” Hanson-Young said in a statement. “The Liberals will cement their destruction of our environment by backing in the worst environment minister ever, Melissa Price, for another term. Keeping Melissa Price on as environment minister is worse than doing nothing. “Melissa Price has been missing in action this election campaign, and since she took the job in August. When she has surfaced it has been to insult world leaders fighting for climate action, or to approve the Adani coal mine and a mega uranium mine in WA. “The climate can’t afford another Liberal Government and our environment can’t afford another term with Melissa Price as environment minister. Voters deserve better than a Prime Minister who lies about his Government’s environmental credentials in the midst of global crises on climate change and biodiversity loss. “The UN biodiversity report released this week gives voters a clear choice. If you want to stop the extinction crisis, if you want to save our environment, you need the Greens in the Senate.” Question: Talking about pursuing new third-party resettlement options. New Zealand is clearly on the table. Is Malaysia also on the table? Shorten: There’s no arrangements to talk with Malaysia. We’re not the government. Question: But you are in ... Shorten: New Zealand has been on the table for four, five years. You’ve gotta ask yourself why the government hasn’t pursued it. Do they want to prolong this issue to score political points? Listen, I know that the government wants to scare people about boats. I’m calling that out ... I’m not the government. What I’m saying here is that this government has run out of anything to talk about. What a surprise. The Thursday or Friday of the second-last week, government has tried all the other scare campaigns. I notice today no one is asking me about that nonsense discussion about climate change costs, when, in fact, the cost of not acting is greater. We all know the government has pressed the panic button. They want to scare people on boats. They know we’ve got the same policy on boats. We will have a very good foreign policy, because I’ve got Penny Wong, and they don’t. We’ll make sure that we help resettle people. But you have sophisticated analysts. You know we’ve got the same policy on boat turnbacks. You know we’ve got the same policy on regional resettle: you know we’re committed to resettling people overseas and not letting them stay here. This nation needs more than scare campaigns. You saw him last night. He thinks that childcare costs are going down. He thinks that cancer treatment is free. He thinks that first home buyers don’t have a problem in the market. Goodness me – he even surprised me when he said, “climate change, yeah, we’re gonna make all our targets rubbish, rubbish, rubbish”. All that man can do is talk about us. They don’t offer any plan for the future of Australia. They just want to give their corporate tax cuts back on the table of old mate Clive. They want to give $77bn away to the top tier of tax earners. We know they have no plans. You know they have no plans. Whereas we want to help the sick people in this hospital. Question: On your health plan, you talked about the election being about choices. You have a number of policies – health is one where there’s quite long-term spending plans. Will the costings tomorrow show those – the budget impact over the medium term, over a decade? Shorten: Four and 10, yes. Question: Labor has been critical of the use of tax havens like the Cayman Islands, but it’s been revealed today that IFM Investors, including Australian Super, owns infrastructure assets ultimately held in trust in the Cayman Islands, deliver a return for their members here in Australia. Can you – do you accept that this shows that there are legitimate uses for tax havens in Australia? Shorten: I ... believe completely in transparency. I don’t want to see a Cayman Islands-based company take over our health system, as been given the green light by this company. Global capital moves around, but we need to see transparency. We need to see where tax is really paid. It’s not good enough in this country that we have large multinationals paying no tax, or nearly next to no tax. For me, it’s about a fair go for all Aussies. The reality is, you run a local news agency, you’re a hardworking journalist, you work at a hospital, you’ve gotta pay the tax that’s levied on you. You don’t have the chance to split your income or park it in the Caymans. Question: Why are you palming off the questions about resettling refugees in the United States, when it’s Tanya Plibersek who raised the prospect and not Peter Dutton? Can we get a yes or no about whether you’d consider that deal? Shorten: No, I’m ... Interesting use of the word “palm” there. No, we’re not. I congratulate Malcolm Turnbull. That’s not something you hear the Liberals talks for keeping that deal on track with President Trump. I actually don’t think that we should keep people in indefinite detention forever when we can resettle them in other countries. I’m sure you’d agree with me. So, we’re not. The point about it is, if we’ve got people who have been in indefinite detention already for six or seven years, let’s move them on. Let’s find third-party countries, that’s all. Let’s not fall for the government’s scare campaign. They’ve said they’ll take a ute off you, there are death taxes when there aren’t. They should be ashamed of themselves, signalling the people smugglers, a week out from the election, to try their hand. They will find us completely resolute, working with border security, exactly as we should. Question: Mr Shorten, you told one of the patients in there this morning, with a week to go, that lots of people are tuning out. So, whose fault is that? Are you failing to engage voters? Or have people just had a gutful of modern politics? Shorten: Well, I do think that not everyone is fully engaged in the election. I think some people are turned off by negativity too, aren’t they? Also, what I was thinking, in an oncology ward is these people there are in the battle of their lives. One of the ladies, she moved up from Gippsland. She’s moved up to Queensland. Resettled with her sons who were there. We met the son there too. This was last April. She’s now had a diagnosis. That was her first treatment today. Like, when you get that news, I tell you what, you’re not greatly fussed about what order a how-to-vote card is in, are you? But having said that, this is why this election is important. Because when you strip away the noise and some of the negative carry-on and all of that, if you’re in the fight of your life, don’t you deserve to have a government in Canberra who’s as brave as you Don’t you deserve to have a plan for the future? What I learned out of last night’s debate is I saw for the first time Mr Morrison’s threadbare, real agenda on display. You know, we had five questions, we each asked each other questions. There were five, all about Labor policy. We don’t talk about Liberal policy, because they’ve only got tax cuts, unfunded, in two elections’ time. As we approach the last week, Mr Morrison thinks cancer treatment is free. Mr Morrison thinks there’s no problem with childcare costs. They think they’re going down. Mr Morrison thinks he’s got climate change under control. This government is out of touch. They’ve only got one plan, which is to look after the special vested interests. For me, making sure that this hospital – this is a modest hospital – it’s the centre of this community. I want it to have better resources. Labor has made choices. We’re going after some of the unsustainable tax subsidies at the top end because, for me, when sick people get a fair go in this country, we are a better country for everyone. Question: On robo-debt, social advocates have talked about the legalities of this program of groups. Like Acoss have ask for Labor to outline your view on it. What would Labor do? Shorten: Well, we want to make sure that people aren’t receiving welfare to which they’re not entitled to. And no one gets a leave pass on that. But I do think that there are smarter ways of getting people to pay back money, and, indeed, investigating what people actually really do owe rather than giving it to the debt collectors. This is a government who have got no problem giving $80bn to the top end of town, but if you’re on Newstart and you found yourself a job and you accidentally got an extra week’s pay, they find the debt collectors for you. This is a government who, if you are weak and powerless in this society, who if you’re someone who this government doesn’t think supports it, they’ll chase you. And if you’re at the top end of town, like Mr Palmer – he apparently owes the commonwealth taxpayer $70m, doesn’t he? Because the commonwealth has paid his debts to the workers. See, that’s the difference. If you are poor and disadvantaged, this government will sick the debt collectors on it you. But if you’re Clive Palmer and you owe your workers tens of millions of dollars, Mr Morrison will put you in the Senate. Question: You mentioned scare campaigns earlier. Today, Labor is linking Clive Palmer with the government’s former proposed company tax cuts, that the treasurer said is now dead. Are you not running a scare campaign of your own with this? Shorten: Well, let me just go to what Mr Morrison said. First of all, does anyone think that Clive Palmer doesn’t want a corporate tax cut for big business? That’s certainly what Pauline Hanson’s made clear he wants. Does anyone think Mr Morrison doesn’t have one of the biggest IOU cheques in history to Clive Palmer if he gets returned? Clive Palmer ain’t going into politics to raise taxes for big business, is he? So, Mr Morrison, though, I think he’s the real problem here. And you say, you know, trying to give Mr Morrison a leave pass in recent times because of his sudden conversion to not wanting to give a tax cut to big business. It’s in the Liberal DNA. I have here a quote from what Mr Morrison said, just about the one-year anniversary of when he said it. Morrison, quote: “We’re fully pursuing our enterprise tax plan. Nothing’s changed on that. We remain committed to this. We don’t flip or flop on these things.” Well, you be the judge. Was he lying then, or is he lying now? The reality is that the Liberal party, for the last three years, has wasted the nation’s time pursuing a one-point economic plan. Tax cuts for big business. And we see it again last night, when he was evasive, he still wouldn’t confirm that he wants to give $77bn to the top tier of tax earners. The Liberal party serve the top end of town in Australia, they serve the vested interests. Labor wants to ensure a fair go for all Australians. Question: Just on borders and home affairs, one of the things that Peter Dutton did say this morning in Townsville is that you should outline who your home affairs minister will be. You’ve pointed to who your health and your education minister will be. Can you give us even just one name of someone within your party who you would consider fit for that role? Shorten: I’ve got plenty of people who can do the role. But I tell you what, unlike the Liberal party, I don’t want to take my orders from Peter Dutton. What a joke this fellow is. He destroyed Malcolm Turnbull. He destroyed Malcolm Turnbull. One of the single biggest issues that we hear wherever we travel – I’m sure you hear it, for your exhaustive inquiries too – is what people really hate about modern politics is the turmoil, the backbiting and the pushing that Peter Dutton has never properly accounted or shown any remorse for tearing up the Liberal government of Malcolm Turnbull. Like, we don’t take orders from – that’s one of the many good reasons why I’m in the Labor party. We will put forward our full ministry after the election. But since we’re talking about ministerial line-ups, has anyone seen their environment minister? Do you know they’ve had five defence ministers in six years? This is a government ... And by the way, what is the real role of Clive Palmer in this government? Clive Palmer ... Pauline Hanson has outed Clive Palmer and said that he was trying to heavy her to vote for $80bn of tax cuts last year. Just how much power will Clive Palmer, the unnamed minister at the Morrison cabinet, table actually have? Question: Would you consider revisiting the [Malaysia] solution or asking the Americans to take more refugees? Shorten: We are committed to maintaining strong borders. We have made it clear we will do boat turnbacks where the defence authorities and border security say it is safe to do it. We are committed to the view that anyone who comes by boat via people smuggler will not be processed and settled in Australia – full stop. We also said – you were all at the debate last night – what we don’t believe is we keep people for semi-indefinite detention. I congratulate Scott Morrison for the work that he did. With think there are opportunities if people want to take people for other places, that is fair enough. We will work it through. I won’t have the government run their scare campaign somehow saying because we believe in the humane resettlement of people in third-party countries that that is not a commitment to strong borders. I notice that Peter Dutton has been let out of wherever he has been, and he’s popped up in Townsville, and Kristina and I were talking about it. She’s got some observations that I think she should share with you. Kristina Keneally: Peter Dutton has been let out of his cave. He’s been kept underground somewhere by the Liberal-National party. But they’ve let him out of his cave to appear on national television, in fact, to travel all the way to Townsville. Look, frankly, this is a desperate attempt by the Liberals to scare Australians. This is a desperate attempt to cling to power. This is a desperate attempt to deploy the most toxic man in Australian politics. And to have him out there, raising the spectre of fear and division in the community. The Australian people understand and support the commitment that both parties have to strong borders. But the Australian people do not believe we need to be a cruel country, cruel to people on Manus and Nauru, in order to secure our borders and keep them safe. Peter Dutton, being let out of the cave, out there in Townsville, trying to scare people, one has to ask: Is Mr Dutton, indeed, auditioning for some job in the future? Perhaps Peter Dutton is showing us his audition tapes for the role of leader of the party after the election. Border protection and Manus Island and Nauru are the first questions off the bat this morning. Asked if Labor would seek to close “back door” Australia entry if it took the New Zealand solution, Shorten says that Labor would seek the same conditions as the United States deal. OMG the Sky ticker has actually changed to “Latham calls out political correctness”. This has made my day. The Sky ticker currently says “Latham criticises ‘leftist elites’” and truly, it is not just death and taxes we can rely on any more in this crazy world, and I for one am grateful for some sort of consistency. It’s comforting. It would only be more obvious if the ticker said something like “Latham stands against political correctness”, but I guess we have to save some things for tomorrow. Not to be outdone by a Clive Palmer candidate questioning vaccination (as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age), now a Pauline Hanson candidate has jumped on the vaccination question train (while claiming not to be anti-vaxxer). As reported by the Herald Sun: A Victorian candidate for Pauline Hanson’s One Nation has shared anti-vaccination propaganda and argued lifesaving “no jab, no play” policies are “dictatorial socialism”. Vaughan Williams, the party’s candidate to take on Labor MP Lisa Chesters in Bendigo, posted a string of anti-vaccination stories and comments on his website “The Vaughan Report”, which promised “real news” for his followers. He told the Herald Sun he was “not an anti-vaxxer” but believed people should be allowed to refuse vaccinations as he raised concerns about their “severe side effects”. With Labor preparing to unveil its costings tomorrow, Liberal treasurers from three states – New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania – have written to Bill Shorten asking for further and better particulars about the big revenue-raising measures, and the impact of them on state revenues. “You have committed to reducing access to negative gearing and reducing the capital gains tax discount. We are concerned that these changes have the potential to further slow the housing market, which will have significant implications for our constituents and also our local economies,” the three treasurers say. “We write to seek your urgent advice on the impact of your policies on home values, rents, the construction industry, the economy, wages and jobs.” The three treasurers are also seeking a “firm commitment” from Shorten that the states will be compensated for any loss of GST revenue as a result of Labor’s tax policies. “Independent analysis of Labor’s changes to capital gains tax policy by the Centre for International Economics estimate that states will lose over $1.4bn a year – over $1bn a year in state revenue and over $400m a year in lost GST revenue. “Further analysis by SQM forecast Labor’s change to negative gearing policy as resulting in a $2.3bn fall in stamp duty in one year alone. These matters could have significant implications for state finances. “We ask that you confirm these issues as a matter of urgency to provide clarity to our states and residents.” Bill Shorten is talking to people who are going through chemotherapy at the Redcliffe hospital. Labor is holding its press conference at Redcliffe hospital. That’ll be sometime after midday. Don’t f**k with the bingo players should be written in every campaign book. I once accidentally held up a game when a forum I was hosting at a surf club ran over time, and let me tell you, I never let that happen again. And Peter Dutton on whether or not Scott Morrison should lead the Liberal party if it loses the election: I am increasingly confident we can win this election because I can tell you in my marginal seat, in Phil’s electorate, Bill Shorten is on the nose. The Labor candidate in my electorate has started taking down Bill Shorten posters. They are not mentioning Bill Shorten. I think older Australians, in particular, are waiting with baseball bats for Mr Shorten because they don’t want their retirement plan wrecked. They don’t want the borders open and they don’t want Labor back mismanaging money. So, we have got a long week ahead of us, but I believe that we can win this election that will be, in part, because people are very suspicious about Mr Shorten and what he represents. Asked another question about the New Zealand offer, Peter Dutton again seems to offer a softening of language here. The government rejected the offer, but then attempted to pass legislation which would put a “lifetime ban” on any Manus Island and Nauru refugees, which New Zealand would not accept, as it created a “second tier” citizenship, given the free movement between the two countries. Dutton again floated that the government does not consider the New Zealand offer a no-go area, while criticising Labor for saying it will consider it (Bill Shorten repeated last night that Labor would look at the NZ offer). I have detailed the concerns in relation to New Zealand. We have not ruled it out, but we have said at the moment that is not the option in the best interests for us. People smugglers are marketing New Zealand at this point and the Labor party refuses to accept that. Bill Shorten doesn’t even understand – and he’s demonstrated this in some of his statements – doesn’t understand that as a New Zealand citizen you have the ability to come to Australia and get a visa on arrival. No other country in the world has that. So, if you want a back-door way to get to Australia, you go to New Zealand. Let’s be very clear about the difference between New Zealand and other countries, including the United States. So why the Labor party won’t accept that, I don’t know. But, if they bring – if they are elected into government and they bring people en masse from Nauru and Manus, I promise you the boats will restart. The people smugglers will be rubbing their hands together because Shayne Neumann will lose control of the situation overnight. Peter Dutton is “increasingly confident we will win this election” and believes older Australians “in particular, are waiting for Bill Shorten with baseball bats”. Peter Dutton on why the government won’t accept the New Zealand offer to take refugees from Manus Island and Nauru: The US deal was for up to 1,200 people but there are some people that the United States has said that they will not accept.Under Mr Shorten’s plan those people will come to Australia or go to New Zealand. It will be interesting to see under a Shorten Government where or not Jacinda Ardern will take people with questionable backgrounds. Will the New Zealand Government take people referred to them by the Australian Government and will they reject anyone. That’s the question for the Labor Party so, yes, we’ve had a significant mess to clean up. Not only the 1,200 lives at sea, as tragic as that was, but 8,000 children in detention, a tragedy for many of those children. We have been able to get all of those kid out of detention, been able to get all of the kids off Nauru. We have been able to get people to the United States and back to their country of origin ore-wise. I promise you the first boat that arrives under Labor, under the agreement that the US has been very clear about, not one person will go to the United States and the New Zealand offer, given that New Zealand is the only country in the world where you can get a on arrival into Australia, that is a very different proposition in the mind of people smugglers, if people can get to New Zealand and we know that people smugglers are marketing New Zealand right now as a destination. It is a very different proposition and Labor, it seems at the moment, is doing everything they can to get the boats are started and this government, as I have announced today, will continue our success of Operation Sovereign Borders and we don’t want to go back to the days of people drowning and we don’t want to go back to the days of kids in detention, but it is Labor Party policy today if a boat with 100 people turned up, those people would go on to Nauru. Once they get overwhelmed on Nauru and the numbers are not able to be accommodated anymore, they will come to the mainland, which is exactly what happened when Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard were in government. 1,000 people a week were pulled off boats on Christmas Island and the Labor Party completely lost control of our borders. Peter Dutton has made his way to north Queensland to talk border security: I am here today along with Phil to make a very important announcement, that is the Coalition’s border protection policy. That is one of the defining issues of this election and the difference now between the two parties when it comes to border protection is more stark than it has ever been. We know that Bill Shorten has a track record, as Labor does, of not being able to manage borders, just like they can’t manage money. The Government over the last six years has worked day and night to clean up Labor’s border protection disaster. All Australians should remember when they go to vote at this election that 50,000 people arrived on 800 boats and 1,200 people, including women and children, drowned at sea. Under Labor 8,000 children went into detention and we’ve been able to not only stop the deaths at sea but we’ve been able to get people off Manus and Nauru that Labor put there. We have been able to get all of those children out of detention and we have been able to make sure that the boats don’t restart. So the promise that we make to the Australian people is that our policy on Operation Sovereign Borders will continue and we cannot take our foot off the pedal here. This is an enduring problem. It is an enduring threat. The fact that Labor is proposing to undo regional processing through their Medevac bill and Labor is proposing to go soft on turning back boats where it is safe to do so and the fact that don’t have the ability or the desire within the Labor Party to keep those boats stopped, it is a big issue at this election. ...It is obvious now, we are hearing whispers out of Labor, that Mr Shayne Neumann will be the Home Affairs Minister if Mr Shorten is elected as the Labor Prime Minister in this country. That should send a shiver down the spine of anybody concerned about border protection in this country. He is one of the weakest people in the parliament. The people smugglers would be rubbing their hands together at the prospect of Shayne Neumann becoming the home affairs minister in this country and Mr Shorten needs to explain why he is reluctant to make that announcement. Even nine days out from the election he refuses to say who would be his Home Affairs Minister. The last reports revealed just one person has been transferred under the medevac bill. Happy birthday to Parliament House This is the final question. It is, as they say on the bad show, to be taken as a comment: I am very pleased that you’re leading the charge in this election on our behalf. The previous Prime Minister I had no idea what he represented and I’m glad he’s gone. (Big cheers) I feel you are representing certainly the values that I hold near and dear so thank you for representing me and even if, heaven forbid, the Labor Party win this election, at least I know that you’ve put up a very good fight on our behalf. Thank you very much.” More cheers. Scott Morrison: I appreciate the support. But we are going to win this election. (BIG CHEERS) I will tell you why I believe we are. I believe we will because of what I said at the outset and whatPat said, I think there are millions of Australians out there - you know, between elections they are not reading the papers or following the political news every day, as I said, they are too busy living their lives and fulfilling their responsibilities to others, they are caring for parents or they’re just being the decent, honest, good-hearted Australians that they are, but they turn up every three years at elections and they take a good, close look at what the options are and they are doing that right now. As we’ve seen, as the weeks have passed, as we got closer to this election, they are seeing what the choice is and they are beginning to see and understand what the risk of a Labor Government would be. I am setting out how we can make things better and will, because we have, and we will continue to and we will do it responsibly and affordably and do it without raising tax, and will make sure Australia is in a strong position and safe pair of hands to manage Australia through the years ahead. They are seeing the alternative of Labor, which is a big risk where everything they have worked so hard for could be turned back. I say to those quiet Australians who are out there, now is not the time to turn back. Now is not the time to engage in big experiments with our economy and national security. Now is the time for those trusted hands that have brought the budget back into surplus next year, that have created 1.3 million job, that have created over 100,000 jobs in just one year for young people, that has invested in our hospitals and schools - up 60% - that has ensured we are taking on the big challenges in mental health and aged care, there are twice as many people today that have an in home care package today than when we were first elected. And to tackle the big issues that I know young people, but not just young people, right across the spectrum of our community who want us to take action on climate change and we are. Bill Shorten is saying that it is a choice between taking and not taking action. No, we are both taking action. We are taking responsible action, that is what we are doing and he won’t tell you the price of the action that he intends to take. While trying to see where that question was coming from in the crowd, Scott Morrison said there was “a shire* girl in every crowd” if that helps paint a picture of the sort of room he’s talking to. *I originally wrote this as shy, but have been corrected from those in the room. He said shire. There is a woman in this Port Macquarie forum who appears to be complaining that her 40-year-old children won’t be voting for Scott Morrison and they “just don’t get” the issues around franking credits. She literally mentions that they are not listening to their father. A lot of us have children in their middle to late 40s and it is very difficult [at] some family get togethers trying to explain to them some of the policies. One of my children has trouble with – I understand it – but I have trouble with explaining why ... the franking credits is not a gift and their father has tried to explain if you don’t earn enough tax to have to pay tax, that’s why you get it back. But it is very difficult for them to get it through to the 40-year-olds why it is not a gift. So I’m wondering if through your last week some of those confusing issues, which to them is just rhetoric, when in fact it is our reality, could be looked at and explained a little clearer to the younger people, please?” Obviously, the children continue to be wrong and you are never too old for your mother to dob on you to the prime minister. Scott Morrison is addressing the Cowper crowd by telling them that Bill Shorten refers to what they have worked hard for (franking credits) as “a gift”. “He said it again last night,” Morrison says. The murmurs are so loud, you can hear them on the broadcast. It’s 1950s musical level of murmuring in there. But at least we know there are no pitchforks. The UK does have nuclear power, so this is with that caveat. But they have done their first week without coal since the industrial revolution. And Malcolm Turnbull was very quick to congratulate them on it. And no wonder they are so happy – water aerobics is about to get LIT. From Scott Morrison’s announcement: Port Macquarie’s first tidal pool is set to become a reality with a $4.5m commitment from the Liberal and Nationals government. Visiting Port Macquarie today, prime minister Scott Morrison pledged his government would finish the feasibility study, finalise planning and design, and get the project done. The prime minister said his government had listened to the local community and the 18,000 people who had signed the petition to the Port Macquarie-Hastings council. “A tidal pool in Port Macquarie is one of those projects which has been talked about in the community for decades and my government and our candidate Pat Conaghan will make it a reality,” the prime minister said. Scott Morrison has arrived at a Port Macquarie’s seniors’ forum to a very warm welcome. Scott Morrison was invited on Insiders when Labor was having its campaign launch last week. He declined and Josh Frydenberg got the gig. Bill Shorten however, has accepted: On Triple M this morning, Bill Shorten has floated the idea, which was floated from many of you yesterday, that Malcolm Turnbull was the punter who dropped a $1m bet on Labor to win the election. There is no suggestion Turnbull made the bet. He’s in New York and the punter was only ever described as a “man from NSW”, but there is also nothing to stop the speculation. While talking to ABC radio this morning, Tanya Plibersek was also asked about Kevin Rudd’s call for a royal commission into the “abuse of the near monopoly” of News Corp. The relationship between Labor under Bill Shorten and News Corp was thrown starkly into the spotlight yesterday, following the Daily Telegraph story about his mother. Shorten broke with long-standing tradition when he declined Rupert Murdoch’s invitation for a meeting in New York, declaring he would deal with local managers the same as he does for every other media outlet. Plibersek says Labor was “not contemplating a royal commission” and there would not be “retribution” from a future Labor government. “But I think it is fair enough to call out the fact, that News Limited is doing their very best ... we are happy to call out what is a pretty obvious bias in the News Limited media, aimed at protecting their business interests. “This is a company that between 2013 and 2017 paid no corporate tax in Australia. In 2015 the ATO said this is the number one company to watch, in terms of reducing or avoiding tax. “More to the point, Rupert Murdoch gave up his Australian citizenship. He does not have a vote in this election. Millions of Australians do. “They should decide for themselves, not based on misinformation from corporate interests protecting their right to pay no tax.” “Have acted, are acting, will act,” says Simon Birmingham on the government’s own climate policy. WeChat continues to make headlines this campaign. The ABC has this report this morning: Prime minister Scott Morrison and the Coalition government have been targeted by online propaganda coming from social media accounts affiliated with the Chinese Communist party (CCP). The findings come from a paper, prepared by cyber propaganda researchers Dr Michael Jensen, Dr Titus Chen and Tom Sear, which will be delivered to the Safeguarding Australia Summit in Canberra today. “Our evidence suggests that accounts aligned more closely with the government in Beijing have a clear anti-Liberal (government) story coming out of them,” said Dr Jensen, a senior research fellow at the University of Canberra’s Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis. Across a period of five months from November 2018 to March 2019, the researchers analysed the Australian content on 47 of the most visited WeChat official accounts in mainland China, 29 of which were aligned with the CCP. There is some suggestion that the posts are in response to the government’s stance on Huawei. And of course, there was the cyber attack on the parliament IT system, which was also levelled (unofficially of course) at China. Peter Dutton has made his way out of Dickson, for one of the first times this campaign. But he hasn’t left Queensland – he is headed to Herbert, to campaign with the Liberal candidate there, Phil Thompson, in Townsville. Herbert is 50/50 at this stage. Labor isn’t overly confident of keeping it and the Liberals aren’t overly confident of picking it up. Preferences are going to be the kingmaker in that seat. Flynn, a little further south, is one seat Labor thinks they could pick up, if they lose Herbert. Leichhardt is another one described as “line ball”. Bill Shorten will be in the south-east of the greatest nation on Earth later today, with Brisbane and Petrie on Labor’s target list. Luke Howarth looks like holding on, at least at this stage. Trevor Evans is facing an increase in the Greens vote, which could cause him some problems. But at this point, Queensland is looking like a zero-sum game for both major parties. Tanya Plibersek was on ABC radio this morning, talking costings. Asked what the impact of Labor’s climate policy would be on the budget, particularly the 45% emissions reduction policy, she gave an answer – just over $500m. It’s the economy-wide impact which will be a different – but that isn’t coming from the budget bottom line, and so, there is no cost put on that. The impact of Labor’s higher ambition for pollution reduction is the same as the government’s because we allow pollution to be reduced by purchasing offsets from overseas and the government won’t allow that,” Plibersek said. The cost on business will depend on how they reduce their pollution.” Also on the ABC this morning, Josh Frydenberg was keen to talk about the missing numbers from Labor’s policies, but once again declined to put a figure on what the cost of the government’s high income tax cuts would be. “All the benefits are laid out particularly in the budget,” he said. Pre-polling continues to just tick along. Higgins is one of many Victorian battlegrounds, with the state very possibly deciding the election outcome. Last night the Liberal candidate, Katie Allen, who hopes to take over from the retiring member Kelly O’Dwyer, was on ABC radio and was asked about comments attributed to O’Dwyer, that she has not disputed, that the Liberal party was seen as “homophobic, anti-women, climate change deniers”. Asked about it on RN, Allen admitted that yes, the party is perceived that way in some quarters: KA: Kelly O’Dwyer’s comments were taken completely out of context … Patricia Karvelas: No, she said the party is regarded as homophobic, anti-women, climate change deniers. KA: No she didn’t, she said she is concerned they are perceived that way, and – PK: I said that, she said the party is regarded – same thing. KA: OK. Fair enough. So it is an internal conversation – PK: I know, I spoke with people in that meeting. I absolutely know what she said in that meeting. KA: It was not a public statement, it was an internal party discussion about concerns of what we were perceived as. PK: And you’re still perceived as that aren’t you? KA: Yes. I’m happy to say that. Absolutely. And so I am putting my hand up – perceptions are not reality. So there are some people – PK: Aren’t some perceptions based on reality? I mean, you have had climate deniers in the party room. KA: I’m sure Labor has as well. This sounded a little strange when the prime minister said it, and here’s why – Scott Morrison’s office has declined to say what legislation he was referring to when he said he had “been taking action” on a landmark UN report about the extinction of a million different species. On Monday, the UN released a comprehensive, multi-year report that revealed human society was under threat from the unprecedented extinction of the Earth’s animals and plants. The agriculture minister, David Littleproud, said the report “scared him”, during a debate on Wednesday. On Tuesday Morrison responded to the report saying: “We already introduced and passed legislation through the Senate actually dealing with that very issue in the last week of the parliament. We’ve been taking action on that.” But no legislation regarding animal conservation or the environment passed in the final week of parliament. That’s the second time Morrison has pointed to environmental legislation that doesn’t exist/meet the sell. Morrison did confirm overnight that if he wins government, Melissa Price, the environment minister who does exist, but is never really seen, will remain in her portfolio. So there is that. There is just over a week to go and the focus is still all on Labor’s policies. Last night’s third and final leaders’ debate was also about Labor’s policies, with both Bill Shorten and Scott Morrison discussing policies the opposition has put forward. It really narrowed down what this campaign has been all about. But it also narrowed down the leaders’ pitch to the electorate. We’ve had continuity and change, but now we have continuity v change. This is not a business-as-usual-in-a-different-cloak election. Which means attention is turning to how each plans to manage the coming economy, with all those global headwinds we keep being warned about. Labor plans on releasing its costings tomorrow, a full week before the election. That’s because the party believes it has a good story to tell. The Liberals have one more day of “tell us the cost” and they don’t plan on wasting it. But the government has other issues to address as well, with Clive Palmer’s United Australia party “undecided” on its stance on vaccinations. Morrison will have to defend the deal his party made with the Palmer party once again, after the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age report. The Liberals look to be are heading to Cowper for a seniors forum, while I wouldn’t be surprised if Labor heads further north, to Queensland. I saw the media buses outside parliament early this morning. It’s a slightly later start, with the latest royal baby winning the morning news cycle, and the parties happy to cede the spotlight – at least for the moment. Once again there is a lot to get through. I’ve been gifted with my second coffee, so am as ready as I’ll ever be. Let’s get into it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2014/sep/01/sellafield-nuclear-scenery-house-prices-wages","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2014-08-31T23:00:00Z","webTitle":"Welcome to Sellafield, the last bastion of affordable house prices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/sep/01/sellafield-nuclear-scenery-house-prices-wages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2014/sep/01/sellafield-nuclear-scenery-house-prices-wages","fields":{"headline":"Welcome to Sellafield, the last bastion of affordable house prices","bodyText":"Easy access to nuclear reprocessing facilities is not usually a selling point in estate agents' marketing details. But for househunters in one corner of Cumbria the plant has one big benefit: Copeland, the west Cumbria borough that contains Sellafield, is now the only part of England with \"easily affordable\" housing still available. A new report from the TUC has found that Copeland is the one local authority area in England where the average house price is less than three times the average annual salary. That is in stark contrast to 1997, when 72 local authorities – one in five – had average prices within easy reach of local homebuyers. Sellafield provides thousands of relatively well-paid jobs to the area, pushing up average pay packets. The presence of the nuclear plant is a beacon of employment in an otherwise barren jobs landscape. The area boasts impressive scenery, from Scafell Pike, England's highest mountain, to the Duddon estuary, a hidden gem where the river Duddon flows into the Irish Sea. And with house prices in Copeland's neighbour South Lakeland now eight times the average local salary, the TUC is clear that \"the rest of the Lake District is by no means an affordable area to live\". The trades union group's report lays bare the effects that a lack of housing and stagnant wages are having on swaths of England. The TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said urgent action is needed to boost workers' pay and tackle a housing shortage. \"London always comes out top when it comes to horror stories about ludicrously over-priced housing,\" she said. \"But the toxic combination of rising property prices and falling real wages has meant that local housing affordability remains a huge problem for millions of people across the country. \"Houses and flats in traditionally affordable areas of the country – from Kirklees to Great Yarmouth and Plymouth to Oldham – are now out of reach for many local people.\" Kensington and Chelsea in West London is the least affordable place to buy, with average house prices more than 30 times the average local salary in 2013, said the TUC. London boroughs also occupy the next five spots on the most out-of-reach list, among them Westminster and Wandsworth. Copeland hosts more than 70% of Britain's higher-activity radioactive waste. Plans to build a permanent underground storage dump for nuclear waste in the area were rejected by Cumbria county council last year. Geography can also be blamed for keeping prices down in Copeland. It takes about an hour to drive from the town of Whitehaven to Carlisle, and almost three hours to reach Manchester. Growing inequality The TUC found that affordability problems are most acute in the south of England, which no longer has any areas where average house prices are less than five times the average wage. The analysis paints a picture of growing inequality, noting that back in 1997, only around one in ten local authority areas were 'out of reach' – with average house prices more than five times local salaries. By 2013 the number of 'out of reach' areas had increased eightfold, to more than 84% of local authorities. \"We need an ambitious programme of home-building to get house prices back under control,\" O'Grady added. \"But housing affordability isn't just about house prices, decent wages are just as important and there is a lot of ground to make up before we return to the kind of salaries that people were earning before the crash.\" The report coincides with a new poll underlining parents' pessimism about their children getting onto the housing ladder. The National Housing Federation (NHF), representing housing associations in England, found more than two thirds of parents fear their children will not be able to afford to buy a home in future without their financial support. The poll of around 1,400 parents of children under 18 also found a quarter had were already saving money for their children's first home. National Housing Federation chief executive, David Orr commented: \"Children are facing the ticking time bomb of being priced out of the communities where they've grown up, and unless they are able to borrow from the 'bank of mum and dad' many will face living in their childhood bedrooms well into adulthood or renting for the rest of their lives.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/21/ground-shifted-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-21T15:46:11Z","webTitle":"How the ground shifted for nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/21/ground-shifted-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/21/ground-shifted-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"How the ground shifted for nuclear power","bodyText":"Political parties The origins of today's decision date back to May 2006 when the then prime minister, Tony Blair – heavily influenced by chief scientist Sir David King – said that Britain should rethink its energy policy to include nuclear. Until then it had been considered unnecessary and too expensive by Labour. Claiming wind and solar power had \"technical\" problems, Blair argued that climate change and energy security demanded nuclear. Research by Mori and the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change that year found that 60% of people would support new nuclear power stations if renewable energy sources were developed and used at the same time. But 74% said that nuclear power should not be considered as a solution for climate change before all other energy options had been explored. Until 2010, the Conservatives said new nuclear should only be built as a \"last resort\". That changed when David Cameron said the party would fast-track it for climate and energy security reasons. The Lib Dems switched to a pro-nuclear stance last month when energy secretary, Ed Davey, said climate change was \"too important to ignore\" and that the party would look \"reckless\" if they ruled out nuclear. Others suggested the Lib Dems switched when it became certain that Cameron would do a deal with the French and Chinese. Public opinion Public trust in the nuclear industry remains low, but it's far more positive than 10 years ago. A survey for the UK Energy Research Centre last month found similar proportions of people supporting (32%) and opposing (29%) nuclear power, compared to 26% and 37% in 2005. But renewables remain far and away the public's first choice. In the same study, solar was backed by 77% of people, and wind power by 64%. The latest Mori poll, in February, showed that public support for building new nuclear power stations had fallen from 50% in 2012 to 42%. Fukushima, whose effects were strongly played down by the nuclear industry in Britain, barely dented support for new UK stations and the proportion of people opposed to nuclear has stayed relatively stable at 20%. However, 38% of the public are now undecided, an 8% increase since 2011. According to Mori, support for nuclear new-build broadly increases with age, and the fall in support and growth in the undecided or neutral proportion is most pronounced in the case of the 35-44 age group . There is still a substantial level of public concern over the storage of radioactive waste and nuclear accidents. Local opinion Support for new nuclear power and a waste has always been greatest near existing plants that employ thousands of people. This has not changed. Other countries Fukushima led to a near-total collapse of support for nuclear power in Japan, where 76% of people want to see it phased out gradually or immediately. Most people want to see more solar and wind energy. In Germany, a 2012 poll found a large majority backing the government's decision to phase out nuclear power and switch to renewable energies within a decade. More than 70% supported the phase-out with 24% against. In Italy, more than 90% of the people in a referendum voted in favour of a ban on new stations. With 55% of the eligible voters participating, the vote became politically binding. Elsewhere, opposition to nuclear remains high with an Ipsos Mori poll suggesting 62% of citizens in 24 countries oppose the use of nuclear energy, with one-quarter of those having change their minds after the Fukushima disaster. Environment groups Environment groups that have strongly backed low-carbon power have barely wavered in their opposition to nuclear in the last decade, although their arguments now are now much about the cost than the danger it might pose. Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth today argued that David Cameron had locked Britain into an immensely costly power source for decades, potentially skewing the market and driving out renewables. WWF said it was essential that other low-carbon technologies were not hurt."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/datablog/2016/apr/01/tata-steel-crisis-what-else-could-we-buy","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-01T10:01:11Z","webTitle":"What the UK could buy for £1.5bn (instead of spending it on Tata Steel)","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2016/apr/01/tata-steel-crisis-what-else-could-we-buy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/datablog/2016/apr/01/tata-steel-crisis-what-else-could-we-buy","fields":{"headline":"What the UK could buy for £1.5bn (instead of spending it on Tata Steel)","bodyText":"Estimates for the annual running cost of Tata Steel have been put as high as £1.5bn a year – a fraction of what we spent bailing out the banks. But what else could you get for the money? We looked at how much the government has spent in other areas, and compared the costs. You could renew one-fifth of a Trident submarine The cost of replacing our Trident submarines has, by the Ministry of Defence’s admission, risen from a projected £20bn to £31bn. The programme involves building four new submarines, so the £1.5bn needed for Tata Steel would get you one-fifth of one new submarine. It’s not a dreadful deal. You get the missiles thrown in for free – they have an operational life expected to last into the 2040s. You could build 1/36th of HS2 In the last autumn statement it was announced that the cost of HS2 was expected to rise above £55bn. Phase 1 of the scheme involves a route distance of 120 miles. We estimate that £1.5bn would buy you 3.2 miles of the route. The money would travel a little further by investing in Crossrail instead. At an estimated cost of about £15bn, you could have got about a tenth of the way across London. You could buy about 8% of Hinkley Point C The Hinkley Point nuclear power station project is in trouble, with engineers suggesting the proposed opening date for EDF Energy’s new reactor is too ambitious to deliver. There’s £18bn on the table to build it, so about 8% of that budget would keep Port Talbot in action. You could also use the £1.5bn to clean up a tiny bit of the mess of decomissioning Sellafield – an operation expected to cost £53bn. You could build half of a massive aircraft carrier We’re spending about £6.2bn on the Royal Navy’s two new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers. HMS Queen Elizabeth was launched in 2014, and HMS Prince of Wales is due for launch in 2017. You could get just about half an aircraft carrier for the money needed to prop up Tata’s UK steel business. The money wouldn’t stretch to buying any planes, however. But then neither does the £6.2bn we’ve spent on building them. It puts parliamentary expenses into perspective Since the MPs’ expenses scandal, our politicians’ claims have been held up as a benchmark for public extravagance. But at their current bill – a modest £106m a year for offices and expenses - it would take MPs 15 years to pool enough cash to bailout Tata for a year. That’s a lot of duck house cleaning bills and weedkiller. The Royal Mail share sales You would have nearly been able to nationalise Tata for a year by privatising bits of the Royal Mail. The government twice sold chunks of shares in the Royal Mail last year, raising £1.341bn. They’d be worth fractionally more at the current share price, but not enough to quite cover the full £1.5bn It’s not such a sweet deal with the sugar tax You couldn’t bail out Tata on the proceeds of George Osborne’s new sugar tax. One of the problems with a state-run steel entity is that it might look like illegal “sweeteners” if the government doesn’t keep the right side of EU regulations. The sugar tax would need to raise three times as much money as Osborne estimated for it to save our steel. We pay twice as much each year to fund the BBC The corporation might be worried about top-slicing of the licence fee to fund free TV and radio for pensioners, but the annual £3bn that the BBC gets from taxpayers would be enough to bail out Tata twice over And with one eye on the EU referendum … You’ll hear a lot of people estimating various amounts of money that the UK funnels into Brussels in EU payments. You can cut the figures several ways, depending on whether you use: the gross contribution; the contribution less our automatic rebate; or whether you try to calculate how much EU money is ploughed back and spent within the UK. Full Fact estimate that the UK’s “net contribution” to the EU budget in 2015 was £8.5bn. That’s £23.28m a day. So bailing out Tata steel would take 64 days’ worth of our annual contributions to the EU budget."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/may/08/north-korea-will-only-use-nuclear-weapons-if-sovereignty-is-threatened","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-08T05:03:34Z","webTitle":"North Korea will not use nuclear weapons first, says Kim Jong-un","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/08/north-korea-will-only-use-nuclear-weapons-if-sovereignty-is-threatened","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/may/08/north-korea-will-only-use-nuclear-weapons-if-sovereignty-is-threatened","fields":{"headline":"North Korea will not use nuclear weapons first, says Kim Jong-un","bodyText":"North Korea will not use nuclear weapons against other nations unless its sovereignty is threatened, and will work toward nonproliferation and global stability, leader Kim Jong-un has said, according to state media. “It is our party’s goal to build a peaceful world free from war and it is the constant stand of our party … to struggle for regional and global peace and security,” Kim said. The comments, reported by the state-controlled Korea Central News Agency on Sunday, were made at the 7th Congress of the Workers’ Party, a gathering organised by the country to select new leaders and create an agenda for the country over the coming years. Pyongyang would not use nuclear weapons against any nation unless “its sovereignty is encroached upon by any hostile force with nuclear weapons”, Kim said. North Korea will also “faithfully fulfil its obligation for nonproliferation and strive for the global denuclearisation”. Despite the apparent overture to foreign powers, Kim said that the nation would “permanently” follow its policy of pursuing economic and military development in tandem, known as the “Byungjin Line”. Observers had anticipated Kim would use the congress to propose talks with rivals to exploit what the dictator considers to be increased leverage as a nuclear power. North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear test in January and followed with a satellite launch in February that was seen by outside governments as a banned test for long-range missile technology, earning worldwide condemnation and tougher UN sanctions. The North responded to the punitive measures, and also the annual US-South Korean military drills in March and April, by firing a series of missiles and artillery into the sea. It also claimed advancements in developing nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, and combined them with threats of pre-emptive nuclear strikes on Washington and Seoul. But analysts took Kim’s comments to congress with a pinch of salt. “North Korea has recently been seeking a peace treaty to end the Korean war,” said Bruce Bennett, senior defence analyst at the Pardee RAND Graduate School in the US. “The purpose of this is to lay the groundwork for the US to withdraw from the Korean peninsula, at which point the north would be able to attack the South.” Bennett said that this would allow Kim to consolidate power at a time when he faces instability at home. “Kim Jong-un says he won’t use nuclear weapons unless he is under threat, but the entire purpose of congress is to consolidate his power. He is under threat from inside now.” The international community, according to Bennett, should demand that the north refrains from developing weapons, put a cap on the ones it has now and stops indoctrinating the population to see the US as an eternal enemy if it is serious about peace. He pointed out that in the past Pyongyang has declared its intention to attack outside powers if the regime is under threat. “A North Korea with 20 or 30 or 50 nuclear weapons is a direct threat to China, and not just to the U.S,” he said. Others viewed the congress in a similar light. “They want to declare Kim’s legitimate rule for the next 50 years,” said Victor Cha, Korea chair at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “High-level purging by Kim in advance of the party congress suggests some internal churn.” In remarks apparently aimed at nations such as South Korea, Japan and the United States, Kim suggested that the nation will look to internationalise further, and “improve and normalize the relations with those countries which respect the sovereignty of the DPRK and are friendly towards it, though they had been hostile toward it in the past”. Toward that end, it is likely that a more outward-looking party elite will be selected. “The congress is likely to close by electing new party leaders, most importantly to the party’s central commission,” said Alison Evans, senior analyst at IHS Country Risk. “This cohort – like that elected to the legislature in March 2014 – is likely to be relatively young, with more women and individuals who have experience abroad.” Pyongyang has seen development in recent years due to the rise of an informal economy, in which dollars can be traded for the local currency on the black market and many haggle goods to stay afloat. The regime apparently turns a blind eye to such activity as it has allowed the nation to fend off crises such as the famines of the 1990s. Evans said that since Kim Jong Un came to power, “there have been minimal economic reforms, despite his overarching policy agenda of …‘dual progress’ in both military and economic terms.” Foreign journalists have been kept away from the congress, despite being invited into the country to cover the event."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2015/oct/26/joshua-oppenheimer-silkwood-meryl-streep","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-26T09:20:02Z","webTitle":"Joshua Oppenheimer interview: ‘Virtually half the movies that come out are overrated’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/26/joshua-oppenheimer-silkwood-meryl-streep","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2015/oct/26/joshua-oppenheimer-silkwood-meryl-streep","fields":{"headline":"Joshua Oppenheimer interview: ‘Virtually half the movies that come out are overrated’","bodyText":"My first memory of cinema is my mother taking me to see Silkwood, which is about a whistleblower at a nuclear power plant.

Donald Trump was condemned as “treasonous” for siding with the Kremlin in a press conference that included discussions about election meddling, oil pipelines, Syria, Crimea and nuclear power. The press conference followed a two hour one-on-one meeting between the two presidents and a working lunch with their aides. In the press conference, Trump did not criticize Putin or the cyber-attacks that the US intelligence community says he coordinated to help Trump’s 2016 election campaign. “I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,” Trump said. Putin denied meddling and said Russia “doesn’t plan” to interfere in US domestic politics. Putin presented Trump with a football from the World Cup. Trump said he would give it to his son, Baron. Republican senator Lindsay Graham, however, warned this could be a bad idea. “I’d check the soccer ball for listening devices and never allow it in the White House,” Graham said. After the press conference, Putin and Trump spoke to Fox News hosts. Putin’s interview will air some time today, but there is not yet a confirmed time. And Trump’s two interviews will air at 9pm ET tonight and 8pm ET tomorrow. The director of National Intelligence under Donald Trump, Dan Coats, released a statement in response to Trump’s summit with Putin today. Trump said today he has confidence in Russia and the US intelligence community. “All I can do is ask the question - my people came to me, Dan Coats came to me and some others, they said they think it’s Russia,” Trump said. “I have President Putin he just said it’s not Russia. I will say this, I don’t see any reason why it would be but I really want to see the server but, I have confidence in both parties.” “We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy, and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security,” Coats said. Guardian foreign correspondent Luke Harding, who has reported extensively from Russia, analyzed the press conference, which he said is “one of the most astonishing ever.” One of the big questions pre-summit was whether Trump would call for the extradition to the US of the 12 Russian spies indicted by Mueller. He didn’t. When the subject came up in the question and answer session Putin sought to throw the accusation back. He said he would investigate the report and even offered to “cooperate”. The Kremlin, he said, would allow Mueller’s team to visit Moscow and to question suspects. In return, however, it wanted access to Bill Browder, a US-born British financier who is a Kremlin bogeyman. Putin was well aware that Mueller’s investigators won’t be visiting Russian anytime soon. He extended a similar offer in 2006 to Scotland Yard following the radioactive murder of Alexander Litvinenko using a cup of tea. The detectives who flew to Moscow found themselves in a PR pantomime, with their efforts to get evidence thwarted by the state. House speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said in a statement that the US must be “focused on holding Russia accountable.” Ryan said: There is no question that Russia interfered in our election and continues attempts to undermine democracy here and around the world. That is not just the finding of the American intelligence community but also the House Committee on Intelligence. The president must appreciate that Russia is not our ally. There is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideals. The United States must be focused on holding Russia accountable and putting an end to its vile attacks on democracy. Seconds before the press conference began, a man in the audience, Sam Husseini, was forcibly removed from the hall. More details are emerging about Husseini and the circumstances surrounding his removal. The Nation editor and publisher, Katrina vanden Heuvel, confirmed Husseini was the man removed from the conference and said he received press accreditation from the news magazine to cover the summit. “As Trump administration consistently denigrates media, we’re deeply troubled by reports that he was forcibly removed from press conference,” vanden Heuvel said on Twitter. Husseini is a communications director of the Institute for Public Accuracy, which seeks to expand the reach of progressive organizations in the media. He was temporarily suspended from the National Press Club in 2011 after questioning the Saudi ambassador. More reaction from the US: Abby Huntsman, Fox News host and daughter of US ambassador to Russia Nancy Pelosi, house minority leader: ‘embarrassing’ David Axelrod, Democratic strategist: ‘horrifying’ Mike Murphy, Republican strategist: ‘weak’ Trump is on his way to the airport, set to fly back to Washington DC. But first, he spoke with Fox News hosts Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson, according to the White House pool. Fox News is also set to air an interview with Putin later today. A brief recap of the press conference, which followed a working lunch and one-on-one meeting between Trump and Putin: Putin said the two outlined the “first steps for improving this relationship and to restore an acceptable level of trust”. Trump said the US relationship with Russia had “never been worse” than it was “until four hours ago,” just before the two spoke. Russian interference in US election Trump and Putin agreed there was “no collusion” between his campaign and Russia in the 2016 election. Trump rejected an opportunity to publicly condemn Putin for Russia’s attempts to meddle in the election. Putin did say he supported Trump in the election. “I wanted Trump to win because he spoke about normalizing Russian relations,” Putin said. Putin said the US president introduced the topic of Russian election meddling during their meeting. Putin reiterated that Russia has not and “doesn’t plan” to interfere in US domestic politics. Trump said Putin “has an interesting idea” about the issue of election meddling, but did not elaborate. Trump repeatedly defended his win in the 2016 election, attacking people who raised questions about Russia’s role. Putin did not deny that Russia has compromising information on Trump. Trump said: “If they had it, it would have been out long ago.” Syria Trump says the two countries “could save hundreds of thousands of lives” in the country. Putin says a major concern there was how many refugees have been displaced from their home country. Business Putin said the US and Russia will put together a “working group” of Russia and American businessmen. Trump said Putin is a “good competitor,” in response to a question about Germany’s plans to build the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. The US Senator from South Carolina has a warning about the football Putin gifted to Trump. Graham also said Trump missed an opportunity to hold Russia accountable for election meddling. “This answer by President Trump will be seen by Russia as a sign of weakness and create far more problems than it solves,” Graham said. We’ll post highlights from that extraordinary press conference momentarily. Meanwhile, some early reaction from the US: Ari Fleischer, a White House press secretary under George W Bush: ‘naive’ John Brennan, CIA director under Obama: ‘treasonous’ Justin Amash, a Republican representative for Michigan: ‘not right’ CNN journalist Anderson Cooper: ‘disgraceful’ Lemire, the AP journalist, now asks about Crimea, something neither of the men had yet mentioned in the press conference. Putin says Trump “continues to maintain that it was illegal to annex it. Our viewpoint is different.” Then, Putin responds to Lemire’s question on whether or not he has comprising information on the US president. Trump said: “If they had it, it would have been out long ago.” That was the last question of the press conference, which has ended. The AP’s Jonathan Lemire asks Trump to warn Putin never to intervene in a US election again in front of the cameras. Trump speaks extensively about FBI servers and asks about Hillary Clinton’s emails. Putin asks to comment. “I was an intelligent officer myself,” he says. “I believe Russia is a democratic state and I hope you’re not denying this right to your own country. Do you believe the US is a democracy?” Putin says. He says if you do believe the US is a democracy, this matter must be dealt with in court. Putin then gives Trump a ball from the World Cup. Trump says his son will like it and throws it into the audience - apparently to Melania. An RT reporter asks Trump, in English, to go into details on any specific arrangements made today or discussed about intervention in Syria. The reporter then moves to Russian to ask Putin about the country’s role there. Trump says they would like to work to help Israel. And that Russia has helped the US eradicate Isis. Putin says a crucial issue in Syria is the “huge amount of refugees” in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey. “I wanted Trump to win because he spoke about normalizing Russian relations,” Putin said. Reuters’ Jeff Mason then asked Putin to answer to claims Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Trump responded to the reporter’s question for Putin for several minutes, including to defend, again, his election win. Then, Putin spoke. Putin said: “Where did you get the idea that Trump trusts me or I trust him?” Putin says they are looking for “points of contact” and that the presidents are looking for a way to reconcile their differences. Jeff Mason, an American reporter for Reuters, asked about Trump’s tweet this morning that US “foolishness and stupidity” damaged the relationship between the US and Russia. “I hold both countries responsible,” Trump says. “I think the United States has been foolish. I think we’ve all been foolish” “I think we’re all to blame.” He says “nuclear proliferation, in terms of stopping” is the most important thing for them to work on together. He then moves onto the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 US election. “There was no collusion,” Trump says. “I beat Hillary Clinton easily,” Trump says. He says it has had a negative impact on the relationship between the “two largest nuclear powers in the world.” A reporter from Russia’s Interfax news agency asked about German’s plan to build the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Trump says Putin is a “good competitor.” “We will be competing when you talk about the pipeline,” says Trump. Trump says the US and Russia “could save hundreds of thousands of lives” in Syria. “This was a very constructive day, a very constructive few hours we spent together.” “I’m sure we’ll be meeting again in the future, often.” The two presidents have concluded their remarks and now for questions from the press. Trump says he addressed election interference. “I thought it was best done in person,” Trump said. He says they spent a great deal of time talking about it. “He feels very strongly about it - and he has an interesting idea.” “The disagreements between our two countries are well-known and president Putin and I discussed them at length today,” Trump says. He says to address world problems the two countries are going to have to work together. “Even during the tensions of the Cold War, when the world looked much different than it does today, Russia and the US were able to maintain a strong dialogue.” “Our relationship has never been worse than it is now. However, that changed. As of about four hours ago.” Trump is now speaking. “We had direct, open, deeply productive dialogue. It went very well.” He commends Putin for how Russia hosted the World Cup and the national team’s performance at the tournament. Putin said Trump raised the issue of Russian meddling in the US election. “I had to repeat what I said earlier, including in personal meetings with the president, Russia never interfered and doesn’t plan to interfere in US domestic politics, including elections,” Putin said. He said if “any such material, if such things arise, we are ready to discuss them together.” “The United States could be more decisive in nudging Ukrainian leadership,” Putin says. “We agreed, me and president Trump, we agreed to put together a high-level working group” of Russia and and American businessmen, Putin says. Putin is discussing counterterrorism and cybersecurity. Putin said Russia and US interests don’t always “dovetail,” but “the overlapping interests abound.” He talks about Syria and how to get refugees back to their home and how the US and Russia have communicated about their intervention there. He said they are “glad” issues with North Korea “are starting to resolve.” The press conference is under way. Putin begins. He says the Cold War is a thing of the past. “Today both Russia and the United States face a whole new set of challenges.” Putin said in the negotiations they outlined “first steps for improving this relationship and to restore an acceptable level of trust”. There was just a skirmish in the press conference hall and a man was removed from the room. Security officials asked him to leave the room earlier, and he left peacefully, according to CNN’s Jim Acosta but then the man re-entered. He was then forcibly removed, carrying a hand-written sign. The man identified himself as a US journalist from The Nation, according to reporters who witnessed the altercation, but that has not been confirmed. Acosta said the sign said: “Nuclear weapons ban treaty”. The “two-minute” warning issued moments ago at the press briefing was ambitious. It’s been more than ten minutes since the two-minute warning. Reporters have gathered for the press conference and were just warned it will begin in two minutes. Trump, Putin and their aides gathered for lunch in the Hall of Mirrors, once the emperor’s throne room, following the one-on-one meeting. That meeting lasted more than two hours, though the White House allotted 1.5 hours for the meeting in its schedule for Monday. There was also a delay because Putin arrived late to his meeting with Trump. All of this has pushed back the press conference, which was scheduled to begin 40 minutes ago. Reporters in Helsinki are antsy: The Guardian’s Washington DC bureau chief, David Smith, is huddled with the press in Helsinki and the press conference delay is a good opportunity to read his report on the summit from this morning, if you missed it: A former US defense secretary under Barack Obama, Chuck Hagel, said he was worried because there was not a clear “strategic purpose” for the one-on-one meeting between Trump and Putin. “What is the point?” Hagel, a former republican senator, asked on Monday morning. “Let’s understand something: the interests of any nation are far bigger than any one leader,” Hagel told NPR on Monday morning. “The interests of America are not the interests that president Trump defines them to be, or he decides that they are the priority or specific interest, or thinks they are or says they are.” Hagel said he supports engagement with world powers but those meetings are “all about a strategic purpose.” “What is the point? Is this just a golf date – with another leader?” Hagel said. “This is not a transactional issue like a real estate deal or an Apprentice-like show business appearance. There has to be preparation.” When NPR asked Hagel what he expected to come out of this meeting, Hagel said: “I don’t know what has gone into it to start with. What was the point? The strategic purpose of going into it? He [Trump] went into it this very weakened because of a divided alliance that he actually perpetuated as well as a divided country.” Trump’s full quote after the one-on-one meeting: “I think it’s a good start. Very, very good start for everybody.” And more from the pool report: The Russian and American delegations were seated across the table – dressed with a white table cloth, wine glasses, and china – and sitting in complete silence when we entered. Putin sat directly across from Trump. Trump was flanked by Pompeo and his translator. White House pool reporter Annie Karni said Trump responded to one shouted question following his one-on-one meeting with Putin. Trump said the meeting was a “very good start,” per the pool report. Karni said a White House spokesperson would not confirm that the meeting lasted two hours and ten minutes, as others are reporting. CNN are showing footage of Trump and Putin sitting down for a very late lunch flanked by six aides each. As expected on Trump’s side were US ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman; US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo; White House chief of staff, John Kelly; national security adviser, John Bolton; and Russia expert and Trump adviser, Fiona Hill. Putin’s six aides included his spokesman Dmitry Petrov and foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. It’s just 4.25pm in Helsinki and the two leaders still haven’t had lunch, as the Putin-Trump one-to-one meeting goes into its third hour. White House pool reporter Tessa Berenson has this update: Another pool reporter Annie Karni added: At 4 pm, we were herded into a coat check area to clear the way for the exit of the President of Finland. He had been here to welcome the two visiting leaders — he welcomed Putin first, earlier today, and then Trump when he arrived. Now that he’s gone, we’re back on the patio awaiting lunch to start. The White House said lunch might be later and that it will let us know how long the one-on-one lasted. China has filed a complaint against the US at the World Trade Organization after Donald Trump’s threats to place tariffs on an additional $200bn (£150bn) worth of Chinese goods. The one-sentence announcement by the ministry of commerce comes less than a week after the US president called for a second round of tariffs on China, in retaliation for Chinese tariffs placed on American goods. On 6 July, the US imposed 25% tariffs on $34bn in Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to hit back with levies on the same amount of US exports to China. In response, the White House last week released a wide-ranging list of Chinese goods, from tobacco to pet food, worth $200bn it would target with a 10% tariffs. Beijing said it would “fight back as usual” and would file a complaint with the WTO. Trump said China and “our mutual friend President Xi” would be one of the key issues at his summit with Vladimir Putin. The Putin Trump tete-a-tete has been going on for almost two hours, an Finnish official told AP. It had been expected to last for 90 minutes at most. Extra time and penalties? There have been more anti-Trump and anti-Putin protests in Helsinki, with some dressed as Margaret Atwood-inspired handmaids demanding the release of members of Pussy Riot who were arrested on Sunday after invading the pitch at the World Cup final in Moscow. AP reports: Abortion-rights activists dressed up Monday in bulging bellies and Trump masks. Anti-fascist protesters carried signs with expletive-laden insults. Free traders, anti-war Ukrainians, environmentalists and rainbow flag-waving gay rights supporters all vied for attention from the world’s media. In a city proud to defend the right to protest, demonstrators were scattered about. Some stayed at barriers erected by police to try to register their complaints as the world leaders sped by in armor-plated vehicles for their summit at Finland’s presidential palace. Others marched by Helsinki landmarks, far away from the leaders’ gathering but in clear view of curious residents and tourists. At the city’s Senate Square, about 20 male “pregnant Trumps” and 20 women wearing pink gags railed against a Trump order reinstating what critics call a “global gag rule” that bans providing federal money to international family-planning groups that perform abortions or provide information about them. Another march that drew hundreds of people was a mishmash of messages some supporting German Chancellor Angela Merkel and some shouting “Fascists go home!” Some marchers questioned the legitimacy of Trump’s election victory since he lost the popular vote. Another sign read: “A woman’s place is in the Resistance.” “I don’t think the two people meeting today are going to care whether we are here or not, frankly,” said Helsinki protesters Tina Aspiala, 43. “It’s more of a global solidarity against a lot of things that are messed up, and I think that that’s why it’s worth coming out.” Some marchers had professionally designed banners while others scrawled slogans like “Not Welcome” onto homemade posters or warned of a looming apocalypse. On Sunday, 1,500 people marched through the city to promote human and sexual rights, democracy and environmental issues. Here’s what Putin wants to talk about, according to the Russian embassy in the US: “ways to normalise bilateral relations, as well as current international issues, primarily the situation in Ukraine, Syria and the Korean Peninsula, and the fight against terrorism.” None of these issues were mentioned by Trump in his opening remarks. . Michael McFaul, former US ambassador to Russia, was not impressed by Trump’s opening remarks to Putin. Reluctant body language is on show in a black and white image of Trump and Putin tweeted by White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders. The BBC’s Stuart Hughes spotted a cuff-tickling handshake. White House pool reporter Annie Karni, has more on what we’re waiting for. Since the one-on-one meeting between Trump and Putin started, the pool has been waiting in a non-air-conditioned, steamy conference room in the presidential palace on the first floor. On the menu for lunch is hot soup. We have a view of lots of people walking right by the palace on the opposite side of this narrow street. At 3:16 pm local time (1.16pm BST) we are gathering to go up to another photocall before the summit lunch - an extended bilateral meeting involving Trump and Putin and their aides Attending the bilateral with Trump will be US ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman; US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo; White House chief of staff, John Kelly; national security adviser, John Bolton; Russia expert and Trump adviser, Fiona Hill; and Marina Gross, an interpreter. The White House has confirmed that Putin and Trump will hold another bilateral meeting with more aides present after their tete-a-tete. There will also be a joint press conference. The joint press conference had been due to take place at around 4.50pm local time, (2.50pm BST). There has been no word on whether this timetable has slipped after the delay to the start of the summit. Donald Trump has dealt a fresh blow to hopes that he will confront the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, over election interference as they met on Monday, blaming his own country rather than Moscow for poor diplomatic relations. Apparently dismissing the cold war, when the superpowers stood on the brink of all-out nuclear war, the US president wrote on Twitter: “Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” Trump made the startling claim ahead of his first, high-risk summit with Putin in Helsinki, Finland. Not for the first time in his long career, Putin arrived later than expected, forcing his counterpart to wait. The Russian leader touched down just after 1pm local time, even though the official greeting with Trump at the Finnish presidential palace had been scheduled for 1.10pm. Trump and Putin came face to face at the presidential palace in Helsinki around 50 minutes later than scheduled and both made brief remarks before the media. Sky’s Mark Stone spotted an interesting Trump wink amidst the awkward body language. Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump are holding a one-to-one meeting in Helsinki after posing for a tense photocall. The two men shook hands for only three seconds. In opening remarks to Putin, Trump said he planned to discuss trade, military, missiles and China. He did not mention Russian meddling in the US election, Ukraine, Syria, Nato or Salisbury poisoning. But he congratulate Putin on a successful World Cup. “Getting along with Russia is a good thing,” Trump said after admitting the US and Russia have “not been getting along very well for the last number of years”. He added: “I really think the world wants to see us get along. We are the two great nuclear powers.” Both Putin and Trump delayed their arrival to the summit in what was widely interpreted as diplomatic gamesmanship. Putin’s plane arrived in Helsinki almost an hour after the summit was due to begin. Trump then delayed his arrival at the Presidential Palace where the talks are taking place. In a pre-summit tweet Trump said US-Russia relations have “never been worse”. He went on to blame the “rigged witch hunt” into Russian meddling in the US election. Russia’s foreign ministry said it agreed with that assessment. In another pre-summit tweet Trump hailed last week’s strained meeting with Nato as a success. He said: “We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media. NATO is now strong &amp; rich!” Trump and Putin are currently participating in their one-to-one meeting with only translators in the room, according to the White House pool reporter. Here’s a transcript of what Trump said to Putin: First of all Mr President I’d like to congratulate you on a really great World Cup. One of the best ever from what everybody tells me and also for your team, itself, doing so well. I watched quite a bit and in the United States we call it soccer and I watched quite a bit of it and I watched the entire final and the semi-finals and they were really spectacular games, but it was beautifully done so congratulations on that. Most importantly we have a lot of good things to talk about ... we have discussions on everything from trade to military, to missiles, to nuclear, to China, we’ll be talking a little bit about China – our mutual friend President Xi. I think we have great opportunities together as two countries that frankly we have not been getting along very well for the last number of years. I’ve been here not too long but it is getting close to two years, but I think we will end up having an extraordinary relationship. I’ve been saying, and I’m sure you’ve heard, over the years ... that getting along with Russia is a good thing not a bad thing. I really think the world wants to see us get along. We are the two great nuclear powers. We have 90% of the nuclear – and that’s not a good thing it’s a bad thing. I think we can hopefully do something about that because it is not a positive force it is a negative force so we’ll be talking about that among other things. And with that the world awaits and I look forward to our personal discussion which I think begins now and then we are going to meet our whole team. You have quite a few representatives as I do. We all have a lot of questions and hopefully, we will come up with answers most importantly. It is great to be with you. Thank you everybody. Note what Trump didn’t list in topics for discussion. There was no mention of Russian meddling in the US election, Syria, North Korea, novichoik, Nato, or Ukraine. Putin and Trump close with a handshake that lasted about three seconds. Both men looked tense, they didn’t smile much. Trump and Putin are posing for the cameras at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki. Putin says it is a pleasure to meet Trump. Trump congratulates Putin on the World Cup and on Russia’s performance in the tournament. “I watched quite a bit of it ... it was beautifully done,” Trump says. He says we have a lot of good things to talk about, from trade to China and “our mutual friend Presidential Xi.” We have great opportunities together, we have not been getting along for years, Trump adds. Getting along is a good thing, Trump says. The world wants to see us getting along, he adds. We have 90% of the world’s nuclear weapons and that is not a good thing, Trump says. AP sets out what is due to happen next: President Donald Trump has arrived at Finland’s Presidential Palace for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin arrived minutes earlier at the palace in Helsinki for the summit, which consists of a one-on-one meeting and a larger working lunch, and will conclude with a joint news conference. Monday’s meeting is being closely watched on both sides of the Atlantic, coming days after the US Justice Department indicted 12 Russian military intelligence officers for their role in hacking Democratic entities during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump says he hopes for better relations with the Russian leader. He faces bipartisan scepticism in Washington that his desire for warming ties is displacing concerns over Russia’s annexation of Crimea and other destabilizing actions. Trump arrived at the presidential palace at 1.57pm local time almost an hour after the summit was due to begin. Both Trump and Putin are in the building. TV footage shows images of Trump’s motorcade, including the famous “beast” limo, is on the way to the presidential palace where the summit will take place. The motorcade left at 1.37pm local time (11.37pm BST) according to White House pool reporter Annie Karni. Trump is reported to be on his way to the presidential palace. Mark Knoller, from CBS, sets out what to expect next. Andrew Roth has some theories of the power games currently being played. Putin’s motorcade has arrived late at the presidential palace in Helsinki for the summit. There’s been no sign yet of Trump. He now appears to be trying to make Putin wait. There’s lots of this macho stuff: Putin’s limo is slightly bigger than Trump’s. Expect more. Russia’s foreign ministry says it agrees with Trump’s dire assessment that US-Russia relations have never been worse. As noted earlier, Trump’s view echoes the Kremlin claim that the US is to blame for the deterioration in the relationship. White House pool reporter Annie Karni, confirms that Trump has delayed leaving the Hilton Helsinki Kalastajatorppa, en route to the Presidential Palace. He was due to depart at 12.40 local time (10.40 BST). The hold up appears to be on Putin’s end as he has just this moment landed in Helsinki. There has been no response from Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders when she was asked about the delay. Putin briskly stepped off his plane, before being greeted on the tarmac. He took of his jacket and waved for the cameras. And then got into his huge new limo. The Washington Post’s Philip Rucker reminds us that the summit was due to start at 1pm local time (11am BST). The diplomatic gamesmanship continues. Vladimir Putin’s plane has touched down in the Helsinki almost an hour late. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman says he hopes the summit will be a “baby step” toward fixing exceptionally bad US-Russian relations, AP reports. Ahead of Monday’s meeting, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told broadcaster RT that the men had no strict agenda but recognize their “special responsibility” for global stability. He said European countries shouldn’t be worried about a possible US-Russian rapprochement or decisions about Europe made “over the heads of Europeans.” Peskov said the Russian leader respects Trump’s “America first” stance because Putin puts Russia first, but said the only way to make progress at the summit is if both sides are open to finding areas of mutual benefit. Russian officials say Putin is expected to reiterate denials of meddling in the 2016 US presidential campaign. The United States is not the only side complaining about cyberattacks ahead of Monday’s summit. Vladimir Putin told law enforcement officials on Sunday evening that the country had seen a sharp rise in cyberattacks during the World Cup as he thanked Russian law enforcement in person for providing security during the tournament. “Almost 25 million cyberattacks and other situations of criminal impact on the Russian information infrastructure associated with the organization of the World Cup were neutralized during the championship,” Putin said In Moscow on Sunday evening. The remarks were reported on Monday morning. Russian officials have pushed the idea of a joint agreement on cybersecurity with the United States for several years. Putin will likely use that fact as a defence when Trump asks about Russia’s election meddling during the 2016 elections, which he said he would “certainly” do in a television interview. Russia would like an agreement on “informational security,” and includes limits on content that may be objectionable to governments. That may permit countries to eliminate content from social media sites like Facebook or Twitter that call for protests. The United States has traditionally defined the issue more closely as cybersecurity, which concerns the use of hacking technology but not content on social media. Putin’s trip to Helsinki marks the first foreign trip for the Russian president’s new Cortege limousine, which was unveiled with great fanfare at his inauguration in May. The Kremlin pool reporter for Komsomolskaya Pravda, Dmitry Smirnov, snapped a picture of the limousine at Helsinki’s airport where Putin is expected to land more than 45 minutes late. The Kremlin pool arrived earlier in a separate plan and have some time on their hands. At Putin’s inauguration, the limousine drove him about 200m from the Kremlin’s Senate Building to the Andreevsky Hall. Monday’s route will be slightly more arduous, usually about a 25-minute ride to the city’s Presidential Palace where he will meet one-on-one with Trump. He has also shown off the limousine to the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed. The domestically produced luxury car was a point of pride for Putin, who used a Mercedes until this year. The state news agency Sputnik wrote that the car was the first domestically produced limousine for a head of state since Mikhail Gorbachev’s Zil-41052 in 1985. Putin’s lateness is being interpreted as diplomatic gamesmanship. Speaking to CNN while we still wait for Putin’s plane to land in Helsinki, Thomas Pickering, former US ambassador to the UN, said: Obviously the lateness is something he could have avoided, so it has some intent. That intent obviously is in some ways to level the playing field of publicity about this meeting so that it isn’t all Trump, whatever he’s saying. Newspaper billboards in Helsinki attack the record of both Putin and Trump on free speech. Huff Post UK reports: Helsingin Sanomat, one of the country’s top news outlets, unveiled nearly 300 billboards calling out the leaders’ respective records of rocky relations with the media. The billboards were placed along the leaders’ route to the summit. Aside from the welcome billboard which reads “Mr. President, Welcome to the Land of Free Press,” most of the others feature headlines published in the newspaper over the years, according to a press release. “The headlines highlight the presidents’ turbulent relations with the media and were published between the years 2000 and 2018,” the statement said. Editor-in-chief Kaius Nieme also explained that the banners are intended as a display of support for “colleagues who have to fight in ever toughening circumstances on a daily basis both in the U.S. and Russia,” noting that both countries sit pretty far down on the 2018 World Press Freedom Index. Russia is ranked 148 and the U.S. sits at 45. Finland is ranked fourth. Putin already has the edge in pre-summit posturing by keeping Trump waiting. His plane to Helsinki is reported to be running late. European Council president Donald Tusk has suggested that Trump is spreading fake news by telling CBS that the European Union is a foe of the US. Trump is confident of getting on with Putin, he told Piers Morgan for ITV’s Good Morning Britain on board air force one. Trump accepted that Putin “probably is” a ruthless person, but couldn’t tell yet. Good Morning Britain quoted him saying: “I don’t know him… I met him a couple of times… I think we could probably get along very well” Russia’s foreign ministry liked Trump’s tweeted about the dire state of US-Russian relations, notes Amie Ferris-Rotman from the Washington Post. Her paper explains that Trump’s tweet echoes Putin’s view that the US — not Russia — is to blame for the poor state of relations between the two countries: Trump is facing immense pressure to aggressively confront Putin over Russia’s election interference, especially after the Justice Department indicted 12 Russian intelligence officials last Friday and charged them with hacking and stealing Democratic emails, as part of a broad subterfuge operation that U.S. intelligence agencies believe was ordered by Putin to help elect Trump. But Trump’s comments Monday were in sync with the argument Putin and his government have long made, which is that the policies of the Obama administration — as well as the investigation into election interference, which Putin repeatedly has denied — inflamed tensions between the to nuclear superpowers. Trump — who has been reticent to criticize Putin and has said he admires the Russian autocrat’s leadership style and strongman image — will meet with Putin at 1 p.m. here at the Presidential Palace, a neoclassical residence facing Helsinki’s heavily touristed Baltic Sea waterfront. The White House has issued a transcript of Trump’s remarks about last week’s Nato summit during his breakfast meeting in Helsinki with his Finnish counterpart. It quotes him saying: Nato has, I think, never been stronger. And it was really – it was a little bit tough at the beginning, and it turned out to be love. It really was a great meeting that we had and brought everybody together, and, I think, very worthwhile ... We had a fantastic meeting a few days ago; some of you were there. It was a very successful meeting. I think Nato has never been more together. People are now agreeing to pay, and we were having a lot of problem with a lot of people not paying, as the President will tell you. And they’re paying, and they’re paying more rapidly. And I think Nato has probably never been stronger than it is today. So we had a fantastic meeting, and now we’re capping it with being in Finland. And the hospitality has been fantastic. Hillary Clinton has questioned Trump’s loyalty to the US in a barbed tweet ahead of the summit. Tweeting after the World Cup final when Putin oversaw a thrilling final between France and Croatia, she said: “Great World Cup. Question for President Trump as he meets Putin: Do you know which team you play for?” One of Putin’s most vocal opponents, Garry Kasparov, says Trump has already given in to Russia by agreeing to the summit. Greenpeace activists have attached a banner about global warning on Helsinki’s Kallio Church to coincide with the summit. “Warm out hearts not our planet”, the banner pleaded. Protesters came out on Sunday to attack both Trump and Putin before the summit. “Not welcome,” read one sign, held by Hemmo Siponen, showing a cartoon of Trump and Putin embracing. “Fuck you both,” read another carried by two young women. “It doesn’t feel good to have them here,” said Anna Bruun, a civil servant who said she was opposed to “great power politics” playing out in her home city. Trump has left the Mäntyniemi Residence, where he had a breakfast meeting with the President of Finland, Sauli Niinistö. TV footage showed Trump waving to reporters as he left. Next up is the one-to-one meeting with Vladimir Putin. Ahead of the Helsinki summit, the European council president, Donald Tusk, has warned that it is the responsibility of the major powers to uphold rules-based order, not destroy it and pave the way to war. Speaking at an EU-China summit in Beijing, Tusk said: “Today, on the same day as Europe meets China in Beijing, American President Trump and Russian President Putin will talk in Helsinki, we are all aware of the fact that the architecture of the world is changing before our very eyes. And it is our common responsibility to make it a change for the better. Let us remember, here in Beijing, and over there, in Helsinki, that the world we were building for decades, sometimes through disputes, has brought about peace for Europe, the development of China, and the end of the Cold War between the East and the West.” “It is a common duty of Europe and China, America and Russia, not to destroy this order, but to improve it. Not to start trade wars, which turned into hot conflicts so often in our history, but to bravely and responsibly reform the rules-based international order.” White House reporter Annie Karni reports from the Hilton Kalastajatorppa in Helsinki: First stop for the president and the first lady today was the Mäntyniemi Residence, for an official greeting by the President of Finland, Sauli Niinistö, and the First Lady of Finland, Jenni Haukio, followed by a breakfast. After arriving at the residence they were given what seemed like short tour of the grounds, by Niinistö and the First Lady of Finland. At a breakfast meeting Trump said: “Nato has, I think, never been stronger. It was a little bit tough at the beginning, but it turned out to be love. I appreciated your support.” A reporter asked what was his message to Putin? Trump replied: “We’ll see him a little while....We’ll do just fine.” On why he picked Helsinki for the summit: “We think Finland’s a great country. We had a fantastic meeting a few days ago, some of you were there, it was a very successful meeting. Nato has never been more together. People are now agreeing to pay. We were having a lot of problems with a lot people not paying, as the president will tell you...They’re paying more rapidly. And it’s probably never been stronger than it is today. We had a fantastic meeting and now we’re capping it with being in Finland. And the hospitality has been fantastic.” Trump ignored this question: “Will you tell President Putin that election meddling is a red line?” Trump is having breakfast with the president of Finland where he described the Nato summit as “tough” at first “but it turned out to be love”. He has also been tweeting, notably blaming Mueller rather than Russian meddling: “Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!” Trump meets Putin at 11.20am UK time with handshakes and photos expected. Trump and Putin will hold joint press conference at 2.50pm UK time. Trump leaves Finland at 4.55pm UK time. President Donald Trump has arrived in Helsinki for his high-stakes summit with Vladimir Putin and has already fired off a series of bombastic tweets. He said America’s relationship with Russia has never been worse thanks to “many years of US foolishness and stupidity” and the current investigation into Russian meddling in the US election, which he again dismissed as a “rigged witch hunt”. Trump also claimed his predecessor Barack Obama “did nothing” about Russian meddling in the election. And in another tweet he claimed his highly strained meeting with Nato last week was a “great summit”. This comes just hours after he described the European Union as a “foe”. Note the omission of other keys such as Ukraine, the Salisbury poisoning, Iran, North Korea, and Syria, and the glossing over of Friday’s charges against 12 Russian agents by the US justice department over Kremlin meddling in Trump’s election. Ahead of his European trip last week, Trump said his meeting with Putin would be the easy bit in a schedule that involved a Nato meeting and a visit to the UK “in turmoil” after cabinet resignations over Brexit. Analysts reckon it will be anything but easy whatever Trump says. Simon Tisdall previews today’s Helsinki meeting: Within hours of arriving in Europe, Donald Trump was busy insulting America’s closest friends and threatening to dismember Nato. He publicly humiliated Theresa May and did his importunate best to force regime change in Westminster, before halfheartedly apologising. Now he takes his ugly brand of rogue-male politics to Helsinki for a meeting with his best buddy, prominent campaign supporter and fellow narcissist, Russia’s Vladimir Putin. This is an ominous, possibly watershed moment for Europe, full of fear and loathing. The Guardian’s editorial predicts that Putin will emerge the winner amid concern about what the result of the summit will mean for the rest of the world. Putin brings experience, preparation, ruthless discipline and actual goals: he is the poker ace facing a man who has mastered only beggar-my-neighbour. So any substantive discussions between the men may be more worrying than the omissions. (Only Mr Trump could make the prospect of “surprising” outcomes in Helsinki sound quite so ominous.) Their shared hostility to Nato, the EU and established US alliances is alarming. And we do not know why Mr Trump wants this meeting, beyond enjoying the spotlight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2014/mar/12/russian-nuclear-power-uk-gas-ukraine-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-12T17:32:36Z","webTitle":"Russian nuclear power in the UK?

We might want to think about that","bodyText":"Clearly there is something jarring about the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) boasting about its positive negotiations with the Russians over building a nuclear power station in Britain just as a summit is due to begin in London about what sanctions can be taken against Moscow over its involvement in the Crimea. If Vladimir Putin is threatening to once again use energy as a political weapon in the Ukraine by cutting off the country's gas exports, then this is a bad moment to talk about state-owned Rosatom taking a critical stake in UK power infrastructure through the construction of an atomic plant. Western Europe is already 30% (and in past years 50%) dependent on Russian gas, while London now hosts the headquarters of Gazprom's global gas trading operation. But surely Britain does not want to open itself up to further dependence on Moscow by allowing its electricity to be generated by Rosatom? Well, few people five years back would have believed state-owned Chinese firms would form key partners in the project to commission the UK's first new nuclear plant in 27 years at Hinkley Point in Somerset, and yet that is now settled. So why not the Russians too, the little question of sanctions aside? After all, Rosatom has already signed a memorandum of understanding with the Decc and with nuclear and aerospace-contractor Rolls Royce. There clearly could be penalties imposed on Russia over the Crimea crisis, but the political stand-off between Moscow and Washington can be expected to blow over before too long. This would still leave the question as to whether Britain's energy needs should be met from a country which has in 2006 and 2009 halted gas supplies to the Ukraine for political as well as commercial reasons. In fact, only around 1%-2% of Britain's gas imports currently come from Siberia, while one Russian nuclear power plant would provide perhaps 5% or 6% of the country's electricity needs. So the dependence side of the argument against Russia is very limited, although there have been reservations about giving even China access to the kind of national IT systems power systems now need. A much more critical issue would be safety, as it should be with China. Both countries have experience operating nuclear power stations, although their safety regulations are generally accepted to be well behind the west. In particular there is a marked lack of openness and transparency around atomic power in China and Russia, plus no history of independent regulators standing at arms length to the state. This is one of the reasons why China General Nuclear Power Corporation is a junior partner at Hinkley Point, with the main equity holder and planned operator being EDF of France. For China or Russia to build one of its own self-designed reactors there would have to be a very long and detailed assessment by the Office for Nuclear Regulation and the Environment Agency. But the current biggest roadblock to any new nuclear facilities is financial. China and perhaps Russia may be willing to sink billions of pounds into Britain's nuclear industry as a showcase for exports to the rest of the world, but even they will need help from the UK state like that being offered at Hinkley. The European commission may yet rule that the Decc \"strike price\" of £89.50 per megawatt hour is an illegal subsidy, which would leave any wider new nuclear programme by the Russians or anyone else dead in the water."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/live/2016/mar/23/pound-brexit-fears-volatility-stock-markets-william-hill-sports-direct-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-23T17:50:18Z","webTitle":"Pound hits two year low on Brexit fears - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/mar/23/pound-brexit-fears-volatility-stock-markets-william-hill-sports-direct-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2016/mar/23/pound-brexit-fears-volatility-stock-markets-william-hill-sports-direct-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Pound hits two year low on Brexit fears - as it happened","bodyText":"As the long weekend approaches, stock markets had little inspiration to move in either direction so ended up virtually unchanged, with a couple of exceptions. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: The FTSE close on Wednesday replicated the atmosphere on trading floors across Europe as London’s leading index finished flat on the day. With little in the way of corporate news or economic data to guide them, most investors decided to stay away, possibly eager not to get left exposed ahead of the long Easter weekend. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 6.37 points or 0.1% Germany’s Dax edged up 0.33% to 10,022.93 France’s Cac dipped 0.18% to 4423.98 Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 1.26% to 18,462.88 Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.72% at 8927.1 In Greece, the Athens market added 1.29% to 551.31 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 33 points or 0.19% lower. Meanwhile with rising US crude inventories again, Brent is down 2.5% at $40.74 a barrel. On that note, it’s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. The pound continued to come under pressure on growing uncertainty over the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union. A new poll showed the lead of the Remain campaign slipping, helping push sterling to a one month low against the euro and down more than a cent at $1.4094. The US currency was also supported by a number of hawkish comments from members of the Federal Reserve, who suggested rate rises were still on the cards - perhaps even in April - despite the current market volatility. Low oil prices have failed to give the global economy a lift and could cause serious problems, suggest IMF economists in a new blog post: Oil prices have been persistently low for well over a year and a half now, but as the April 2016 World Economic Outlook will document, the widely anticipated “shot in the arm” for the global economy has yet to materialize. We argue that, paradoxically, global benefits from low prices will likely appear only after prices have recovered somewhat and advanced economies have made more progress surmounting the current low interest rate environment.... Persistently low oil prices complicate the conduct of monetary policy, risking further inroads by unanchored inflation expectations. What is more, the current episode of historically low oil prices could ignite a variety of dislocations including corporate and sovereign defaults, dislocations that can feed back into already jittery financial markets. The possibility of such negative feedback loops makes demand support by the global community– along with a range of country-specific structural and financial-sector reforms–all the more urgent. After the select committee meeting with EDF on a new nuclear plant at Hinckley Point, one of its MPs James Heappey has called on the French government to formally confirm the timetable for them to refinance the business. Heappey said: This morning’s evidence session was hugely frustrating. EDF CEO Vincent de Rivaz opened by saying ‘categorically’ that Hinkley C would go ahead and seeming to confirm that a final investment decision would come in ‘early May’. But when pressed to confirm that date, he refused to do so. It is clear from his responses to our questions that despite EDF’s undoubted commitment to Hinkley, the final decision on the project is entirely in the hands of President Hollande and the French Government. Whatever EDF might want to do, they just don’t have the cash to do this unless the French Government agree to their re-capitalisation. EDF clearly expect this to be agreed by May but the UK Government must now seek further assurances from Paris that this timeline is realistic. Here is our report on the committee hearing: Crude prices, which have been supported by hopes that a meeting of producers next month can agree to freeze output to cope with the supply glut, have slipped back after new US inventory figures. US crude inventories rose by a much larger than forecast 9.4m barrels last week, more than three times higher than expected. Refineries cut output and imports jumped, adding to the crude stocks. But gasoline stocks fell by 4.6m barrels compared to expectations of a 1.5m decline. And crude stocks at the Cushing delivery hub in Oklahoma dropped by 1.26m barrels, the first fall in seven weeks. The news has helped send Brent crude down 2.5% to $40.73 a barrel. Over in the US , and new home sales rose 2% in February after a 7% fall in the previous month. But this was lower than the expected 3% rise, and sales fell in three of the main regions, with only the West seeing an increase, which took some of the gloss off the figures. February sales rose to an annual rate of 512,000 compared to 502,000 in the previous month. The January figure was revised upwards from 494,000. On Wall Street, markets have taken the data in their stride, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down just 20 points. Here’s the opinion poll that is hitting sterling: The polling was taken last week, on 16 March. Sterling has just hit its lowest level against a basket of other currencies in more than two years. Thats’s via Reuters, who are citing data from the Bank of England. Back to the other story of the morning... worries about the UK EU referendum. The pound is continuing to drop today, now down almost one cent against the US dollar at $1.4113. This latest weakness is triggered by a new telephone poll from Comres, just released, which shows the Remain campaign with 48% of support, and Leave on 41%. That’s the narrowest lead since the general election of May 2015, according to Reuters. That follows the spike in sterling volatility we covered this morning, driven by new worries about Brexit. There’s drama in the UK courts today Tom Hayes, the only person jailed in the UK for conspiring to rig the Libor rate, has been ordered to pay $1.25m, or £878k, after a ‘proceeds of crime’ hearing. It’s likely that Hayes, and wife Sarah, will now be forced to sell their house in Surrey. Over at Westminster magistrates court, the alleged “flash crash trader” Navinder Singh Sarao has been told he can be extradited to the US. Sarao is accused of causing market turmoil on Wall Street in 2010, which briefly wiped 1,000 points off the Dow Jones industrial average. From court, Rob Davies has the details: District judge Quentin Purdy at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday ruled that Sarao’s alleged actions constituted a crime in the UK. The ruling means Sarao, 37, can be sent to the US to answer 22 counts of wire fraud, commodities fraud and market manipulation carrying a maximum sentence of 380 years’ imprisonment. Sarao’s lawyer Richard Egan said: “We’re very disappointed. We definitely will be appealing. We think we’ve got a strong argument.” Energy and climate change committee member James Heappey shares our view of today’s hearing: Good news for fans of British Home Stores. The UK retailer has been rescued from closure, after its creditors voted in favour of the department store chain’s survival plan. My colleague Graham Ruddick has the details: Landlords, suppliers and other creditors approved the 88-year-old retailer’s company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency procedure, at a vital meeting in a hotel in west London on Wednesday. The approval of the CVA secures the short-term future of BHS’s 10,000 staff and 164 stores. However, the company still needs to restructure its pension scheme, which has a deficit of £571m and is likely to enter the Pension Protection Fund, and raise £100m so it can continue trading and fund a turnaround plan that includes modernising its shops and product range. The CVA involves landlords accepting sharp cuts to the rent on 87 of BHS’s 164 shops. As many as 40 of these shops could close in the next few months if a deal on the size of the rent reduction cannot be reached with property owners. Greenpeace chief scientist Doug Parr, who pointed to flaws in the Hinkley C project this morning, has issued a statement heavily criticising the situation: “This morning the committee began to come to terms with the fact that the UK’s energy policy has been annexed by EDF. It became very clear that Hinkley is dependant on the French state and the enthusiasm of the French and Chinese nuclear industries. This has distorted our national infrastructure planning, and has led to the UK government undermining our nascent but booming renewable energy businesses and scaring off investment. It is unconscionable that in reality the decisions pending about the future of our energy system and whether the UK meet our future carbon targets are in the hands of the French Economy Minister.” What have we just learned about Britain’s biggest nuclear power project in decades? 1) EDF are still committed. Despite the shock resignation of its CFO, and concerns over its own finances, France’s energy company is still planning to build Britain a new nuclear power station at Hinkley. CEO Vincent de Rivaz insists that the controversial project is a good deal for all sides, and can be delivered. In a prepared statement, he said: I will start by saying, clearly and categorically, that Hinkley Point C will go ahead. That’s good news for the UK. It has been a long road. The project has successfully passed a huge number of regulatory, commercial and operational milestones. EDF has already invested £2.4bn, and is spending another £55m per month. 2) But the project is in the French government’s hands, rather than MPs in Westminster. De Rivaz consistently failed to commit to signing a final investment decision in May. Why? Because he’s waiting for French ministers to agree a bailout for the company. Emmanuel Macron, the French economy minister, is effectively deciding whether Britain embarks on the Hinkley project. Conservative MP James Heappey summed the situation up, in this exchange. If the French government doesn’t commit to that recapitalisation [of EDF], you can’t build us a power station because you’ve not got the cash. 3) Confidence isn’t enough. The committee shone a light on the nuclear industry’s black spots - plants are very difficult to build safely, and expensive to decommission afterwards. Committee chair Angus MacNeil pointed to other projects where executive confidence has been followed by problems on the ground. France’s troubled Flamanville nuclear project loomed over today’s session, given the problems with its reactor vessel. De Rivaz insisted that lessons have been learned, but that’s easier to say than prove..... 4) The climax is looming. While uranium has a half-life of 4.468bn years, the Hinkley C drama could be intensifying in just a few weeks. If EDF doesn’t sign on the dotted line to build Hinkley in early May, then the whole future of the project will be in serious doubt. That would please many campaigners - such as the three experts who told MPs this morning that Hinkley is a bad deal and best abandoned. But I suspect it would prove career-limiting for de Rivaz. Our environment editor Damian Carrington sums up today’s hearing: The session ends with chairman Angus MacNeil saying the committee has heard EDF’s confidence about Hinkley “loud and clear.” But they want to see action – a final investment decision on Hinkley by early May. So it that doesn’t happen, and the Hinkley project isn’t in the Queens speech on May 18, Vincent de Rivaz and colleagues could be hauled back to parliament to explain themselves. The committee turn to China’s Taishan nuclear power station, which is using similar technology as Hinkey C. Q: When will Taishan be up and running? China General Nuclear’s Zhu Minhong says it will definitely start operations in 2017. Q: So why is it moving so much faster than Hinkley? EDF’s Humphrey Cadoux-Hudson says Taishan has benefitted from some of the lessons learned at France’s Flamanville. The committee are concerned about problems at the Flamanville nuclear power plant in France - will they affect Hinkley? Humphrey Cadoux-Hudson, managing director for Nuclear New Build at EDF, says that engineers are already addressing concerns about Flamanville. Lessons can be learned for Hinkley. [Background: back in April, the French nuclear regulator discovered flawed steel in EDF’s reactor in Flamanville] The Hinkley reactor pressure vessel is not made yet, so chances can be made if necessary, Cadoux-Hudson adds. Q: Has a power station similar to Hinkley C been build before? Cadoux-Hudson says not; Hinkley has taken lessons from Flamanville, and also from Japan’s Fukushima. Labour’s Matthew Pennycook MP isn’t impressed with what he’s hearing this morning. He tells the energy chiefs that: If this power station was fuelled on confidence and passion it would be up and running, but it’s not. The committee ask Zhu Minhong of China General Nuclear, EDF’s partner in the project, when he expects Hinkley to be signed off. Zhu explains that CGN are happy to be involved in Hinkley, concluding that: We are confident to say that this project will go ahead. Angus MacNeil, the committee chairman, nails it: Isn’t the future of Hinkley Point C in the hands of the French government? De Rivaz says the project is in “good hands” (sparking some tittering in the committee room). He argues that the French government should be closely involved, as he is EDF’s major shareholder. Conservative MP James Heappey moves in for the kill. Heappey tells Vincent de Rivaz that he knows why EDF can’t give a categorical pledge to make the final investment decision in early May. It’s because the French government is set to decide in early May on whether to recapitalise EDF. Heappey says: If the French government doesn’t commit to that recapitalisation, you can’t build us a power station because you’ve not got the cash. De Rivaz repeats that he is fully confidence that the project will go ahead. Heappey says it is “extraordinary”, given that confidence, that EDF won’t commit to make the final investment decision in early May. It doesn’t make sense to anyone, he adds. Here’s our story about the possible recapitalisation of EDF: The committee are concerned about the cost of (eventually) decommissioning Hinkley Point C. Is enough money being put aside? De Rivaz says this cost is fully recognised in the contract -- it’s “an example of us and the UK government behaving in a responsible way”. But MPs point out that the cost of cleaning up previous projects, such as Windscale/Sellafield has been massively higher than expected. We’re in as different world today, De Rivaz insists. “What has been done badly in the past will not be done badly again” Q: How much is Hinkley Point C actually going to cost? EDF say £18bn, but other estimates say £24.5bn De Rivaz says the construction cost is £18bn. The larger figure comes from the European Union, and relates to another way by which the project could have been financed. Q: It’s disappointing that you can’t tell us more about the discussions with the French government about new financial support for EDF. Can you assure us that they won’t be passed onto UK taxpayers in some way? De Rivaz says various options are being discussed, including: raising more capital, paying dividends in shares rather than cash selling non-core assets. None of them would impact the UK taxpayer, he promises. Q: Did EDF’s chief finance officer resign over the Hinkley project? De Rivaz declines to comment on the reasons for Thomas Piquemal’s shock resignation in early March. But he insists that the company’s top executives support the project. Q: Your shares fell 6% when your CFO resigned; won’t the impact be terrible if you don’t meet the early May deadline? The project will go ahead, de Rivaz insists. De Rivaz insists that EDF is being responsible by sorting out its finances before making the ‘final investment decision’ on Hinkley. MPs don’t seem too impressed, though. The energy and climate change committee want to know what’s holding EDF back from a final decision on the Hinkley project. De Rivaz points says the fall in the oil price has put added strain on its finances, so it is in talks with the French government (its major shareholder) to finding a solution to these challenges. We are a great company, 70 years old, finding ways to tackle these challenges he continues. Q: Given EDF’s confidence, when will it actually take the final investment decision to build Hinkley? It will be taken very soon, insists CEO Vincent de Rivaz. Q: When exactly? The French minister of economy and finance, Mr Macron, said early May. Q: If there is no decision by 15th May, the UK government and public should be worried? No-one should be worried about our commitment to a project in which we have spent more than £2bn. Q: So, which day? I don’t want to give a precise day, de Rivaz insists... We cannot be more commited and more confident than we are. But the committee remain unconvinced -- they want a firmer commitment, and are going to ink in 15 May are their own deadline. The committee question Vincent de Rivaz’s claim that Hinkley Point C is a good deal for the British public. Q: We’ve heard that Hinkley is only economically fair if oil was $230 per barrel [it’s $40 today], so how can it be fair to customers? De Rivaz replies that the project is seen as too financially risky in France, and too expensive in the UK, so on balance it is probably fair. Greenpeace’s Doug Parr (who testified earlier) isn’t convinced. The EDF CEO also points out that his company are taking the risks to build the plant. UK consumers will pay nothing until electricity is produced in 2025, he adds. EDF chief executive Vincent de Rivaz has declared that the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant will proceed, despite concerns about the project. He’s reading a statement to the energy and climate change committee now, which begins I will start by saying, clearly and catagorically, that Hinkley Point C will go ahead. That’s good news for the UK. It has been a long road. The project has successfully passed a huge number of regulatory, commercial and operational milestones. De Rivas says EDF has the expertise needed, and a team and supply chain set up to build Hinkley C “on time and on budget”. He says that EDF is confident that the project will deliver the highest standards of safety, and has “the strong support of the UK and French governments”. De Rivas also touches on those concerns about the price of the project, saying: We are confident and proud to be able to deliver this project, as it meets the UK’s need for reliable, affordable, low-carbon electricity. It is a fair deal - fair for customers, fair for investors. A group of energy experts have told UK Parliament’s energy and climate change committee today that the Hinkley Point C nuclear project is very bad value for money, and should be scrapped. The future of the new nuclear power plant was thrown into doubt last month when the finance chief of EDF, the state-controlled French energy company, resigned. And Simon Taylor, lecturer in finance at Cambridge University, said, the best hope for most people concerned is that the French government decides to “pull the plug” on the deal. It would preserve the rest of the nuclear options in the UK, as it would not cast any doubt on the UK’s underlying commitment But if the UK cancels the project it could jeapodise all the other projects in the pipeline. Douglas Parr of Greenpeace told MPs that such a project could only be built by a huge slab of public money, and political will. Parr also heavily criticised the project, arguing that the cost of solar power and energy storage will both fall drastically in the next couple of decades, meaning Britain will be overpaying for Hinkley. Peter Atherton of investment bank Jefferies predicted that Hinkley should prove highly profitable to EDF, thanks to the contract agreed with the UK government. They’ve got a great, great deal, if they can build it on time and on budget.....Once it’s operational, that power station is going to be gold. The committee will hear from EDF shortly.... The chairman of Lloyds of London has warned that Brexit would hurt its business. John Nelson told Reuters this morning that: “About 90 percent of our capital and business comes from outside the UK,” “It would diminish our attraction as a market to invest in if we were not part of the EU.” Lloyds is already finding conditions tougher - it posted a 30% drop in pre-tax profits this morning, partly due to record low interest rates cutting returns on its assets. Sports Direct has confirmed to the City this morning that its profits this year will be at the bottom end of the guidance issued in January. The announcement came a day after The Times published an interview with founder Mike Ashley, in which he warned: “We are in trouble, we are not trading very well. We can’t make the same profit we made last year....” That sent SPD’s shares down 12% at one stage yesterday. They’re down another 2% today. Boris Johnson, mayor of London, has begun testifying to the UK Treasury committee about the Eu referendum question. Boris, who supports Brexit, is fielding questions about “the economic and financial costs and benefits of the UK’s EU membership”. And he’s begun by arguing that the City would not suffer if Britain left the EU. Our politics liveblogger, Andy Sparrow, says Boris’s appearance is his toughest test yet, in the undeclared contest to succeed David Cameron as PM. Andy is tracking the action in his liveblog. Over in the City, shares in bookmaker William Hill have slumped by 13% after it warned that online profits are below forecasts. The company blamed unlucky results at Cheltenham last week - where it lost money every day. Good news for the punters. William Hill also admits that new rules allowing online gamblers to ‘self-exclude’ themselves from its services are hitting revenues, and could knock £20m off profits. That suggests recent moves to help those with gambling problems are working. Here’s another great chart from Jamie McGeever of Reuters, showing how demand for protection against a sterling crisis has soared: Several economists have predicted that the pound would slump against the US dollar if the Brexit campaign win, from $1.41 today to perhaps $1.2 or lower. Brexit concerns will be high on the agenda at the Bank of England today. The BoE’s Financial Policy Committee, which is charged with protecting financial stability, is holding its final meeting before the referendum. And the prospect of Britain voting to leaving the EU will be top of the agenda. Two weeks ago, governor Mark Carney told MPs that Brexit was the single biggest domestic risk to economic stability, so officials should be drawing up contingency plans to handle a Leave vote. Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank in London, told Bloomberg that the Bank of England will be worried about the impact on the City. “Without a doubt, Brexit is the top of everyone’s agenda until June, and possibly after if we do vote to leave.” “The FPC’s mandate is the financial system, so they’ll be looking at whether banks will be able to continue to do their business if there is a vote to leave. They may also talk about other risks to the financial sector, whether there would be an exodus of firms.” City traders may also be reacting to the latest Referendum opinion poll, from ICM. It showed that the Leave campaign are leading by 43% to 41%, with 16% still undecided. The cost of insuring against a sharp fall in the pound is soaring this morning, in another sign of Brexit jitteriness. Three-month sterling volatility (which tracks contracts that protect against wild moves in the pound) has hit levels not seen since the last general election. That shows that investors are expecting a serious shake-up over the next quarter. Reuters has snapped the details: STERLING/DOLLAR THREE-MONTH IMPLIED VOLATILITY JUMPS TO 14.50 PCT, HIGHEST SINCE MID-2010 EURO/STERLING THREE-MONTH IMPLIED VOLATILITY ALSO JUMPS TO 13.70 PERCENT, HIGHEST SINCE APRIL 2009 In a sense, it’s not a surprise that it’s happening now - the referendum falls in exactly three month’s time. But it also shows considerable uncertainty over the result, which could easily feed through to other parts of the economy. The pound is losing ground this morning, as concerns over Britain’s upcoming EU referendum swirl through the City. Serling has extended yesterday’s losses, and is down almost a half a cent since trading began in London, to $1.4168 against the US dollar. That wipes out most of its recent recovery, and sends it towards the six-year lows seen last month. Traders are citing the uncertainty over the June 23 referendum, and the possibility that the public could vote to break away from the EU. Yesterday’s terrorist atrocities in Brussels could also be adding to Brexit concerns. But as Kit Juckes of French bank Société Générale points out, there are other reasons to be bearish about sterling too. We are now exactly three months away from the UK’s referendum on EU membership and some ‘Brexit’ protagonists have chosen to use the atrocities in Brussels as a campaigning tool. The ‘remain’ campaign is based solely on warnings of how dreadful leaving would be, so the whole debate is thoroughly depressing. Meanwhile, slowing growth is hurting public finances, the Chancellor’s spending cuts are in a mess and so it’s no wonder the pound isn’t flavour of the month. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There’s a pre-Easter feeling in the City this morning, as traders start to wind down for the long weekend. The market volatility of January and February is but a memory, as investors hunker down and ponder the state of the global economy. From Melbourne, IG’s Chris Weston sums it up: What we are seeing at present is about as dull as one will see. As detailed yesterday, it could be the shortened week, but it feels like market players have entered the saloon and tumbleweeds are rolling down the street. So European markets are likely to be eerily calm. The economic calendar is disappointingly threadbare this morning too, although we do get the latest US oil reserves count this afternoon. But there’s a flurry of corporate news around this morning. Lloyds of London, retail chains Kingfisher and Game Digital, bookmaker William Hill, and furnishings group Laura Ashley are all issuing results. That might shake things up in the Square Mile. And Swiss bank Credit Suisse has already announced 2,000 job cuts, as part of a restructuring plan: We’ll be tracking the main events (such as we can find) through the day....."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2016/aug/15/brexit-canada-trade-deal-eu-model-next-steps","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-15T09:00:00Z","webTitle":"Canada's trade deal with EU a model for Brexit?

Not quite, insiders say","bodyText":"It took hundreds of skilled negotiators, dozens of videoconferences and seemingly endless days in Brussels to produce the 1,600-page text. Some seven years after Canada and the EU began negotiating a trade deal, the future of the agreement remains shrouded in doubt. But that hasn’t stopped the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or Ceta, as Canada’s deal with the EU is known, from being held up as the preferred model for Britain to follow in the wake of the Brexit vote. David Davis, the new minister for Brexit, has called it the “perfect starting point for our discussions with the commission”. Earlier this year, Boris Johnson cited Canada and its trade deal as an example for the UK to follow, adding: “It’s a very, very bright future I see.” Those close to the negotiations and others who have followed the development of the agreement paint a more nuanced picture. They point to the years of complex negotiations demanded by the deal and the persistent uncertainty that continues to dog its implementation – and they question whether the agreement’s framework is far-reaching enough to allow the UK to replicate its current level of access to the single market. “How they think Ceta is the panacea, I’m confused,” said one senior Canadian government official who was deeply involved with the negotiations. “We still don’t get complete access to the EU market the way the Brits currently have as a member state. So I don’t understand this looking towards Ceta as the answer to Brexit when they will be taking a 43-year step backwards in terms of the current access they have to the European Union.” The agreement – which has yet to be ratified – promises that around 98.6% of goods traded between Canada and the EU will be free of duty, paves the way for access to public procurement between the two markets and empowers regulatory bodies to accept the standards and tests carried out in each other’s jurisdictions. The trade deal doesn’t heighten access to sensitive agricultural products such as eggs or poultry and keeps quotas – albeit boosting them – in place for tariff-free imports of products such as beef and cheese. While the trade deal aims to liberalise services, hundreds of exceptions are listed. Under Ceta, Canada will have no hand in setting EU regulations or formulating product standards and no access to the banking passport system that would have allowed its banks and financial services to trade freely. The freedom of movement clauses are primarily focused on businesspeople. Negotiations between Canada and the EU dragged on for years, despite early expectations that they would be completed by 2012. The extended timeline was a reflection of the sheer complexity of the issues being addressed and helped produce a document described by Canada’s trade minister as a “gold standard” deal with the EU. “I’m surprised we pulled it off,” said the government source, crediting the political will that came from both sides. It remains to be seen whether the same spirit of collaboration will colour negotiations between the UK and the EU. “I honestly don’t know how it can be exactly replicated,” said Sylvain Charlebois, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax. “Gains are going to be different, stakes are going to be different. And therefore the deal has to be different.” Some of this lies in the scale of Canada’s trade with the EU. Canada’s largest trading partner is the United States, accounting for more than 60% of its total global trade in 2014. The EU is Canada’s second trading partner, representing around 10% of its external trade. In contrast, the EU is the UK’s biggest trading partner, accounting for 45% of UK exports of goods and services in 2014 and 53% of imports. As Pierre Pettigrew, a former trade minister for Canada, wrote in March in the Times: “It is fatuous to think there is a real comparison between Canada’s relationship with the EU and the UK’s with the bloc. Indeed, were Canada to trade as much with the EU as we do with the US we would want a much deeper relationship than Ceta.” Pettigrew pointed to the seven years of negotiation that went into Canada’s deal. “When you can rely on trade with the world’s largest economy, as is the case for Canada, you can afford the luxury of time. That will not be the UK’s position.” He estimated it could take up to 10 years for the UK and EU to reach agreements on various arrangements. The time would likely be spent attempting to reach compromises on the many areas not covered or minimised by Ceta. Canadian exports to the UK and EU are dominated by gold, precious stones and other metals – all products that aren’t produced in large quantities in Europe, Fredrik Erixon of the European Centre for International Political Economy noted in a recent article on Ceta. “For the UK, whose trade with the EU are in sectors highly exposed to regulatory protection (finance, nuclear power equipment, pharmaceuticals, et cetera) it would lead to a serious loss of market access and commercial integration,” he wrote. The task of reaching a compromise within these sectors would fall to the UK’s team of negotiators – many of whom have yet to be hired. The UK government has said it plans to hire up to 300 people after an initial government review turned up just 20 “active hands-on” trade negotiators. These negotiators will also have to decide whether to push forward with some of Ceta’s more thorny clauses, such as that which allows corporations to launch legal challenges against governments perceived to block them. “That’s a real threat,” said Andreas Schotter, a professor at Western University’s Ivey School of Business in southern Ontario. “That’s what the person in the street doesn’t understand, that with the legislation that is behind these trade deals, corporations become powerful enough to sue governments.” The clause could leave the UK fending off the same sort of challenge to its sovereignty that many in the Leave camp had hoped to avoid by leaving the EU, he said. “They don’t want to have German corporations start suing the UK government for not giving access to certain areas in the market or not giving certain incentives or certain aids.” Ironically, the same voices which laud Ceta as a model to be followed have helped cast doubt on when – and whether – the trade deal between Canada and the EU will come into force. Recently, the European Commission backed away from a plan that would have sped up the adoption of the deal, saying it would instead send the text to the EU’s 28 national parliaments, as well as some regional parliaments, to be ratified. The Canadian government hopes to have the agreement in force by early 2017, said Greg Tereposky of Borden Ladner Gervais, a law firm that represented various private sector companies during the negotiations. “I don’t think that’s possible … We don’t know how the UK will fit into this puzzle, ultimately.” He pointed to the annual quota set for tariff-free cheese laid out in the trade deal, rising to 18,000 tonnes over a period of six years. “Clearly some of that should be allocated to British blue cheese. The question is, how do you divide that?” Discussions such as these will probably force officials to push back the date of Canada’s trade deal with the EU to the second half of 2017 at the earliest, he said. “These are very complex and potentially contentious negotiations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/jul/13/george-osborne-the-unlucky-chancellor-too-wedded-to-austerity","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-13T18:19:25Z","webTitle":"George Osborne: the 'unlucky' chancellor too wedded to austerity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/george-osborne-the-unlucky-chancellor-too-wedded-to-austerity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/jul/13/george-osborne-the-unlucky-chancellor-too-wedded-to-austerity","fields":{"headline":"George Osborne: the 'unlucky' chancellor too wedded to austerity","bodyText":"Few chancellors have extended their reach across Westminster like George Osborne. After eight of his budgets, spending ministers were dancing to the Treasury’s tune across vast areas of government life. Schools, health, transport, energy, local government all operated under arms-length control by Osborne. HS2 and Hinkley Point – neither of which have actually happened – carried the Osborne imprint. On his home turf, however, the bald record of his six years in No 11 reads like this: he was the hi-vis austerity chancellor who did not meet his own fiscal rules. But perhaps the targets were wrong in the first place. And perhaps the effort of trying to hit impossible goals contributed to the current political earthquake. As the last of Osborne’s rules – the target of reaching a budget surplus by the end of this parliament – was quietly abandoned last week, note Theresa May’s call for “an economy that works for everyone”. Her list of complaints was long. “Wages have grown but only slowly,” said May. “Taxes for the lowest paid went down, but other taxes, like VAT, went up. Fixed items of spending – like energy bills – have rocketed. Monetary policy – in the form of super-low interest rates and quantitative easing – has helped those on the property ladder at the expense of those who can’t afford to own their own home.” For good measure, May added job insecurity, “unscrupulous bosses”, the divide in prosperity between generations, and “the gaping chasm” between wealthy London and the rest of the country. After that speech, it was obvious May would want a new chancellor. Missing the targets was often a good thing under Osborne, many would argue. Liberal Democrat Sir Vince Cable, who served as business secretary in the coalition government, says Osborne’s moments of preference for pragmatism over dogma are “something to be celebrated”. Indeed, it was only when Osborne relaxed the pace of austerity in 2012, by giving himself more time to hit his fiscal targets, that growth began to pick up and the chancellor was able to escape the charge that the economy was flatlining. By the time of his March 2015 budget – the last before the general election that saw the Conservatives confound the pollsters and secure a slim majority – Osborne was able to boast that “in the last year we have grown faster than any other major advanced economy in the world”. The growth was not much to shout about, but it cemented the Tories’ reputation for economic competence. On that score, Osborne helped to deliver the election victory for his party. But the pain of austerity also surely contributed to the referendum result. Osborne’s promise to pile on spending cuts and tax rises in the event of a leave vote – dubbed the “punishment budget” – was a tactical blunder. Voters knew it would not be imposed and resented the threat. Osborne’s permanent legacies will be fourfold. First, the creation of the Office for Budget Responsibility to report on the sustainability of the public finances. The move mirrored Gordon Brown’s grant of independence to the Bank of England to set monetary policy in 1997. It is similarly hard to imagine any government abolishing the OBR. Second, banking reform. Though Osborne is often derided as too banker-friendly (witness this week’s revelation that he lobbied US authorities for soft treatment of HSBC), the Financial Services Act of 2013 was a major piece of legislation. The bankers squealed about being forced to erect ringfences between their retail operations and their investment banks, but they will have to do so. And the new capital rules for banks, overseen by the Bank, are seen to have passed their first serious test – the vote for Brexit. Third, pension freedoms. Giving savers the right not to buy an annuity, and thus handing over-55s greater freedom to control their own savings, was a popular reform that will be almost impossible for a future government to reverse. Fourth, the introduction of the “national living wage” for those aged 25 and over. The genesis of the policy is unclear – it looked like an attempt to shoot a Labour fox, conceived from short-termist political instincts. Economists are divided over its sense. If growth shudders to a halt in coming years, the price of meeting living wage pledges could be higher unemployment. But, again, the architecture will probably survive. Yet few would paint Osborne as a visionary chancellor. His professed “march of the makers” never materialised and the UK economy looks as unbalanced as he leaves the Treasury as when he arrived. The UK’s current account deficit hit a peacetime record of 5% last year and productivity in the economy has gone sideways. Housing incentives have pushed up house prices – at least in London and the south-east – but the boom in housebuilding that was supposed to follow has been disappointing. There was no serious reform of competition policy. Industrial policy, at times, has seemed to amount to little more than attempts to sweet-talk China and others into funding new nuclear power stations. Note that May talked about “more Treasury-backed project bonds for new infrastructure projects”. One suspects the love-in with Beijing is over. For all the successful banking reforms, Royal Bank of Scotland is not in a state to be sold back to the private investors, as Osborne had planned to do; the shrunken share price makes such a move impossible. The public anger of the tiny sums of tax paid in the UK by the likes of Google and Amazon has barely been addressed. When Osborne hailed “a major success” in securing £130m from Google, most people saw a trifling settlement that did not oblige the company to change its corporate structure. The misjudgment recalled Osborne’s famous “omnishambles” budget of 2012 that briefly proposed taxes on pasties and caravans. Being generous, one could argue that two other big ideas – the “northern powerhouse” and the devolution of powers to local authorities – could yet change the economic and political landscape of the UK. It’s too early to say. Much depends on whether Osborne’s successors carry through his thinking. In sum, Osborne’s tenure was defined by the drive to tackle the budget deficit. In his own terms, he semi-succeeded, despite the missed fiscal targets. He inherited a deficit of 10.3% of GDP and got it down to 4% in six years. Note, though, the public debt has risen by more than £500bn on his watch – that’s what happens when you run deficits for years. He was an unlucky chancellor in the sense that growth in the global economy has mostly disappointed since 2010 while the eurozone – the UK’s biggest export market – has stumbled from crisis to crisis. But political historians may be less concerned with deficit statistics. What damage was done to the UK’s social fabric by years of austerity? And, once it was obvious that bond markets were not in revolt and that the UK was not going the way of Greece, was it a colossal mistake not to boost spending on public services?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/oct/21/nuclear-power-in-the-uk-a-history","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-10-21T08:47:58Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power in the UK – a history","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/21/nuclear-power-in-the-uk-a-history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/oct/21/nuclear-power-in-the-uk-a-history","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power in the UK – a history","bodyText":"1934 - Nuclear fission is first experimentally achieved by Enrico Fermi. 1947 - UK’s first nuclear reactor was built at Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) Harwell to demonstrate the viability of commercial power reactors. 1954 - United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) established to carry out nuclear research; to develop atomic weapons deterrents and reactor technologies. 1955 - UK government publish white paper titled A programme of nuclear power announcing the first purely commercial nuclear program. 1956 - World’s first commercial nuclear reactor, Calder Hall 1 (MWe net: 50) at Windscale (later Sellafield) is opened by Queen Elizabeth II.

Around him is a vast construction site, all aimed at creating temperatures of 150mC on this spot and finally bringing the power of the sun down to Earth. The €18bn (£14.3bn) Iter project, now rising fast from the ground under the bright blue skies of Provence, France, is the first capable of achieving a critical breakthrough: getting more energy out of the intense fusion reactions than is put in. “It is a bet that is very important for humanity,” says Johannes Schwemmer, the director of Fusion for Energy, the EU partner in the international Iter collaboration. “We need to get this energy once and for all.” The long allure of nuclear fusion is simple: clean, safe, limitless energy for a world that will soon house 10bn energy-hungry citizens. But despite 60 years of research and billions of dollars, the results to date are also simple: it has not delivered. Fusion is in danger of following its atomic cousin, conventional fission nuclear power, in over-promising – “electricity too cheap to meter” – and under-delivering. The Iter project itself, which stems from a cold war Reagan-Gorbachev summit in 1985, has seen years of turmoil. The US pulled out entirely between 1998-2003 and in 2008, Iter had to treble its budget and shift its deadline back a decade. But leaders representing half the world’s population – through the Iter partners, the EU, China, Russia, US, India, Japan and South Korea – are now making the €18bn wager that fusion can deliver and have radically overhauled Iter’s management to fix the mistakes of the past. The goal is to trap a plasma in a huge magnetic ring and force heavy hydrogen isotopes to fuse together to release prodigious amounts of energy – four times more than the splitting of uranium atoms produces in conventional fission reactors. “We are convinced we can deliver hundreds of megawatts through Iter,” up to 10 times more energy than is put in, says David Campbell, the director of science and operations at Iter (which means “the way” in Latin). To achieve that breakthrough, Iter will use a donut-shaped magnetic cage called a tokamak to trap the plasma. More than 200 smaller tokamaks have been built around the world and Campbell says the decades of physics and engineering that Iter is building on is a strong guarantee of success. But nothing has ever been attempted on the scale of Iter. The world record for fusion power – 16MW - was set in 1997 at the JET reactor in the UK. The longest fusion run – six minutes and 30 seconds – was achieved at France’s Tore Supra in 2003. Iter is aiming for 500MW and 50-minute runs. The site is a cathedral to the fusion dream: it spans the equivalent of 60 football fields and the reactor building will weigh 320,000 tonnes, all resting on rubber bearings in case of an unlikely, but not impossible, earthquake. The reactor itself will weigh 23,000 tonnes, three times more than the Eiffel Tower. It is the most complex engineering project in history. More than 2,800 tonnes of superconducting magnets, some heavier than a jumbo jet, will be connected by 200km of superconducting cables, all kept at -269C by the world’s largest cryogenic plant, which will pump 12,000 litres per hour of liquid helium. Millions of precision components will be shipped in from the seven partners to be assembled by thousands of workers. This is all aimed at keeping just two grammes of plasma hot enough and stable enough in the 30m-diameter tokamak for fusion to take place. Iter’s schedule is to create the first plasma in 2025, then start firing tiny 5mm frozen pellets of heavy hydrogen – deuterium and tritium – into the plasma and generating energy. Deuterium is easily refined from seawater and fuses with tritium, which is harvested from fission reactors but could be self-generated in Iter in future. The aim is to reach its maximum power output by 2035 and, if so, Iter will be the foundation of the first fusion power plants. Bernard Bigot, the director general of Iter, is certain it will produce plentiful power, “but what is not granted so far is that this technology will be simple and efficient enough that it could be industrialised,” he says. The point of Iter is finding out, says Bigot: “The world needs to know if this technology is available or not. Fusion could help deliver the energy supplies of the world for a very long time, maybe forever.” Even if things go well, getting real fusion power plants online before 2050 would be a triumph, raising an awkward question: what if fusion comes too late? Climate change is driving an accelerating transformation to low-carbon energy and drastic cuts in emissions are needed by 2050. If these are achieved, will there be a need for fusion power, which will be expensive at the start? “It is certainly not going to be too cheap to meter,” says Campbell. But it’s a question of timescale, he says: “In the long term there are very few available options: renewables, fission and fusion.” For Schwemmer, there is only one long-term option. “You would have to cover whole continents with wind turbines to produce the energy needed for 10 billion people,” he says. “And if our children’s children are not to sit on piles of [fission] nuclear waste, we have to make fusion work. Even if it takes till 2100, we should still do it.” Nuclear fission is also limited by uranium supplies, perhaps to a few decades if it were to play a large role. Bigot said: “People have to realise, if we want a breakthrough [that could provide energy] for millions of years, 10 or 20 years is nothing.” He thinks fusion may still come in time to meet the need to move the world to zero emissions in the second half of the century to defeat global warming. As a nuclear technology, some will remain implacably opposed to fusion. While fusion reactions produce only harmless helium, the high-energy neutrons also ejected irradiate the walls of the reactor, leading to radioactive waste. Again, the key is timescale, says Campbell. Waste from fission can remain radioactive for 250,000 years, making plans to store dangerous waste for many times longer than the whole of human civilisation speculative. In contrast, fusion waste will decay on the scale of decades. “Looking after the waste for 100 years is credible,” he says. Fusion is also intrinsically safe, with the large meltdowns seen in fission accidents such as Fukushima and Chernobyl physically impossible. Part of the reason is the tiny amount of fuel in a fusion reactor at any one time and part is the temperamental nature of plasma, a boiling gas of ions and electrons. “If you lose control of the plasma, it doesn’t just sit there, it disappears like that,” says Campbell, clicking his fingers. “After Fukushima, we thought we would be flushed down the toilet like all nuclear,” says Sabina Griffith, a communications manager at Iter. “But the opposite happened – governments thought if not fission, then what?” There are other fusion reactor designs that might be better and, in particular, smaller. A €1bn reactor opened in Germany by chancellor Angela Merkel earlier in 2016 uses a stellarator, in which the plasma ring is shaped like a Mobius strip. This makes it potentially more stable and, crucially, able to operate continuously, rather than in pulses like a tokamak. There are also numerous private companies, staffed by serious fusion researchers, promising much smaller reactors, including the UK’s Tokamak Energy and Tri Alpha Energy and General Fusion in Canada. “There are technology routes that might let you build something smaller – in principle,” says Campbell. But he says they either rely on unproven “exotic” ideas or underestimate the heavy engineering needed to contain burning plasmas. “Iter is the size our present technology allows us to build,” he says. Politics remains a challenge to delivering Iter and uncertainty has been ramped up by the election of Donald Trump as president of the US, where some powerful voices want to leave the project for good. Britain’s vote to leave the EU has also added to the uncertainty. But Bigot believes the need to know if full fusion power is feasible will keep the partners in. “To be frank, the US is only 9% of the project, if they were to leave alone, I believe we could go on,” he said. “But it would be the wrong signal [showing] the most powerful country in the world is not preparing for its future.” On Brexit he says: “It would damage Iter a little, but it would damage the UK a lot,” given its long and continuing research in fusion. The political problems usually boil down to costs and the governments of Iter partners wanting to reduce the taxpayers’ money spent on the project. “Iter looks very expensive to the ordinary person in the street,” says Campbell. “But the cost is spread across half the world’s population. Seen in that context I don’t think it is such a big investment to make.” The world spent $325bn on fossil fuel subsidies in 2015 alone, according to the IEA, and $150bn on renewable energy support. Fusion supporters such as Campbell also suggest fusion has geopolitical benefits because its key fuel – heavy hydrogen – is accessible to all. “No one has a monopoly on the fuel so no one is going to fight each other over it.” The 1985 Reagan-Gorbachev summit that kickstarted the Iter project called for “the widest practicable development of international collaboration” in nuclear fusion to obtain “energy which is essentially inexhaustible, for the benefit of all mankind”. So how far is the world from achieving that, 30 years and numerous stumbles on? Many still point to the answer given by Lev Artsimovich, the father of the tokamak and head of the Soviet fusion power programme for more than two decades until his death in 1973. Fusion power, he said, will arrive “when mankind needs it – maybe a short time before that”. • This article was amended on 2 December 2016 to correct General Fusion’s location."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/oct/21/xi-jinping-poised-to-sign-nuclear-deal-as-uk-seeks-to-clinch-30bn-of-contracts","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-21T10:55:53Z","webTitle":"Xi Jinping  signs nuclear deal as UK and China clinch £40b​n of contracts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/21/xi-jinping-poised-to-sign-nuclear-deal-as-uk-seeks-to-clinch-30bn-of-contracts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/oct/21/xi-jinping-poised-to-sign-nuclear-deal-as-uk-seeks-to-clinch-30bn-of-contracts","fields":{"headline":"Xi Jinping  signs nuclear deal as UK and China clinch £40b​n of contracts","bodyText":"China and Britain have signed multi-billion pound business deals, including for the project to build a nuclear power station in Britain, during day two of the Chinese president’s first state visit to the country. Xi Jinping and David Cameron on Wednesday attended a UK-China business summit at Mansion House, where the focus was on investment, infrastructure and innovation. Cameron said at the press conference after the two leaders met: “A strong relationship is in both our countries’ interests, not just because it brings investment and jobs and higher living standards for our peoples – vital though these things are.” “The more we trade together, the more we have a stake in each others’ success and the more we understand each other, the more we can work together to confront the problems that face our world today” Chinese president signs off on nuclear power station deal The Chinese leader made a statement with David Cameron to confirm the planned Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in south-west England, just as the French energy firm EDF and China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) signed an investment agreement to build the new plant in Somerset. In what is likely to be the biggest deal of Xi’s visit, the project would create more than 25,000 jobs and power 6m homes, yet is subject to approval by ministers, according to the Department of Energy and Climate Change. China will take a stake of one third, $28bn (£18bn), in the EDF project due to start operating by 2025, and is the first European nuclear plant to be built since Japan’s Fukushima disaster in 2011. As part of the deal, EDF and the state-owned CGN will also cooperate to license a Chinese-designed reactor and build it at a site near London. However, the prospect of China – which western spymasters say sponsors the hacking of global companies – helping to build a nuclear plant in Britain and being involved in running others has stoked security concerns in Britain. Securing almost £40bn in contracts with the world’s second largest economy, the UK is to also extend the standard Chinese visitor visas from six months to two years, the government has announced. Chinese tourists contribute £500m annually to the UK economy, according to government figures. Cameron said: “China is becoming one of our fastest-growing tourism markets, so making it easier and more convenient for Chinese visitors to come to the UK is extremely important. “That is why the announcement I’m making today is great news for our tourism industry and great news for the British economy enabling us to maximise Chinese spending power even further.” Human rights activists and protesters against China’s state visit accuse Cameron of courting Chinese money while brushing aside criticism of a crackdown in civil liberties since Xi came to power in 2012. Cameron said in the joint press conference the UK did not have to choose between doing deals with China and raising difficult issues such as the steel industry crisis and Beijing’s human rights record. Asked what he would say to a steel worker facing the dole who saw the Chinese president given a glittering welcome, he said: “The stronger our economic, trading, business and other partnerships, the stronger our relationship and the more able we are to have the necessary and frank discussions about other issues.” The Chinese president answered and said: “China attaches great importance to the protection of human rights. We combine the universal value of human rights with China’s reality and we have found a part of human rights development suited to China’s national conditions.” Xi added: “With regard to protection of human rights, looking round the world we know that there is always room for improvement.” Chinese president and chancellor visit Imperial College London Earlier in the day of business and diplomatic handshaking, the Chinese president had visited Imperial College London with George Osborne, the chancellor, and the Duke of York. Xi interacted with the latest medical robots, including an ultra-flexible snake robot for use in surgery, as further Chinese funding was announced on Wednesday at the university. The fresh support is to bolster the research British and Chinese experts are working on together – in fields including nanotechnology, bioengineering, computing, advanced materials, environmental engineering and public health. Prof Alice Gast, president of Imperial College London, said: “Imperial’s Chinese students have developed a reputation for innovation, creativity and an openness to new ideas. They are the leaders of tomorrow. Their work today will help shape the UK-China relationship for generations to come.” Plans for scores of China’s most academically able scholars and students to receive funding to attend Imperial, as well as support for Imperial’s top PhD students to undertake research work at Chinese universities, are to be announced by the Chinese Scholarship Council. China UCF Group will donate £3m to support research at Imperial’s Data Science Institute and Hamlyn Centre for Medical Robotics. The university also announced it is to partner with Zhejiang University on a new centre for transnational entrepreneurship in London. Cultural collaboration summit at Lancaster House In the morning, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge joined Xi at an event where British and Chinese technology and creativity collaborations were showcased. Before meeting Cameron at Downing Street on the second day of his state visit, the Chinese leader saw British objects ranging from Doctor Who’s Tardis and a Dalek to a prototype zero-emission red London bus. The latter was one of three famous vehicles the royal couple and the Chinese head of state viewed in the courtyard of the historic house, also accompanied by Jackie Chan, the actor and martial artist, who is filming parts of his film The Chinaman in London. Against a typically British backdrop of persistent rain, they also viewed a black cab and an Aston Martin sports car – all either prototype zero-emission vehicles or capable of producing no emissions. Companies and institutions had set up stands to highlight their products and services at Lancaster House in central London, as an Anglo-Sino deal worth £325m was to be signed in “creative and technology partnerships” such as low-carbon taxis, zero-emission sports cars, and a TV training programme. Aston Martin has announced a £50m deal with China Equity to develop its zero-emission RapidE car. London Taxi Company owner Geely, a Chinese business, has also announced a further £50m investment to enhance its research capabilities and launch a new fleet of zero emission-capable black cabs. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, said such global partnerships were essential in building “a Britain that is stronger, more prosperous and full of opportunity”. John Whittingdale, the culture secretary, said of the new collaborations – which include the £200m TV training programme with China Capital Investment Group at the University of York: “These new collaborations with China mark yet another step forward for UK innovation. By sharing our skills and expertise we can enter markets we wouldn’t have dreamed of entering a decade ago, and reach people who have yet to experience the magic of British film, theatre or video games.” In a boost for the Duke of Cambridge, whose efforts to curtail the illegal wildlife trade saw him give a speech on the issue earlier this week, palace officials said a major Chinese firm would be offering financial support to his charity. The firm Sanpower will work with the royal foundation United for Wildlife, headed by the Cambridges and Prince Harry. Charity officials said a donation from Sanpower would be used to create two regional ranger training facilities in eastern and southern Africa. Further business meetings and banquets Xi will then visit Huawei Technologies, a leading Chinese telecommunications company, followed by a banquet hosted by the Lord Mayor and the City of London at the Guildhall."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2014/sep/10/japan-restart-nuclear-reactors-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2014-09-10T08:49:42Z","webTitle":"Japan to restart nuclear reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/10/japan-restart-nuclear-reactors-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2014/sep/10/japan-restart-nuclear-reactors-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"Japan to restart nuclear reactors","bodyText":"Japan's nuclear watchdog has given the green light for two reactors to restart but the operator still has to persuade local communities they are safe. Widespread anti-nuclear sentiment has simmered in Japan ever since an earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 caused meltdowns at the Fukushima power plant, sparking the worst atomic disaster since Chernobyl. The country's nuclear reactors were switched off after the catastrophe. Two reactors were briefly restarted last year but all of Japan's nuclear plants are currently offline. The go-ahead from the Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NRA) for two reactors at the Sendai plant in southern Japan comes after it issued a more than 400-page safety report in July and follows a month-long public consultation period. But any restart is unlikely before the year end as the operator, Kyushu Electric Power, is also required to get two more NRA approvals for other facilities at the site. More challenging, perhaps, is gaining the consent of communities living near the plant in south-western Kagoshima prefecture, who must sign off on the restarts before they can happen. Much of the job of convincing a sceptical public will fall on the shoulders of new industry minister Yuko Obuchi. \"If people say they are worried, I think it is only natural. If you are a mother, I think it is a kind of feeling that everyone has,\" Obuchi said soon after being appointed as Japan's first female industry minister. \"The central government must offer a full explanation to these sentiments.\" Obuchi has highlighted the importance of earning the \"understanding of hosting communities\" who may be hostile to the prospect of firing up nearby reactors, despite beefed up safety rules. The minister has reportedly dispatched five central government officials to help local bodies in Kagoshima draw up evacuation plans in case of an accident. Communities living right next door to nuclear plants, who often enjoy grants from utility companies and depend on the power stations for employment, are frequently sympathetic to restarts. However, there is often hostility from those living further afield who enjoy no direct benefits but see themselves as in the firing line in the event of another accident like Fukushima. Greenpeace Japan, which is campaigning for Tokyo to abandon nuclear power completely, said the government of the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, appeared to be glossing over the last year, in which Japan has survived without nuclear power. \"The government … is ignoring the lessons of Fukushima and attempting to prevent the renewable energy revolution, trying to take the nation back to its dependence on dangerous and unreliable nuclear power,\" said Kazue Suzuki for the organisation. Abe has been trying to persuade a wary public that the world's third largest economy must return to an energy source that once supplied more than a quarter of its power. Obuchi visited Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant on Sunday, wearing a protective jacket and face mask to observe work at the crippled facility."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
