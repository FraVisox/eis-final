The potential inclusion of renewable energy in the coalition's flagship \"green deal\" comes as a surprise, as the development of the scheme has so far focused on energy efficiency measures such as lagging lofts. Papers published by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) on Thursday show that the 14 million householders expected to qualify for a complete energy-saving overhaul in the next 10 years may be able to choose from 23 different technologies, including cavity wall insulation and draught proofing but also covering solar water heating, wood burning stoves and biomass boilers. \"We are leaving the window open for micro generation technologies. It could happen in the future,\" said Greg Barker. Under the scheme, which it is hoped will be rolled out from next year, all 25m homes in Britain will ultimately be assessed and owners will be offered loans by high street companies for energy-saving measures. Repayments will theoretically be offset for consumers by savings on energy bills, and the debts will be attached to properties rather than individuals. But Barker said it would not be like a conventional bank loan. \"It will not be a loan. It will not count against people's credit rating. This is a revolution that will ricochet around the world. This is the most ambitious energy-saving programme anywhere since the second world war. It will do for environmental efficiency what privatisation did for industrial efficiency. The fact is you should be better off from day one. You will have a better property that is easier to heat. Your fuel bill should be less. This is about unleashing new technologies. We have got to do 14m homes by the early 2020s and 25m by 2030.\" . Barker said that companies including John Lewis, B&amp;Q, Marks &amp; Spencer, Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's are now set to offer the packages to consumers, with installation work to be done by certified assessors and contractors bound by law to work to meet agreed standards. Critics of the scheme have said that few people will be attracted because the money borrowed is expected to be at expensive commercial rates of interest. But Barker hinted that more incentives would be offered. \"I am sure I am sure there will be more incentives to come. We are in discussions with the Treasury,\" he said. According to the papers published today there will be different options for householders on the length of repayments, defined standards of service for assessors and installers will need to be members of a green deal accredited certification body. Providers will need to hold a consumer credit licence to provide consumers protection against mis-selling."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/dec/23/solar-panel-cowboys-subsidies","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-23T12:09:26Z","webTitle":"Beware of the solar panel cowboys | John Vidal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/23/solar-panel-cowboys-subsidies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/23/solar-panel-cowboys-subsidies","fields":{"headline":"Beware of the solar panel cowboys","bodyText":"The UK solar electric industry says it is in turmoil. The government slashed its subsidies in the middle of a consultation period, and then, this week, Friends of the Earth showed in the high court that the government had acted illegally. Many companies, who thought Christmas had come early, now say they are confused, uncertain of the future and don't know what to advise consumers. Join the club. The public has been confused and uncertain about solar energy for months now. The industry has some fine, legitimate businesses, which have vast experience in installing and maintaining solar PV systems; but ever since word got out that there was free money to be had, it's gone mad, with cowboys, incompetents, rogue dealers, dodgy workers, ruthless salesmen and hosts of under-employed, have-a-go builders, many of whom graduated in the double-glazing industry, piling in. They have left a trail of faulty installations and unfinished work and householders believing they will benefit from massive amounts of cheap or free electricity over the next 20 years – when they almost certainly will not. The first problem is that rogue companies have been over-enthusiastic about the kind of returns people can expect, both from their panels and then from the government scheme. Some people have reportedly paid £18,000 for 1Kw systems in the belief they are getting a mini-Sellafield power station on their roof, when in fact they will be lucky to be able to boil a kettle most days. Others have been persuaded to \"rent\" their roofs out to companies for 20 years in return for \"free electricity\" with little idea of what this means if they sell or want to change. Then there's the problem of installers. Solar companies need qualified electricians but most of these have never been on a roof. One couple I know of had to have 400 tiles replaced after the installers trampled over it. They were lucky that the company rectified the damage quickly. In addition, they need plumbers, who mostly have little experience of electrics, and scaffolders, who have massively upped the price of renting kit. There's room for trouble everywhere. Companies must, in theory, be accredited under the Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS) and also be members of an approved consumer code scheme. But cowboy installers have found ways round this, getting \"freelance\" electricians to do the final hook-up to the grid and therefore technically making it safe and eligible for the subsidy, but actually having no responsibility for anything else. Then there's the money. There has been a glut of panels and factory prices have plummeted, but many companies are over-charging, asking for upfront deposits and offering minimal \"cooling off\" periods. So what to do? • Only approach companies that are members of the REAL Assurance Scheme. • Only sign a contract with a company that is certified under the Microgeneration Certification Scheme for the technology you are looking to install. • Check the Energy Saving Trust website for objective information and target prices. Their online \"cashback calculator\" will tell you how much solar panels could earn on your roof. • Read guidance carefully before you sign a contract or pay a deposit. • Get at least three quotes, make sure any testimonials you rely on are genuine and were not paid for and contact the people yourself and ask them any questions. • Before you sign a contract or pay a deposit, make sure the company gives you a quote in writing, including a standard performance estimate specific to your property. • The standfirst of this piece was clarified at 14:55 on 23 December 2011"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2012/mar/05/wrexham-europe-solar-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-03-05T11:24:17Z","webTitle":"Wrexham leads Europe's solar charge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/05/wrexham-europe-solar-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2012/mar/05/wrexham-europe-solar-energy","fields":{"headline":"Wrexham leads Europe's solar charge","bodyText":"Wrexham – average sunshine: three hours a day for four months of the year – has joined Sacramento in California, desert city Abu Dhabi and Freiburg in Germany as a new solar power centre. The north Walian town, which has had one of Europe's largest solar panel factories since 2005, employing around 1,000 people, moves into the renewable energy premier league this month after installing 30,000 panels made in the town on 3,000 of its council homes. This year it will fit six schools and several public buildings with a further 90kW of solar power. Scaffolding was bought in from all over Cheshire and north Wales to complete Europe's biggest social housing solar scheme by 4 March, the cut-off date which allowed installations to earn the higher government solar incentive (assuming a government appeal in the courts fails). \"They have been going up like mushrooms. Everyone got them, even my auntie,\" said Jackie Downward, a resident of Hullah Lane, Wrexham who had eight panels installed on the roof of her pebble-dashed 1960s semi. \"I've never taken an interest in green things before. Some people say they look ugly but most say they wouldn't mind them. I only heard of one couple who said they wouldn't have them on their roof. In the end, it's money off your bills and jobs so it has to be worth it,\" she said. In what council chiefs say was a \"sensible\" investment, Wrexham last year borrowed nearly £28m for the 5MW scheme to equip one in three of its properties with panels made by Japanese company Sharp, which has a solar module factory on the edge of the town. Tenants, who pay on average around £70 a week to rent their homes, can expect £200-300 a year off their bills from the electricity they generate and the council will make over £1m a year profit from feed-in tariffs, the government's solar incentive scheme. The money will increase Wrexham's housing budget by nearly 10%, and will be invested back in public housing. In a riposte to critics who dismissed solar as a technology only for the wealthy, the town – which has some of Britain's most deprived estates – expects its investment to lift people out of fuel poverty, benefit its schools and old people, and reduce carbon emissions by 3,000 tonnes a year. Sharp says it has invested £43m in its Wrexham solar plant and that 132 people worked nearly six months to install the panels on council homes. The investment should also lift Wrexham to near the top of the UK league table for emission reductions. By 2020 it expects a 70% cut on 2005 figures – way above central government targets and possibly the most by any British borough. But while it may be one of the only towns in Britain to have boosted its economy with solar, it has been hard hit by the government's decision before Christmas to halve solar incentives]. As a direct result, solar panel manufacturers, including Sharp, have had to lay off people, and Wrexham's expected income from the panels will drop. \"We were never doing this for the money. Our intention was always to reduce emissions. We will still make a profit but it will take longer,\" said a council spokeswoman. The halving of the 43p incentive for solar installations is expected to hit the solar industry hard. The fledgling industry, which employs 30,000, says it is \"facing ruin\" after the energy minister, Greg Barker, further slashed incentives for people investing after July 2012. Installations completed by July will continue to get the 21p incentive, but after that could drop to 13p and may only be available to people who have insulated their homes to a certain level. Explosive growth in solar panel installations on homes, schools and fields in the UK over the past 22 months saw the green energy source pass the symbolic milestone of 1,000MW last month. \"It showed very clearly that people were desperate to get out of the clutches of the big six energy companies, which hate the idea of people generating their own electricity. There goes a small industry which has invested hundreds of millions of pounds,\" said Daniel Green of solar energy company Homesun. \"This is the steady strangulation of a successful industry. First it was by stealth, now it's blatant. This company alone had 330,000 applications for solar in 18 months. There must have been millions of people across Britain who were interested in installing it and in generating their own electricity,\" said Green \"The industry has taken a massive knock The government is preparing to kill off the industry altogether,\" said Jed Rowbottom, director of Burnley-based solar company Solarlec. But Jeremy Leggett, chair of Solar Century, said the solar would not be crushed. \"The government does not want anything to impinge on the prospect of centralised power from the big six electricity companies. But well before 2020 solar will be cheaper than nuclear or gas. It's not the end of the industry but of our opportunity in Britain to grow a domestic industry that could compete with those in Germany and elsewhere. It will explode again, but it will not be British.\" Since the feed-in tariff scheme was launched by the Labour administration in April 2010 the amount of solar has grown by over 40 times. There was just 26MW of solar before the scheme."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2012/jul/24/letters","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2012-07-24T12:59:02Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 27 July 2012","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/jul/24/letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2012/jul/24/letters","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 27 July 2012","bodyText":"Marina Hyde gave the body politic a deservedly good hiding (British democracy in terminal decline, 13 July). To hear that the Japanese collectively should have confessed a cultural culpability over Fukushima gave me a start, albeit a happy one. One would have rather feared some scapegoating and seppuku among the corporate shoguns for dishonouring their nation. In China \"taking the honourable way out\" to atone for scandalous misfeasance is still commonplace enough. In the US we can still display a latent strain of Calvinism that craves the spectacle of pilloried muckety-mucks. And tarring and feathering was once a lively spectator sport, an effective cathartic for less-than-stellar performance in the office. Committees of investigation serve primarily as palliative palaver, geared to temporise and defuse the public ire by the mere appearance of action: window-dressing. PR is pre-eminent. Still, there ought to be some credible jeopardy looming for officials: leastways, a lifelong ban ought to be in order. Leaders are bold to proclaim: \"The buck stops here\" and \"I take full responsibility\". One is stirred to shout, \"Well? What then are your consequences?\" By way of Dantean (tailor-made) contrition, imagine for example that the players in the al-Yamamah arms deal could be rendered up to a penitential stint retrieving landmines. Or, those currently reneging on the rights of pensioners could find themselves reassigned as musical directors in a nonagenarian care centre, or as moggy manicurists. R M Fransson Denver, Colorado, US • Marina Hyde's cause for British democracy's terminal decline: blame the victim. We, she states, meaning I assume the average British voter, put the power brokers in their counting houses and parliaments. Does the average British voter accept such an accusation? As a brother average Canadian voter, I wouldn't. What options does the average person have? The global village is gated, and the gatekeepers have all the money and the power. A gaggle of valueless people, railroading through the world on a narrow-gauge money track, gorged with wealth, and power a cancer on their soul. The debaters of values in times past – religions and ideologies – are all used and abused, marginalised by the tsunami of capital gain. No matter how refreshingly candid, the Fukushima disaster report will end up on a dusty shelf. Average voter of the world: be smart, don't give in or give up. Shout and block traffic, beat pots and pans, love and make love, help those in need. And laugh loud and clear at those who have power and money. There are some lively ones among them: humour might make them see just how average they are. They could be persuaded to share the wealth. Tom Edmonds Cowansville, Quebec, Canada • Oli Scarff's photograph of the House of Lords members is an eloquent image of patriarchy, patronage and privilege, all absurdly out of place in the early 21st century. I'm embarrassed for Britain. B Jane Robinson-Bond Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Just consider the facts Regarding Disaster averted, for now (13 July): I write with disappointment at the blindingly obvious link that no one seems game to talk about: the destruction of the Earth with every financial crisis, past and future. When referring to potential reasons for the global financial crisis, the article cited the optimism bias in relation to risk, and warns that optimism is risky as it leads us to exaggerating our ability to predict the future. Why do we need to look to feelings to predict the future of business? What about the plethora of peer-reviewed science behind the risk of climate change and impact of peak oil in relation to the previous financial crisis? As Paul Gilding says: \"The change ahead will be driven by the physics and biology of the ecosystem rather than the good intentions of our leaders. The implications for business are enormous. Anyone who fails to understand this context will fail to guide their business through the coming storm.\" The article goes on to suggest that \"Lasting recovery will only come when...\" How long will any nation stay recovered when we continue to profit from the plunder of the earth's finite resources and consume at a rate we can't sustain? Where is there forewarning of our role as consumers in this capitalist growth-based society, bringing about our next financial and environmental crisis? Let's not rely on our view of the situation, whether it be optimistic or pessimistic; let's take some responsibility and decisive action on this collision course we have set our targets on. As Margaret Thatcher once said: \"When did we start talking about feelings instead of actually doing something?\" What will we tell our children? \"We did nothing because we couldn't decide how to think about the problem\" or \"We did everything we could to protect what was left\". Tamlin Mackenzie The Channon, NSW, Australia Upbeat stories helped I noticed a remarkable number of upbeat articles in the 6 July Guardian Weekly: Battle to curb arms trade begins, Shock as US supreme court rules to uphold Obama health reforms, EPA victory for Obama (on rules governing greenhouse gases), Gillard campaigns for tax (on greenhouse gases), Italy and Spain grab the lifeline, Pakistan's release of Indian fishermen raises hope for detente between foes, UK tax crackdowns threaten lucrative status of havens, Diamond faces the inevitable and departs as Barclays chief, Indian companies tap into abundant [solar] energy and unmet demand [for electricity], News Corp does the splits (and Rupert Murdoch steps aside from the newspaper business), and even Failure can be inspiring.

Julie Telford St Louis, France Don't forget conscience The Guardian's editorial on Syria (A long hard slog, 17 July) is a well-reasoned summary of the political situation and, unfortunately, you are probably right that this will be a long hard slog. Yet when I finished the piece something was wrong. After perusing it again I recognised the problem. The editorial reads as if this is a difficult uphill walk in the rain. No mention of the brazen massacres, of the civilian deaths, of the flight of refugees to Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. Is the Guardian now reprinting editorials from the Wall Street Journal? The Syrian opposition website Syrian Martyrs estimates there have been 19,900 deaths to date in the conflict, the vast majority of them innocent civilians. I like to think of the Guardian as news and analysis with a conscience. Please don't forget the conscience. Robert Walsh Wilton, Connecticut, US Who's the better loser? Kevin Mitchell writes \"[Murray's] performance was as good a losing effort as these championships have seen since Federer lost to Rafael Nadal in 2008\" (Wimbledon: so close for Murray, 13 July). Surely Andy Roddick's performance in losing 16‑14 to Federer in the final set the following year deserves consideration? Murray did indeed play some superb tennis against Federer, but the poor quality of his serving in the final two sets must be counted against him. According to the ATP, in the 2009 final, Roddick made 70% of his first serves. In this year's final, Murray wound up making only 56% overall. In 2009, Roddick made 74 winners to 33 unforced errors – a ratio of 2.24:1. In 2012, Murray made 46 winners to 25 unforced errors – 1.84:1. Other statistics tend to favour Roddick's performance in similar fashion.

In case they are still looking for ideas, here are my free-of-charge suggestions: track runners should be issued with swimming goggles so they can see where they are going. Those jumping over hurdles should be allowed an assisted lift by a member of their synchronised swimming team. Javelins should be attached to marker buoys so officials can see where they splash down.

The government's figure of £2.5bn is slightly higher than an estimate for the previous year and well down on total investment in the sector in 2009. The Department of Energy and Climate Change said the investment, which represents the total financial commitments announced by a variety of companies between April and December to proposed renewable energy projects, had the potential to create 12,000 jobs across Britain. Chris Huhne, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, said: \"Renewable energy is not just helping us increase our energy security and reduce our emissions. It is supporting jobs and growth across the country, and giving traditional industrial heartlands the opportunity to thrive again.\" But the £2.5bn investment announced since April showed little progress from 2010, when £2.1bn was poured into renewables and other low-carbon forms of energy in the UK, according to the US-based thinktank Pew Environment Group. The 2010 figure was itself a dramatic fall of 70% compared with the investment reached in 2009, when at least £7.1bn was put into the sector. DECC said this year's investment figures were the first it had compiled, so direct comparisons with previous years have not been possible because Pew's methodology was likely to be different. However, the department agreed that Pew's figures could be used as an indication. Investors have complained of a damaging uncertainty in government policy, as twice this year the government cut the subsidy rates available to solar energy, and this autumn announced plans to reduce the incentives for wind power. In 2010, the UK fell out of the league of the top 10 countries around the world in terms of renewable energy investment. This year's figures are extremely unlikely to redeem the UK's place in the league, as many countries in the developing world in particular have surged ahead, including China and India. The fall in investment in renewables confirms research by the Guardian earlier this month that showed the number of wind turbines built this year is down by half on last year. In the year to the end of November, 540MW of new turbines, on land and offshore, were built – comprising 200 onshore turbines and 50 offshore. In 2010 more than double that capacity – 1,192MW of turbines – were constructed. This contrasts sharply with more than 30GW of gas-fired electricity generation that is in the planning stages. Charles Hendry, minister for energy, said oil and gas were crucial to the UK economy, contributing about 2% of GDP. Granting 46 new licences to explore for oil and gas under the North Sea, he said: \"Our innovative licensing system continues to make the UK one of the most attractive places to do business. These continued high levels of interest, and the award today of these licences, gives me yet more reason to be optimistic for a prosperous 2012 for the UK oil and gas sector.\" DECC said last year there was a 27% increase in renewable energy consumption from 42.6TWh in 2008 to 54TWh in 2010 – representing 3.3% of total energy consumed. The energy from wind generation increased by 46% from 7 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2008 to 10.2TWh in 2010, and in 2010 achieved 5GW of offshore and onshore wind capacity. There was also, according to DECC, a threefold increase in the use of biofuels in transport from 1% of total road transport fuel supply in 2007-08 to 3.33% in 2010. Huhne said: \"Our renewable target is less demanding than other EU member states, but the effect is bringing real jobs and investment. I do not want the UK to be left behind by turning our back on the green economy. The agreement to negotiate a global deal secured at [international climate change talks in December in] Durban has reinforced major nations' commitment to cutting carbon. We cannot afford to stand alone while the world wises up.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/rio-20-brazil-sustainable-development-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-13T15:31:21Z","webTitle":"Rio+20: why Brazil is a country of contradictions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/rio-20-brazil-sustainable-development-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/rio-20-brazil-sustainable-development-environment","fields":{"headline":"Rio+20: why Brazil is a country of contradictions","bodyText":"Despite Brazil's emergence as a global economic power, its massive environmental resources and its environmentally conscious people, many Brazilian companies and politicians have still not fully taken on board sustainable development as a strategic priority. The ongoing debate about a forestry law that could encourage deforestation has exposed deep divisions in Brazilian society. The UN Conference on Sustainable Development, also referred to as Rio+20, will take place in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil next week, marking the 20th anniversary of the also Rio-based 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development (Eco 92). Brazil itself is one of the world's most environmentally diverse and sensitive countries. Almost 50% of Brazilian territory is taken up by the earth's largest tropical forest, the Amazon rainforest, home to nearly 50% of all the world's biodiversity. Almost half of all the energy consumed in Brazil comes from renewable sources: 75% from hydroelectricity and the rest from biomass, solar energy and ethanol. In addition to its environmental riches, the country is experiencing rapid economic growth. The Brazilian economy just overtook the UK to become the world's sixth largest economy. Brazil's poverty rate has also fallen significantly and in just the past five years some 30 million Brazilians (17.6% of the population) have joined the middle class. The average Brazilian's income increased from US $3,700 a year in 2000 to US $9,720 at the end of 2010. During the same period, the income of the poorest 10% of Brazilians increased by 8% per year while the income of the richest people in the country increased by 1.5%. These achievements can be celebrated by Brazilian society. They show that the country is no longer a \"future promise\". In addition to all the plentiful natural resources available to us such as water and farmable land, Brazil is also becoming a very important player in the economic and political world scene. Nevertheless, we are still very much a land of contradiction, as Brazilian society, companies and government all struggle to address the many issues that remain. An example of this is a recent controversy surrounding the new version of a forest management law, which was approved last month by the Brazilian congress and which takes us in the opposite direction to what will be discussed at Rio +20. The law, supported and backed by the agribusiness industry, represented a major step backwards for Brazilian environmental legislation and for our forests: its intent was to give an amnesty to land owners who cleared land in the past and who had illegally invaded and deforested riparian areas. The law also opened several loopholes for legalising further deforestation. In the face of this threat to our forests and rivers and to the progress of the possibility of a sustainable economy, civil society in Brazil called on president Dilma Rousseff to veto this new version of the law, which she did partially. But while she vetoed some parts of the law, the fight goes on; the law has returned to congress for a new vote. This episode highlights the gulf between the views of Brazilian society and those of our legislators. And what are Brazilian society's views? As civil society mobilised for the \"Veto, Dilma\" campaign through protests and online petitions, research firm Ibope released a survey that showed that 94% of all Brazilians said they are concerned about the environment. Some 44% of the people surveyed said that protecting the environment should be a priority over economic growth whilst 40% believe that environmental protection and economic growth can be reconciled. However, research carried out in 2010 by Instituto Akatu, a Brazilian NGO that promotes sustainable consumption, also showed that only 5% of Brazilians can be classified as conscientious consumers. A more recent study, released in 2012, found that only 26% of Brazilians said they recycled always or frequently, even though 86% agreed that recycling is something that everyone should do. Yet, almost 50% of the towns in Brazil do not even have the infrastructure in place to enable recycling. Meanwhile, in the corporate sector, a group of executives from companies such as Natura and Tetra Pak publicly supported the president's veto of the new version of the forest management law and argued that it is imperative that the country keeps its forests standing. The forests, they wrote, have become a source of income for many communities and companies that have learned to manage the ecosystem in a sustainable and intelligent way. \"Do we want a country that is driving a new economy in which everyone benefits from ecosystem services, or a Brazil which is looking in the rear view mirror, wasting its legacy and generating social and environmental liabilities?\", they asked. Brazil has its fair share of business leaders who have seen value in sustainable practices. One of these is Fabio Barbosa. Currently the chairman of media group Abril, this week he was named by UNEP, the UN Environment Programme, as one of six \"Champions of the Earth\". While heading Banco Real (subsequently acquired by Santander of Spain), he transformed the bank into a leading company in the area of sustainability. Nevertheless, most Brazilian business leaders have not yet recognised that \"companies that are also concerned with the environmental aspects of the business tend to do better in their financial performance\", as Barbosa told the UNEP. Despite a growing awareness of the need for sustainable business models, many companies in Brazil are still lagging behind in articulating and acting on strategies that would bring about real change. Today, we can classify Brazilian companies into three different stages: there is a small group of pioneers, typified by the likes of Fabio Barbosa, which are integrating sustainability into their core business; there are some companies which are implementing changes in their processes and products; and finally there is a larger segment of companies that are just starting to understand the need to incorporate sustainability, but which are only acting in a very limited way to achieve this. Research carried out jointly by the Akatu Institute and the Ethos Institute supports this analysis. According to the survey, despite significant growth in the number of corporate social responsibility actions undertaken by Brazilian companies, CSR is still very much a work in progress in the country. The survey shows that 21% of the companies have implemented 0 to 12 CSR actions or practices, 30% have between 23 and 33, and only 20% have 34 or more practices. Hence out of the total companies surveyed, less than 50% had implemented more than 22 CSR practices. The research also highlighted that only a small number of companies have formal processes and procedures to manage their CSR practices. One of the main problems facing the corporate sector in Brazil today is this lack of know-how and of references to help companies shape and define their sustainability strategies and actions. Although an increasing number of companies are incorporating sustainability practices and procedures into their everyday business, this can often be a haphazard, informal process. In most companies in Brazil, there is still a need for the issue of sustainability to be given a formal priority in the organisation, so that these practices are adopted as part of a company's strategy and policies. Despite the progress of recent years, Brazil is still a country that faces deep institutional challenges as it tries to advance the cause of sustainability in the public and private sectors. As such, there can be no better country to host Rio+20 and the dialogues and debates that will shape the next 20 years of sustainable development.

When this occurs the effect is similar to that of opening a Venetian blind, allowing more of the Sun's rays to reach the Earth. Until now scientists were puzzled as to what caused the alignment, but new measurements show that electricity holds the key. The Cape Verde Islands, off the west coast of Africa, are frequently smothered in dust blowing off the Sahara desert. Last year atmospheric scientists Keri Nicoll and Giles Harrison, from the University of Reading, released special weather balloons into dust clouds above the islands and measured the electric charge, up to an altitude of 4km. Their measurements, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, showed that many of the dust particles were electrically charged, perhaps as a result of being battered by cosmic rays from outer Space, or maybe just from collisions between the particles. Theory suggests that the more the dust particles are charged, the more they could align, allowing more solar energy to pass through the gaps. Desert dust is known to have a significant influence on climate all over the world (the Sahara alone flings several hundred megatons of dust into the atmosphere every year) and this \"Venetian blind\" effect could play an important role, moderating the amount of solar energy that reaches Earth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/remap-minds-jeffrey-hollender","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-01T16:19:17Z","webTitle":"We have to remap our minds, says Hollender","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/remap-minds-jeffrey-hollender","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/remap-minds-jeffrey-hollender","fields":{"headline":"We have to remap our minds, says Hollender","bodyText":"Jeffrey Hollender has pioneered sustainable business in the US, racking up awards and appointments – most recently, Distinguished Fellow in Leadership and Ethics at the NYU Stern School of Business. Born in New York, he made his name in the 1980s as co-founder of Seventh Generation – a multi-million dollar non-toxic cleaning products company, recently named \"the seventh most responsible brand in America\" by an independent study. He went on to found the American Sustainable Business Council, a coalition of more than 200,000 business leaders, entrepreneurs and investors \"committed to public policies that support a vibrant, just, and sustainable economy\". Today, Hollender sits on the board of directors for ASBC – as well as for Greenpeace USA, the labour rights non-profit Verite, and the Environmental Health Fund. If anyone is well-placed to point out the way forward for sustainable business, in the US and globally, this man is. His vision for a better world is set out in six books. A lot of words for a message which is alarmingly simple: that we must try to understand how everything in life is connected, and use this understanding to be a positive force. Of course, if it were that easy, we'd be making better progress. So, in a recent conversation, I asked him what's getting in the way, and what we should do about it. Corporates have led the way on sustainable solutions, investing in research and innovation. But in your sixth book, 'The Responsibility Revolution', you say that this isn't enough. Why? When you look at the health of the planet – from fish stocks to water shortages – it's clear that all the positive changes we are making haven't turned around the trajectory of resource depletion. They have simply bought us more time. So, now there are two things we can do. We can prepare for the negative consequences. Or, we can shift our thinking towards regeneration and resilience. We have to do things that are good, and not merely less bad. But first, we need to know what doing good looks like. Unfortunately, we have mental frameworks which prompt us to look at individual attributes (fair trade, organic and so on) as opposed to seeing a more holistic picture. And we have created entire systems that incentivise progress in one area, without asking how it will bring us closer to wider goals. Take ethanol, for example. Thankfully, we are ending ethanol subsidies in the US, but we approached it as if anything you make from vegetables is good! We didn't look at the energy it takes to produce ethanol, or at food prices. We set about promoting a technology with large negative impacts. Government regulations are designed around specific attributes and concerns, instead of wider strategies and visions. Of course, there are sophisticated ways of looking at impact in the round, such as life cycle analysis. But these don't govern the way consumers think, the way businesses operate, or the way governments makes decisions. [So] we have to start a new conversation. We have to ask how we can do things that are net positive. It's an attractive idea: a world in which businesses actively boost our societies and ecosystems. Are there any examples out there? The example I keep coming back to is the Evergreen Cooperatives of Cleveland, Ohio. It's a group of for-profit companies – in solar energy, urban food and laundry – which aim to bring wealth into the community. Each company is owned by its employees, and this cooperative structure prevents assets leaking away to a concentrated group of wealthy individuals and businesses. The employees can choose to up and leave, but they can't take their shares away with them. The group was set up in 2010 by the grant-making Cleveland Foundation, the City Government, and 'anchor' institutions, including hospitals and universities. Local initiatives like this one make me feel most optimistic now. It's much easier to remain aware of the negative – and positive – impacts of anything you do when they show up in the community where you work! So the Evergreen Cooperatives do good by generating local wealth. But to what extent is wealth something to aim for? Growth is critical. But we live in societies that have become obsessive, wealth-concentrating machines. The more wealth is in the hands of a few people, the worse the overall impact on society. The very idea of individual wealth – as opposed to a wealth of shared resources – is dangerous, not just for the planet, but for business and for our very social fabric. I don't separate my concern for the planet from my concern for economic inequality, because they're both part of the same system. But we have compartmentalised responsibility. We feel we can fulfil our responsibility by writing a cheque to a charity. The rest of our impact is literally out of our consciousness, certainly out of our view. It's not a holistic perspective. So what we really want is healthy systems, with wealth generated to support them. Forum for the Future is bringing organisations together to rethink systems we depend on, but which you could say are broken – finance, food and energy. How important is it for us to understand these systems? I think understanding systems should be an integral part of our education system. Once you learn the endless connection between all things, it makes it really hard for you to behave in a way that ignores the implications. And going back to your old way of seeing things would feel like such a fundamental distortion of reality. If you can't teach kids systems thinking in first grade, you have to catch people wherever you can – and certainly in the workplace. At Seventh Generation, we taught every employee systems thinking – for very pragmatic business reasons! If employees don't understand how their work relates to their colleagues', you find you have two departments with separate goals that have a hard time functioning as part of a whole. But it can at times feel deeply challenging to subject your decisions to a completely systemic, holistic framework. When I'm walking down the aisle of a supermarket, I'm not able to make a systemic evaluation of everything I'm going to put in my shopping cart: it's just overwhelmingly complicated to do so. I say you have to understand the three places in your life where 50-70% of your impact is: the car you drive, your diet, for example. You have to be strategic so that you don't make yourself crazy about decisions like taking a plastic or paper bag at the grocery store. But for many people, 'systems thinking' is a new concept, and a bit of an obscure one. Where should they start? There's a wonderful book by Donella Meadows 'Thinking in Systems': that's probably the single best place for anyone to start. But, for me, there's just one thing which is absolutely critical, and that's the need to work together. Many of the forces (NGOs, businesses, researchers) trying to solve the problems we face are competing with each other, rather than collaborating. Think what could happen if the two million non-profits had collaboration as their number one objective, instead of each finding the 100th way to solve a problem. We need to spend more time on what unites us, and what actions help all of us move forward, even if it means going beyond our own personal priorities. Does political polarisation get in the way of collaboration in the US? Yes. It's deeply disturbing and saddening to see how polarised our conversation in the US has become. It's so polarised that it makes progress at times totally impossible, because we're unable to find a middle ground. A big part of the problem is the way in which we allow businesses to put money into politics. When businesses do this they disenfranchise individuals: there's no point in them trying to make their voices heard if big business can just write a big cheque. Another problem is that businesses are encouraged to externalise their costs. Take General Electric. GE employs aggressive strategies – all 'legal' – to reduce the amount it has to pay in taxes. One would think it would be shameful for a large corporation not to contribute to our education and our defence. It's a cultural problem, combined with a systemic problem, which is really worrisome to me. We have to find a way for companies in the US to see how they can work with society, not against it. Some European companies (Unilever, M&amp;S, Novo Nordisk) have achieved this understanding, with the help of Forum for the Future. But there are greater disincentives [over] here, which the Forum will no doubt face as it builds on its work with American businesses! Changing this culture – in particular the sense that money can buy exemption from shared responsibilities – will obviously be a huge challenge. What do you see happening today, that might help to shift things in the right direction? I am a believer in radical transparency. We can't solve the problems we face if we're not willing to recognise, in public, the problems we have in the first place. It is a problem that, in the business world, people want to talk about their successes but not about their failures. Most businesses are stuck in this difficult mindset that if they talk about the good, the bad and the ugly, no one will like them. But we learn just as much, if not more, from failures as we do from successes.

In a highly critical report, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (Imeche) said the first minister's target was poorly worked out, uncosted and unrealistic. Salmond had failed to properly explain how it could be achieved, said Tim Fox, the institution's head of energy and the environment. The target was \"very problematic\", Fox added, because it failed to explain how it would be met, paid for and supplied using new grid connections. \"The Scottish government needs to lay out a very clear, engineering-based plan on how they're going to have an energy mix which is secure and affordable for Scotland,\" he said. \"At the moment, there is no clear vision for the engineering of this infrastructure. Without a clear vision of what it's going to take to deliver it, it's impossible to put any credible cost against that.\" This week Citigroup said investing in Scottish renewables was extremely risky because Salmond's drive to make Scotland independent by 2015 raised far too much uncertainty about public funding. The bank said hitting the 100% target would need about £46bn of subsidy in total, an annual subsidy of £4bn and a doubling of green generating capacity in Scotland alone to 26Gw. An independent Scotland would put that subsidy \"at grave risk\". The two reports echo widespread misgivings in parts of the energy industry and banking sector about whether Salmond's plan to turn Scotland into the \"Saudi Arabia of renewables\" within the decade is achievable. He has won applause from green campaigners and renewables firms for vigorously championing green energy; industry sources argue that his ambition has built up confidence and excitement for green power. Al Gore, the climate campaigner and former US vice-president, heaped praise on Salmond in his speech to a Scottish government-sponsored conference on low-carbon investment in September. Several major green energy companies, including Mitsubishi and Doosan, have moved to Scotland. Imeche said it supported Salmond's goal of 100% renewables but warned there was a significant lack of credible detail and planning. Fox said there were significant doubts over whether the 2020 target could be met. Imeche said the Scottish government had failed to provide stable sources of renewable energy, such as biomass or geothermal power, to give baseload electricity supply when wind farms or solar energy failed to provide enough electricity during unfavourable weather. Scotland would instead have to import power from England or abroad, Imeche said. The report said infrastructure and market subsidies would \"quickly cost billions\", so pushing up fuel prices for ordinary consumers and increasing fuel poverty. The 100% target would also mean green energy sources needing to be built five times faster than the rate achieved in the past decade. Imeche said the most intelligent starting point was to cut demand and increase efficiency, before finding new energy sources. A Scottish government spokesman dismissed the criticisms, insisting it had published a very clear \"renewables routemap\" in June. He stressed the target was to generate the equivalent of 100% of its electricity from green sources, not provide that round the clock. \"We have always been clear about the need for baseload,\" he said. \"Our ambitious and achievable target is to generate the equivalent of 100% of Scotland's electricity needs from renewables by 2020, supported by cleaner fossil fuel baseload electricity, such as the recently consented gas power station at Cockenzie.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/dec/09/climate-change-impacts-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","webTitle":"Global warming will boost solar power in Europe but cause losses elsewhere | Duncan Clark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/dec/09/climate-change-impacts-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/dec/09/climate-change-impacts-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"Global warming will boost solar power in Europe but cause losses elsewhere","bodyText":"Amid all the discussion about how energy sources may impact on climate change, we often overlook the fact that climate change will in turn impact on energy sources. As the world warms, this will become an increasingly important issue, affecting everything from nuclear power stations needing cold water for cooling through to melting ice opening up new fossil fuel reserves in the Arctic. Given the current row about how much the UK should subsidise solar power, it was interesting to come across a scientific paper looking at how solar technologies will be affected by global warming in the coming century. The paper – published earlier this year but as far as I can see not covered anywhere in the mainstream media – predicts that Europe's potential for solar will increase. Perhaps more surprisingly, many other regions will see losses. The research, carried out by academics at the University of Leeds, examined the implications of a medium global warming scenario for temperatures and sunlight in different regions. Sunlight will be affected by changing cloud cover. The researchers then calculated what those changes would mean for the two main solar energy technologies: photovoltaic (PV) panels, which use semiconductors to convert sunlight directly into electricity; and concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, which use mirrors to focus sunlight onto a small area, generating heat that can then be converted into power. Of the specific areas assessed, Germany comes out best. According to the paper, the country – Europe's solar leader – can expect to see PV systems in 2080 producing around 3% more power than the same systems would today. Germany's potential for CSP will increase even more – by 10% – though from a very low baseline. The UK will see a small increase in the potential for both technologies. By contrast, Saudi Arabia and the south-west US face losses of 4–6% for both PV and CSP. The map below provides a fuller picture. It shows PV outputs in 2080, relative to the late 20th-century. Blue is a decrease; red is an increase. For PV, it seems, the losers outweigh the winners. Here's the same map for CSP. In this scenario, the increases and decreases are more evenly shared out, with large areas of Eurasia and the Americas looking likely to see increases. The reason for the different impact on the two technologies, the paper explains, is that while both of them respond well to rising solar insolation, only CSP also responds well to rising temperatures. Indeed, PV actually works better in cooler conditions. It's important to note that the changes listed above are relative. In absolute terms, it will still be far more efficient to put up a solar panel and plant in Marrakech than in Manchester. As the paper makes clear: \"Solar power plants are and will continue to be located close to centres of population within the Earth's sun belt of 40N to 40S.\" Nonetheless, the findings will impact on the economics of solar going forward and may affect the optimal technology mix in different areas. For example, according to the study, North Africa – the proposed home of the giant Desertec solar project – looks set to become better for CSP and less good for PV. Rolf Crook, one of the researchers behind the paper, believes the findings lend weight to the case for solar subsidies in Europe. He said: \"We have shown, perhaps surprisingly, that climate change will have a positive impact on the output of solar power plants in many parts of the world. This further strengthens the case for research and investment in solar power today. Subsidies play a vital role in driving down the cost of solar technology. Cutting subsidies would only have a negative effect.\" Download the data • DATA: download the spreadsheet More open data Data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian World government data • Search the world's government data with our gateway Development and aid data • Search the world's global development data with our gateway Can you do something with this data? • Flickr Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our Flickr group • Contact us at data@guardian.co.uk • Get the A-Z of data • More at the Datastore directory • Follow us on Twitter • Like us on Facebook"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2011/jun/14/hugh-muir-diary-michael-gove","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-14T21:44:01Z","webTitle":"Hugh Muir's diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jun/14/hugh-muir-diary-michael-gove","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2011/jun/14/hugh-muir-diary-michael-gove","fields":{"headline":"Diary","bodyText":"• It's all at the Co-op, said Big Dave before the election, when it didn't really matter. But now he's in a position to show just how much the people are the masters, it all seems to have gone somewhere else. Got to be a good idea for this caring, sharing, localist government to allow people to band together to arrange their energy supplies, thought the Labour and Co-operative party MP Luciana Berger. So she moved an amendment to the energy bill to ensure co-ops and mutuals \"have equal access to the market for supply and installation of energy efficiency measures\" under the much-heralded green deal. \"I hope there is broad agreement among all members of the committee that we do not want to exclude from the green deal the charities, co-operatives, mutuals and social enterprises that want to benefit our communities and focus resources on vulnerable people or households in fuel poverty,\" she said. But she was wrong. The coalition was whipped to vote no. But perhaps she shouldn't have been surprised at the dissonance between the coalition's rhetoric and its practical policies. For in opposition, Conservatives and Lib Dems demanded the Labour government give funding to support the development of larger solar energy co-operatives. They have now announced plans to slash support for larger new solar energy co-operatives so as to give greater support to solar panels on the roofs of individual homeowners. The \"big society\"? What's that again? • But then we assume hypocrisy and mendacity when the truth may be that they just don't know what they are doing. Certainly that was the impression gained as the same committee voted through a Labour amendment to have a specific apprenticeship scheme included as part of the green deal. The plan was for the Tories to vote it down, and whip Shailesh Vara knew that. Unfortunately few of his colleagues did, and it would appear that the plan lost something in the telling. So when committee chair Edward Leigh called a vote, the Tories stared at each other in blind panic and, lacking any clear direction, abstained. Labour won by default. They are still triumphant. They take their victories as and when. • Good old Michael Gove. One minute the education secretary is singling out Michael Wilkins, the superhead of Outwood Grange, in Wakefield, as a \"great school leader\". The next Wilkins, thus blighted, is embroiled in controversy. He faces disputed claims from an auditor – unearthed by an FOI request by the Yorkshire Post – that the academy school had a rewards culture, including thousands spent on alcohol, hotels and overseas trips. Also claims, again disputed, that the head received payments that were \"not legitimate\". Outwood insists all expenditure and payments were above board, but it's all a bit distracting. Is Gove the bad luck charm of the coalition? • Watch out, rage alert. \"Plastic Brits are using Team GB to fulfil their own Olympic dreams,\" screams the Daily Mail's Martin Samuel. \"Team GB's cheating is more a convenient manipulation of the rules, coming together with our colonial past, to create the option of securing the best of America's cast-offs, plus the odd Caribbean ringer.\" And who set the precedent for all this nationalistic jiggery-pokery? Why, 'twas the Daily Mail, which moved heaven and earth to get South African Zola Budd Britified for the 1984 Olympic Games. She was their kind of immigrant, and she fitted right in nicely. The only flaw in the plan: she didn't win. • Finally, people worry about so many things during this terrible downturn, the great and the good included. Charles Moore of the Telegraph and the Spectator hankers after a top hat made of silk. \"It is an odd thing when there is so much money in the world that it is now impossible to buy such a hat new,\" writes Charles in the Speccie, having seen Prince Harry wearing one at the Derby. \"I discovered this years ago because none of my family's elderly top hats fitted.\" A secondhand one my size costs £2,000,\" says Charles. \"There is a demand here waiting to be satisfied.\" And there is.

You wouldn't necessarily think so if you listen to the very vocal, media-driven opposition against, say, wind power, but a recent YouGov survey commissioned by the Sunday Times suggests the true picture might be a little different. The Sunday Times itself chose not to report the YouGov findings related to renewables (you can draw your own conclusions as to why), but if you look beyond the headline polling about the 1,696 respondents' political leanings you start to reach some rather intriguing environmentally themed results from page seven onwards (pdf). For example, asked (over the period 24-25 November) if they would support or oppose a high-speed rail link between London and Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, the response was 54% in support and 27% in opposition. For a new airport in the Thames Estuary, 30% were supportive and 48% opposed. (The split among respondents in London was 50% / 34%, respectively.) But the real point of interest can be found on page nine, which asks: \"Thinking about the country's future energy provision, do you think the government should be looking to use more or less of the following?\" Solar power More than at present - 74% Less than at present - 6% Maintain current levels - 12% Not sure - 9% Wind farms More than at present - 56% Less than at present - 19% Maintain current levels - 15% Not sure - 9% Nuclear power stations More than at present - 35% Less than at present - 27% Maintain current levels - 23% Not sure - 15% Oil power stations More than at present - 10% Less than at present - 47% Maintain current levels - 27% Not sure - 17% Coal power stations More than at present - 16% Less than at present - 43% Maintain current levels - 25% Not sure - 17% It then asks: \"Do you think the government is right or wrong to subsidise wind farms to encourage more use of wind power?\" Right 60% Wrong 26% Don't know 15% Do you think increased use of wind power is or is not a realistic way of combating climate change? Realistic 47% Not realistic 36% Don't know 16% Do you think increased use of solar power is or is not a realistic way of combating climate change? Realistic 67% Not realistic 18% Don't know 15% Over at BusinessGreen, James Murray describes the survey results as \"explosive\", especially given that they \"follow months during which the right-wing press has waged an increasingly virulent campaign against climate change, wind farms, renewable energy, and the green levies that pay for it\". (See Duncan Clark's assessment of how \"UK newspaper coverage is skewed against renewables\".) As Murray correctly points out, it is worth the time drilling down into the various demographic, political and regional breakdowns of the results. For example, you see a clear age bias when it comes to wind farms. As the age of the respondent increases, their support for wind falls, but not to the point where the majority of the \"60+\" grouping are against it. The older respondents tend to be more supportive of nuclear energy, too. But support for solar energy is near equal across all age groups. It is worth noting the political differences, too. For example, 43% of Conservative voters say they want more wind farms than at present, compared to 62% of Labour voters and 70% of Liberal Democrat voters. Equally, Conservative voters are noticeably more supportive of nuclear energy than Labour or Lib Dem voters. But, somewhat counter-intuitively, support for wind farms is lowest among London-based respondents (49%) compared to areas that might consider themselves more at risk of being \"blighted\" by wind farms, say, Midland/Wales (57%) and Scotland (59%). Sadly, the survey doesn't distinguish between urban, suburban and rural residents, as those results might have provided extra illumination. When it comes to subsidising wind farms (it doesn't distinguish between off- and on-shore wind), 18-24 voters are far more supportive (70%) than 60+ voters (48%). YouGov didn't ask the same question of solar power (or nuclear, for that matter). James Murray describes the survey's findings as the \"best kind of early Christmas present\" for the \"government's green agenda\". I'm not sure I would go that far – it is only one snapshot survey, after all – but it does provide grist to the theory that there is a danger that the vocal minority (and their powerful media allies) who oppose investment in renewable energy shouldn't be allowed to drown out the views of the silent majority who seemingly favour such an approach."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/2011/dec/03/new-green-alliance-savages-osborne","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-03T20:32:00Z","webTitle":"New green alliance in savage attack on George Osborne","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/03/new-green-alliance-savages-osborne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2011/dec/03/new-green-alliance-savages-osborne","fields":{"headline":"New green alliance in savage attack on George Osborne","bodyText":"An extraordinary alliance of countryside campaigners, wildlife groups and green activists has launched a savage onslaught on the government, accusing it of showing \"stunning disregard\" for the environment. The attack – backed by organisations including the RSPB and the Campaign to Protect Rural England – is a significant embarrassment for David Cameron who claimed at the last election that his would be the \"greenest government ever\". However, in letters to the Observer, green groups – including the umbrella organisation the Wildlife Trusts, which has more than 800,000 members – ridicule this claim and vent their fury over last week's autumn statement by George Osborne. With the government outlining cuts in solar energy subsidies, reforming planning regulations and introducing tax support for energy-intensive industries, the chancellor's rhetoric has infuriated the green lobby. \"Following the chancellor's autumn statement, we can say that the coalition is on a path to becoming the most environmentally destructive government to hold power in this country since the modern environmental movement was born,\" states one letter, signed by the green campaigners George Monbiot, Tony Juniper, Jonathon Porritt, Caroline Lucas, leader of the Green Party, and others. A second letter, from the heads of the RSPB, Greenpeace and others, says: \"The stunning disregard shown for the value of the natural environment not only flies in the face of popular opinion but goes against everything the government said in June, when it launched two major pieces of environmental policy – the natural environment white paper and the England biodiversity strategy.\" The backlash comes as serious tensions are developing inside the Tory/Liberal Democrat coalition over green policy. The Observer understands that the Liberal Democrat energy secretary, Chris Huhne, was not consulted by Osborne about his comments in the autumn statement. In terms that many MPs saw as at odds with the government's professed enthusiasm for the environment, Osborne told the Commons last Tuesday: \"We are not going to save the planet by shutting down our steel mills, aluminium smelters and paper manufacturers. All we will be doing is exporting valuable jobs out of Britain.\" Osborne also said he wanted to ensure that \"gold plating of EU rules on things like habitats\" was not putting \"ridiculous costs\" on firms. Several leading Liberal Democrats are furious, and fear that the government is backtracking on its commitments. One minister said he could not understand Osborne's behaviour. The minister said: \"If George goes down this route, he fires an Exocet missile right through David Cameron's political integrity.\" Tim Yeo, the Tory chairman of the energy and climate committee, said: \"We are getting a change of rhetoric, with more emphasis on the burdens that green projects could put on the economy. But it is out of step with what the government is doing, much of which is radical and forward-looking.\" Labour claimed on Saturday that the Tories were undergoing a \"retoxification\" as they abandon the softer image they promoted before the last general election. The dispute intensified as delegates gathered for the latest climate change summit in Durban. The meeting's goal of further progress on global emissions is unlikely to be met as developed nations continue to fret over their own domestic financial woes. Earlier this year the government infuriated many traditional Conservative party supporters when it emerged that it was planning to sell many of the nation's forests. Following an outcry from countryside and environmental groups the policy was abandoned. Since then it has been locked in an equally damaging row over plans to loosen planning controls that many Tories feel would threaten the countryside. Now environmentalists fear more damage from large-scale developments – including port and road schemes. They cite the north Norfolk coast, the North Yorkshire moors, the Wye valley and the Salisbury plain as large areas of natural and untouched beauty that could be under threat. Many Tories are also concerned about potential environmental damage from the proposed HS2 highspeed rail line between London and Birmingham. The transport secretary, Justine Greening, is expected to announce a delay in the final decision on the project this week in order to examine whether funding estimated at £500m could be used to pay for a new tunnel under the Chiltern hills. A treasury spokesman said: \"This is the government that introduced the first green investment banks, the carbon price floor and the green deal. Our planning reforms strike the right balance between protecting our countryside [and] permitting economic development that creates jobs.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/nov/28/george-osborne-green-energy-economy-budget-report-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-11-28T16:06:56Z","webTitle":"From the 99% to the 1%: Osborne bails out the energy fat cats | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/nov/28/george-osborne-green-energy-economy-budget-report-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/nov/28/george-osborne-green-energy-economy-budget-report-industry","fields":{"headline":"From the 99% to the 1%: Osborne bails out the energy fat cats","bodyText":"Stealing from the 99% to give to the 1%: sound familiar? Chancellor George Osborne has found a new way to siphon money from the public purse into the pockets of some of the richest businesses on Earth. He has been aided and abetted by business secretary Vince Cable who, a senior civil servant told me, has been \"utterly captured\" by the corporate lobbyists. Their craven capitulation to the special pleading of the energy intensive users defies all economic sense and only adds up in one place: the account books of the lobbyists. In Tuesday's pre-budget statement, Osborne will hand out about £250m of taxpayers money to steel, cement, chemical and other industries that use a lot of power. The main aim is to \"protect\" them from the European Union's emissions trading scheme. This is beyond parody: the shameless industrial lobbying in Brussels so weakened the EU ETS that the energy-intensive giants are already wallowing in an estimated €4bn windfall of carbon pollution permits. The European Commission estimates this will rise to €7bn-€12bn by the end of 2012. But these colossal cash mountains would be enough to keep jobs in those companies safe, you might think. You'd be wrong. In May, Tata Steel announced it was sacking 1,500 workers in the UK and blamed \"EU carbon legislation\". At the same time, Tata had banked almost €400m of free money from EU carbon legislation. As a very senior UK businessman said to me: \"Powerful people pretending to be victims is really, really offensive.\" What's worse is that the energy-intensive industries is a little tail wagging the UK dog, according to Tim Yeo MP, the influential chair of the commons energy select committee. He calls them \"past masters at special pleading.\" These industries generate about 13% of the UK's carbon emissions, but just 1% of GDP and provide about 145,000 jobs in the UK (0.5%), according to a report by the government's official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change. If you prefer an estimate from the ferociously anti-green Taxpayers Alliance, the number is 225,000. That's a lot of jobs. But compared to the green economy, it's small beer. A study for the department of business found low-carbon and environmental goods and services employed 910,000. The green sector generated £112 billion a year, about 7% of GDP, with half of that revenue in the low carbon and about a third in renewable energy. There's more. The business minister told parliament this month that the solar power industry (PV only) had \"£5 billion of sales in 2009-10, employing 39,000 across 2,000 businesses.\" The department for energy and climate change expect its Green deal to make homes warmer and more energy efficient to provide 65,000 jobs by 2015. Ask yourself this: is your childrens future in steel, cement and coal, or renewables, energy efficiency and low-carbon transport. We have a government in thrall to a declining sector of industry and throwing yet more of your cash at these international mega-businesses. In the larger and fast-growing green economy, they are slashing subsidies for solar energy by far more than costs are falling, and creating a Green investment bank that can't borrow. The government is bailing out the big polluters, while bailing out from supporting those helping the nation achieve its legally binding emissions targets, curbing climate change and delivering a secure, sustainable economy. Why? Because while the Chancellor in his desperation for economic growth has now taken to putting government subsidies into almost anything he can lay his hands on, those items which have green labels attached are often left on the shelf. The 20th century economics that pervades the Treasury is one reason, the poisonous and pervasive lies spread by corporate lobbyists and their ideological allies are another. But perhaps Osborne will yet retain the last remaining scraps of credibilty for the government which wanted to be the \"greenest ever\". He promised as much in September. We should get the details of the infrastructure projects into which he hopes to plough money on Tuesday. Renewable energy and railways would be welcome, and particularly flood defence schemes, which the government has recvklessly slashed. On the other hand, dirty power stations and lots of roads would be unwelcome. At the heart of it all is the familiar \"jam today\" political paradox. Voters will welcome Osborne's largesse in sparing them a planned 3p rise in fuel duty. But when it come to investing for a future in which the nation is not helpless on the hook of soaring fossil fuels prices, voters are incensed. Any politician, however feeble, can sell the former. Only strong, independent ones can sell the latter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/26/solar-textiles-remote-villages","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-26T14:09:00Z","webTitle":"Solar textiles bring light to remote villages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/26/solar-textiles-remote-villages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/26/solar-textiles-remote-villages","fields":{"headline":"Solar textiles bring light to remote villages","bodyText":"Portable solar-powered lights that combine nanotechnology with local crafts could help bring electricity to some of the nearly two billion people without access to electricity. The Portable Light Project, a non-profit initiative led by Kennedy &amp; Violich Architecture and Global Solar Energy, in the United States, inserts tiny solar cells into shirts, woven items and bags produced by remote communities in developing countries. The project aims to integrate clean energy and lighting with indigenous textile production. This helps local communities adopt the new technology and add value to it through their own work. The project provides kits — containing a thin, two watt solar film, rechargeable battery, USB port, and an LED light — and training on how to weave them into garments. Integration with the textiles allows the batteries and devices such as mobile phones to be charged on the move, as people go about their daily work, and LED lights enable communities to work and study after dark. \"You simply put it [the textile with solar cells] out in the sun for about three hours. It harvests the sunlight and turns it into electricity. Then you can use it for up to seven hours,\" Sheila Kennedy, the Boston-based architect who leads the project, told SciDev.Net. Pilot projects are underway in Brazil, Kenya, Haiti, Nicaragua, Madagascar, Mexico and South Africa, in collaboration with local non-governmental organisations (NGOs). For example, in the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico the nomadic Huichol people charge solar lanterns during the day and use them to light their houses at night, which allows them to engage in artisanal cottage industries and later sell their products in towns. The Nicaraguan NGO Paso Pacifico helps the project provide electricity to two villages. \"Now children can study in the evening and women can carry out household work safely,\" Sarah Otterstrom, Paso Pacifico's director, told SciDev.Net. Otterstrom said people in the village no longer need to buy diesel or batteries to light their houses. \"Now they are asking for more lights,\" she added. Kennedy said they have half the carbon footprint of normal solar cells during production, and are smaller, lighter and more resilient. Although there is still no economic model for mass production to meet global electricity needs for remote communities, the estimated price of US$16 per item can be paid off in a year via microloans, according to Kennedy. Brazilian sociologist Paulo Martins, who studies the social impacts of nanotechnology, told SciDev.Net that integrating textiles with solar energy is a global trend. \"We need to keep it available at affordable costs to the ones who really need it,\" he said. This is a good example of targeting science to local needs, he added. \"[In Brazil] we invest huge amounts of money in technologies that can make our country a major player in global markets … But we constantly forget to develop science in a way that suits our true social needs.\" Frederik Krebs of the Risø National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy in Denmark, who designed a low-cost, plastic solar lamp for Africa, expressed caution. \"All our studies indicate that a high degree of ruggedness is needed before it [portable solar lights] can help people in developing regions,\" he said. In his opinion, such garments are \"simply not wearable enough yet.\" However, Harish Hande, head of India's SELCO Solar — a social enterprise taking sustainable power to households and businesses that tested Portable Lights garments — praised their portability, flexibility and light quality. But he said while it can help power off-grid communities it is not a complete solution in itself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/06/investment-clean-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-06T11:09:30Z","webTitle":"Investment in US clean technology highest since 2008","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/06/investment-clean-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/06/investment-clean-technology","fields":{"headline":"Investment in US clean technology highest since 2008","bodyText":"Global investment in US clean technology has reached its highest level since 2008, while investment in UK companies has dropped sharply, quarterly figures show. Increasing investor confidence and rising oil prices have helped investment in North American companies more than double compared with the previous quarter, according to a report by Cleantech Group, an international firm that works to accelerate the development and market adoption of clean technologies. Sheera Haji, CEO of Cleantech Group, said: \"I absolutely think rising oil prices have had some important impacts. We've seen decent uptake in transportation.\" He added: \"We're seeing a good rebound as public markets are doing well, companies are doing well, and investors are raising funds and investing them. We're also seeing a real skew towards bigger deals.\" While North America flourishes, investment in companies in Europe and Israel dropped by 60% compared with the previous quarter. Investment in British companies has plummeted to its lowest level since 2003, with only nine deals secured all year. Haji described the period as a \"very weak\" quarter for the UK. He said: \"I have not been following the UK closely, but there's been some uncertainty around what's happening in the UK – around the economic recovery and growth – and that has impacted on the vibrancy of the start-up economy.\" The news comes a week after a report from the US Pew Environment Group showed that Britain's private investments in green energy projects fell by 70% last year, causing it to fall from third to 13th place in the league of countries developing clean technology. Haji said Japan's nuclear crisis could have a \"pretty significant impact\" on the next set of quarterly figures, and that it may boost investment in clean technology and coal.

By the real deal I mean photovoltaic (PV) systems that convert sunlight into electricity as opposed to rather prosaic solar thermal systems that heat water. Last year just 6MW of solar PV was installed in this country. Compare and contrast the situation in Germany, where more than 1,500MW was installed last year and one in 10 buildings has a solar power system. This is ludicrous because solar PV could provide 30-40% of the UK's total electricity needs by 2050, reducing CO2 emissions by 15% a year. An average domestic system (a fairly modest 1.8kWp PV system) can provide at least 25% of a household's energy. The sticking point has been the expense. Luckily there are sunnier days ahead. We've been waiting years for a Feed-in Tariff scheme (rebranded as the Clean Energy Cash Back Scheme), and now it is expected to arrive in April 2010. This will guarantee domestic PV installations 36.5 pence per kw hour of electricity they feed back into the grid, probably for around 25 years. However campaign groups, notably We Support Solar (www.wesupportsolar.net), say that this is too miserly given that 36.5p represents just a 4% return on income for most domestic installations. They believe 8% would be nearer the mark. Still, even 4% is preferable to a poke in the eye, which is what's being offered to those brave pioneers who became adopters of solar PV from 2002. If plans go through, they'll get just 9p for their surplus output. You would, however, be able to enjoy the more generous tariff and possibly a grant (£10m is available until April via the Low Carbon Buildings Programme in the form of £2,500 per household – go to www.lowcarbonbuildings.org.uk). And you'll be able to take advantage of the fact that solar panels have come down in price. According to Sharp, a UK-based solar-module manufacturer, units are 30% cheaper than a year ago. You can get different types to stick on or integrate into your roof, not just the traditional crystalline cells using reject silicon from the electronics industry. The new wave is full of efficient, sleek models. Some look uncannily like normal roof tiles. Thanks to a recession in Spain (a voracious PV consumer) there are lots around. Visit the rooftop garden at Solar Century (www.solarcentury.co.uk) in London to see them up close. But in the solar rush, remember to purchase responsibly. PV cells are far from ecologically innocuous, as they contain a concoction of toxic conductors. They should be manufactured in a closed-loop system to high environmental standards (www.sharp.co.uk). They also remain the only renewable really attuned to normal life. You can add them on to a house without incurring the wrath of planning departments or undertaking huge civil engineering projects. Solar PV systems are good house guests, and the clouds are definitely clearing.★ lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2014/mar/11/bank-of-england-governor-grilling-forex-rigging-scandal-co-op-boss-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-03-11T18:50:31Z","webTitle":"Bank of England quizzed over forex rigging allegations - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/11/bank-of-england-governor-grilling-forex-rigging-scandal-co-op-boss-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2014/mar/11/bank-of-england-governor-grilling-forex-rigging-scandal-co-op-boss-live","fields":{"headline":"Bank of England quizzed over forex rigging allegations - as it happened","bodyText":"And that’s all for tonight. A quick reminder of the key points: Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has warned that the FX rigging scandal is at least as bad as Libor, as the BoE mounted a defence of its handling of the crisis. Here’s our summary Treasury committee chairman Andrew Tyrie has responded, saying the Bank must reassure the public that it is handling the crisis well, having labelled its governance structure “opaque, complex and Byzantine”. As my colleague Katie Allen flags up, Carney didn’t argue that the Bank is in a spot: Tyrie also criticised the BoE for routinely destroys recordings of its meetings. Earlier, Carney said UK interest rates could rise, finally, to 2.5% within three years, as MPs exposed differences within the MPC over the state of the UK economy. The other key main events are: The Co-op Group has lurched deeper into crisis, with the resignation of CEO Euan Sutherland from the “ungovernable” bank. Tributes have been paid to one of Britain’s most influential union leaders, Bob Crow of the RMT, after he died aged 52 today. Fears over China have sent the copper price sliding again today.....and oil has also fallen. The OECD has predicted that the UK will grow faster than its major rivals in the first six months of 2014. The president of Cyprus has appointed a new central bank president, Chrystalla Georghadji, to succeed Panicos Demetriades who resigned last night. Back tomorrow. Thanks, as ever, for reading and commenting. GW Another important story to flag up tonight -the OECD has predicted that Britain’s economy will grow fast than the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada over the first half of this year. The Paris-based body expects to see growth equal to an annual rate of 3.3% between January and the end of June -or around 0.8% in both Q1 and Q2. OECD predicts UK recovery will be strongest in G7 over first half of 2014 The drop in the copper price casts a shadow over the City tonight, where the FTSE 100 finished slightly lower at 6685, down 4 points. My colleague Nick Fletcher reports: Leading shares continued their losing streak, down for the third trading day in a row after late jitters sent copper prices lower and hit the mining sector. For much of the day, markets had been edging higher but lurking concerns about tensions in Ukraine and an economic slowdown in China refused to die down and finally got the upper hand. Added to that came talk of another possible Chinese corporate bond default, pushing Wall Street lower in early trading and sending many European markets into reverse. By the close the FTSE 100 had dipped 3.93 points to 6685.52, having earlier climbed as high at 6718. With copper falling to a four year low at one point on the Chinese worries, Antofagasta fell 18.5p to 840p and BHP Billiton lost 10p to £18.12. Market report: FTSE 100 falls for third day as late Chinese jitters hit copper price Those global growth fears are also pushing the oil price down. US crude (NYMEX) just fell to $100/barrel, a drop of around 1%, for the first time since mid-February. The copper price has slumped to its lowest level since July 2010 this afternoon, as fears over China’s economy continue to gnaw at investors. Copper fell another 2%, extending losses suffered on Monday. Traders continued to be spooked by data showing Chinese exports fell 1.7% in January, suggesting a sharper slowdown in the economy. Another factor is speculation that China could see more domestic bond defaults -- following the first one ever, Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology -- last week. Analysts are warning that further defaults could send more copper flowing into the markets, as the metal is used as collateral in many opaque loans made in China’s shadow banking sector (Reuters has more details) Developments in the eurozone today -- Cyprus’s outgoing central Bank chief, who resigned yesterday, has hit back at government’s accusations that he mishandled the Mediterranean island’s near economic collapse. President Nikos Anastasiades, meanwhile, has wasted no time appointing a replacement to Panicos Demetriades. Our correspondent Helena Smith explains all: In a further sign of his no nonsense approach to life, politics and business, Cyprus’ president needed barely 15 hours to appoint a successor to disgraced former central bank governor Panicos Demetriades. The centre-right leader, who had been openly at war with the outgoing bank chief, an appointee of his own predecessor and unrepentant communist Demetris Christofias, said in a brief statement issued by the presidential palace that he had decided to install auditor general, Chrystalla Georghadji, to the post. A seasoned technocrat, educated in both the US and UK, Ms Georghadji has a fierce reputation as another no-nonsense figure on the island as the head of an anti-corruption watchdog who regularly reports on misuse of public funds. It will be music to the ears of mission chiefs representing bailed out Cyprus’ lenders at the EU, ECB and IMF, that she is a big advocate of scaling back the island’s public sector and pressing ahead with the overhaul of its near defunct banking system. The 58-year-old will officially assume the role on April 11, a day after Demetriades leaves the post as prescripted by European Central Bank law. The presidential palace said ECB head, Mario Draghi, who had previously expressed disquiet over Anastastiades’ handling of the governor, had been apprised of the appointment. With her well-established track record as an independent and autonomous figure, Georghadji’s appointment is clearly aimed at dashing notions that she is a political appointee who will simply follow the president’s line. But Demetriades’ unexpected decision to step down – and his cursory replacement – could set a precedent in the way nation governments treat central bank governors, insiders say. From the outset the former Leicester University economics professor has made no secret of the fact this his “dysfunctional relationship” with Anastasiades and other central Bank board members had hindered his role in the post. This morning, as it emerged that he had also been given a €250,000 payoff (to enforce his resignation) he hit back with a statement that not only cited “personal and family reasons” for his resignation but rejected accusations that he had failed to take adequate steps ahead of the island’s spectacular banking collapse last spring. Despite the mudslinging – and there has been plenty of it over the past year – Demetriades, who leaves the position less than two years into his five-year tenure, said he had always aimed to act in the island republic’s best interests by ensuring the stability of its financial system. The statement released by Demetriades’s office reads: “It was a privilege to serve as Governor of the CBC. During my tenure my actions were always aimed at ensuring confidence and stability in our financial system and I always acted in the best interests of our country. “Ι wish the CBC every success and I have every confidence that Cyprus will soon restore its financial strength.” In other news... the National Institute of Economic and Social Research has predicted that the UK economy picked up pace a little last month. NIESR estimates that GDP grew by 0.8% in the three months to February, compared with 0.7% in the October-January quarter. The thinktank also believes the UK will finally reach its pre-crisis peak before the end of 2014. Andrew Tyrie has just issued his official response to today’s hearing --criticising the Bank of England for destroying recordings of MPC meetings, and over its inquiry over the forex rigging issue: On MPC records “I have yet to hear a good argument against keeping verbatim records of MPC meetings, published with a long time lag - probably longer than the maximum term of an external member. “There seem to me to be a good number of arguments for keeping such records, among them, to bolster public confidence that the minutes published after MPC hearings are an accurate reflection of what was said.” On the Bank’s forex inquiry “This is the first real test for the Bank of England’s new governance structures. Early signs are not encouraging. “It has taken some time for the Bank’s Oversight Committee to take the lead on accusations of misconduct relating to forex. “Any review commissioned by the Oversight Committee must be demonstrably independent. It should have a remit broad enough to ensure no stone will be left unturned. “The Committee will look closely at the mandate and terms of reference of the work commissioned from Travers Smith to ensure that it provides for comprehensive coverage and independence. “The public needs confidence that the Bank’s governance structures will ensure that it gets to the bottom of forex-related misconduct allegations. The public also needs confidence that any misconduct in other areas will be discovered.” The other surprising thing we learned today is that the Bank destroys the recordings of the Monetary Policy Committee’s meetings. This, it says, is because transcripts were hard to follow -- and their existence might deter MPC members from holding a free-flowing debate. I’m tempted to call today’s event a ‘marathon’ session, but a world-class athlete could actually have rattled off 26 miles in half the time it took the Treasury committee to quiz Mark Carney and colleagues. Today’s mega session covered three important issues -- monetary policy, Scottish independence, and the foreign exchange rigging scandal. More of a slow roast than a grilling. But we learned quite a bit - here’s the key points. • The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has warned allegations that foreign exchange rates were manipulated are “extremely serious”, as he and senior colleague Paul Fisher defend the BoE’s role in the affair. Carney told the Treasury committee: This is extremely serious. As Martin Wheatley [FCA chief] has rightly said this is as serious as Libor if not more so because this goes to the heart of integrity of markets and we have to establish the integrity of markets. Time will tell.” Carney also told MPs that the Bank would issue a report to the G20 over the issue, underlining its importance. Ensuring the probity of the foreign exchange rates is “incredibly important” for the FX market and “fundamentally important” for the credibility of the Bank of England itself, Carney added. • Carney also revealed that the Bank will appoint a new deputy governor, with responsibility for markets and banking. Their first job is to “conduct a root-and-branch review of how we conduct market intelligence,” he said. • The Bank’s executive director for markets, Paul Fisher, denied that the Bank had known in 2006 that FX rates were being rigged. Fisher told the committee that eight-year old minutes, released last week, only showed City traders griping that hedge funds were manipulating the daily FX fix -- not that there was collusion between traders to rig it. Fisher argued: It would be very odd for traders to have come to these meetings and said ‘we’ve been rigging the market, what do you think?’. • But MPs expressed deep concern over the Bank’s conduct. Andrea Leadsom criticised the BoE for not acting years ago, when concerns were first raised. She suggested it had learned little from previous wrong-doing -- prompting Fisher to reply that it’s not the Bank’s job to look for market rigging. • MPs also demanded to know why an unnamed Bank staff member was suspended last week, but the line manager -- Paul Fisher himself -- had not been. Carney said there was no reason at this stage to “escalate” the issue, insisting that the staffer suspended was not facing any disciplinary action. That suspension relates to “the keeping of our rigorous internal control procedures, including around records management and escalation,” he said. • Carney was asked about reports last weekend that the Bank might appoint a senior external figure to handle its inquiry. The governor said he couldn’t say if this is true, as he’s not on the Bank’s oversight committee, but said he believes it makes to enlist such an outsider to lead the inquiry. • Carney also revealed that the Bank was first alerted on 16 October that it could have been aware of FX manipulation, and acted swiftly by engaging external lawyers. And on Scotland.... • Earlier in the session, the governor said there was a “distinct possibility” that Royal Bank of Scotland would have to move its HQ from Edinburgh if Scotland votes for independence. He also spoke about the importance of fiscal union underpinning successful currency unions, pointing to the eurozone crisis. • And discussing monetary policy, Mark Carney insisted he had ‘no regrets’ over his forward guidance that interest rates won’t rise until the economy is stronger. He also suggested UK interest rates could have risen to 2.5% in three years, and said it would not start to unwind its QE bond-buying programme until interest rates had been raised several times. • The session also exposed difference between MPC members over the size of the UK’s output gap - Carney said it was probably more than 1.5% of GDP, but Martin Weale said it is likely to be under 1%. • There’s an earlier summary of the first 2 hours of the session. You can see the minutes of those 2006 meetings between the Bank and its Chief Dealers subgroup on the Bank’s website: here. Here’s one crucial paragraph: It was noted that there was evidence of attempts to move the market around popular fixing times by players that had no particular interest in that fix. This was not in the interest of customers if the market was forced away from where it should be when the fixing snapshot was taken. It was noted that ‘fixing business’ generally was becoming increasingly fraught due to this behaviour. That’s what Andrea Leadsom was citing, when she asked why talk of ‘efforts to move the market’ didn’t set alarm bells ringing at Threadneedle Street. Andrew Tyrie, who has steered the Treasury Committee since 2010, ends the session by chiding Mark Carney and Paul Fisher over the way the Bank of England has handled the FX scandal. Tyrie said the session (coverage begins here) had exposed that the Bank’s governance structure -- which was meant to be bolstered since the financial crisis - is “still opaque, complex and byzantine” and must be fixed. It is now facing its first test... and it’s not doing very well, Tyrie concluded. Mark Carney suggested the Bank could perhaps learn from the IMF’s own internal evaluation office. And that is that - after a session that began at 9.29am.... Summary to follow.... Andrew Tyrie puts his finger on one key issue -- the line manager of the Bank of England employee suspended while the FX probe takes place is one Paul Fisher. Has Mr Fisher at all involved in the Bank’s inquiry? Fisher says he is not, and is also not privy to the details of the internal probe - “just in case” it is escalated to include investigating him. Andrea Leadsom homes in on the key issue -- exactly what was contained in the minutes of meetings between the Bank and FX traders in 2006, that were released last week. Paul Fisher insists that those minutes do NOT show collusion between traders -- only ‘manipulation’ of rates by people who are not market setters. Leadsom wants to know the difference -- Fisher explains that in 2006, FX traders were complaining that hedge funds were putting large FX orders through the system around the 4pm London fix (when the official daily rate is set). Those large orders would move the market against the dealer -- who could potentially run up losses if the markets move against them. But as Tyrie points out that minutes from 2008 also highlighted concerns that the market could be subject to manipulation. Leadsom is clearly unconvinced by Fisher’s argument -- if the meeting showed signs of manipulation, why on earth didn’t the bank act? Especially once the Libor scandal gave a clear signal of how markets could be manipulated. At this point, Mark Carney steps in to explain the distinction between the complaints in 2006 and 2008, and the allegations that broke in 2013. FX traders want a quiet life, he tells the MPs - and hedge funds putting large orders through the systems messes up their chances of guaranteeing they can deliver the 4pm fix to their clients. Later, Carney says, some appear to have decided to cheat and collude to make their lives easier (and richer, one MP suggests). Carney concludes: That is not acceptable, and has to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Leadsom is concerned that until 2012, the Bank apparently had no clear policy on how staff should escalate evidence of possible misconduct. A great series of questions from Andrea Leadsom MP - who asks why the Bank hasn’t acted on previous warnings of wrong-doing in the City going back many years. She asks how the Bank official who has been suspended should have addressed the signs of wrong doing. Paul Fisher says that “clear evidence” of manipulation should have been escalated. And asked why the Bank hasn’t looked deeply into other markets after the Libor scandal broker, Fisher replied that “it’s not our job to go hunting for the rigging of markets”. Bank of England governor Mark Carney told the Treasury committee that the allegations of foreign exchange rate manipulation is at least as bad as the Libor scandal -- in which traders conspired to fix the interest rates charged between banks. As the FX hearing continues (highlights start here), Carney told MPs that: This is as serious as Libor, if not more so...it goes to the heart of the integrity of the markets, and we have to ensure the integrity of markets. He reiterated that the Bank takes it extremely seriously, and is tackling it in a serious, fair manner. George Mudie MP, though, isn’t impressed -- accusing Carney of acting like his predecessor Sir Mervyn King by passing the buck onto other people; either the ‘old duffers’ on the Bank’s Court, or to FCA boss Martin Wheatley. The committee are trying to get to the bottom of exactly who is investigating what at the BoE. What is the Bank’s oversight committee investigating? They are examining if any officials were involved in manipulation, or knew about it and didn’t act. Mark Carney insists that the Bank of England takes the issue of foreign exchange rate manipulation extremely seriously. He tells MPs that it is “incredibly important” for the FX market and “fundamentally important” for the credibility of the Bank of England itself. I do not want to leave you with the impression that we’ve done something, and now we’ll relax. We are going to pursue this all the way. We owe it to the public, to parliament, and to our employees - who have acted with professionalism at this time - to address this issue, and we can’t allow any concerns over the integrity of the Bank, Carney concludes. BIG NEWS: The Co-operative Group has confirmed that Euan Sutherland has stepped down as its chief executive. Richard Pennycook, its finance director, has taken temporary control - hours after it emerged that Sutherland had tended his resignation, saying the Group was ungovernable. As covered early in the blog, Sutherland wrote a resignation letter after the Observer reported on Sunday that he was receiving a £3.5m pay package. More on this later.... Carney is reminded that reports of problems in the foreign exchange market surfaced in June 2013 -- why did the Bank do nothing until October? He says there were some discussions with the FCA about the issue. Carney says the allegations came from a “credible member” of the private sector. The FCA (City watchdog) was involved straight away, he says. And the BoE is working “intensively” with other central banks to make sure the Foreign Exchange market is reformed. David Ruffley MP is seeking details of how the Bank handled its inquiry into its conduct in the FX markets. Carney says that a Bank employee received information about potential foreign exchange rigging on 16 October. The bank acted straight away, hiring legal council [Travers Smith] the same day. The staff member was suspended while the inquiry examines whether they maintained rigorous internal controls and records So why, Ruffley asks, has the suspended staffer’s manager, not been suspended? There’s a long pause...before Carney replies that “escalation” is still an option. Carney is pretty scathing about the conduct of those traders involved in financial wrong-doing, telling the Treasury committe that it is vital to ensure the highest standards of integrity in the City. What we saw with Libor.....is a group of individuals, and it appears with FX too, who have lost sight of what a real market is, Carney says. The Bank of England must lead the efforts to fix this, he adds. Carney says that the Bank’s new strategic review will be published a week today -- and will include a new deputy governor responsible for ensuring markets operate properly. Mark Carney tells MPs that the Bank of England’s senior staff are not protected from the City watchdog. The Financial Conduct Authority, he says, “can and does” investigate individuals Paul Fisher has denied, robustly, that the Bank of England has known since 2006 that the foreign exchange market might have been unfairly manipulated. The Bank’s executive director for markets insists that the minutes of meetings from 2006, released last week, only showed that chief dealers were concerned that large foreign banks were putting extremely large buy and sell orders through the system, moving the FX rates and making their lives harder. We didn’t learn until these specific allegations of FX rigging until last year, Fisher tells the Treasury committee. As he puts it: It would be very odd for traders to have come to these meetings and said ‘we’ve been rigging the market, what do you think?’. Fisher is adamant that he would have alerted the authorities if he’s had any suspicions that foreign exchange rates were being manipulated. Carney insists that the Bank has “relentlessly” followed up the allegations of foreign exchange rigging. He also says that he believes it is best to appoint an external person handle the inquiry. Tyrie asks Carney about reports in the weekend newspapers that the Bank is going to appoint a senior independent figure to oversee the inquiry. That’s a decision for the Bank’s oversight committee, Carney replies -- he’s not a member, so he can’t comment on whether the reports are true. Carney outlines how the Bank of England first became aware on 16 October that the investigation into forex manipulation could involve the Bank itself. We acted swiftly, he said, engaging external legal council just 48 hours later. Have any minutes of the Bank’s Court been redacted? Carney says yes -- November’s Court minutes were redacted on the advise of legal council. The issue could still be escalated through the managerial chain, Carney adds. Andrew Tyrie begins by asking why the Bank of England released the name of the person they suspended last week, over its inquiry into possible manipulation of the foreign exchange markets. We didn’t release it, Mark Carney insists (citing the UK’s “very active press).... And no disciplinary action is underway. Tyrie points out that the release of the name must be very upsetting for the person involved -- who may very well have done nothing wrong at all. Why wasn’t this person’s manager also suspended, he asks Paul Fisher (executive director of the Bank). There was no reason to consider suspending the manager, Fisher adds. And Carney says that the Bank’s governors took the decision to suspend the individual, based on evidence that emerged during the inquiry. And we’re off again! With, finally, the section on the allegations that the foreign exchange market has been manipulated. Andrew Tyrie tries to sum up Carney’s position -- is he saying that rules aren’t enough to ensure the stability of a currency union, you actually need fiscal unity? Carney replies that he believes the eurozone needs to build a degree of fiscal federalism to be viable in the medium term. And does the same thing apply to the issue of Scotland, teases Tyrie: That, the governor replies firmly, is an issue that needs to be analysed, and is being analysed, by the appropriate people. I would prefer not to share my own views, he adds. And that’s the end of Part Two - with Tyrie congratulating Carney on playing a “very elegant straight bat”. Scotland’s banking sector is 12 times its GDP -- is that remotely sustainable? Carney says that given the way the financial service industry is structured, such a multiple is very risky. Upcoming changes, though, mean a country could support a higher multiple than is safe today, he adds. For comparison -- Cyprus had a banking sector eight times its GDP, before its bailout. Another intriguing exchange, about what commitments the rest of the UK would need in return for agreeing a currency union. Carney says that rUK (in the jargon) would need to see a “fiscal arrangement”, giving a claim on Scottish assets in the event of future liabilities: He points to the eurozone crisis -- the Maastricht Treaty ruled out bailouts, but in the “teeth of a global crisis” it was judged that the risks were too great. Interesting question -- does the Bank of England have a duty to help Scotland with the challenges of independence? Mark Carney replies that the BoE has a “very high interest” in the financial stability of an independent Scotland (just like the eurozone). We are providing “technical assistance and perspective to the interested parties”, he adds. Some reaction to Mark Carney’s comments on Scotland: Andrea Leadsom asks whether an independent Scotland could reassure the Bank of England by applying to join the European Banking Union. Carney replies that this would address some concerns - as Brussels is creating mechanisms to decide how banks are regulated, and how failing banks are wound up. But, it would not create a new Lender of Last Resort -- and being semi-viable isn’t enough. As Carney puts it: It is a bit like being pregnant... You can’t be half viable in a currency union. Now a key question -- does Mark Carney think RBS would have to move its headquarters from Edinburgh to the rest of the UK if Scotland votes for independence, and remained part of the EU? Carney replies: It is a distinct possibility, but I don’t want to prejudge.... He adds that an independent Scotland would also have to hold higher foreign exchange reserves if the financial markets thought that any sterling union was only temporary -- which would put pressure on Edinburgh to run a budget surplus. Carney keeps repeating that he isn’t a lawyer, but he does sound more negative about the issue than when he gave his speech on the issue in late January. David Ruffley is now probing about whether Scottish banks would need to move out of an independent Scotland. Mark Carney says that it is “not clear” that banks would keep their HQs in Scotland -- given the high-value operations in the rest of the UK (ie, the City). What would the Prudential Regulation Authority do about the issue? Carney says that a crucial factor is whether Scotland remains a member of the EEA (the European Economic Area). If it does, then the PRS is limited in its ability to adjust. Would you act as Lender of Last Resort for Lloyds and RBS if Scotland chose to use sterling without joining a currency union? Carney says that the Bank would have to take a decision, based on where the banks’ chose to domicile themselves, their capital position, and other measures the Scottish government might take. He adds that the Bank is “conscious” that acting as a lender of last resort to banks outside the UK does expose the UK balance sheet to potential losses. Now David Ruffley, Conservative MP, asks how a Yes vote could affect the way the Bank of England worked with banks based in an independent Scotland. Carney says the Bank would have to evaluate financial firms domiciled in Scotland over whether to continue acting as a settlement agent for those banks, but suggests it would probably keep settling those accounts. Under European law, he says, there needs to be a decision over where a bank is domiciled. And an independent Scotland would need to guarantee the deposits of Scottish-domiciled banks that are held in England. Has the Financial Policy Committee, the part of the Bank charged with maintaining financial stability, conducted any work on the possible threat posed by Scottish independence, asks chairman Andrew Tyrie? Carney says it has not. Tyrie wants to know why not Carney says it is not on list of risk the FPC must take account of, and there is a period of time when arrangements could be discussed (if Scotland votes for independence). Tyrie points out that this risk is coming down the line pretty fast (with a vote scheduled for September this year) Carney assures the committee that the Bank of England isn’t being negligent -- if there was actually a change to monetary conditions in the UK we would offer clear advice, he says. Carney says the Bank has not done any thinking on how many seats an independent Scotland would get on the MPC, in the event that it joins a currency union. Liberal Democrat MP John Thurso is next, and tries to expose the flaws in Scottish independence (he represents the Scottish constituency of Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross). Scotland is a small country, he says, would its economy be more volatile if it were independent? Mark Carney says that Scotland’s economy suffers when energy prices fall, but at present this impact is cushioned because the wider economic weakness triggers more ‘transfer payments’ (welfare payments) to Scotland. Are small countries more volatile, asks Thurso, citing Portugal and Iceland (both hit hard by the financial crisis). Carney pauses, thinks, and says he hesitates to come to such a conclusion. Stewart Hosie, the Scottish Nationalist Party’s MP on the committee, asks Mark Carney to explain what rules makes a successful currency union. Carney says it all depends on the nature of the countries involved. Hosie follows up, pointing out that output growth in Scotland is highly correlated with the rest of the UK -- so is being highly correlated beneficial to creating a successful currency union? A high correlation of output growth is “beneficial for successful monetary policy”, Carney replies. Carney repeats that he is only taking a ‘technocratic’ view of the pros and cons of independent Scotland. Ultimately, it is a decision for Scotland. The committee are back, and so is Mark Carney (David Miles and Martin Weale have been released for the day, while Paul Fisher is on a tighter leash and must return to his seat when the committee move onto the forex inquiry). This session is on Scotland independence. Reminder, it is being streamed live here. A quick summary of the key points, as the committee takes a quick break. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has told the Treasury committee that it’s ‘not unreasonable’ to think that UK interest rates could hit 2.5% within three years. Carney said that some struggling firms will fail as interest rates rise -- which would help to improve productivity in the UK. The BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee is split over the size of the UK output gap. Carney says it is probably more than 1.5% of the UK economy - but Martin Weale says it is under 1%. Carney also revealed he failed to persuade the rest of the MPC to publish an official estimate of the output gap.... ...and said the Bank is concerned that mortgage underwriting standards could drop. Bank officials have denied that they could drive up UK borrowing costs when they start to unwind QE. The Bank will announce details of its new strategic review next week -- including new funding for its forecasting arm. And it has revealed that it destroys the recordings of the monthly meetings of the MPC -- to the clear concern of committee chairman Andrew Tyrie The era of falling real wages could soon be over, suggests David Miles, who tells MPs: “I think we’re getting to the point at which average wage settlements are moving above the rate of inflation.” How worried is the Bank of England about the UK recovery, which it described as ‘fragile’ last month? Carney points to business investment -- if that doesn’t pick up, then the recovery could disappoint, he says. The risks are to the downside with business investment, he adds. Andrew Tyrie MP asks what happens to the records of the Bank of England’s monthly monetary policy committee? Paul Fisher, executive director for markets, explains that a recording is taken to allow the Minutes to be written, and that recording is later destroyed. Tyrie is most unimpressed -- the recording could have real historical value, he says, pointing out that the US Federal Reserve released transcripts of its own meetings in 2008. Why is the Bank of England not keeping its own records, he demands? Fisher replies that it can be very hard to distinguish exactly what is being said during the meetings. And the minutes give a true impression of what went on* Tyrie hits back, asking if the MPC members are shouting and banging the table. Fisher explains that a ‘free flowing’ discussion doesn’t lend itself well to a transcript, and MPC members might not speak freely otherwise. Tyrie urges the committee to give serious consideration to keeping the recordings, and (devilishly) suggests Mark Carney should chair the MPC in a way that means the members can be clearly heard. Carney laughs, in a way that suggests he’s not particularly amused. * - and without the recordings, we’ll have to take his word for it Sky News’s economics editor, Ed Conway, is aghast: Carney also suggests that the Bank’s balance sheet - swelled by its gorging of gilts -- will not return to its pre-crisis level: A long discussion about the intricacies of quantitative easing... with Carney assuring MPs that the Bank has an indemnity against possible losses on its bond-buying programme. It ends with Andrew Tyrie MP asking whether the Bank plans to sell all the £375bn of gilts on its books. Carney explains that new capital rules means commercial banks will need to hold more assets such as gilts (meaning, I think, that there shouldn’t be a lack of willing buyers) David Miles is confidence that things are looking up in the UK economy -- telling MPs that he is seeing more optimism among small and medium-sized firms than at any time since he joined the MPC [in June 2009, I think]. Back in the Thatcher Room (livestream here), Labour MP John Mann has challenged the Bank of England governor over his comments that there will be more recycling of capital and jobs when rates rise (see here). Does that just mean more recycling from the north of the UK to the south? Carney says he was speaking in more general terms, and also denies that the looming UK general election (inked in for May 2015) will affect his vote on when to raise rates, or anyone else on the MPC either. Breaking away from the Treasury committee briefly, one of Britain’s most powerful union leaders has died this morning. Bob Crow, the leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, passed away in the early hours of this morning at the age of 52 - shocking the worlds of unions and politics alike. The London mayor, Boris Johnson, and his predecessor Ken Livingstone have both paid tribute to Crow - famous for industrial disputes and campaigns that delivered pay rises for his members, and occasion disruption to London’s transport links. The Bank of England will announce plans to beef up its economic forecasting division next week. Asked about the Bank’s (somewhat ropey) track record on economic forecasting, Carney says that the Bank will publish the results of its strategic review next week. That will include new resources for its forecasting division -- which has been criticised for failing to predict inflation through the crisis, the depth of the last recession, or the recent recovery in the jobs market. Carney says forecasting is: Something we have to constantly get better at. The Bank needs to ask why it made mistakes*, and explain how it is learning from them, he adds. * - speaking of which, the photo in the last entry is ANDREA Leadsom MP. Mark Carney says that the Bank of England won’t consult the Treasury before taking the decision to unwind its £375bn bond-buying programme. He tells the committee that the BoE is likely to consult the Debt Management Office (which sells the debt to fund the UK deficit) over the timing. But the chancellor of the day will not get a say, he suggests. My view is that it’s a monetary policy decision, Carney says - it’s clearly been delegated to the MPC. Andrea Leadsom MP homes in on the Bank’s quantitative easing programme -- when will it start to sell the £375bn of UK debt it bought during the crisis, and how much will that push up borrowing costs? David Miles suggests that unwinding QE will have little impact, citing academic research that says it could have ‘zero’ impact in a market that is operating at full efficiency. Leadsom’s not impressed -- dumping £375bn of gilts is only going to move the yield curve one way, she insists. Carney agrees that selling the bonds bought under QE will indeed have an effect, which is why it will take place gradually and in consultation with the BoE’s Financial Policy Committee. He also says that the Bank will probably have raised interest rates several times before starting to unwinds QE. David Miles, another external member of the MPC, admits that he’s a bit baffled by the difference between the amount of ‘slack’ in the UK economy, and the ‘output gap’ (see 9.45am for the early exchange). Cue much handwaving by both Miles and Carney: Carney then reveals that he would personally like to publish a measure of the output gap, but he couldn’t persuade the rest of the MPC. Andrew Tyrie asks Carney whether the Bank will regularly issue its own estimate of the output gap in the UK economy, to give a better insight into its forward guidance. There are no plans at present, the governor replies. Mark Carney has told the Treasury committee that it’s not unreasonable to think that UK interest rates could rise to 2% to 2.5% over the next three years, in a ‘gradual’ manner. He told the Treasury committee that deputy governor Charlie Bean had spoken sensibly about this subject yesterday: Some members of the MPC have put more precise figures on the extent to which interest rates would be expected to rise over the three-year horizon. Charlie Bean yesterday referenced 2.5 percentage points. I don’t think that’s an unreasonable sense to get across - a 2-2.5 percent bank rate over the course of the forecast horizon.” Is Mark Carney suggesting that the improvements in the UK economy are all down to his stewardship of the Bank of England? The governor replies that monetary policy is one reason that the economy has improved. Carney is having to defend his new forward guidance, with the committee suggesting that the Bank’s credibility has been hurt by the decision to change the policy after just six months. Are the new 18 economic indicators that the Bank of England will now consider when deciding when to raise interest rates just a way to create ‘wriggle room’? Looking a little irked, Carney shoots back that there has been a dramatic improvement in the UK economy since last summer - unemployment has dropped sharply, and the UK economy is growing faster than most of the developed world. Stepping back a bit - here’s Carney’s comments about house prices, and the concern that people could become overstretched (via Reuters) Underwriting standards at present of mortgage providers are quite high... ”Our concern is that those underwriting standards will deteriorate and that that deterioration itself would be fed by general improvement in the housing market.” The committee is concerned about struggling firms who might go bust when interest rates go up, because they can’t repay their debts. Mark Garnier MP asks what work the Bank has done on this - how many firms are effectively on life-support and will go under once borrowing costs return to normality (known as “forbearance”) Mark Carney replies that fewer firms collapsed in the last recession because the Bank acted quickly to loosen monetary policy so quickly. That may have hampered productivity, because less capital was recycled and fewer people were laid off and then rehired in more productive jobs. The recovery should bring some “normalisation of interest rates”, and reduce forbearance (as firms who are only viable in a low interest rate environment go to the wall) . That will bring some pain, but it should increase productivity, Carney says. Carney says the Bank is developing ‘affordability tools’ to avoid households being given mortgages beyond their means, but cannot influence some of the factors driving up house prices in the UK capital. Onto the housing market -- does Mark Carney think rising house prices are a good thing? It all depends what is pushing prices up, he replies. If it’s because incomes are rising, then that’s a good sign for the economy. But if they’re being driven up by “extrapolative expectations” (ie, because people think prices will keep rising) then a bubble may be forming, and that’s clearly bad. The latter case could put “a large number of households in a vulnerable position” that takes a long time to recover from, he cautions. An early difference of views -- Mark Carney suggests there is more than 1.5% of spare capacity in the UK economy (as estimated by the Bank’s own economists). .. but Martin Weale, an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee, suggests there is less than 1%. Weale is explaining that he believes official measures can suggest the output gap is bigger than it really is, as new entrants are typically paid less than established workers (making wages a poor measure of output). Weale opposed Carney’s forward guidance back in August -- and doesn’t think that was a poor call. As expected, the session begins with the Committee asking about monetary policy (we may not get to the Forex rigging allegations until noon) Chairman Andrew Tyrie asks Mark Carney why he changed his forward guidance on interest rates last month - dropping the 7% jobless rate target (unveiled last summer) in favour of a broader target based around the output gap. Could a really alert chap in August have guessed that you’d have changed your focus in February, asks Tyrie. A really alert chap could have suspected that we’d focus on spare capacity in the economy, Carney replies. So how big is the output gap in the UK economy? Carney says the gap is ‘dominant’ in the labour market, saying that the ‘equilibrium’ rate for unemployment is around 6%, compare to 7.2% at present. There’s also spare capacity in firms, as well as in the labour market, he adds. Reminder - the agenda is here. THE HEARING IS UNDERWAY - LIVE STREAM HERE Andrea Leadsom MP, a member of the Treasury Committee, says today’s hearing (in a few minutes time) will focus on the question of exactly what the Bank of England knew about allegations of rigging in the forex market. She points to the minutes released last week which appear to show that chief currency dealers were raising the possibility of collusion when meeting Bank officials as far back as 2006. Yet, it appears that that Bank “did nothing”. If this was indeed allowed to take place over many years, and the bank didn’t do anything to stop it, it would strengthen the case for a proper supervisory board to oversee the Bank of England, Leadsom said. That is unlikely to go down well with Threadneedle Street, where the BoE is currently watched over by its own Court of Directors (including Carney and the deputy governors). Leadsom was speaking on the Today programme. Brenda Kelly of IG explained that there is no central body that sets currency rates -- instead, the ‘4pm London fix’ is taken as that day’s official FX rate. So, in theory, a large bank could flood the market with orders around that time to influence that day’s reading. Here’s Jill Treanor’s first take on the latest drama at the Co-op: Co-operative Group chief executive Euan Sutherland offers to resign Labour and Co-operative MP Meg Hillier MP isn’t impressed that Euan Sutherland has threatened to resign from the Co-operative Group. She just told the Today Programme that she is “pretty shocked” by the news that the Co-op CEO had tendered his resignation, and doesn’t have much sympathy for him either. If Sutherland believes he is worth the £3.6m pay package being drawn up then he should explain why, Hillier said. If he’s embarrassed by it, he shouldn’t take it. Hillier added that pay packages that are common in the PLC arena are not acceptable in the Co-operative world - Sutherland should accept that he’s “swimming in different waters”. Today presenter Evan Davis suggested, though, that Sutherland has a right to be paid the going rate for turning around the Group. As he put it: There’s no point having a Co-operative movement that goes bust. The chief executive of the Co-operative Group, Euan Sutherland, has threatened to quit. City editor Jill Treanor reports that Sutherland has said the Group is simply too hard to manage, as the row over his efforts to reshape the organisation, and plans to hike his pay, deepens. She writes: The Co-operative Group was thrown deeper into crisis on Tuesday after the new boss Euan Sutherland threatened to resign in the face of opposition to his reforms for the mutually-owned chain of supermarkets, funeral homes and pharmacies. The Group board convened a late night telephone conference call to agree to recommend changes to its management structure to give Sutherland a seat on the board in a more conventional style for a major company. Sutherland offered to resign in a letter to the chair Ursula Lidbetter -herself promoted once the bank’s problems were exposed – on a point of principle that the Group was too difficult to govern. The threat comes two days after The Observer reported that Co-op was planning to pay Sutherland more than £3.5m, and massively boost the salaries and bonuses of other senior staff. Jill explains: Sutherland threatened to quit after using Facebook to criticise leaks of his £3.6m pay deal to The Observer last weekend. Sutherland, who took the helm on May 1 after leaving Kingfisher’s B&amp;Q, said on the group’s Facebook page that “an individual or individuals” were determined to undermine him. BBC economics editor Robert Peston has also been reporting the story on the Today programme. Here’s some reaction: Treasury Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie has already fired a warning shot at the Bank of England. He said last week that the Central Bank had been too slow to act when allegations of forex market-rigging came to light: “Led by the Chairman of Court, there is a strong case that the non executives in the Bank should have taken the initiative on this from the moment the need for external assistance was considered. That was last October, possibly earlier. Yet this issue does not appear to have been raised with Court or the Oversight Committee – the nearest the Bank has to a board – until December. Indeed, it appears to have taken the suspension of a Bank employee for the Oversight Committee to be fully engaged.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the economy, the eurozone and business. What exactly did the Bank of England know about the possible rigging of the foreign exchange markets? And why didn’t it act faster when allegations first surfaced that traders had conspired to fix the official forex rates? These question will be on the lips of the Treasury Committee this morning, when they tackle governor Mark Carney over the latest scandal to rock the City. The committee will also be quizzing Carney and colleagues over the latest inflation report, and the monetary implications of Scottish independence, in what looks like a mammoth session. The Bank of England has been dragged deep into the Forex row this month, amid speculation that its own officials had condoned the manipulation of foreign exchange prices. The Bank suspending an employee last week, and released details of minutes held with foreign exchange traders over many years. They showed that the possibility that the market was fixed could have been discussed as long ago as 2006. Carney, who only joined the Bank last July, should expect to be challenged over his efforts to modernise the Bank. As we wrote yesterday: Carney will be under pressure to explain to Andrew Tyrie, the committee’s chairman, why it took the Bank so long to act after allegations in October against two of its officials. Last week, Tyrie said the Bank needed “a board worthy of the name”, adding that the revelations had exposed a “byzantine” governance structure. Andrew Love, a committee member said: “We will be asking the governor what steps he is taking to bring management arrangements and committee structure up to the standards of the 21st century.” Here’s the Committee’s agenda: At 9.30 am: Dr Mark Carney, Governor, Bank of England Paul Fisher, Executive Director, Markets, Bank of England Professor David Miles, Member, Monetary Policy Committee, Bank of England Dr Martin Weale, Member, Monetary Policy Committee, Bank of England At 11.00am (approx) Subject: Governor of the Bank of England’s speech ‘Economics of currency unions’, Edinburgh, 29 January 2014 Witness: Dr Mark Carney, Governor, Bank of England At 12.00 (approx) Subject: Foreign Exchange Market Review Witnesses: Dr Mark Carney, Governor, Bank of England Paul Fisher, Executive Director, Markets, Bank of England I’ll be tracking the session, along with other news through the day.

In five and a half hours of gruelling testimony to the house energy and commerce committee, Chu was assailed for repeatedly claiming to have had no real-time knowledge of key events in the collapse of Solyndra, which went bankrupt in August after receiving $535m in government loans. \"I hope you didn't leave your brains at the door,\" Morgan Griffith, a Republican from Virginia, told Chu. The energy secretary, who remained unflappable throughout the barrage, was just as unyielding on the question of an apology for the failure of Solyndra and the loss of taxpayer funds. In his testimony Chu refused on multiple occasions to apologise for the Solyndra debacle – although he did go so far as to describe the company's collapse and the loss of US public funds as \"extremely unfortunate\" and \"regrettable\". Asked whether he would still approve such a loan today, Chu said: \"Certainly knowing what I know now, we'd say 'no', but you don't make decisions fast-forwarding two years in the future and then go back. I wish I could do that.\" By the end of the day Chu had deflected Republican attempts to cast the entire clean energy industry as a pay-off for Democratic donors. \"I want to be clear: I did not make any decision based on political considerations,\" he said. But he was left exposed on the question of his own general competence. On question after question, to the Republicans' frustration, Chu claimed to have had knowledge of key decisions. \"I'm aware of it now\" was all he could offer. It was a phrase Chu deployed more than a dozen times and it had the effect of making him the target of Republicans, rather than the White House. Among other things, Chu claimed ignorance of documents warning Solyndra was a bad bet in early 2009 – before the loan was awarded. He said he had never heard of George Kaiser, the Democratic fundraiser who was the main investor in Solyndra. Republicans did not buy it. \"Everybody and their dog at DOE knew who he was and what he was involved in,\" Joe Barton of Texas said. The cumulative effect of Chu's responses was to deflect the Republicans away from their charge that the administration gave the loan to Solyndra as a favour to Kaiser. \"I don't see from today's hearing that there was a smoking gun here,\" Lee Terry, a Republican member of the committee from Nebraska, said in an interview. But that put Chu in the firing line. \"The main impression I got today was that he wasn't as involved in the process as we assumed he was. I don't know if he was just a figurehead, but I assumed like everybody else that he was actually involved in the decisions,\" Terry said. \"He just seems … detatched.\" Other Republicans went farther. Cliff Stearns, who has led the Republican charge on Solyndra as chair of the committee's investigations wing, told the hearing that Chu deserved to be fired. \"I just think he has failed the test,\" Stearns said. Chu refused on multiple occasions to apologise for the Solyndra debacle – although he did go so far as to describe the company's collapse and the loss of US public funds as \"extremely unfortunate\" and \"regrettable\". The five and a half hour hearing was extraordinarily long by the usual congressional standards. As a comparison, BP's Tony Hayward was grilled for just half that time at the height of the oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. It was also ill-tempered. Republican members of the committee on several occasions cut off Chu's answers or, as he wearily complained after four hours of testimony, trod over the same old ground. \"These questions are going over and over and over,\" he said. The White House has supported Chu in public for the duration of the scandal. But the energy secretary has been damaged by an email released in response to demands from Stearns, which shows other administration officials expressing doubts about Solyndra's viability – even in early 2009 before the loans were finalised. He was also hurt on Thursday by his justification for extending further loans to the company as it was failing, and his admission that he could not guarantee there would be no further collapses among the three dozen or so other clean energy companies that also got government loans. \"I can't promise you there won't be another,\" he told reporters. Chu also failed to squash the Republicans' charge that he broke the law with a restructuring agreement that put private investors ahead of taxpayers if Solyndra was forced into liquidation. An aide to Chu, in an email sent out after the hearing, rebutted the claim. \"Secretary Chu relied on the thoughtful, thorough legal analysis of the career lawyers in the department's loan program,\" Dan Leistikow, the communication chief, wrote. Chu, meanwhile, ended the day with the same quiet defiance with which he fended off Republican attacks. At the end of his grilling, he told reporters America had no choice but to push ahead on solar energy – or else give up the field to China. \"America faces a simple choice: compete or accept defeat,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/oct/27/oakland-police-protest-wounding-veteran","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-27T07:25:43Z","webTitle":"Oakland police and mayor face fresh protest over wounding of veteran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/27/oakland-police-protest-wounding-veteran","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/oct/27/oakland-police-protest-wounding-veteran","fields":{"headline":"Oakland police and mayor face fresh protest over wounding of veteran","bodyText":"Protesters have returned to downtown Oakland, California, to demand the resignation of the city's mayor and an investigation to explain how an Iraq war veteran, Scott Olsen, was hit in the head by a teargas canister at close range, leaving him critically injured. About 2,000 people – half as many as Tuesday night – massed in front of City Hall on Wednesday, tearing down a steel barricade intended to keep them off the grass in Frank Ogawa Plaza. When the city closed down a nearby underground station, preventing dispersing protesters going home, they organised a spontaneous march through the centre of the city, chanting: \"Whose streets? Our streets!\" Police had been under orders to let them have the run of the plaza until 10pm. Officers stood guard at junctions in patrol cars and motorbikes to deter people from jumping up on to an overhead freeway. The police were more lowkey than on Tuesday, when they manned barricades around the plaza and fired volley after volley of teargas that filled the surrounding streets and smoked out businesses. As the protest continued late into the night both sides appeared afraid of engaging the other. Many marchers wore scarves over their noses and mouths in anticipation of teargas. Some had gas masks. When officers wanted the crowd to move out of a traffic intersection they sent an ambulance in with its siren blaring, not a police vehicle. One sign taped to a lamppost delivered this message to the police: \"You've fuelled our fire.\" Speaker after speaker demanded the resignation or recall of the city's mayor, Jean Quan, who had initially voiced her support of the protesters. \"Mayor Quan you did more damage to Oakland in one evening than Occupy Oakland did in two weeks,\" said one slogan scrawled near the entrance to her offices. In an afternoon news conference Quan had struggled to explain the decision to clear the square in the early hours of Tuesday morning and again when protesters returned that evening. She gave the impression she had been as blindsided as anyone by the decision to close down Occupy Oakland. She had been in Washington at the time and said that although she knew there were hygiene and public safety issues that needed to be addressed, she did not expect that to happen while she was on the other side of the country. \"I only asked the chief to do one thing: to do it when it was the safest for both the police and the demonstrators,\" she said, pinning responsibility for the decision on her police chief and the top city administrator. When pressed for more details, Quan said: \"I don't know everything.\" Scott Olsen, 24 – a former US marine who friends said served two tours of duty in Iraq – has become a figurehead among Occupy Wall Street supporters in Oakland and elsewhere. Organisers took to Twitter and other social media urging protesters back into the streets. Acting Oakland police chief Howard Jordan told a news conference his department was investigating the injury to Olsen as a \"level one\" incident, the highest for an internal police inquiry. In Portland, Oregon, a crowd estimated to number at least 1,000 joined in a march organised by the AFL-CIO labour federation in support of the anti-Wall Street movement. Hundreds of protesters also gathered in New York to march in solidarity, leaving the Occupy Wall Street base in Zuccotti Park and marching around the financial district and city hall. Protesters in New York voted to send $20,000 and 100 tents to their peers in Oakland, according to a Twitter message from a protester identified as JA Myerson and retweeted by the Occupy Wall Street group. The Oakland crowd was a mixture of eco-activists, families with young children, nurses and teachers, as well as a handful of young men with bandanas or Palestinian keffiyehs covering part of their faces. Many said they were shocked by what happened on Tuesday and were bracing themselves for further confrontations with the police. \"Quan let the [county] sheriffs in to do her dirty work and then said she didn't know who was responsible for the decision. She's got to go,\" said Robijn Vangiesen, a local activist and organiser. Vangiesen was in the plaza when Olsen was knocked down by a teargas canister. \"He was out, man. Totally non-responsive. He had blood pouring out of his nose,\" Vangiesen said. The initial teargas volley was followed by another projectile from the police straight into the small crowd trying to help Olsen. His friends said it was a flash-bang grenade, pointing to a video distributed on the internet as evidence, but police have denied this. Many of Wednesday night's protesters expressed anger. \"When the rich steal from the poor it's called business. When the poor fight back it's called violence,\" a 25-year-old solar energy company executive, Cory Rae Shaw, wrote on a banner. \"Who's really the bandits here?\" said Demarion English, a 23-year-old security guard. \"I called them bitches. I call the police bitches to their face. We're all fighting for a real cause... and we got teargassed.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/the-lay-scientist/2012/aug/03/africa-obama-administration","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2012-08-03T09:20:00Z","webTitle":"Africa's propaganda trail, part III: Grandma Obama's support for domestic violence | Martin Robbins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2012/aug/03/africa-obama-administration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2012/aug/03/africa-obama-administration","fields":{"headline":"Grandma Obama's support for domestic violence","bodyText":"President Obama's angry granny stared impassively into the distance, as her rabbits relentlessly fucked each other around us. One ventured near her ankle, as if wondering whether to hump it. \"Should I hump it?\" the rabbit asked, and it dawned on me that sleep deprivation and whatever sickness had begun to take root in my gut were beginning to affect my brain in unexpected and disturbing ways. This was already very different to the experience of one Greenpeace worker, whose blog post I had read the night before: \"Oyawore, Mama Sarah\" was my first attempt to speak Luo, the local dialect of US President Obama's family's village in Nyang'oma Kogelo. This greeting got me a warm smile and a hug from Mama Sarah Obama, the President's grandmother, when I met her under a mango tree in front of her home. At 87 years old, she exudes a strong warm presence. She's definitely a lovable grandmother that you don't want to fool around with. We had flown out west to Kisumu, a large town built halfway between Nairobi and Kampala on the shores of Lake Victoria, in the Nyanza province. This was a poorer, rural corner of Kenya, which we would spend two brutally-scheduled but rewarding days touring with the CDC. A stereotypically American convoy of five bright white trucks greeted us at the airport and whisked us off to local clinics and homesteads, where we watched bright young health workers perform HIV tests, and demonstrate to village elders the correct way to put condoms on giant wooden phalluses. The second day ended, inexplicably, with a visit to Sarah Onyango Obama in the nearby village of Nyang'oma Kogelo. Famous only for marrying a president's grandfather, the woman a young Barack called 'Granny' has become embedded in Kenya's national mythology in much the same way that Pippa Middleton has become embedded in the pages of Heat magazine. Described by some as \"a new voice of rural women,\" she was appointed a goodwill ambassador by one NGO, and had solar power installed at her home by volunteers from Greenpeace. While Greenpeace busied themselves upgrading Mama Obama's power to solar in 2009, her neighbours struggled to get electricity of any kind. The village was only connected to the national grid after Obama became President, and local police were deployed to keep the solar cells out of the hands of Obama's less fortunate neighbours - presumably not at Greenpeace's expense. The new wattage was swiftly followed by a new police station, a museum, and improvements to the nearest international airport. While much of the country struggled with chronically bad roads, new tarmac was bulldozed across Nyanza to connect one old lady to the West. Now aged ninety, and as formidable as ever, it was clear that Obama was a living propaganda coup for the Kenyan government, a way to attract the attention of America's wealthy tourists and donors. We arrived shortly after lunch on a warm, sunny day, to find a green and pleasant compound, its bustling gardens filled with birdsong and populated by rabbits, turkeys, and assorted humans - mostly staff and police officers. A few short rows of plastic chairs had been set out for the journalists in the shade of a mango tree where our host sat facing us, surveying her land with an expression of grumpy authority. She had become irritated when a member of the group decided to put a video camera in front of her to record the interview without introducing themselves first, and the start of the interview was tetchy and a little fraught as the IRP leader attempted to break the ice with a series of awkward compliments about her \"beautiful dress.\" Obama only speaks the language of the Luo people, Dholuo, and our questions had to be put through a convenient government translator. This quickly became a problem. A question about whether life was better under British rule was met with the response that, \"she doesn't talk about politics,\" and although Obama herself seemed perfectly willing to answer (in the affirmative), it was clear that political discussion of any sort was frowned upon. It seemed we were expected to ask only soft questions about her charity work, the animals sharing her compound, and her famous step-grandson. Half an hour passed, and I was becoming dangerously bored. I didn't give a fuck about how often she talked to President Obama, or whether President Obama sent her a card at Christmas, or whether she was proud of President Obama, or any of the other five hundred questions with the words 'President Obama' in them, so I decided to ignore the protestations of the government translator and veer off-message. The Kenyan constitution had been rewritten recently, triggering a huge debate over abortion rights: elective abortion is prohibited in Kenya, fueling an industrial-scale trade in illegal - often dangerous - alternatives. Aha! I thought. What better subject could there be to ask this great supporter of Kenyan women about! \"Can I ask…? There's been a considerable amount of debate in Kenya recently about changes to the Kenyan constitution, particularly around family planning and abortion. Do you have any views on access to abortion services and to family planning in Kenya?\" The twin microphones of my Zoom recorder picked up five long seconds of birdsong, but not the visible distress of the government translator. Eventually, on Mama's prompting, she reluctantly translated the question. It was left to our CDC guide to relay the reply: \"So she's against abortion.\" \"She's against abortion.\" I echoed, half-expecting to be corrected. \"And she's against family planning.\" \"She's against family planning.\" \"And her reason… She says that if God gives you the reproductive ability, just reproduce, because in our circumstances the mortality rate is very high. If you limit, you lower the number that will remain. So the more the better.\" ... Unless of course your country's population is expanding at the rate of a million people a year, and many of them can't find jobs. Of course, it's rarely God who decides such matters in the bedroom: more than a tenth of Kenyan women report being raped by their partners, and Kenya's male-dominated parliament blocked legislation protecting women from marital rape in 2006, making it clear they didn't take the issue seriously. BBC reports from the time quote MP Kenneth Marende welcoming the dropping of the marital rape clause, celebrating the fact that: \"Kenyans can still have sex with their partners even when they are asleep so long as they are married.\" Another MP, \"told parliament that women usually say 'No' to sex, even if they mean 'Yes', unless they were prostitutes.\" I was still digesting this response when Julia Manning, a pleasantly moderate blogger from the Daily Mail – asked Obama about initiatives to stop wife-beating: \"There's been a program in the last few years, called 'Real Men Don't Beat Their Wives.' Has she heard of it, and has she had to counsel any men in the area on treating their wives better?\" The response, rather unexpectedly, was raucous laughter. The translation was left again to our CDC guide - by this point the government translator had pointedly asked not to be photographed, and seemed to have decided that if she couldn't stop the more controversial questions, she could at least avoid any involvement with the answers. \"The disobedient wives should be beaten.\" \"Sorry?\" replied Manning, as I fished in my camera bag for some imaginary popcorn. \"The wives that are disobedient, they should be beaten.\" \"They should be beaten?\" \"Yeah, they should be beaten.\" \"Can you ask her,\" replied the admirably unruffled blogger, \"what about disobedient husbands?\" More laughter. \"So as far as our culture is concerned, women should not beat as much. The major reason… we marry the women, we pay dowry, they come to our compounds, you give them land, so that gives some element of superiority over the woman.\" In the case of President Obama's step-grandmother, the dowry was apparently ten cows – well above the average of four. The interview came to an end after an hour or so, and I wandered the green, well-tended compound on an increasingly urgent mission to find a toilet. I thought about my own family: we've all been embarrassed at Christmas dinner by relatives with unfortunate views and perhaps that's why President Obama doesn't visit her more often - that and the whole running the country deal - but why on Earth does it matter? The truth is, it doesn't: there is no reason for any journalist to visit Barack Obama's grandmother, and yet dozens of them are dumped on her lawn every month by organizations like the CDC, the IRP, or any of a hundred others drawn to her celebrity like a moth to a television. Her views on abortion, contraception or local politics aren't particularly representative of Kenyans should be no more relevant than those of anyone else in the village she dominates; and yet her voice is broadcast across continents, drowning out the many neighbours living quietly in her shadow. Still, everyone who matters is happy: the NGOs and aid agencies are pleased to get some coverage, journalists leave with some soft easy copy, and Sarah Obama sits happily under her Mango tree watching the rabbits and turkeys and policemen that occupy her lawn. If you bother to look behind the myth of Barack Obama's step-grandmother, the reality is a sad reminder of the patriarchal, deeply misogynistic society that progressive Kenyans have fought against for decades. With her large government house, translator, police escort, and the unearned role as a sort of national elder that gains her lavish attention from NGOs and journalists, she is symbolic of the corruption that riddles the country and holds back progress. It's not really surprising that a ninety-year-old rural Kenyan woman holds these views, but it's troubling that NGOs are happy to gloss over them for the sake of attaching a famous name to their brands. Greenpeace will argue that their high-profile solar energy project here included workshops for local kids and power for a nearby school, but its visible impact was to put a solar panels on the house of a rich lady while dozens of her poorer neighbours went without power of any kind, creating an inordinate amount of hassle for local police in the process. Faced with stunts like these, Kenyans are entitled to question the real motives of other foreign NGOs; and faced with an unelected celebrity spokeswoman attacking women's rights, they are entitled to ask the West to listen to somebody more suitable. - - - - - - - - - - We couldn't have left without asking one last question, a question that could have far-reaching consequences for global politics. \"In the United States there's a group of people who believe that the President was born in Kenya,\" Salon's Irin Carmon explained: \"Do they ever contact her, or ask her for help?\" Suddenly the rabbits ceased their rampant rogering and ran for the hills, causing chaos to erupt. Police officers scattered in all directions as the furry fuckers darted under nearby vehicles and bushes. Mama Obama stood and took charge, waving her arms and barking instructions at the hapless men making futile efforts to chase after or reason with the erratic little creatures darting back and forth across the lawns. Minutes passed until order was restored, but despite this obviously CIA-orchestrated attempt to disrupt the press conference and prevent Obama from revealing The Truth, Carmon stuck doggedly to her question: \"I'm sorry, I didn't get an answer.\" \"She's saying Barack wasn't born in Kenya, Barack was born in America,\" came the response. \"But many people, they think that he was born in Kenya because they…\" Irin paused, as if searching for the most polite term to use, \"…are crazy. I wonder if those crazy people ever bother her?\" \"No, they don't bother her anymore.\" We could leave satisfied that at least one important issue had been settled. Whatever the Birthers claim, it's clear that Barack Hussein Obama was born in America, not Kenya; and if you can't trust a ninety year old woman who believes in wife-beating and thinks God is the best form of contraception, well then who the hell can you trust?

The locals had been \"paid a lump sum to leave, never come back and never complain in the media or in court if they became sick from environmental contaminants\". Epstein returned to New York, where he lives, and found himself thinking about the power of huge corporations to shape ordinary lives. An idea was born. For the next six years he travelled though America making the images that eventually appeared in a book called, simply, American Power, published in 2009, which won him this year's Prix Pictet photography prize. Epstein photographed the sites where America produces its nuclear, fossil fuel and hydroelectric power as well as its wind and solar energy. His aim was to investigate the relationship between these sites and the communities in and around them – communities that often depend on the power stations for employment. To this end he created a series of large-format prints that are surprising both in their formal unity and in their extraordinary detail. Just how surprising is clear when you walk into the new Open Eye Gallery in Liverpool, which has relocated to new premises on two floors of a towering glass-fronted building on the waterfront. There are only eight prints from the series on display, but they are huge. The most immediately striking is the one entitled BP Carson Refinery, California 2007, in which a huge American flag is draped over the front of an ageing oil production plant. Here, the relationship of oil to politics – to American power of a different sort – is unintentionally made explicit. Most of the images, though, are more subtly powerful. One called Poca High School and Amos Coal Power Plane, West Virginia 2004, which captures the school football team practising on a field under the towering power plant, shows the link between energy production and life in small-town America. Here, day-to-day life goes on much as it always has, but Poca is also one of the many places where Epstein was harassed by both the police and private security men as he tried to take photographs of the plant. In post-9/11 America, he concludes in his book, corporate law now often seems to supersede constitutional law. The shadow of Ansel Adams looms large in Epstein's calmly beautiful portrait of the Hoover Dam and Lake Mead at sunset, but the diminishing waterline is the telling ecological detail. One cause of this is the constant siphoning of water to maintain the lavish hotels, casinos and golf courses of Las Vegas, which Epstein captures in all their extravagance in a picture so vast and detailed you could stand in front of it for hours and not take all of it in. There is something uncanny about the widescreen scope and detail of these prints that makes me admire them more than love them. The exceptions are a pair of photographs facing each other in the exhibition's second room. Biloxi, Mississippi 2005 is a warm-hued image of total devastation: an upended car, battered and bent, lies behind a huge tree that is covered in rags, blankets and remnants of dirty clothing. Bathed in the ochre tint of a southern sunset, a mattress hangs impaled on a broken branch. On the opposite wall is a portrait of a kneeling couple: a white woman and a black man framed against a blue sky flecked by white clouds. They could be praying together but are actually rifling though the remains of her house, a few pots and pans, a bowl, some broken china figurines. Both images testify to the brute force of hurricane Katrina, which was recorded by Epstein six weeks after it wreaked havoc on Louisiana in 2005. Here, the elemental power of nature is evoked in images that are serenely still, and both of which carry an almost religious undertow: the one biblical, the other contemplative. One floor above, in Open Eye's archive gallery, Chris Steele-Perkins's photographs of England in the 80s are powerful in a much more intimate but visceral way. Ironically titled The Pleasure Principle, they are visual reports from a time of great social and political upheaval. The first image that greets you as you enter the room is an unforgettable fly-on-the-wall portrait of Margaret Thatcher flanked by fawning followers – one of whom seems to be about to orgasm with delight at the proximity of his beloved leader – at a Tory party conference in 1985. The yuppie 80s are portrayed here in all their brash vulgarity, with garish images of the rich at play. The colours are gaudy, the humour jet black, but there is a kind of otherworldly poetry here too, in Steele-Perkins's panorama of ballroom dancers in Blackpool, shot from above and bathed in hazy red light. That same light wreathes a soldier on Territorial Army practice, who is caught hiding behind a tree in a hellish red mist like some forest sprite. Having not seen these photographs for some time, I was struck as much by Steele-Perkins's dramatic use of colour as by the often telling vignettes he captures. As a taster of his work this was great, but a big retrospective of this pioneering photographer's work is surely long overdue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2011/oct/02/low-cost-solar-panels-fuel-uk-boom","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-01T23:06:57Z","webTitle":"Low-cost imports from China fuel boom in solar panels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/02/low-cost-solar-panels-fuel-uk-boom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/oct/02/low-cost-solar-panels-fuel-uk-boom","fields":{"headline":"Low-cost imports from China fuel boom in solar panels","bodyText":"British homeowners are increasingly able to build greener homes by using cheap solar panels from China, but western workers are paying the price with a wave of corporate collapses and layoffs among green energy firms. The price of PV (photo voltaic) solar panels has dropped by as much as a third this year alone, hastening the introduction of a low-carbon economy and reducing the time period when renewable energy needs public subsidy. And there is a boom at present as consumers try to install the low-cost equipment before the level of handouts via the government feed-in tariff (FIT) is reassessed in April next year. \"Prices (of solar panels) are falling so fast that some buyers are holding off making purchases on the expectation they will come down even more. We have seen an average fall of around 33% so far this year and I would expect to see a further 15% decline in the last quarter,\" says Gabriel Wondrausch, founder of Exeter-based PV installer, Solar Gift Solar. Wondrausch has traditionally bought in solar equipment from places such as Germany but says he is now poised to introduce a whole new range of low-cost panels with the help of Chinese manufacturers. Solar Century, a larger London-based supplier that also assembles PV equipment, says a large amount of its equipment is imported from China too. Britain has come late to the solar party with government ministers preferring in the past to concentrate on wind power and only fairly recently trying to stimulate demand by offering subsidies to solar users. This has meant PV manufacture has been concentrated in countries such as Germany and Spain where harnessing the power of the sun has been encouraged for many years. The US, and more recently China, have gradually latched on to the growing global market for solar and have been setting up factories in double-quick time. But the very low labour costs – and allegedly the very cheap finance available from state-owned institutions – has rapidly propelled China into pole position in the production of solar equipment. The rapid build-up in capacity in the Far East is playing a major role in driving down the cost of panels, but it is also being blamed for a crisis at many German and particularly American rivals. In recent months leading green equipment makers in the US such as Solyndra Solar, Evergreen and SpectraWatt have all been declared bankrupt, while SolarWorld has shut a factory in California and Hamburg-based Conergy, is to axe 100 jobs. The 1,100 job losses at Solyndra have caused a political storm in America over alleged predatory practices by Beijing. The situation has been made worse for Barack Obama by the fact the Californian company received more than half a billion dollars worth of loan guarantees from Washington. Republican critics of the US president and his climate change policies have been having a field day reminding Obama of a speech he made at the main Solyndra plant last year. \"The promise of clean energy isn't just an article of faith,\" Obama said, \"It's not just some abstract possibility for science fiction movies or a distant future or 10 years down the road or 20 years, it's happening right now. The future is here,\" he said. Senators in the US have recently written to Obama with a call for action to be taken against low-cost competition. \"Unless the US takes aggressive action to combat the import surge of Chinese solar panels and the unfair trade practices that China employs, our efforts to facilitate the creation of the new jobs our economy needs will be substantially undermined,\" wrote Democratic senator for Oregon, Ron Wyden. Parts of the US and German industry have voiced similar concerns and the air was thick with recrimination at the recent annual meet-up of the industry, the PV solar energy conference in Hamburg, earlier this month. But top Chinese companies have started to fight back, saying that their country is being used as a scapegoat for bad management, old technology or other individual company problems. They point out that even some smaller Chinese companies have been going to the wall as competition intensifies. Huang Ming, founder of Himin Solar Corporation, which claims to be the biggest solar thermal business in the world and is hoping soon to break into the British market, told the Observer: \"It's nonsense that Chinese companies are thriving on the back of low credit from state-owned banks. You can get lower interest rates from local banks in the west – and governments from Germany to the US have been offering financial support to solar developments.\" Whatever the reason for solar manufacturers losing out, it should be easy to see a winner: the British homeowner. But as Wondrausch points out, it is also tough for consumers deciding which panels they should buy knowing any producer could out of business and shred any 25-year guarantee along with it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/jun/14/solar-revolution-government-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-14T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"Response: It is shameful that this government is resisting a solar revolution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/14/solar-revolution-government-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/14/solar-revolution-government-cuts","fields":{"headline":"It is shameful that this government is resisting a solar revolution","bodyText":"You report that \"subsidies for large-scale photovoltaic installations are to be cut drastically\" (Solar power industry dismayed as subsidy for large plants cut, 10 June). However, the most devastating impact of the government's actions will be on \"community-scale\" solar – which is poorly understood but crucial to building a modern green electricity infrastructure. As you state: \"The government said its review of feed-in tariffs (FITs) for renewable energy would divert funds from field-sized ... solar power plants to panels on house roofs.\" The Renewable Energy Association campaigned alongside Friends of the Earth for the FIT legislation to ensure that diverse people and groups can invest easily in renewable power, including solar. Solar projects in schools, farms, businesses and local councils were beginning to flourish. Overseas, FITs have proven incredibly successful at driving renewables forward and opening up the electricity sector to millions of new investors. Solar is hugely popular, attractive and long-lasting. The UK has around 4,000 square kilometres of roof space. Solar on south-facing roofs and facades alone would meet a third of our electricity needs. If we invest today, by 2020 a typical domestic solar roof should cost around £3,000, supplying around half the occupants' power needs, carbon-free, for 40 years. But instead of embracing the future, the coalition government is locking the UK industry out of vital manufacturing and global share prospects. You report: \"The government's reform will favour domestic and other small-scale installations of solar electric power – up to 50kw ... which would not be enough for some community-scale installations.\" The industry was shocked that no assessment of economic and jobs benefits was undertaken by the government before, in effect, it killed off community and large-scale solar. Britain came late to solar and was clearly taken aback by the sheer dynamism of this global industry. More solar capacity was installed across Europe last year than any other renewable energy technology. Germany, China and Japan have scaled back on nuclear and invested heavily in both solar and wind. The UK solar industry is asking for as little as £3 per household per annum during the lifetime of this parliament to start a solar revolution in Britain. Minister Greg Barker says: \"I want to drive an ambitious roll-out of new green energy technologies in homes, communities and small businesses.\" I can't support his very limited domestic plans. He has been boxed in by the Treasury (no experts on energy), and let down by his own department's shockingly poor understanding of solar: the latest report by its \"expert\" consultants anticipates a 37% drop in solar costs between 2010 and 2020. Prices dropped around 25% last year alone. The government needs a fresh approach to this technology, which has the potential to revolutionise the way we own and generate electricity. Solar energy has to be allowed to compete directly with fossil fuels and new nuclear. It empowers millions of people, not a handful of energy companies.

There are three reasons why astronomers and space buffs should cheer the seven-year, $800m robot mission and one reason why they should sob. Asteroids and comets are the rubble left over from the making of the solar system: this pristine stardust, unchanged for 4.5bn years, is of immense scientific interest. Asteroids and comets are packed with an astonishing array of organic chemicals, including amino acids, the building blocks of proteins: there is an enduring suspicion that they may have played a role in triggering life on Earth. And the target asteroid, 1999 RQ36, is an enormous lump of rock that crosses the Earth's orbit and could in theory smash into us, with calamitous consequences – it would help to know more about it, in case evasive action is necessary. But the Osiris-Rex mission (the acronym stands for Origins-Spectral Interpretation-Resource Identification-Security-Regolith Explorer) is also a wistful reminder of abandoned dreams. Four decades ago, the Star Trek and Avatar future seemed not just possible, but almost inevitable. Science had embarked on a course lit by science fiction – the space odyssey would continue. By 2001, the visionaries promised, there would be human settlements on the moon and Mars. And in high orbit around Earth, or balanced at points in space where solar and terrestrial gravity were equal, there would be artificial housing estates, orbiting homes to 10,000 people, and industrial centres: the conversion of captive asteroids into wealth on an astronomical scale. Space scientists calculated that a nickel-iron asteroid of one cubic kilometre would contain 7bn tons of iron, 1bn tons of nickel and enough cobalt to supply the planet for thousands of years. Carbon-rich asteroids would be sources of water, butane, ethane, methane and other organic chemicals that would keep space colonies in food, fertilisers, building materials and even booze, while the citizens exploited solar energy in its most direct form. Space was the high frontier, and in the euphoria generated by the moon landings, prophets like Arthur C Clarke and Gerard K O'Neill were perceived not as daydreamers but as the new realists. In the next 40 years, commercial investment in space grew exponentially, but only to make fortunes on Earth. There have been 10 missions to fly by, photograph and even touch these maverick lumps of celestial debris. But Osiris-Rex will be the first to pick up a whole pocketful of stardust, and bring it back for assay. A small step, but it keeps an old dream alive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2010/may/13/renewables-float-spain-economic-uncertainty","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-13T18:43:14Z","webTitle":"Uncertainty over Spanish economy hits green energy firms' ambitions to float","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/13/renewables-float-spain-economic-uncertainty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/may/13/renewables-float-spain-economic-uncertainty","fields":{"headline":"Uncertainty over Spanish economy hits green energy firms' ambitions to float","bodyText":"Renewable power companies have been forced to abandon attempts to raise money on the London and Madrid stock markets amid fallout from the European debt crisis and concerns about future public spending levels. Among the victims are Engyco, led by the former United Utilities boss John Roberts. The company told The Guardian today that it was unable to proceed with a £1bn initial public offering in the City. \"The situation is that it [the IPO] is on hold but the company is determined to complete it and the feedback from investors is positive,\" said a spokesman for Engyco which had previously talked of a float in late April or early May. Renovalia, the Spanish renewables firm, and T-Solar, the solar power business, have also been hit by uncertainty over the future of the European currency and subsidy levels. These businesses have postponed IPOs which would have sucked hundreds of millions of pounds into low-carbon projects, but they needed operating subsidies to thrive. Chaos in the financial markets has spelled trouble for companies as large as the Prudential insurance group, which wants to raise money, as well as forcing a halt to planned floats by firms as diverse as the budget fashion retailer, New Look, the London Eye and Merlin Entertainments, which runs Madame Tussauds. All three of the renewable power companies are tied into the Spanish market where commercial confidence has been undermined by speculation that the country could be the next after Greece to hit serious financial problems. The Madrid government made the situation worse by suggesting it might in future cut subsidies to the solar market – perhaps retroactively – a move that sent the share price of local renewable companies spiralling downwards. Madrid has sucked in an estimated €18bn in solar-power projects since 2008 by offering generous public subsidies, but it is now looking at cutting back. Miguel Sebastián, the minister for trade, has since promised not to make any cuts on projects already given the go-ahead but indicated new wind and solar funding is likely to be lower than before. Engyco, was formed recently as a vehicle for investing in the Spanish solar market by buying up existing assets with the hope of creating a pure renewables utility that could raise billions of pounds in the bond market. City analysts specialising in the clean-technology sector have believed for some time there was little chance of Engyco being launched in the near future given the negative noises coming out of Madrid. \"This is nothing less than a catastrophe\" for investors, said Stephane Aderca, an energy analyst at Liberum Capital in London last month. Engyco had previously denied there was any chance of the scheme being postponed, saying the roadshow with investors would continue and there was strong support for it. Today, the company said the float was \"on hold\" not \"postponed\", but declined to speculate when the IPO mightnow be completed. Renovalia has meanwhile said it does not expect to float till after the summer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/06/sun-cause-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-06T08:00:00Z","webTitle":"Is the sun causing global warming?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/06/sun-cause-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/06/sun-cause-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Is the sun causing global warming?","bodyText":"Over the very long term, variations in Earth's orbit that shape where and when sunlight reaches the planet are the main cause of ice ages, but this doesn't apply to our current situation. It's true that the Sun has produced more sunspots in recent decades than it did in the early 1800s. However, this mainly reflects an increase in the ultraviolet range of sunlight, which is only a tiny part of the solar spectrum. In fact, the total solar energy reaching Earth changes very little over time. Across the 11-year solar cycle, it varies by less than 0.1%, and even across the period since the little ice age chill of 1750, solar output climbed no more than about 0.12%, according to the 2007 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Subsequent estimates by Judith Lean of the Naval Research Laboratory and others have pegged the solar contribution to 20th-century warming at 10% or less. And a recent analysis of solar trends suggests that – over the last few decades – the sun has actually contributed a slight cooling effect, rather than accounting for any of the observed warming. There's still a question mark or two when it comes to ultraviolet radiation, where the lion's share of solar variability occurs. It's possible that UV rays interact with ozone in the stratosphere in a way that inhibits low-level cloud formation and thereby allows more sunlight to reach the earth, but there is no strong evidence to suggest that this is a significant factor in practice.

There was a cold winter, a glorious but very dry spring, an Autumnal heatwave and a late drought, but the government which promised to be the greenest ever, was pilloried for its proposed actions on planning, forests, air quality, climate change, solar energy, sustainable development, biodiversity, nuclear power, badgers, geo-engineering, rivers, shale gas, energy conservation, roads, public transport and a lot more besides. Only a few nuclear industry fans and some optimistic marine conservationists had much to celebrate. It started terribly for the politicians. By mid-January protesters in the Forest of Dean and the Lake District had made it clear that plans to sell off 250,000ha of the English forestry estate were barmy. In the next few weeks, more than 500,000 people signed a petition to stop it, and environment secretary Caroline Spelman unified left and right, crusty and county, young and old, the National Trust and the Countryside Alliance against her plan. Remarkably, the only people standing up for it appeared to be some of the big wildlife conservation groups who, close to government, possibly stood to benefit, along with rich landowners. Cameron had to step in and Spelman was forced to withdraw the plans and apologise profusely in the Commons for \"having got it wrong\". A panel of the great and the good was set up to reconsider the future of English forests and and will report back in the spring of 2012. But an even more embarrassing confrontation with the public came in July with government's draft plans to dismantle the entire planning system. Nobody objected to rationalisation, but the proposed presumption in favour of development over all social and environmental considerations led to apoplexy among organisations as disparate as Friends of the Earth and the CPRE, Campaign for Better Transport, local authorities and the Theatres Trust. Most feared a return to sprawl, the demise of favourite places, and damaging free for all development in suitable places. The National Trust, its gander up after leading the fight against the forest sell-off, went head to head with the government, and got 200,000 signatures to try to force a climbdown. But while opposition simmered through the year as a long consultation took place, the tipping point may have been reached in December when a powerful committee of MPs demanded that the \"default yes\" to development be removed from the text. The planning minister, Grant Shapps must decide soon. However, the government did please that half of the population which felt that the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan should not delay the building of 10 reactors in Britain. The UK's chief inspector of nuclear installations, Mike Weightman, reported in May that the Japanese disaster was no reason to abandon nuclear power, but it later emerged that extra safety checks mean the first station cannot now be delivered before 2019, and could cost vastly more than expected. Meanwhile, ministers revealed that the government wanted to build a plant for processing nuclear waste, just four months after a similar plant costing the taxpayer £1.4bn was closed. A combination of the recession and a mild winter had seen UK carbon emissions fall in 2009, but in March 2011 the latest figures showed them up by nearly 3%. The better news, said Decc, was that the UK had now cut greenhouse gas emissions by 24.8% since 1990 and now generates nearly 25% of its electricity from low carbon, nuclear and renewable sources. Undeterred by its unpopularity in the countryside, the government gave in to pressure by farmers to slaughter over eight years, as many as 105,000 badgers, which, it is alleged, cost the nation as much as £100m a year by spreading TB. The cull, to be carried out in Wales and the west country, will be carried out by farmers with rifles and is likely to be strongly opposed by animal lovers. Hopes that shale gas, locked in rocks deep below Lancashire and elsewhere, could compensate for dwindling north sea oil and gas reserves were raised in September when Australian fracking company Cuadrilla announced that it had \"gas in-place\" in its licence area in Lancashire of 200 trillion cubic feet – more than the entire previous UK proven gas reserves, and many times what the British Geological Survey had estimated. But reality struck when scientists concluded that the test drilling earlier in the year had \"highly probably\" set off two mild earthquakes and protesters invaded the company rigs. Deutsche Bank calmed nerves when its analysis suggested it was extremely unlikely that there would be a bonanza or that it would reduce gas prices. Finally, conservation had a bad year. Powerful groups like the RSPB, the Wildlife Trusts, the Woodland trust, Plantlife, Buglife and Butterfly Conservation could all point to individual successes, but Natural England, the official body responsible for advising and defending the natural world at the highest levels of government, effectively lost its voice. Its budget was cut to the bone, many of its best people left, and in the words of ecologist Peter Marren, author of Nature Conservation, \"our wildlife watchdog has morphed into a pathetic delivery boy, charged with attending to \"customer focus\". The longterm consequences on wildlife may not be seen for years, but the government gave notice of what it is planning, asking the public through its \"red tape challenge\" to identify regulations and laws that could be lifted to allow business to perform better. Under the environment topic, the 159 regulations on biodiversity, wildlife management, landscape, countryside and recreation are specifically mentioned, as well as the regulations on air quality, energy labelling and sustainable products. The potential for rolling back 60 years of environmental protection is now greater than ever. The possibility of deep embarrassment for Britain at the London Olympics as well as swingeing EU fines helped to shoot air pollution way up the national agenda in 2011. Government figures released in June showed that 17 regions and cities, including London, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and Cardiff, were well above the legal limit for N02 emission, and were not expected to get below it for another five years. Meanwhile, particulate pollution – the minute sooty particles mainly from traffic that get deep into the lungs – was shown to be linked to thousands of deaths every year. The London Assembly urged mayor Boris Johnstone to take action and the environment audit committee thundered that air pollution now costs £8.5-20bn per year and is leading to 4000 premature deaths a year. But the government avoided being sued by activist lawyers ClientEarth working with Clean Air London. Sadly, Environmental Protection UK, one of the world's oldest environment groups, folded as a national organisation in November after 114 years fighting air pollution. The bravest man of the year was surely comedian David Walliams who spent eight days swimming the Thames for charity in September. Within hours of starting he was violently ill, having caught a dose of water pollution. Happily it wasn't as bad as that which struck down and killed double Olympic gold medal winner Andy Holmes, who died only months before after catching a bacterial infection in a river. The irony, not lost on conservationists trying to protect river habitats, is that government can say that British rivers have never been cleaner in 100 years because they only measure some pollutants. In fact 75% fail new EU standards, nitrate levels are higher than they were 140 years ago and raw sewage regularly floods into the Thames and other rivers whenever there is a storm because the drains cannot cope."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/pepsico-renewable-local-wind-farms","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-05T16:09:30Z","webTitle":"Don't invest in wind farms unless it makes sense for your business locally","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/pepsico-renewable-local-wind-farms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/pepsico-renewable-local-wind-farms","fields":{"headline":"Don't invest in wind farms unless it makes sense for your business locally","bodyText":"The world's largest consumer packaged goods companies are most often recognised through the lens of the billion-dollar global brands that they produce. However, to build a global business with which other businesses can be proud to affiliate, and from which consumers want to buy products, a company must realise that its true, long-term worth is determined by the investment it makes in its employees, in the communities where it operates and in the environment, as well as its financial performance. From a sustainability perspective, these consumer-facing companies must find ways to make investments that will have an impact on greening the planet, while simultaneously delivering profitable growth. It has been our experience that few global companies have achieved significant reductions in their environmental impact simply by launching a few large projects driven by central headquarters. Rather most, including PepsiCo, have discovered that they must leverage the comparative advantage of each market when choosing where to invest in green energy. PepsiCo has publicly stated a target to reduce fossil fuel-based energy usage by 20% per unit for electricity and 25% for fuels, and achieve a reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve these targets in a way that proves advantageous for all stakeholders as well as the planet, we have to find the right combination of technology and geography. Wind energy is a clear example of where geography determines where an investment makes sense. Bionomicfuel.com lists the United States, Germany and India among the countries that use wind energy most efficiently. As an example of leveraging geographical advantages, PepsiCo India directly invested in three turbines, taking advantage of natural winds in the eastern mountains of the country to install more than three megawatts of electrical capacity. For this project to make sense, we installed the turbines where the wind was, as opposed to where the factories were located. We then worked with a third-party operator and the local electrical grid to feed electricity into the grid and take our benefit at the factory. Location is also key to economic viability in both solar and biomass energy applications. Biomass applications are highly dependent upon a ready supply of sustainable raw materials. These materials are more plentiful in North America than in other developed markets. However, even in North America, a developed supply chain is required to justify a substantial investment. In a unique relationship between the city of Topeka, Kansas, and Frito-Lay, our snack-food division, the city is able to facilitate the supply of enough cellulosic-based biomass material to supply a 60-ton-per-hour boiler steam operation for the factory. Without the support of the city, this project would not have been nearly as viable. According to recent research by Solarbuzz, solar energy demand has grown by an average 30% per year over the past 20 years. Particularly in markets where sunlight is abundant, solar technology is a great, cost-effective source of energy. Frito-Lay is taking advantage of this renewable source at facilities where sunlight is abundant, namely in Arizona, US, and Tarsus, Turkey. Solar facilities are capturing the energy of the sun to provide electricity for lighting, building heat in winter and cooking processes in the factory. Large alternative energy projects typically cost more than $1m (£620,000) per megawatt to install. Regardless of the investing company's intent, the economics are directly driven by the local cost of traditional fuels, availability of alternative sources and support of local authorities. As a result, other multinational companies such as P &amp; G, Walmart and Unilever, to name a few, have announced a mix of projects that they are supporting around the world to help achieve their environmental objectives. Local viability, I am sure, is a key factor in each investment. This is not to say that a global strategy is not essential. PepsiCo, like most multinationals, relies on broadly aligned and communicated corporate strategies to move our environmental sustainability agenda in the right direction. In March 2010, we unveiled a series of global goals and commitments that serve as guideposts for our global mission but, also give locally operating businesses the responsibility of devising their own local solutions. In the examples above, the local businesses found a way to align with the corporate objective in a meaningful and profitable way for their individual circumstances. The best practice, I believe, for most companies is: align globally and execute locally to achieve both profitability and sustainability.

After New Hampshire we know the following: Mitt Romney will be the Republican nominee; Jon Huntsman's strategy of putting all his eggs in the New Hampshire basket did not work well; Ron Paul, who came in second in New Hampshire, will not win the GOP nomination. However, Ron Paul is the only candidate for the Republican nomination whose endorsement will matter to Mitt Romney. It is the only endorsement that will bring votes and the only endorsement, if withheld, that could cost Romney the general election. If Ron Paul speaks at the GOP convention (as he was not invited to do in 2008), the party will be united and Romney will win in November 2012. If Ron Paul speaks only at his own rally in Tampa, Florida (as happened at the 2008 GOP convention in Minnesota) the party will not be at full strength. Gingrich, Santorum and Rick Perry divided up 20% of the New Hampshire vote – less than either Romney or Ron Paul received. They will now divide the non-Romney, non-Ron Paul vote in South Carolina. Unless something else happens. Grover Norquist is president of Americans for Tax Reform Matt Lewis: 'South Carolina is conservatives' last hope to derail Romney's candidacy' Mitt Romney's speech Tuesday night sounded more like a convention speech than a New Hampshire election victory speech. Maybe, there's a good reason for that. In winning so decisively – he is the first non-incumbent Republican to win Iowa and New Hampshire in modern times – Romney made history. If there was ever any doubt, Romney is now the clear frontrunner, and is poised to essentially lock up the Republican nomination with a win in South Carolina. Conservatives, having failed to coalesce around a single anti-Romney alternative, now find themselves struggling to stop the Romney juggernaut. If they fail to stop Romney in South Carolina, my guess is the conservative money dries up, and Romney's nomination becomes a fait accompli. There is one caveat: a Super Pac affiliated with Newt Gingrich is preparing to spend more than $3m in the Palmetto State to stop Romney. That might be the last hope for those who want to derail Romney's candidacy, and puncture the notion of his electability (and of his inevitability). We shall see if the attacks work. In the meantime, Ron Paul deserves praise for a strong second place finish in New Hampshire. Paul, of course, won't win the nomination – but he will collect delegates along the way. Paul may not win the election, but his real goal is to win the argument. In that regard, Paul likely has won a convention speech for himself – and may help influence the Republican plank – and the direction of the party. Matt Lewis is senior contributor to the Daily Caller Cheri Jacobus: 'The attacks on Romney for his work at Bain Capital inflicted no mortal wound' Mitt Romney not only made history with his back-to-back Iowa and New Hampshire wins, but despite the large field of candidates and Tuesday's record turnout, he matched or surpassed recent non-incumbent GOP nominees' New Hampshire percentages. Having bested his own 2008 numbers, he heads to conservative South Carolina with a strong lead, indicating that he hits enough of the high notes for the various segments of the GOP and can unite the party. That's outstanding news for Romney, but ominous news for President Barack Obama. Romney is deftly wooing and winning over conservatives, who are becoming increasingly more comfortable with him. And as Obama is haemorrhaging independent voters who carried him over the finish line in 2008, Romney is proving he can hold them. The attacks on Romney for his work at Bain Capital took a slight toll, but no mortal wound was inflicted. It provided him with the opportunity to address the matter months before the Obama attack machine brings it on. Bain created a net 100,000 jobs, with Romney risking his own money. President Obama gambled taxpayers' money on his campaign supporter's solar energy company, Solyndra, which then failed, costing approximately 1,000 people their jobs. Game, set and match. What to watch: Newt Gingrich's allies have a fresh wad of cash to spend in South Carolina. Romney may have the wind at his back, but at the same time, needs to watch his back. Cheri Jacobus is a political strategist, pundit and writer Michael Wissot: 'Romney can potentially hold 28% in South Carolina and still win' On Perry. On Paul. On Huntsman. On Santorum. On Gingrich. The contagious euphoria over tepid campaign outcomes is truly astonishing. Staffers and supporters alike are pressing their candidates to look to the next primary. At some point, they need to turn around and see who is following. The issue for conservatives is not whether a suitable alternative to Mitt Romney exists – rather, which one to choose from a crowded field. Romney's victory in New Hampshire reveals a predictable trend: pluralities, regardless of the runners-up, still propel his march to the nomination. The New Hampshire exit polls tell the story. Romney captured 48% of registered Republicans, so he's increasingly tapping the richest source of delegates. Jon Huntsman's core voter base (postgraduates, social moderates, opposed to the Tea Party) is simply too small, and his performance last night will be short-lived. Ron Paul fares well in open primaries (beating Romney 32% to 29% among independents), but fails to galvanise GOP voters. Newt Gingrich's biggest problem is Rick Santorum, and vice versa. They collectively won 43% of \"very conservative\" voters, compared to Romney's 33%. But neither Gingrich nor Santorum can afford to split that base. South Carolina may offer their last shot at reversing the momentum. Pundits question whether these pluralities expose a weakness in Romney's candidacy. In reality, they're fortifying it. Unless Gingrich and Santorum go after each other – an unlikely scenario – Romney can potentially hold 28% in South Carolina and still win. As the window of opportunity narrows, only one candidate seems poised to steadily move on. Michael Wissot is a senior strategist for Luntz Global James Antle: 'Ron Paul is building a real movement for his ideas within the GOP' In 2008, New Hampshire Republican primary voters were supposed to do two things: deliver a victory to Mitt Romney, a recent former governor of a neighboring state, and give a strong showing to Ron Paul, who represents the area's \"Live Free or Die\" libertarianism. The Granite State wound up doing neither. Romney, already battered by a loss in Iowa, came in second to John McCain, realistically ending his campaign. Paul underperformed his final poll numbers and finished fifth, making New Hampshire one of just a handful of states where he got fewer votes than Rudy Giuliani. But this time around, New Hampshire did what it was expected to do. Romney won the primary with just under 40% of the vote. Paul came in second with a shade under 23%. The only other candidate who impressed was Jon Huntsman, who shared Romney's uneasy relationship with social conservatives and Paul's reluctance to join in the chest-beating that passes for Republican foreign policy debate. Huntsman's third-place showing was a bit of a disappointment based on the last-minute polls, however. Romney did best among the Republicans whose biggest priority is beating Barack Obama in November. The candidates most capable of doing Romney harm in the Southern primaries, where the relatively moderate Mormon from Massachusetts is least popular, did poorly. Rick Santorum, who nearly toppled Romney in Iowa, may have finished fifth behind Newt Gingrich. Rick Perry got around 1% of the vote. New Hampshire leaves us with Mitt Romney moving toward the Republican presidential nomination, and Ron Paul building a real movement for his ideas within the GOP. What the rest of the candidates are doing at this point is impossible to tell.

Set up by Solarcentury in 2006, the charity helps local entrepreneurs replace harmful kerosene with solar power to light homes, charge mobile phones, power rural communities and create \"sunny schools\". Solarcentury is a business with an explicit sustainable purpose: to fight climate change. But while the company gives 5% of its profits to SolarAid, its social impact can increasingly be found much closer to home. The solar energy company runs Solar4Schools to provide photovoltaic (PV) electricity to UK schools. In 2010 it also worked with over 50 housing associations to help reduce fuel poverty in social housing. Both these projects make solar power accessible to more people in areas where previously it may not have been viable – whether for financial or social reasons, or because of lack of awareness. Over 260 schools have gone solar since 2008. And last year – working with partners GE Capital and the ethical bank Triodos – the company made Solar4Schools even more accessible, providing finance to bring solar into education with minimal upfront costs. Importantly, the government-backed solar feed-in tariff (FiT) – a financial incentive to install PV power on UK buildings – has encouraged wider uptake since it launched in April 2010. FiT rewards PV system owners for every unit of electricity they generate over a guaranteed period of 25 years. For example, an average three-bedroom home will earn around £900 a year from its energy company by generating solar electricity, on top of a likely £140 reduction on household energy bills. Solarcentury campaigned for the FiT tariff to be set at a rate that would trigger wide investment, and between April and June last year saw the number of its PV installers double. The important issue for social housing is fuel poverty, a problem that is exacerbated by rising fuel costs. Fuel poverty is a particular concern for people on lower incomes and Solarcentury is working with organisations like the South Yorkshire Housing Association (SYHA) to address it. Each solar system installed is expected to meet around 30% of tenants' electricity consumption and provide an annual saving of £130. The income received by housing associations goes towards creating jobs and investing in other energy efficient schemes.

Australian physicist David Mills is developing large-scale pollution-free solar thermal electricity (STE) plants in California, estimated costs being less than imported oil. With only 16 hours of storage capacity, STE can supply the great majority of the US national grid over the year, with hourly solar radiation data including typical cloudy weather patterns. Mills calculates that the total land requirement to supply the US national grid amounts to the equivalent of a square with 153km sides. If the US transport vehicle fleet were converted from oil to electricity, the land area required for solar energy capture and storage would increase to between 182km and 211km on a side. In 2006, the US department of energy calculated that total vehicle emissions amounted to 2bn metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent, which is close to the annual US electricity generation of 2.3 metric tonnes of CO2. It is technically, if not yet politically, feasible to replace fossil-fuelled energy generation with clean solar power, not only in the US but also in other big polluting countries. Since Jenny Goldie informs us that the world is running out of oil (Reply, 20 January), sun-drenched Middle Eastern suppliers could convert from ancient polluting stored solar capital to clean STE currency and export power to European and African grids, thereby saving their economies and delaying the worst scenario of global heating. Bryan Furnass Canberra, Australia Enlightenment values There is much one could take issue with in Will Hutton's article, since much of what he is rallying against is a reaction – often overreaction – to political correctness gone mad (Blood, faith and tribal bonds will not save us, 13 January). There is one specific reference in his argument that is totally incorrect, grossly unfair and exceedingly insulting to Hungary. Viktor Orbán, the much maligned Hungarian prime minister does not \"propose to offer ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring countries Hungarian citizenship\": that option has been available to those Hungarians for some time now and many are taking advantage of it. It is questionable if Hutton knows, or indeed cares, how those ethnic Hungarians came to be living in neighbouring countries. They are not some huge emigre diaspora. They are people living where their ancestors lived for over 1,000 years within the borders of historical Hungary, brutally carved up by the victorious allies after the first world war at the infamous Treaty of Trianon in 1920. The disgraceful mutilation of historical Hungary as the result of that treaty robbed that nation of more than 70% of its territory, containing most of its mineral wealth and 60% of its population. Many of the allied leaders expressed their disgust at the falsified information on which they relied when formulating the treaty, provided to them by leaders of minorities living in Hungary and seeking self-determination. Sadly, the Depression and the second world war prevented any remedial action. Now Hutton has the temerity to criticise Orbán for enabling the descendents of people who found themselves on the wrong side of arbitrarily drawn borders to regain the citizenship of their birthright. Bill Martin Valentine, NSW, Australia • The profit-growth imperative now dictates that the Enlightenment, entitlements, democracy, peace, science and decency are dispensable, to be discussed only in \"quiet rooms\". There is plenty of available money and ignorance to implement the dictatorship of capital – fascism. Keep your mouth shut and keep shopping. Greed, however, cannot stop the laws of physics forcing the planetary chemistry to devastate the biology. The rest of this century will be quite a show. Defending the Enlightenment is not enough; rebel to win. Richard Blackburn Coogee, NSW, Australia Help for rural farmers The article (Why food prices keep surging, 30 December) points out that last year the global price of food was higher than ever and thus it was a great year for the traders. You also reported that in France for half the crop species it is forbidden to use your own seed (French farmers have to pay to use their own seeds, 6 January). This increases dependence on seed manufacturers, as it seems food producers are getting squeezed at both ends by agribusiness. French farmers who enjoy subsidies and access to large urban markets may well cope; those who will struggle will be the large populations of rural poor in the developing world. Alina Paul-Bossuet's article (Little things make all the difference, 6 January) offers some solutions for our rural food producers to dually contribute to world food supply and to their own livelihood. This can be done via \"selling small, affordable amounts of seed, fertiliser or other products\" . With the world population growing and becoming more urbanised, by 2030 70% of earth's population will be urban and will need to be fed. There is a need to think creatively and constructively on how to make this work for food consumers and producers. As Paul-Bossuet explains, \"specifically tailored advice is needed to help farmers make informed choices\": whether it is by NGOs or government extension officers, this advice should benefit the producers. This in turn will stem the tide of urban drift. The dependence of rural food producers on agribusiness has not delivered better livelihoods for them and has had negative effects on the environment; let's hope this can be turned about before the masses depart from the rural areas to the big smoke. Liam Golding Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia Is it really a Stradivarius? It is well known than anyone can make a study that will prove their point, however wrong that point may be, and the study by Claudia Fritz is a perfect example (Stradivarius? You don't say, 13 January). The modern violins were chosen from a pool of instruments for their impressive sound quality – they had their qualities optimised – whereas the old instruments were on loan and did not have any soundpost or bridge adjustments after the flight to Indianapolis, nor did they have new strings. We don't know if the old instruments were in use or if they had been sitting on display in a case, which is more likely. Instruments are living breathing things that need to be played. Whenever an instrument is out of use the sound dries up, and the longer it has been out of use the longer it takes for the sound to come back. I have known instruments that took well over a year of consistent playing to regain their quality of sound because they had been out of use for so long, and unfortunately people have a habit of putting Strads in museums, as if they were made to be looked at. If you want to know what really happened at this \"study\" then go to Laurie Niles's blog at violinist.com. Sarah Westwick Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Inelegant words multiply In Jonathan Yardley's review of Joseph Epstein's new book Gossip: The Untrivial Pursuit, he quotes the author: \"...part of the delight of gossip, after all, is, to use an old-fashioned word, its naughtiness\" (6 January). And then Yardley himself writes \"Another good old-fashioned word for it is mischievousness\". Well, I beg to differ: the old-fashioned word is mischief. One can't help but notice the propensity in recent years for writers to add the suffix \"-ness\" to adjectives that are derived from nouns, so as to make yet another noun, and one that would be as awkward to use in speech as it is unseemly to use in writing, compared to the old-fashioned noun. I can think of several other rather egregious examples, like obliviousness, zealousness and – get this one – honestness. I know that one can find examples of this practice in older writings, even in Shakespeare, but none quite so ridiculous as the examples that I've given. I'm not about to condemn this practice, but I ask this: why use an awkward word when a word that's much more direct, not to say much more euphonic, is right at hand?

Haile estimates that a rooftop reactor could produce about three gallons of fuel a day. She thinks transport fuels would be the first application of the reactor, if it goes on to commercial use. But she said an equally important use for the renewable fuels would be to store solar energy so it is available at times of peak demand, and overnight. She says the first improvements that will be made to the existing reactor will be to improve the insulation to help stop heat loss, a simple move that she expects to treble the current efficiency. The key component is made from the metal cerium, which is almost as abundant as copper, unlike other rare and expensive metals frequently used as catalysts, such as platinum. Therefore, said Haile, availability would not limit the use of the device. \"There is nothing cost prohibitive in our set-up,\" she said. \"And there is plenty of cerium for this technology to make a major contribution to global gasoline supplies.\" The fossil fuels used by vehicles, ships and aeroplanes pose the biggest challenge in the search for low-carbon energy, as they are highly energy-dense and portable, unlike alternatives such as batteries or nuclear reactors. An efficient, large-scale way of converting solar energy into a renewable liquid fuel could play a major role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and tackling climate change. The device, reported in the journal Science, uses a standard parabolic mirror to focus the sun's rays into a reaction chamber where the cerium oxide catalyst breaks down water and carbon dioxide. It does this because heating cerium oxide drives oxygen atoms out of its crystal lattice. When cooled the lattice strips oxygen from surrounding chemicals, including water and CO2 in the reactor. That produces hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which can be converted to a liquid fuel. In the experiments the reactor cycled up to 1,600C then down to 800C over 500 times, without damaging the catalyst. \"The trick here is the cerium oxide – it's very refractory, it's a rock,\" said Haile. \"But it still has this incredible ability to release oxygen. It can lose one in eight of its oxygen molecules.\" Caltech has filed patents on this use of cerium oxide. The use of sunlight to make fuel is being explored by groups around the world, such as that lead by Daniel Nocera at Massachussetts Institute of Technology. His group's technology works at room temperature but is more complex chemically. At the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory last year researchers found cobalt oxide could help sunlight create fuels, but only as nano-sized crystals. Imperial College in London is also exploring different catalysts. Other groups are exploring the use of CO2 from power station flues to create liquid fuels, while a related research effort is testing how algae grown in sunlight can be used to create fuels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/jul/13/spain-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-13T15:59:20Z","webTitle":"Spain overtakes US with world's biggest solar power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jul/13/spain-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/jul/13/spain-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"Spain overtakes US with world's biggest solar power station","bodyText":"Spain has opened the world's largest solar power station, meaning that it overtakes the US as the biggest solar generator in the world. The nation's total solar power production is now equivalent to the output of a nuclear power station. Spain is a world leader in renewable energies and has long been a producer of hydro-electricity (only China and the US have built more dams). It also has a highly developed wind power sector which, like solar power, has received generous government subsidies. The new La Florida solar plant takes Spain's solar output to 432MW, which compares with the US output of 422MW. The plant, at Alvarado, Badajoz, in the west of the country, is a parabolic trough. With this method of collecting solar energy, sunlight is reflected off a parabolic mirror on to a fluid-filled tube. The heated liquid is then used to heat steam to run the turbines. The mirror rotates during the day to follow the sun's movement. The solar farm covers 550,000 square metres (the size of around 77 football pitches) and produces 50MW of power. Protermosolar, the association that represents the solar energy sector, says that within a year another 600MW will have come on-stream and projects that by 2013 solar capacity will have reached 2,500MW. The northern, though thinly populated, region of Navarra is already producing 75% of its energy from a range of renewables, including wind, solar, hydro and biomass. Spain's windfarms now produce around 20,000MW of electricity and on one day in November they accounted for 53% of demand. Last year, solar energy met 2.8% of demand out a total of 12.9% for all renewables. In March, the government announced a plan to increase the renewable share to 22.7% by 2020, slightly ahead of EU targets. With an average of 340 days of sunshine a year in Spain, solar is more reliable than wind, and can go a long way towards weaning the country off gas-fired and ageing nuclear power stations. Spain is now the fourth largest manufacturer of solar power technology in the world and both solar and wind power technology exports have become valuable earners in a country with a weak manufacturing"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2011/jun/16/sun-astronomy","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-16T14:10:59Z","webTitle":"Solar cycle may go into 'hibernation', scientists say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jun/16/sun-astronomy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2011/jun/16/sun-astronomy","fields":{"headline":"Solar cycle may go into 'hibernation', scientists say","bodyText":"The next solar cycle – the 11-year pattern when dark spots appear on the sun's surface – may be delayed or even go into \"hibernation\" for a while, according to US scientists. But this does not mean a new ice age is coming, said astronomer Frank Hill of the US National Solar Observatory. \"We have not predicted a 'little ice age',\" Hill said, speaking from an astronomical meeting in New Mexico. \"We have predicted something going on with the sun.\" Hill and other scientists cited a missing jet stream, fading spots and slower activity near the sun's poles as signs that our nearest star is heading into a rest period. \"This is highly unusual and unexpected,\" he said. \"But the fact that three completely different views of the sun point in the same direction is a powerful indicator that the sunspot cycle may be going into hibernation.\" That hibernation would not begin now, as the current sunspot cycle, the 24th, has recently passed its minimum. Hill and his colleagues pondered a slowdown in sunspot activity in the 25th cycle, expected sometime around 2019. They also wondered whether this possible slowdown, or even a long cessation of sunspot activity, indicates an upcoming return of the Maunder Minimum, a 70-year sunspot drought seen from 1645-1715. They had no evidence as to whether this might be true, and said nothing about whether the Maunder Minimum was related to a long cold period in Europe and other parts of the Northern Hemisphere known as the little ice age. How strong a connection is there between a little ice age and a Maunder Minimum? \"Not as strong a connection as people would like to believe,\" Hill said. \"The little ice age actually lasted for hundreds of years, of which the Maunder Minimum was only a small segment. My opinion is that there is only an anecdotal connection without a whole lot of scientific background behind it.\" Some commentators have argued that the potentially cooling influence of a lower level of sunspot activity could cancel out the warming caused by human activities that generate climate-warming greenhouse gases. Hill disputed this. \"In my opinion, it is a huge leap to an abrupt global cooling, since the connections between solar activity and climate are still very poorly understood,\" he said. Across the sun's 11-year solar cycle, the total solar energy reaching Earth varies by less than 0.1%, and even across the period since the little ice age chill, solar output climbed no more than about 0.12%, according to the 2007 IPCC report. Subsequent estimates by Judith Lean of the Naval Research Laboratory and others have pegged the solar contribution to 20th-century warming at 10% or less. Mike Lockwood, professor of space environment physics at the University of Reading, said: \"Our research based on the behaviour of the sun over the past 9,000 years shows that there is indeed an 8% chance that we will return to Maunder Minimum conditions over the next 40 years. But there is no evidence at all that this will cause an ice age and, given the observed and predicted rise in greenhouse gases, we find it would do no more than slow global warming a little.\" Prof Joanna Haigh, an atmospheric physicist at Imperial College London, said: \"It would certainly be very risky to suggest that we rely on the sun's activity to compensate for global warming. In a future Grand Minimum the sun might perhaps again cool the planet by up to 1C. Greenhouse gases, on the other hand, are expected to raise global temperatures by between 1.5 and 4.5C by 2100. \"So even if the predictions are correct, the effect of climate change will outstrip the sun's ability to cool even in the coldest scenario; and in any case, the cooling effect is only ever temporary. When the sun's activity returns to normal, the greenhouse gases won't have gone away.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/feb/10/1","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-10T10:50:46Z","webTitle":"Green light: Green blogs festival, forest sell-off and frosty photos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/10/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/feb/10/1","fields":{"headline":"Green light: Green blogs festival, forest sell-off and frosty photos","bodyText":"Environment news • Engineers urge government to act now to 'climate-proof' UK infrastructure • Palm oil giant vows to spare most valuable Indonesian rainforest • Solar energy firms threaten legal action over feed-in tariffs • Decc surpasses 10:10 pledge to cut emissions by 10% in 2010 • China plots course for green growth amid a boom built on dirty industry • GM crops to be allowed into Britain under controversial EU plans Green blog festival The latest posts in our blogging journey around the world. • Australia's recent extreme weather isn't so extreme anymore • Whaling in Japan is on the verge of collapse • Tar sands are a blot on Canadian politics – as well as the landscape • Complacency over deforestation pushes orang-utan closer to extinction England forest sell-off • Has the government done U-turns on forest and nature reserves sell-off? • Why forest sell-off plans are not in the public interest • Jonathon Porritt attacks conservation groups for stance on forests sell-off • Forest sell-off: MPs under pressure to vote down plans Multimedia • The world's 10 most threatened forests – interactive • The price of success: China blighted by industrial pollution – in pictures • Green shoots January 2011: Frost - in pictures • The week in wildlife - in pictures Green living • UK governments have failed to support organic farming, says report • Live web chat: Dame Ellen MacArthur on the environment • Ethical pioneers changing the way we live • Totnes: Britain's town of the future • Should you talk on your phone while cycling? ...And finally • Norfolk's local hero fighting coastal erosion Michael Kennedy spends two hours a day shifting rocks to build sea walls"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/oct/13/green-economy-speech-cameron","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-13T12:14:00Z","webTitle":"The green speech David Cameron should give | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/oct/13/green-economy-speech-cameron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/oct/13/green-economy-speech-cameron","fields":{"headline":"The green speech David Cameron should give","bodyText":"With chancellor George Osborne badmouthing the green economy, those who see clean and sustainable investment as an opportunity not a threat are desperate for David Cameron to give strong public backing to his government's environmental policies. Ironically, the policies are pretty good – green deal, green investment bank, renewable heat incentive and so on – but without clear support from the top those investors who sign the big cheques needed to get the green economy going are going to waver. Since pledging to lead the \"greenest government ever\" days after taking office, the prime minister has been all but silent. With our comment and leader writer Julian Glover now off to write Cameron's speeches, I thought I'd help him on his way by writing the speech Cameron should – and could – give. Let me be absolutely clear, I don't agree with it all and the political attacks are just me getting into character. It is not \"me\" slamming Labour's record. The speech aims to give wholehearted support to those wishing to create jobs and growth in green industries, while addressing the fears about rising energy bills and the costs of going green. I give you … the prime minister: I understand that times are tough right now. That's why the government I lead is working in every way possible to repair the economic damage Labour left us and to make Britain fit to compete in the 21st century, bringing jobs and prosperity back. But while the global economic crisis threatens us today, the environmental crisis of climate change has not gone away. Unchecked, the damage global warming will cause to our prosperity is far greater. Not just affecting one year, one decade or even one generation, but blighting the prospects of our grandchildren and their grandchildren. That is why we need to tackle both the economic and climate challenges. And the good news is that we can do both. By saving energy, we make our homes warmer, our businesses more competitive and our nation's energy supply more secure. The best protection from rising energy bills is properly insulating our homes to make them warmer and cheaper to heat. That's why our Green deal programme will see 14m homes refurbished by 2020 - without causing home energy bills to rise by a penny. Along with our backing for modern, clean heating systems, these measures will create a thriving industry of local tradesmen serving local communities. How we generate our energy has to change too. We have no choice. One third of our coal and nuclear plants will close in the next decade and Labour's years of inaction meant nothing was in place to replace them. Thanks to the great work of Chris Huhne and his colleagues at Decc, we now have a strong plan. And the strength of that plan, like Britain itself, comes from diversity. Gas, nuclear, wind power and more; all will have their role to play. You may think wind turbines are a waste of time, stranded when the wind stops. Let me tell you, nuclear power plants go offline and the gas tap can be switched off as the Ukraine discovered to its cost. You may think renewable energy is too expensive to support in difficult economic times. That might be true if the cost of oil and gas was on a downward trend, or even holding steady. It is not. Building clean energy is an investment in keeping energy bills down in the long term. And let me be clear, green taxes are not the reason our energy bills are rising, it is the soaring cost of fossil fuels. We must get off that hook. But do not think for a moment that we are continuing Labour's wasteful ways. We will squeeze the greatest value for money out of every pound of invested. That is why we changed the feed in tariff given to large solar energy farms: Ed Miliband left a scandalous scheme where big business could get rich at taxpayers' expense. We will not tolerate a penny of waste as we build an energy system fit for the future. Many businesses will flourish as the UK leaves the polluting, high carbon economy behind: those making electric cars in the northeast, developing wave and tidal power in the south west, regenerating entire cities in the Midlands. I thank those businesses for what they have done and ask them to do even more, secure in the knowledge that I am on your side and by your side now and in the future. Other businesses are concerned that in our determination the create a secure energy system and fight global warming, we are making it harder for them to compete. Those of you making steel, cement, ceramics and paper, you say tougher rules on emissions will drive jobs to countries with weaker rules. That would be a double catastrophe: losing jobs and a losing battle against climate change. I will not let that happen. We value your work and we need your products to build a new Britain. But this is no time for handouts or special treatment. The country cannot afford it. Where there is genuine danger to your business, we will act. Where you overreach and seek to profit without effort from Britain's public purse, we will close the door. I want to talk now about leadership. I have been leading the Conservative party for six years now. As prime minister, I have taken action when others have said it was better not to: protecting Britain's economic security with a resolute deficit reduction plan; helping the Libyan people rid themselves of a cruel dictator; ensuring our international aid continues to help the very poorest in the world. Actions speak far louder than words. So when we discuss with the US or China or India or Japan how to reduce the carbon emissions that are driving global warming, we must do so from a position of leadership. We cannot demand action from others if we do not act ourselves. And if all nations waited for others to act, failure would inevitably follow, with terrible consequences. Britain can be a leader in the world. In the quality of our homes, in clean technology and industry, in the battle to defeat climate change. And we can reap the just rewards of leadership, jobs, growth and a modern, sustainable economy. Things may be difficult now, but there is a brighter future ahead. Work with me to secure that brighter future, for your family, your country and your world. Thank you. There.

Gas is likely to make up about one-quarter of the world's energy supply by 2035, according to the study, but that would lead the world to a 3.5C temperature rise. At such a level, global warming could run out of control, deserts would take over in southern Africa, Australia and the western US, and sea level rises could engulf small island states. Nobuo Tanaka, executive director of the IEA, told a press conference in London: \"While natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel, it is still a fossil fuel. Its increased use could muscle out low-carbon fuels such as renewables and nuclear, particularly in the wake of Fukushima. An expansion of gas use alone is no panacea for climate change.\" Governments are likely to come under pressure to reduce support for low-carbon energy and opt for gas instead, as oil and gas companies have been urging, in a move that could imperil the fight against climate change, the IEA warned. Fatih Birol, chief economist of the IEA and one of the world's foremost authorities on energy and climate, said: \"If gas prices come down, that would put a lot of pressure on governments to review their existing renewable energy support policies ... We may see many renewable energy projects put on the shelf.\" He said some renewable technologies, such as onshore wind, would continue to prosper but the worst affected projects were likely to be offshore wind and solar energy. Birol said the world must continue to invest in renewables, energy efficiency and carbon capture and storage, in order to stave off climate change. If the world fails to invest in renewables, a new generation of gas-fired power stations would have a lifetime of at least 25 years, effectively \"locking in\" billion of tonnes of carbon emissions a year. The Guardian recently revealed the extent of lobbying by the gas industry, which senses a unique opportunity to rebrand itself as green. Previously inaccessible sources of gas, known as \"unconventional\" gas, are predicted to create a \"golden age of gas\" with lower prices and plentiful supply. When burned for power, gas produces half the carbon of coal. However, a recent study from Cornell University suggested that this might not be the full story, as using shale gas - one of the chief forms of \"unconventional\" gas, derived from fracturing dense rocks - could create more emissions than coal because of difficulties in its exploitation. The IEA's estimates put the associated emissions much lower. Along with a supply glut - the IEA estimates there are at least 250 years of recoverable resources at today's demand levels - gas is benefitting from market turmoil surrounding some of the alternatives. \"Gas is a fortunate fuel because all its competitors have some problems,\" said Birol. Coal suffers high emissions, renewables can be expensive, and there are safety fears over nuclear after the Fukushima disaster in Japan. But Birol pointed to evidence that exploiting unconventional gas could bring severe environmental damage. In the US, there are many reports of contamination in the water supply near shale gas sites, and dangerous leaks of natural gas. In the UK, two small earthquakes have taken place near sites where a company is using \"fracking\" - the process of releasing gas from dense shale rocks by blasting it with water and chemicals. Fracking operations have been halted while investigations take place to establish whether there is a link. Birol said that the concerns around fracking should lead companies to adopt more stringent safety and environmental measures. \"If gas companies want to see a golden age of gas, then they need to stick to golden standards,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2011/aug/17/sierra-leone-barefoot-solar-engineers","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-17T11:52:49Z","webTitle":"The women bringing solar power to Sierra Leone | Meena Bhandari","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/aug/17/sierra-leone-barefoot-solar-engineers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/aug/17/sierra-leone-barefoot-solar-engineers","fields":{"headline":"The women bringing solar power to Sierra Leone","bodyText":"A group of 12 women from villages in Sierra Leone is in the frontline of a battle to bring solar-powered electricity to rural communities. No small feat, given that rural Sierra Leone is not connected to power. The women were all trained at Barefoot College in Tilonia, Rajasthan, in western India. They are now back in Sierra Leone assembling 1,500 household solar units at a new Barefoot College in Konta Line village, Port Loko district, which is to be formally opened next month. They sit at long wooden tables fitting tiny coloured resisters to circuit boards – heads tilted, deep in concentration, as smoke puffs up from their soldering irons. The women are all either illiterate or semi-literate – they used to be subsistence farmers, living day-to-day like millions in Sierra Leone. But now they are proud graduates, having travelled 6,000 miles to India to learn – in the women's words – \"how to make light from the sun\". \"The idea of solar was so surprising that I had to be a part of it,\" says Mary Dawo from Romakeneh village. \"Snakes, rodents, reptiles and biting insects crept and crawled into our homes with the dark at 7pm. Children couldn't study, and we couldn't relax, socialise or plan our lives after a long day's work,\" says Fatmata Koroma from Mambioma village. The Barefoot College in Sierra Leone is the first in Africa. It will enrol up to 50 students on four-month residential courses in solar engineering. The Sierra Leone government has invested about $820,000 in the project. Though the college is funded by the government, the women hope they can run it independently, in what they describe as the \"Barefoot way\". The solar equipment the college runs on, and the equipment for 10 villages, was provided by the Barefoot College in India, and the initial training was sponsored by the Indian government as part of its south-south co-operation programme. \"In India, the first problem was vegetarian food,\" says Koroma. \"The desert was too hot and everything was different. But, within months we could assemble circuits and construct systems. Anything was possible after that.\" The graduates now live in the college hostel, where they will stay until they have trained their replacements \"for the service to our villages and our country\", says Nancy Kanu. She was in the first female batch of students to train in India, in 2007, the same year that Konta Line village, where she's from, was declared the first solar village. She is now chief solar engineer. \"I teach full-time, but I'm on call – even at night – to fix a fuse, change a bulb or charge a phone,\" she says. People interact differently now in Konta Line, says Aminata Kargbo. \"People socialise more – they're nicer,\" she says. The advent of solar energy has saved the village about $1,000 in candles and kerosene so far; money that is being kept for the upkeep of solar equipment. However, the solar units are expensive [$500-$800] and far beyond the reach of most rural households. \"There's a 45% import tax … You need electricity to manufacture solar equipment here,\" says Idriss Kamara of the Safer Future Youth Development Project. The local NGO tackles the country's 60% youth unemployment, training people in vocational skills, including solar. But, Kamara says, few solar trainees find work because hardly any households use it. The government says it is looking to reduce the tax so benefits are passed on to customers and access to solar power increases. However, while Sierra Leone's government supports the Barefoot College project, people have wider energy needs, says Yvette Stevens of the ministry of energy and water. \"We are developing a broader rural energy programme focusing on community, productive and social needs,\" she says. Renewables such as solar, biofuels and hydro form the basis of this programme, supported by an upcoming World Bank project. \"There's a lot of donor money for renewables now, given their impact on climate change,\" says Stevens. The government envisages local solar systems will provide power for clinics and schools, and for \"water pumps, communal television, and computer centres\", she explains. Energy is not set out as a separate MDG, but it's vital in meeting them, she says. Sierra Leone is still catching up after the lost years of the decade-long civil war that wiped out the country's fragile infrastructure. More than 60% of people (about 3.6 million) live rurally. Few can afford generators. Even in urban areas, more than 90% of people go without power. A recent World Bank report states that electricity is Sierra Leone's most daunting infrastructure challenge. This, despite the new Bumbuna hydropower plant, which has improved the situation in the capital, Freetown, a little during the rainy season, providing nearly half the city's demand. Nevertheless, rural areas lag far behind. Sierra Leone records 46 days of power outages a year, which is four times higher than in other low-income African states. They may be a small part of a bigger strategy, but Sierra Leone's Barefoot women are thinking about the future. \"Once these units are installed, I think we'll need an investor to manufacture solar units here to make them affordable for everyone,\" Barefoot College graduate Kanu says. \"There's nothing we can't learn now to make our lives better. We have the power to change our villages.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/19/solar-legal-action-feed-in-tariffs","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-19T16:36:42Z","webTitle":"Solar companies take legal action over UK feed-in tariff cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/19/solar-legal-action-feed-in-tariffs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/19/solar-legal-action-feed-in-tariffs","fields":{"headline":"Solar companies take legal action over UK feed-in tariff cuts","bodyText":"Solar power companies are taking the government to court over last-minute changes to subsidies that they say are destroying their business. A group of companies filed on Tuesday for a judicial review against Chris Huhne, secretary of state for energy and climate change, for his decision to review the feed-in tariffs (Fits) that top up revenues for renewable power. Ministers said in February they would end subsidies to large-scale solar power installations from this summer to ensure all money available would go to domestic or small commercial installations. But solar companies are furious that dozens of planned installations will now be scuppered, including schemes for solar panels on farms, schools and other public buildings, which they said would have boosted the UK's renewable power capabilities. Larger scale deployments are more cost-effective than putting panels on individual roofs, say solar campaigners. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) said: \"We have been served with a judicial review in relation to the feed-in tariff review into large-scale solar, which we will consider. We support sustained growth in the solar industry and have proposed measures for consultation that will protect the Fits scheme for homes, small businesses and communities.\" We are consulting on proposals and would encourage those with an interest to respond. It added that solar photovoltaic schemes under 50 kilowatts are unaffected by the fast-track review. The case is based on the argument that Decc had made it clear that the first review of Fits would not take place until 2012, with changes not implemented until April 2013. Then last November, it said a review could take place earlier, but that any changes would not come into force until next year. Setting such expectations and then betraying them was unreasonable, the solar companies argue. They say Decc failed to give sufficient reason for beginning a review earlier than expected. There is no evidence of \"excessive\" deployment of large-scale solar power, according to the complainants. Mark Shorrock, chief executive of Low Carbon Solar UK, one of the group taking the case to court, said: \"Further to communicating our concerns through various meetings and letters [to ministers], we now feel that the only course of action left to us as a group is to seek a judicial review. We hope Chris Huhne will abandon this fast-track review of Fits and work with us to find a more appropriate solution.\" He said the government's plans would hobble solar development in the UK. \"In pulling back on a commitment to support solar energy, the government will cause the abandonment of hundreds of community scale schemes. The costs of not getting this right now include the creation of new jobs, a diversified income for farmers and landowners, reduced energy costs for businesses and the provision of more secure and reliable energy for the UK.\" The group of solar companies includes Low Carbon Solar, MO3 Power, Alectron Investments and Element Power. Several individuals are also involved in their own right."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jun/20/solar-panel-price-drop","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-20T11:14:57Z","webTitle":"Price of solar panels to drop to $1 by 2013, report forecasts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/20/solar-panel-price-drop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jun/20/solar-panel-price-drop","fields":{"headline":"Price of solar panels to drop to $1 by 2013, report forecasts","bodyText":"Prices of solar panels are falling so fast that by 2013 they will be half of what they cost in 2009, according to a report from Ernst &amp; Young that argues solar electricity could play \"an important role\" in meeting the UK's renewable energy targets. The average one-off installation cost of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels has already dropped from more than $2 (£1.23) per unit of generating capacity in 2009 to about $1.50 in 2011. Based on broker reports and industry analysis, the report forecasts that those rates of decline will continue, with prices falling close to the $1 mark in 2013. At present, solar PV is economically viable in the UK for homeowners, businesses and investors only because of government subsidies given out via feed-in tariffs (Fits). But the new analysis suggests that falling PV panel prices and rising fossil fuel prices could together make large-scale solar installations cost-competitive without government support within a decade – sooner than is usually assumed. The report was commissioned by the Solar Trade Association (STA) from Ernst &amp; Young's energy and environmental infrastructure advisory unit in response to the recent shake-up of Fits, which saw government support for large solar systems significantly reduced. This was a result of the government's decision to cap the total that could be spent via Fits and weight the limited budget in favour of domestic and other small-scale installations. The chairman of the STA, Howard Johns, said the new analysis backed up the industry line that government support for all types of solar systems in the next few years made good economic sense as it would build capacity and enable unsubsidised solar to be as widely deployed as possible as prices come down. \"This reinforces the case we have laid out in our Solar Revolution strategy,\" he said, \"and it comes from an independent consultancy.\" The report coincides with new data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance that show a drastic 28% month-on-month drop in the spot price of high-grade silicon, the raw material used in most PV panels. The conclusions of the Ernst and Young report contrast with the view of the government's advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), which recently argued that solar remained too expensive to warrant serious consideration in the short term and that Britain should instead \"buy in from overseas later\". The lead author of the Ernst &amp; Young report, Ben Warren, said the CCC's view failed to consider the wider economic benefits of solar. \"Being a laggard has never been very successful in terms of capturing the greater share of the value added for the economy … if you create a sustainable market, you will achieve cost savings and drive economic benefits in terms of tax income and job creation.\" To compare the relative cost of solar – usually described in terms of the dollar price of each watt of peak capacity – and other energy sources, analysts consider factors such as upfront expenditure, fuel prices, maintenance and discount rates to calculate the \"levelised\" cost of each unit of energy. The report predicts that, with continued support in the short term, the levellised cost of large-scale solar will be no higher than retail energy prices by 2016-19. This suggests that within 10 years companies with large electricity demands will find it cheaper to install unsubsidised solar than to buy energy via the grid in the traditional way. In the meantime, a full assessment of the costs and benefits of supporting solar should recognise that generous subsidies help unlock new sources of capital that can speed up decarbonisation of the energy supply, according to Warren. \"The energy market is starved of capital – and it won't all come from utilities and banks,\" Warren said. \"There's a desperate need to engage with institutional investors.\" In the runup to the announcement of the Fits cuts, climate minister Greg Barker told the Guardian that Britain had underestimated the potential of solar energy and in light of falling prices he hoped to find \"new pathways\" for supporting large-scale solar developments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2011/jun/20/germany-nuclear-power-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-20T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"Germany is right to opt out of nuclear | Ulrich Beck","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/20/germany-nuclear-power-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/20/germany-nuclear-power-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Germany is right to opt out of nuclear","bodyText":"\"You Germans are on your own\" was the reaction of Stewart Brandt, the American environmentalist, to Germany's plans to exit nuclear energy. He also added that Germany's decision was irresponsible. Economic considerations and the threat represented by greenhouse gases meant that we simply could not renounce nuclear energy. George Monbiot and Mark Lynas have argued along similar lines. Having been a member of the special expert commission appointed by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in the wake of Fukushima, I disagree. Ultimately, the rejection of nuclear is not a result of German angst but of economic thinking. In the long run, nuclear power will become more expensive, while renewable energy will become cheaper. But the key point is that those who continue to leave all options open will not invest. A hesitant Germany would fail to achieve the push of self-fulfilling prophecy in energy change that is required. Supporters of nuclear energy block their own access to the markets of the future because they are not investing in energy-saving products and in renewable energy – not even in \"green\" professional training and research institutes. The situation we are facing at the dawn of the 21st century is comparable to other turning points in energy generation. Just imagine what would have happened 250 years ago if people had brushed aside the suggestion that they should invest in coal and steel, steam engines, power looms and, later on, railways. Or what the world would be like now if 50 years ago people had seen the Americans suddenly investing in microprocessors, computers, the internet and the new markets that those technologies opened up and dismissed it all as the product of American angst. If we could open up just a part of the world's deserts for solar energy, we could satisfy the energy needs of the whole of civilisation. No one can take possession of sunlight; no one can privatise or nationalise it. Everyone can open up this source of energy for himself or herself and profit from it. Users of energy produced by a nuclear power plant have their electricity cut off if they fail to pay their bills. This cannot happen to people using electricity generated by the solar panels installed on the roofs of their houses. Why, of all nations, do the Americans, the French and the British – nations that value freedom so highly – persist in remaining blind to these emancipatory consequences of the coming change in power generation? People everywhere are proclaiming and mourning the death of politics. Paradoxically, the cultural perception of the danger may well usher in the very opposite: the end of the end of politics. To understand this, we need to go back to John Dewey's insight, formulated as early as 1927, in The Public and its Problems. According to Dewey, a transnational public sphere powerful enough to create a community arises not from political decisions, but from the consequences of decisions that have come to seem problematic in the lives of citizens. Thus a publicly perceived risk triggers communication between people who would otherwise prefer to have nothing to do with one another. It imposes obligations and costs on people who resist – and who often have the prevailing law on their side. In other words, what is denounced by many as a hysterical over-reaction to the \"risks\" of nuclear energy is in fact a vital step towards ensuring that a turning point in energy generation becomes a step towards greater democracy. The novel coalition between the state and social movements of the kind we currently see at work in Germany now has a historic opportunity. Even in terms of power politics, this change of policy makes sense. Only a conservative government close to industry is capable of pulling off such a shift in energy policy. It could well be that those who criticise Germany's decision to opt out of nuclear energy have fallen victim to the caterpillar's mistake: as it emerges from the chrysalis, it laments the disappearance of the cocoon because it has no premonition of the butterfly of renewable energy it is destined to become."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/mar/03/solar-panel-workable-future","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-03T17:30:01Z","webTitle":"Solar panels are not fashion accessories | Jeremy Leggett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/03/solar-panel-workable-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/03/solar-panel-workable-future","fields":{"headline":"Solar panels are not fashion accessories","bodyText":"George Monbiot's attack on solar energy and the government's \"cash-back\" solar photovoltaic (PV) market-building scheme paints a distorted picture of the industry I work in, and government policy towards it (Are we really going to let ourselves be duped into this solar panel rip-off?, 2 March). First, Monbiot gets the workability of solar wrong. He says: \"The amount of power PV panels produce at this latitude is risible, [and] they also produce it at the wrong time.\" Those who buy panels, therefore, will own a mere \"fashion accessory\". The companies who manufacture solar PV in the UK have shown that putting solar panels on all available building surfaces would generate more electricity in a year, under typical cloudy British skies, than the entire electricity consumption of our energy-profligate nation. Some fashion accessory. Of course, just a fraction of that area of buildings would suffice because we would want to mix and match renewable technologies – large and small, onshore and offshore – so matching loads and compensating for the fact that solar generates by day and not by night. Second, Monbiot says the government's scheme targets money where economies of scale are \"impossible\" – an incorrect assumption because solar electricity costs will inevitably fall to the point, within just a few years, where they are cheaper than any form of fossil fuel and nuclear electricity. Systemic economies of scale in solar manufacturing and installation techniques are causing rapid reductions in solar PV costs globally, just as Ofgem and others worry so loudly about the inevitable rise of traditional electricity costs. Third, Monbiot gets the precedent for the British government's solar \"cash-back\" scheme – the German feed-in tariff – upside down. He says the \"German government decided to reduce sharply the tariff it pays for solar PV, on the grounds that it is a waste of money\". But all feed-in tariffs are supposed to decline, and indeed reduce to zero within some years – that is the whole point. They are not like the market-building schemes for the nuclear technologies that Monbiot advocates, where subsidies – open and hidden – are needed for decades. Most Germans are rightly proud of their feed-in tariff regime. They have, after all, created over 50,000 jobs in solar PV alone. Fourth, Monbiot has it wrong about who pays the cash back. \"The government is about to shift £8.6bn from the poor to the middle classes,\" he says. But the number is not the cost to \"the poor\". It's not even the cost to all electricity consumers over the next two decades. The cumulative cost to all consumers – including all non-domestic industrial, public sector, and commercial users and covering all technologies in the scheme – is £6.7bn, and is spread over 20 years. The average household levy in 2013, when tariff rates are all up for review, is likely to be less than £3. This is far less than the average saving from the government's various domestic energy efficiency measures over the same period. So there is no net subsidy. The levy is not \"regressive\" at all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2009/apr/16/solar-energy-farms-space","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-04-16T13:26:00Z","webTitle":"Pacific Gas and Electric Company to tap solar energy in space","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/16/solar-energy-farms-space","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/apr/16/solar-energy-farms-space","fields":{"headline":"US power company to tap solar energy in space","bodyText":"A leading American power company is hoping to turn science fiction into reality by supporting a project to set up solar panels in outer space and beam the electricity generated back to Earth. Pacific Gas and Electric Company, which serves San Francisco and northern California, has agreed to buy electricity from a startup company claiming to have found a way to unlock the potential power supply in space. The firm, Solaren Corp, says it will launch solar panels into orbit and then convert the power generated into radio-frequency transmissions, which will be beamed back down into a depot in Fresno, California. The energy would then be converted into electricity and fed into the regular power grid, PG&amp;E said. Although spacecraft and satellites routinely use solar panels, the project marks the first serious attempt to take advantage of the powerful and near-constant supply of sunshine in space. Nasa and the Pentagon have been studying the idea of orbiting solar farms since the 1960s, and a number of private researchers have been looking at ways to tap into space-based solar energy. But Solaren Corp, founded by a former spacecraft engineer, says it has developed a technology that would make it commercially viable within the next seven years to transmit electricity generated in space to a terrestrial power grid. PG&amp;E announced this week that it had agreed to buy 200 megawatts of electricity from Solaren starting in 2016. The deal has yet to be approved by California state government regulators and PG&amp;E has not put any money into Solaren, but the promise alone has turned the notion of space based solar power from fantasy to reality. \"There is a very serious possibility they can make this work,\" said PG&amp;E's spokesman Jonathan Marshall. Unlike on earth, with its cycle of nights and days and where there can be clouds, sunshine in space is practically constant – aside from a few days around the spring and autumn equinoxes. That means the space-based solar panels could potentially produce a steady supply of electricity. The sunlight hitting solar panels 200 miles in space would be 10 times as powerful as the light filtering down to Earth through the atmosphere. The satellite would then convert the energy into radio waves and beam them down to a receiving station on Earth. Spirnak did not give details of how this would work but said the technology was based on that now used by communications satellites, describing it as \"very mature\". He added that power losses via the radio-wave route are lower than transmission cables used on Earth. Another advantage of the plan is that it does not require large amounts of real estate. Ground-based solar installations require huge tracts of land. Solaren has released relatively few details about the project. But Solaren's CEO, Gary Spirnak, said the company, a group of about 10 former satellite and aerospace engineers, was confident in the technology and timing behind the venture. He argued that the science behind the orbiting solar farms was little different to that of communications satellites. \"This is the exact same thing that satellites do every day. The basic technology is there,\" said Spirnak. \"The bottom line is that this is not really a technology issue.\" Daniel Kammen, a professor in energy and resources at the University of California, Berkeley, agreed: the most daunting challenge to Spirnak is cost. \"The ground rules are looking kind of promising. Whether we can do it at scale, whether we can do it affordably, whether it is too much of a technological leap or not, those are all factors,\" Kammen said. \"It is doable. Whether it is doable at a reasonable cost, we just don't know.\" Spirnak argues that a confluence of recent events now make the project more commercially viable. The cost of rocket launches – though still prohibitive – has been dropping because of the commercialisation of space, making it cheaper to send up and service solar panels. Spirnak will face a difficult task raising funds for his project though, especially in this time of global economic recession. He said he was seeking in the low billions of dollars in investment – much higher than the usual $100m (£67m) to $200m costs for projects in renewable energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2011/dec/28/green-philosophy-roger-scruton-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2011-12-28T09:00:05Z","webTitle":"Green Philosophy by Roger Scruton – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/28/green-philosophy-roger-scruton-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2011/dec/28/green-philosophy-roger-scruton-review","fields":{"headline":"Green Philosophy by Roger Scruton – review","bodyText":"There are two kinds of people in the world, as an old joke has it: those who think there are two kinds of people in the world, and those who realise there aren't. The philosopher Roger Scruton belongs to the first set. Over the past 30 years he has created a role for himself as a champion of traditional English conservatism, placing himself in one corner along with other admirers of fox-hunting, village greens and parish churches. In the other he sees hordes of chavs and Guardian-reading prigs – health-and-safety fundamentalists, postmodern relativists, entitlement freaks, utilitarians, multiculturalists, socialists, aging soixante-huitards, nihilist revolutionaries and political correctionists gone mad. But if you think Scruton can be dismissed as a churlish little-Englander you're in for a big surprise. Read his books without prejudice and you will find him lucid and informative, companionable, learned and urbane. He is probably better-read than you, in more languages than you know, and he can take on experts in legal history, economic theory, music, art, architecture, wine and world literature without missing a beat. There seems to be only one thing he cannot do, and that is ambiguity. His constant refrain is: \"Which side are you on? Will you stand by the gnarled oak of Englishness or will you bring on the bulldozers of soulless modernity? Can you appreciate beauty or are you an enraged devotee of contemporary art? Do you want wholesome food or tasteless, shrink-wrapped crap? Do you care about western civilisation or would you be happy to see it demolished? Are you one of us or one of them?\" Those who dwell in the valleys of uncertainty are liable to feel bullied by Scruton's methods. If we value the kind of authors who are hard to pin down – Rousseau, say, or Marx, Mill or Derrida – we will wish he was not so eager to deride them. No one can be right all the time, after all, and none of us is immune to life's ironies. Even if we agree with Scruton that many of the horrors of the past century are due to leftist authoritarianism, we might want to jog his memory about the NHS and other achievements of social democracy, and remind him that totalitarianism has right-wing forms as well. But as I said, he is one of the best philosophers of our time. In his new book Scruton turns his attention to ecological issues: erosion of habitats, depletion of resources, accumulation of waste and, of course, climate change. He's not a catastrophist, but he's not a sceptic either, and he recognises that the future of our natural environment poses theoretical problems as well as practical ones. The familiar backstops of political discussion – notions such as individual freedom, social equality, national sovereignty, representative democracy or human rights – are not going to help us face the fact that if we carry on as we are, the entire planet may soon become uninhabitable. You could in fact see old-style politics as the root of the problem: a vast filibuster that keeps the interests of unborn generations off the agenda, not to mention the fate of other species and the biosphere as a whole. If the standard routines of political thought prevent us from confronting the dangers that threaten our planet, we might conclude that it is time to abandon the old stand-off between rightists who want to cling to the past and leftists planning a brave new world. But Scruton will not see it that way. If environmental disaster is the question, he thinks, then leftism is still \"the worst thing that can happen\", and conservatism the only answer. He knows that conservatism has got itself a bad name by flirting with unbridled capitalism and promoting the idea that there's no motive like the profit motive. But that's never been Scruton's version, and for the past few years he has been conducting a grand exercise in rebranding. He still divides the world into shrewd conservatives and leftist buffoons, but in the new terminology his sort of people are now \"oikophiles\" (from the Greek \"oiko\" for house, which is the derivation of \"eco\"), while the rest of us are benighted \"oikophobes\". The English have a word for it too: home-lovers, as opposed to home-haters. I'm not sure why Scruton resorts to Greek, but up to a point I can see what he means. I got through Green Philosophy sitting by an open fire in the old stone cottage where I have lived most of my life, and I can understand why oikophiles such as me might be well-attuned to environmental issues. We like to think of ourselves not as lords and masters of our private patch, but trustees of a heritage that we hope to pass on to successors who will cherish it as we do. On the other hand I cannot get my mind round the idea of oikophobia. The great wanderers of myth and history, from Oedipus to Wotan, from Borrow and Stevenson to Davies and Kerouac, may not have been amiable oikophiles, but they did not have a sinister plan to replace homely hearths with parallelograms of paupers. And if you are homeless, or hate the place where you live, the chances are that you are not suffering from oikophobia, but drifting into oikophilic melancholia, dreaming of the cherishable home you have not got. The distinction between oikophiles and oikophobes may not hold water, but it gives Scruton a launch-pad for some effective polemics. He is acute about the so-called \"precautionary principle\", pointing to the dangers of disaggregating the innumerable risks that face us and trying to pick them off one by one. He also reminds us that NGOs are not angels, and that some of them have the wealth and power of governments, without any of the accountability. But then he does not like governments either, and enjoys setting off alarms about faceless bureaucrats and the nanny state – though if he really thinks that schools no longer organise adventure-trips, or that fruit and vegetables cannot be sold unwrapped, he needs to stop reading the red-tops and get out a bit more. The damage we do to our environment arises mainly from what economists call externalities: side-effects that can be disowned by the people who cause them. Scruton believes that many ecological externalities – river pollution, for example – can be sorted by a combination of free markets and common law. Beyond that, he appeals to the idea – borrowed without acknowledgement from the socialist historian EP Thompson – of a \"moral economy\", meaning standards of acceptable behaviour that are espoused by ordinary people. Thompson used the notion to rescue 18th-century rioters from the condescension of the right, but in Scruton's lexicon it describes the values promoted by the Women's Institute, National Trust and Campaign for the Protection of Rural England in their struggles with polluters and property developers. On any normal definition, these institutions belong in the same category as the NGOs that Scruton abhors, but he circumvents the difficulty by calling them \"civil associations\", on the not-un-question-begging ground that they have a different \"moral character\". When it comes to environmental dangers that are too big to be dealt with by NGOs or civil associations, Scruton displays a boyish confidence in the prospect of a technical fix. His aversion to international organisations limits his options, and his hatred of state power cramps him further, but he ends up calling for government-funded research into carbon capture and solar energy, and argues that Washington ought to get into the business of geo-engineering – solar radiation management perhaps, or ocean fertilisation – without waiting for the consent of other countries. If you are wondering how these proposals can be squared with Scruton's lofty objections to state intervention as such, do not worry: with a wave of his rhetorical wand he transforms the faceless nannies of legend into kindly patriots shouldering their inherited responsibility for the homeland that they love. Perhaps the idea of externalities could be extended from economics to philosophy, to describe by-products of the argumentative process for which other people are expected to pick up the tab. By the end of his book, Scruton is clearly involved in the same sorts of intellectual make-do-and-mend as the rest of us, but he tries to dump all the inconsistencies on the trusty old fall-guy that is the loony left. He might be even wiser if he were less interested in ideological purity – as he acknowledges, with characteristic grace, by giving his dateline as \"Scrutopia\".

The controversial low-carbon buildings programme is a grant system aimed at boosting renewable energies including wind, biomass and solar. It was due to close this summer but last week the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) put an announcement on its website saying that applications for solar photovoltaic (PV) projects on public buildings such as schools and hospitals were running at such high levels that they had used up their allocated share of half of the £50m grant pot ahead of time. PV has proved to be the most popular renewable technology under phase two of the grants programme and the industry argues that the unspent money available for other technologies should be thrown open to PV because otherwise it simply will not get spent. They also want the grant money recycled to other projects if some are cancelled. But environmental campaigners are furious that the solar industry will undergo a gap in support for well over a year at a time when Gordon Brown and other ministers are talking of creating 400,000 green jobs as a way of boosting the economy and combating climate change. Paul King, head of the UK Green Building Council, said: \"The prime minister has talked of the need to both invest in low-carbon infrastructure and to stimulate the economy. [This grant system] did just that, so it seems absurd that government has now suspended grant applications for solar PV. This emerging industry needs to be confident of government's commitment – which this decision seriously calls into question.\" A DECC spokesperson said: \"We recognise that the popularity of the low-carbon buildings programme has led to an over-subscription in solar PV applications. We are discussing with industry what options are open to us to address this.\" But Friends of the Earth accused DECC officials of standing in the way of progress towards a low-carbon economy by remaining too sympathetic to fossil fuel energy companies. \"DECC needs root-and-branch reform to cull these people who are trying to destroy our best efforts to move to a low-carbon, green energy system without which we have no hope of meeting our carbon-reduction commitments,\" said FoE campaigner Ed Matthew. A coalition of MPs, businesses and charities known as the Aldersgate group has written an open letter to the chancellor, Alistair Darling, urging him to match the green stimulus of the United States in the budget next month. The letter said this would create UK jobs and competitive advantage in lucrative environmental markets, reduce fuel bills and improve energy security. Peter Young, chairman of the group, said: \"The government's aspirations for a low-carbon industrial strategy will only be credible if they are matched with genuine ambition in the upcoming budget. We have heard the rhetoric, we now need to see action. If not, the UK will fall further behind in the race to establish jobs, expertise and growth in the industries of the future.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2011/may/15/marlon-brando-tahiti-eco-resort","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-14T23:06:14Z","webTitle":"Marlon Brando's Tahitian idyll to become luxury eco-resort","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/15/marlon-brando-tahiti-eco-resort","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2011/may/15/marlon-brando-tahiti-eco-resort","fields":{"headline":"Marlon Brando's Tahitian idyll to become luxury eco-resort","bodyText":"Marlon Brando would flee to the South Pacific idyll of Tetiaroa when the glare of the international spotlight became too much. Now, seven years after his death, his eight surviving children have united to build an eco-resort on the atoll in his honour, complete with a $150m (£90m) luxury hotel called \"The Brando\". Construction has begun on an environmentally sensitive complex which the film star's friends and family believe he would have wanted for Tetiaroa, a 2.5 sq mile, 13-islet chain encircled by a coral reef, the name of which in translation implies its remoteness. Brando leased Tetiaroa for $200,000, having fallen in love with the South Pacific and its people after filming Mutiny on the Bounty in 1962. He vowed to preserve it. \"If I have my way,\" he said, \"Tetiaroa will remain forever a place that reminds Tahitians of who they are and what they were centuries ago.\" Mindful of what would happen when he was no longer around, Brando put the atoll in a trust to ensure its preservation for posterity, wanting it to be passed to future generations of his children, \"many of whom are, or will be, Polynesian\" – his third wife, by whom he had a son and a daughter, was Tarita Teriipia, his Polynesian co-star on Mutiny on the Bounty. Before his death in 2004, Brando explored plans to build a small hotel without spoiling the azure lagoon and powdery white sand. He was excited by the idea of an air-conditioning system powered by ocean water, and saw the potential of solar energy and wind power. Having funded surveys of local wildlife, he also intended to establish research projects such as a nursery for sea turtles that would draw scientists from around the world. Now his relatives are pursuing his dream with a developer. Under construction is an eco-hotel comprising up to 47 bungalow villas, all concealed from view and raised within the vegetation. Air-conditioning will be operated by seawater. A deep-sea pipe will pump cold water from the ocean to chill the hotel. The development is also investing in ecological and marine research. A nursery raising 100 turtles will return the endangered species to the sea. A research group from the University of Redlands, Hawaii, is currently conducting surveys in Tetiaroa. David Seeley, who was Brando's lawyer and now advises the Brando estate, told the Observer: \"It's amazing. This project is going to be revolutionary. They're using all sorts of new technology to make it a truly green hotel. It's going to be the most environmentally friendly hotel in the world.\" Brando starred in many of the classic films of the 20th century such as A Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront and The Godfather, inspiring generations of actors with his screen presence. But he loathed producers, directors and even his profession of acting. Depressed by the intrusive attention that came with celebrity, Brando could be himself in the South Pacific. He once said: \"I like to go to the market, to buy toilet paper and not be bothered by some guy with a camera.\" The hotel, expected to open in 2013, is being developed by Richard Bailey, who has resorts in French Polynesia. \"In 2002, Marlon signed a building permit to allow Bailey to begin work,\" said Seeley. He heard about this technology and he told Bailey about it. It's revolutionary.\" Seeley emphasised the difficulty of building on a remote atoll: \"It's hard to imagine how difficult it is with no infrastructure – no power, gas, water, anything. They've had to reconstruct an airstrip, to make it meet regulations and long enough. They've created a sea bridge, a dock.\" A hotel built by Brando on Tetiaroa in the 1970s was closed down because the atoll's airstrip failed to meet official guidelines. Brando's eight surviving offspring are equal beneficiaries; a ninth child committed suicide."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2011/jun/24/change-career-green-jobs-environmental-sector","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-24T22:01:39Z","webTitle":"Change career by going green","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/jun/24/change-career-green-jobs-environmental-sector","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2011/jun/24/change-career-green-jobs-environmental-sector","fields":{"headline":"Change career by going green","bodyText":"Sheena Stone was trekking in the Nepalese Himalaya when she had what she calls her moment of career clarity. \"Nepal is one of the five poorest countries in the world,\" she says. \"I saw an advertising billboard for one of the big detergent brands which looked so out of place. It struck me that keeping their clothes clean was perhaps not one of their biggest worries in life, and I realised how inappropriate a lot of commercial marketing is.\" Six years on, having left behind a 16-year career in that field, she has just taken up a new role managing a Heritage Lottery Fund project focusing on environment, conservation, restoration and community engagement with Clackmannanshire council in Scotland. Until last week she led a community engagement project promoting the reduction of carbon emissions on the Isle of Bute off the west coast of Scotland. It's a change of career direction that would be the envy of many, but Stone is just one of a growing number of professionals who, midway through their working lives, are finding ways to reinvent themselves in environmentally focused occupations. Public sector restructuring coupled with continued economic pressures on many industries mean career change is high on the agenda for a large proportion of UK workers. A recent ICM survey for the Guardian and financial insurance provider Unum suggested that 40% of the workforce would pursue a completely different career if they could start again, while one in five was planning to change career in the next five years. It's easy to see the long-term potential of the environmental sector, but how easy is it to move into a \"green-collar\" job? A member survey by the Institute of Environmental Management &amp; Assessment (IEMA) last week painted a revealing picture: more than a third of respondents said they had entered the environmental field having previously worked in unrelated sectors, including engineering, construction, manufacturing, IT and telecoms, bringing with them a range of different business skills. Advantages In spite of the gloomy economic situation, more businesses see advantages in following the environmental agenda. A report commissioned by the American Solar Energy Society in 2009 predicted that one in five US workers could be employed in the renewables and energy-efficiency industries by 2030, and the UK's green economy is also maturing quickly. In 2009 it represented more than 5% of GDP and accounted for around 900,000 jobs nationally, according to a report by what is now the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Claire Lea, the IEMA's director of membership services, highlights the increasing demand from employers for people who can translate the complexities of the green agenda. \"Businesses have a lot of environmental issues to deal with, from climate change and availability of resources to operational compliance issues and resource efficiency,\" she points out. Part of the trick is picking a career route broadly appropriate to your skills background. \"You've got to define which area you want to go into,\" says Jonathan Kyle, director of strategy with recruiter GreenJobs.co.uk. \"Environment is one, ecology is another, then you have solar, wind, smart metering … all these need specific skill sets. If you want to do something like, say, carbon management, you're probably going to have to go back and do a whole new qualification, whereas if you're happy to carry on in an existing role like marketing, you could probably get into a similar role within one of those organisations.\" In a bid to untangle the web, the IEMA has devised an environmental skills map for those looking at careers in the sector. \"We're trying to guide a professional from an early stage of entering the profession right up to management,\" Lea says. \"It sets out what knowledge and skills you require, and that's a first.\" The green sector suffered its share of pain during the recession, the downturn in the construction industry having a particularly bad knock-on effect. But it has also nurtured more innovative approaches to environmental production, with small-scale solar energy a particular boom area. Recent government cuts to the UK's renewable energy strategy dismayed many, but 39% of respondents to a recent Ernst &amp; Young survey still felt investment would increase this year. One employer who agrees with that view is Gary Summers, managing director of Warwickshire-based solar photovoltaic panel manufacturer EOS Energy. Such is the demand for his company's products that he now urgently needs 30 to 50 more staff in various roles including electrical design engineers, installers, estimators, quantity surveyors, general managers and construction managers. \"I would like to pick up skill sets of what I need for the business of renewables that we're in, but we would also certainly consider career changers,\" says Summers. \"As a company, we have invested a lot in education and training. What we always look for is enthusiastic people, regardless of age, who still have a hunger for work.\" Spot the gap But where does one start to acquire the skills and experience to be an environmental practitioner? For those already in a suitable role with a larger employer, the best route may well be to spot a gap within your existing setup, says Andrew Tew, an environmental recruiter with Acre Resources. \"It's quite rare that someone would be a project manager or a surveyor and leave that job with one company to join another as an environmental or sustainability manager,\" he says. \"People who come into these roles tend to be in an organisation that won't have a team in place. \"They might have put themselves forward as an environmental champion or suggested to the directors that they need to put something in place around energy conservation, waste reduction, water usage and so on. Then the company has seen the benefits and said: 'Actually, do you want to take the role full-time?'\" After her Nepalese epiphany, Stone, then working as a commercial marketer with an Edinburgh housing association, identified a similar path. \"We had a large number of disabled tenants, who were more likely to be in fuel poverty, who were less likely to be moving about and so more likely to need the heating on for longer at a higher temperature to keep warm. I could see there was funding to upgrade these people's properties and I had a personal interest in trying to reduce the impact on the environment anyway. So I started trying to persuade the housing association.\" Stone soon realised the way to an employer's heart: \"I learned early on that you can't sell much to organisations based on climate change itself, but the fuel poverty aspect was my selling point, because they were more interested in their customers' welfare.\" Sharon Lashley is another who found a path into green-collar work through an existing employer. She was working in sales at a plastic packaging company and got involved with the company's ISO 14001 certification, an internationally recognised environmental management standard, after it fell behind with the auditing. \"I'm very interested in environmental issues in my personal life,\" she says. \"Environmental management systems are brilliant if you can keep them going, but you can't relax once you've got them. So I volunteered in an admin role to help them back on track. \"My employer then went through a restructuring process and I liked what I was doing so much that I decided not to stay in sales but progress into the environmental area.\" During that time Lashley was contacted by the Environmental Academy, a local training organisation running courses through a free funding stream to help small and medium-sized enterprises. Through it, she completed an NVQ level 4 environmental management qualification at the same time as working on the audit. The qualification also helped Lashley become eligible for IEMA membership, a well-regarded qualification for many green employers. Thanks to her experience and contacts, she is now a project manager for Community Energy Solutions, a Newcastle-based company providing sustainable energy and renewable technology solutions. Rita Callender, managing director of the Environmental Academy, says the long-term appeal of the environmental sector is drawing professionals from all sorts of backgrounds to the company's courses. \"The low-carbon economy will be a big part of our future and green professions and agendas will continue to be very relevant,\" she says. The Environmental Academy runs a range of online courses as well as classroom-based ones, though Callender says the ideal scenario is to train on the job. \"A lot of environmental issues are quite hard to pick up in the classroom, and it's one of the challenges people have in trying to get into the discipline,\" she says. While working for the housing association, Stone convinced her employer to let her study for a part-time master's degree, which helped to open up her new career path. But she points out that, in many ways, her previous experience proved just as handy. \"I hadn't thought at all that my marketing skills would come in useful,\" she admits. \"But some of it is about selling to customers the idea of what you want to achieve. \"Now I'm trying to encourage behaviour change, which is what you do in commercial marketing. There's a whole field called social marketing, encouraging people's behaviour to change by reducing energy bills, for example.\" Perhaps the quality most environmental career changers are likely to share and benefit from though is a personal passion for green issues, as with Ian Hill, chief sustainability officer at Openreach, the local communications network arm of the BT Group. \"Environmental issues are something I'd always had an interest in at a personal level,\" says Hill, who began his career in BT's finance division before moving across to its network construction arm. \"At Openreach I could see the importance to our customers of treating the environment considerately when we are putting up telegraph poles, running cable underground, and so on,\" he says. \"I also could see the importance to the business and I got the importance of the environment, and I realised I could connect it all up in a business context.\" The IEMA members' survey found that, when asked why they had switched careers, nearly 45% said they changed either because they wanted to make a difference, or they had a personal interest in the environment. Of those who had switched career, 88% said they had experienced high levels of satisfaction since doing so. With that comes a passion for the subject which makes many practitioners surprisingly easy to connect with, says Stone, who initially attended all the free climate-related events she could to get up to speed with the issues and key players involved. \"I kept contact details for them all,\" she says. \"The environmental field, in Scotland anyway, is still quite small. You come across the same people a lot. It's a vocation as much as a job.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2009/mar/17/government-solar-energy-grant-carbon","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-17T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Anger after government halts solar energy grant programme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/mar/17/government-solar-energy-grant-carbon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/mar/17/government-solar-energy-grant-carbon","fields":{"headline":"Anger after government halts solar energy grant programme","bodyText":"The government ran into a storm of criticism yesterday after quietly closing its grant programme for solar energy last week, which campaigners said made a mockery of its commitment to build a low-carbon economy.

Yet it is real, and remarkably so; for this intriguing city not only exists but is also one of the most unexpected in the Gulf region or anywhere in the world. Behind those walls and wind towers is one of the world's first zero-carbon cities. I went to see it recently, just shortly before families from across Abu Dhabi turned up in their thousands for The Market @ Masdar City, the first one-day fair designed to showcase the architecture and planning of this brave attempt at shaping a truly sustainable city of the future. Designed by Foster and Partners for the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company and set in the desert 17km from the skyscrapers of Abu Dhabi, Masdar is an intriguing experiment in urban design and living. The six square kilometre city – powered by solar energy and other renewable resources – is an attempt to show what kind of future might lie ahead for urban development in the Gulf now that the high-rise city of gas-guzzling towers, that has characterised the region in recent decades, has been increasingly discredited. Although unlikely to be completed much before 2025, when 50,000 people are expected to live here, the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology (the anchor of the first phase of the city) is up and running. Its buildings, streets and squares give a good idea of how Masdar will be. Getting to the showcase streets of the new institute is an unusual experience. Arriving by road from Abu Dhabi – there will be a train in years to come – you swap your car for a ride in a Personal Rapid Transit pod, an experience that combines the cartoon aesthetic of The Jetsons with the comedy of Jacques Tati's Mon Oncle, the 1958 French satire that lampoons the excesses of an overdesigned futuristic world. The driverless sci-fi pods bumble around the undercrofts of the first phase of Masdar City and it is a wonder that none of them bump into each other. But they move so slowly it may well be quicker to walk. The original idea was for these comic pods to criss-cross the entire city underground so that residents, commuters and visitors could reach any part of it without having to drive, and in the welcome shade. There would have been hundreds of pods. In the event, they have been seen as an all too complex way of getting about. Future phases of Masdar will be pod-free, although cars and lorries will be directed underground, leaving the streets above for pedestrians only. Walking here is a pleasure. Streets and squares are shielded from the sun, desert winds, sandstorms and heat by thick-walled buildings that provide shade and funnel the breeze between them. Although modern in appearance, these streets and buildings are essentially old-fashioned. With its narrow alleys, deep shadows and wind towers, Masdar follows in the tried and tested footsteps of traditional Arabic towns, where keeping the sun at bay was both a science and an art practised over many generations. Eventually, there will be homes, businesses, parks and mosques here and Masdar City will relax into its role as an urban sustainability frontrunner. At the moment, it can seem like a theme park aimed at attracting day-trippers, yet these are early days. Gradually, the Jetson-like novelty side of the city – especially those driverless pods – will take a back seat as Masdar matures. The true success of Masdar turns on the recognition that the very old ways of designing and building cities in hot climates are the ones that make most sense: thick walls and carefully directed breezes rather than pods and wind turbines. It's the determinedly ultra-modern aspects of Masdar that prove to be a mirage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/sep/12/epa-republicans-abolish","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-12T17:52:37Z","webTitle":"Why the GOP is going after the EPA | Beth Wellington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/sep/12/epa-republicans-abolish","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/sep/12/epa-republicans-abolish","fields":{"headline":"Why the GOP is going after the EPA","bodyText":"When Richard Nixon founded the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by executive order, politicians of all stripes agreed the US needed reforms, even if it cost a small amount of economic growth. Yet, after four decades of the EPA's helping to improve our land, air and water quality, ask whether we need federal regulation and the answer depends on whom you question. Ask ordinary people in the US and, according to a 2011 Pew survey (pdf), 71% respond, across the political spectrum, that they agree with the statement,\"This country should do whatever it takes to protect the environment.\" Ask most Republican politicians, some Democrats and the polluting industries that provide them substantial funding, and you'll get a very different answer. And this divergence may be ramping up in the wake of the Citizens United supreme court decision, which equated free speech and political contributions. Republicans returning to Congress after the Labor Day recess have a legislative shopping list running gamut from rolling back \"job-killing\" regulation to outright abolition of the agency. Republican presidential candidates would similarly strip the EPA of its authority or shut it down. As far as abolishing the EPA goes, Mark Schapiro, author of Exposed: The Toxic Chemistry of Everyday Products and What's at Stake for American Power, tells me, \"It's an economic catastrophe to remove incentives and oversight.\" Jonathan H Adler, director of the centre for business law and regulation at Case Western Reserve University, has received an award from the conservative Federalist Society for Law and Policy Studies – and yet he writes of the GOP efforts, \"opposing the Environmental Protection Agency, by itself, is not a serious environmental policy.\" Meanwhile, Democrats co-sponsoring legislation to curtail the EPA include Senators Jay Rockerfeller (West Virginia), Joe Manchin (West Virginia), Claire McCaskill (Missouri) Kent Conrad (North Dakota), Tim Johnson (South Dakota), Ben Nelson (Nebraska) and Jim Webb (Virginia); as well as Congressmen Mark Critz (Pennsylvania), Gene Green (Texas) and Nick Rahall (West Virginia). And, on 2 September, President Obama, as is his wont, sought to assure critics of his reasonableness by arguing that the EPA unnecessarily burdens US industry. The president said that, while his commitment to public health and the environment is \"unwavering\", he has ordered the EPA to withdraw its draft ozone national ambient air quality standards in order to \"underscore the importance of reducing regulatory burdens and regulatory uncertainty, particularly as our economy continues to recover\". Ground-level ozone is the primary constituent of smog, which leads to lung and heart disease. In June, EPA administrator Lisa Jackson testified before a Senate environment and public works committee (EPW) hearing on the clean air act and public health. In July, she responded in a letter (pdf) to EPW member Tom Carper (Democrat, Delaware) that she had opted to review the 2008 ozone standards, rather than keep them in place until the next mandated review in 2013. The Bush administration standards, which the outgoing president had weakened at the last minute in 2008 and are under court challenge. In Jackson's estimation, those standards are \"not legally defensible given the scientific evidence\". Juliet Eilperin, who reports on on science, policy and politics for the Washington Post, called Obama's statement a \"win for business\". And, according to Eilperin, the forestalled ozone regulation may be joined by delayed \"limits on mercury and air toxins, greenhouse gases from power plants, and a range of emissions from industrial boilers, oil refineries, cement plants and other sources\". The annual budget request for the EPA for 2011 was $10.02bn (pdf). Compare this, to the $11.4bn requested by the department of defence for just one family of fighter planes, Lockheed Martin's F-35 (pdf). The paradox of curtailing the EPA is that the benefits of its regulations outweigh its costs (pdf) due to reductions in disease and premature death. Of course, in the US, manufacturing firms do not have to pay the costs associated with the pollution. Schapiro, who is also senior correspondent at the Centre for Investigative Reporting, tells me that the fact that environmental regulation is stricter in the European Union than in the US may derive from the US's lack of universal healthcare: \"The economic argument becomes more potent where government … will have to absorb healthcare costs.\" Another difference, according to Schapiro, is that the European system fosters prevention (risk avoidance), the US-system favours litigation to obtain compensatory damages. I'd observe that companies are willing to gamble with our health and safety: tobacco, the Ford Pinto, Love Canal and the BP oil spill all come to mind. In the past, the EPA has countered critics of federal regulation, saying – in Jackson's words – that \"[s]mart environmental protection can actually drive innovation.\" Schapiro agrees: \"The dialogue between 'jobs' and 'regulation' is endless and repetitive, and in almost every instance, the claims by industry that new, more protective regulations would result in job losses and harm competitiveness have turned out to be dramatically overstated.\" Take, for instance, how the US is falling behind Europe in green technology – in the field of solar energy. As Paula Mints writes: \"The US was the leader in solar manufacturing until the mid 1990s when Japan took over, offering government support to its manufacturing and its market. Once the FiT incentive gathered steam in Europe, its manufacturers enjoyed one year as the number one manufacturing region. Meanwhile, China's government invested – and heavily – in its crystalline manufacturing sector and export market, and in 2009 Chinese manufacturers began aggressively pricing product for share (a common practice, by the way). And now China's manufacturers control the market.\" Beyond the economic argument, do we really want to go back to the days before the EPA? Nixon's first EPA administrator, William Ruckelshaus, describes that time in the Wall Street Journal: \"We humans with our big cars and our big factories and our big cities were discharging terrible stuff into the air and water, and it had to be stopped or we would soon make our nest uninhabitable. The public was growing increasingly outraged.

Writing for our Social care network, he says there will be scepticism over the prime minister's apparent urge to merge, adding: If Cameron's apparent enthusiasm for integration is to mean anything, merging of commissioning budgets for NHS and social care provision at local level is the sine qua non. That said, the conditions for integration are now about as favourable as they have ever been. The NHS has finally woken up to the harsh truths of demographic change, understanding that these days it is first and foremost in the business of caring for older people living with long-term conditions. It is also understanding that it is not going to be able to care for them – or indeed continue to care for everyone else – unless it actively helps the social care system to play its complementary part. And on the Critique Allowed blog, Claudia Megele says: I would like to think of this as a huge step in the right direction and believe that it offers a rare opportunity for us all to take leadership in this process in order to ensure that the focus extends beyond financial metrics and remains on services and users of services. Health (both physical and mental), care, connectedness, and inclusion are fundamental to individual well-being and foundational for greater social justice in civilised and progressive society. Therefore, although research indicates that healthy competition will serve to improve systems and services, this should not result in myopic fixation on immediate returns driven by purely financial metrics. Unfortunately, however, too often econometrics and financial considerations are and have been the main driver of change and realignment of services, and this has resulted in repeated and sadly wasteful reforms. Suffice it to say that it was Tory government who pushed for separation of Health and Social Services in 1988, and are still pushing for further fragmentation of services through Health and Social Care Bill. She goes on to list five questions and challenges raised by the concept of integration, including the impact of the care bill on the suggestion. • A dreadful statistic: 31 benefit claimants have died while appealing against a judgment that they were fit to work. The Herald Scotland reports that the figures, covering the three years to last October, were revealed in a parliamentary written answer by employment minister Chris Grayling. The report adds that tribunal centres across the UK are holding Saturday sittings to deal with disputed cases. (link via the Black Triangle Campaign) Also on welfare reform, Steve Hilditch claims on the Red Brick blog that the total household benefit cap \"will possibly be the most damaging change of all\": ... the real disgrace is that Iain Duncan Smith and his Department are not able to say what impact the policy will have and on whom. Their estimate is that around 50,000 families will receive less benefit because of the cap (it only applies to those of working age). They admit, as with many of their tax and spending cuts policies, that the biggest impact will be on the larger families – over 80% of those affected will have 3 or more children. On average, household losses are expected to average £93 per week. 35% will lose more than £100 per week. DWP estimated, in response to Parliamentary Questions, that 70% of those affected would be social tenants leaving 30% (around 15,000) as private tenants. These estimates are counter-intuitive and extraordinary given the importance of housing benefit in the calculation of the cap and the huge difference between private and social rents, and they led frontbencher Karen Buck MP on a voyage of discovery about the statistics and the relationship between the new cap rule and other statutory duties. Well, given the lack of answers, it has been more of a voyage of non-discovery. • An interesting plea on Paul Clarke's Honesty Real blog, calling for clear, assessible data on the ward-level ratio of registered nurses to patients. This information, Clarke argues, may highlight systemic problems and be used to help lobby for change: There aren't enough nurses. Uneaten food, chaotic cleanliness, delayed painkillers say there aren't enough nurses. There aren't enough nurses. The testimony of medical nurses, militant and otherwise: that should count for something, right? And what about patients? I understand that Granny's soiled bed is a rationally lower priority than an emergency transfusion form, but when did we come to accept indignity at that level at all? Why waste time with tossers in suits (and, indeed, flipcharts) when you could just set a ratio that works as your operating baseline, and build your model around that? Report and manage the exceptions to that baseline, sure, but why wait for the data to \"prove\" anything. The Royal College of Nursing, it seems, are on to this question of ratios, by the way. More power to to them. Support them however you can. • A recommended piece by my colleague Rebecca Smithers on the impact of the breast implants scandal on women who have, like her, had reconstructive surgery after treatment for cancer: I was one of the lucky ones: I already knew that the alien beast nestling under my pectoral major muscle is not made by PIP. My knowledge had nothing to do with any incisive questioning on my part, but because my consultant sent me all the details in a letter prior to my operation. But many other women who have been treated for breast cancer and fitted with PIP implants before the 2010 ban on their use in the UK may not have had such reassurances. Indeed, treatment solely on the NHS rarely comes with such information. Of the suspected implants fitted into more than 40,000 UK patients in 2000-2010, the Department of Health says that 2,000 to 3,000 were provided by the NHS – 5-7% of the total – which by implication means they were for breast reconstruction, as the NHS does not perform cosmetic sugery. Some commentators have conveniently used this to emphasise that the overwhelming majority of implant operations in the UK involve cosmetic procedures entered into voluntarily and privately. So does that mean that the minority do not count? Or indeed that any of these women are less deserving of concern? • An excellent post on the Patient Opinion blog on social media and the NHS, prompted by the experience of inpatient Little Feet, who was prevented from blogging by a mental health trust (see Wednesday's Society daily for the back story): ... a blanket rule of 'Don't blog!' is in our view both misplaced and impractical. What is happening here is that the NHS is (slowly!) learning the realities of the new world of social media. Most of the time social media comments should be welcomed. Sometimes they should be ignored. Occasionally something needs rebutting. ... From our experience of moderating thousands of stories about mental health services we know that occasionally postings will raise issues of clinical governance – for example people expressing suicidal thoughts or threatening harm to staff. But in principle this has always happened and trusts should have procedures to deal with this.The fact that it is now happening in public on-line may be uncomfortable but does not change anything much. At root trusts need to think about whether they are exercising a legitimate duty of care - or protecting themselves.

Now the light will be stronger than ever, with the news that Barnsley Football Club is to become the first major league outfit in the country to be powered entirely by solar energy. If you think that gloom always surrounds the handsome South Yorkshire market town (and believe me, I have met plenty who still do), then think again. Photovoltaic panels on the roof of two stands and an outside wall at the Oakwell ground are going to be sun-kissed enough to provide enough regular energy for 140 homes. That will meet the club's needs with some left over, which the Tykes and their technical suppliers will sell back to the national grid, in proper Yorkshire fashion. The club's general manager Don Rowing reckons electricity bills will be halved; savings running into tens of thousands of pounds. The other excellent thing about this is that the roughly £1 million contract has gone to a firm in nearby Dodworth, Solar Europa, which is keen to interest other clubs. They've been given a hand in their early days by the Enterprising Barnsley programme which in turn has attracted £2.89m investment from the European Regional Development Fund. Mind the doors, and your ps and qs My younger son Olly Tweets perceptively from London, where he is part of a loosely-northern posse - not self-conscious or banging on about it like me, but just pleasantly self-assured about the complete excellence of coming from this part of the world.

I'm still tripping on strange images of this animal drama from the dear old resort's beaches, which have seen many excitements in their lifetime. Actually, Dotty the donkey \"galloped in to save her friend Stanley the sheep from being savaged\" on a nearby farm, rather than the sands where Scarborough's more famous donkeys ply. Poor Stanley lost two teeth and suffered facial paralysis but is now fully recovered. He now sleeps in the same stable as Dotty which is newly decorated with a PDSA Certificate of Animal Bravery on the wall.

Heavy rain and strong winds during 2010 meant that renewables - principally hydro, wind and solar power - met 35% of Spanish demand. Wind power rose by 18.5% in 2010 and now meets 16% of demand. Luis Atienza, managing director of Spain's electricity grid, predicted that \"within three years wind power will overtake nuclear as an electricity source\". At its peak, on November 9, wind power met 43% of demand. Heavy rains saw hydro-electrical production rise by 59% on 2009. Solar power, meanwhile, lags behind at only 3%, although some of the big solar plants have yet to come on stream. Oil and gas continue to generate about half of Spain's capacity, while nuclear power accounts for around 19%. Javier Garcîa Breva, director of the solar energy programme, said that \"even five years ago no one would have believed these figures were possible. No one expected renewables to grow so fast. They have unlimited potential.\" Spain continues to import electricity from France but only as a staging post en route to Morocco, Portugal and Andorra. \"France has not increased its capacity and so its ability to export has decreased,\" Atienza said. \"This has fallen further due to industrial strife.\" During recent strikes dozens of French power stations were forced to close and Spanish production had to be imported to meet the shortfall. This greening of the Spanish grid has not benefited the consumer, with prices likely to rise by 9% in 2011. The government sets electricity prices which have no direct correlation with production costs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jun/28/climate-change-environmental-sustainability","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-28T16:31:00Z","webTitle":"Women excluded from climate change projects in Africa, UN experts warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/28/climate-change-environmental-sustainability","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jun/28/climate-change-environmental-sustainability","fields":{"headline":"Women excluded from climate change projects in Africa, UN experts warn","bodyText":"Of the millions of dollars spent on climate change projects in developing countries, little has been allocated in a way that will benefit women. Yet, in Africa, it is women who will be most affected by climate change. According to United Nations data, about 80 percent of the continent's smallholder farmers are women. While they are responsible for the food security of millions of people, agriculture is one of the sectors hardest hit by climate change. \"There is a lot of international talk about climate change funding for local communities and especially for women, but not much is actually happening,\" says Ange Bukasa, who runs investment facilitation organisation Chezange Connect in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Bukasa was one of the delegates at the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) 2011 Partnership Forum, which was held from Jun. 24-25 in Cape Town, South Africa. The Climate Investment Funds (CIF), established by the World Bank in cooperation with regional multilateral development banks, provide funding for developing countries' climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. Since their launch in 2008, the CIF have allocated 6,5 billion dollars to climate change projects in 45 developing countries. More than a third of the money went to 15 African states. But most of the money – more than 70 percent – is financing large-scale clean technology energy and transportation projects. These are traditionally male-dominated sectors of the formal economy. Only 30 percent is being spent on small-scale projects that directly benefit poor, rural communities and thereby potentially improve women's livelihoods. Experts at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) warn that the funds could run the risk of perpetuating existing gender imbalances. To take into account the gendered nature of energy consumption and domestic labour patterns in a resource-poor context, women need to be consulted when designing and implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation initiatives, they say. But that doesn't happen often enough. \"The links between large regional institutions that administer the funds and the people on the ground who need to access them are missing,\" says Bukasa, who works with farmers in Katanga in the southern DRC and elsewhere in the country. She complains about a lack of consultation of women, who make up the majority of smallholder farmers in the area. Bukasa also points out that most rural communities have not been sufficiently educated about what climate change is and how to mitigate it or adapt to it. \"People may have heard the words 'climate change', but they have no clue what to do about it and where to access information,\" Bukasa warns. That means that they remain unable to identify problems and solutions related to climate change and hence cannot develop their own projects and apply for funds. Their only option is to \"continue farming like before\", she sighs. Such feedback from climate change experts working at community-level seems to have had some effect, however. The banks managing the CIF have now pledged they will integrate gender indicators into all operations and include them in the main criteria for the approval of grants. Gender analysis, sex-differentiated data, gender monitoring and gender auditing will also be part of all projects financed by the CIF to ensure they benefit men and women equally, they promise. \"We are planning to take gender into greater account and are introducing more and more indicators to assess the gender dimension of projects,\" says Mafalda Duarte, climate finance coordinator at the African Development Bank (AfDB), one of the regional institutions administering the funds. Duarte says there is a particular focus on financing off-the-grid energy technologies that will improve the lives of women and girls, because they are still lumped with the burden of fetching wood and water in rural communities. The funds will go towards solar energy projects, improved cooking stoves, sustainable forestry projects, solar-powered irrigation as well as water storage and heating systems. \"When we review proposals we ensure that women will be able to access the funded technologies,\" Duarte adds. The only drawback is that the focus is again on small-scale investments that only make up a small percentage of the overall funds. Duarte admits that more needs to be done: \"We do need to increase the scale of gender-sensitive projects because we have too many poor hotspots on the continent.\" Florah Mmereki, project manager at Wena Industry and Environment, an environmental education trust based in Gaborone, Botswana, agrees that efforts need to be accelerated: \"The few climate change project projects that exist in Botswana today are not targeted at women. It's a huge oversight.\" Mmereki says women remain excluded because participation in many climate change adaptation projects usually requires an upfront investment, such as a contribution to the cost of energy-efficient wood stoves. \"But rural women don't have access to funds. They are the ones working in the fields, but it's their husbands who manage the money,\" she notes. \"There are many gender barriers that still need to be removed.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/18/community-power-station-investment-sussex","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-18T14:00:24Z","webTitle":"UK's first local power station rattles the bucket for investment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/18/community-power-station-investment-sussex","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/18/community-power-station-investment-sussex","fields":{"headline":"UK's first local power station rattles the bucket for investment","bodyText":"The UK's first renewable \"community power station\" will on Tuesday begin raising money to install solar panels housed on the roof of a local brewery. If its backers can raise enough money to get it off the ground, the project will begin generating electricity for the local area later in the year. The planned 500 sq m installation in Lewes, near Brighton, will also use part of the revenue generated by the government's feed-in tariff scheme to fund community projects. But its future is in doubt because of a pending government review of the scheme. The seven directors – all local residents – have managed to raise more than £150,000 of their £300,000 target and hope to acquire the remainder from local investors at the launch of a share issue on Tuesday. Dirk Campbell, 65, a founding director of the Ouse Valley Energy Security Company (Ovesco), hopes the scheme will inspire others. He said: \"We're doing this in order to create a model which will be exportable and replicable by people anywhere. The main focus of this is community ownership.\" Ovesco will be run by its directors as a non-profit society for community benefit. Investors will receive a 4% rate of return on their outlay, profiting from the government's feed-in tariff scheme that pays for the generation of renewable electricity. Under these terms, the directors of the 98 kilowatt (kW) installation hope to repay investors over 20 years. The energy generated will be used by Harveys, the local brewery, which has leased its roof in exchange for free electricity, which will be used primarily to cool its beer, Sunshine Ale. Any surplus will be sold back to the grid, and the additional revenue will be used to fund community projects. Without payment from the government's feed-in tariff scheme, which is currently under review, the project will not be financially sustainable. From 1 August, subsidies for schemes larger than 50kW will be slashed, meaning that Ovesco must install the panels within the next few months or face an unfeasibly low rate of return. Campbell said: \"We're completely dependent on the feed-in tariffs scheme to make it work, so in that sense it's not sustainable. The government might renege on their commitment.\" Howard Johns, the managing director of Southern Solar, came up with the idea for Ovesco. He said: \"We've finally got to a position where we've cracked a model that we think could work, and unfortunately the government have been meddling in the background.\" He added: \"The government have effectively trashed the feed-in tariff system.\" Liz Mandeville, 65, another director of Ovesco, is investing more than £20,000 into the scheme with her partner because she believes \"that climate change is the greatest single threat to human beings on the planet\". She said: \"We're both retired, we own this house, our children are all independent. We like Lewes. We don't like shopping, and we've got plenty of furniture – what better way for us to spend our money?\" Caroline Lucas, Green party leader and MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: \"The government's reckless plan to review solar feed-in tariffs has created uncertainty in one of the few industries to have generated thousands of new green jobs. Proposals to slash financial support to solar projects over 50kW have further laid bare the shocking lack of ambition on solar energy. \"The feed-in tariff scheme is crucial to helping projects like the Lewes community-owned power station get off the ground – but thanks to the uncertainty brought about by the review, it will be difficult for renewables companies or investors to trust the government again.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/may/12/solar-energy-price-fall","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-05-12T16:07:27Z","webTitle":"Cost of solar energy will match fossil fuel electricity by 2013, claims Solarcentury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/12/solar-energy-price-fall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/may/12/solar-energy-price-fall","fields":{"headline":"Cost of solar energy will match fossil fuels by 2013, claims Solarcentury","bodyText":"Solar energy will fall in price to match the cost of conventional fossil fuel electricity far sooner than previously expected, the UK's largest solar company has claimed in a new report. Solarcentury said British homeowners will see solar achieve \"grid parity\" – the point where solar electricity rivals or becomes cheaper than conventional nonrenewable electricity – by 2013. Most predictions suggest that technological innovation will not bring the price down far enough until 2020 or later. The company suggested falling production costs for solar panels and increasing conventional electricity costs have brought parity closer. Prices for solar and grid electricity in residential homes are expected to crossover at around 17p to 18p per unit of electricity (kWh) in 2013, followed by parity for commercial solar electricity in 2018. Last December, the renewable energy analysts New Energy Finance predicted silicon costs – a key material for much solar panel technology – would fall by 31.5% in 2009 compared with 2008 levels. Energy consultants Element Energy, under commission from the government, have also forecast solar PV costs will fall by around half between now and 2020. Derry Newman, CEO for Solarcentury, said: \"When you reach grid parity, you have a watershed moment where the perceptions of investors and consumers shift. People have been programmed to believe solar is expensive and takes a hundred years to pay back, but when parity arrives people realise it takes 8-10 years to payback, and they can then be making money out of it.\" Jeremy Leggett, executive chairman of Solarcentury said, \"The feed-in tariff that the government has said it will bring in from April 2010 is vital. A burst of premium-pricing for solar energy, of the kind now on offer in 18 European countries, will stimulate a very fast-growing market.\" Experts said the projections were based on significant assumptions in future energy prices, which have been extremely volatile over recent years – last year saw gas and electricity prices double, but now household bills are falling again. Ray Noble, solar PV specialist at the Renewable Energy Association, said: \"The predicted grid parity by 2013 could be possible if all of the predictions, both in terms of grid electricity prices increasing and reductions in the cost of solar PV, come through. However that's a big if – any slight changes in the pricing can add further years to this date.\" He added that the important message is that even if grid parity slipped to 2016, the moment when solar can compete on cost is not far off. Chris Goodall, Green party parliamentary candidate and author of Ten Technologies to Save the Planet, warned the grid parity predictions were based on unrealistic price assumptions. \"This projection of residential grid parity depends crucially on continually increasing prices of conventional electricity, but I just don't see any evidence that residential electricity will cost 17-18p a kWh in 2013. The 'underlying' retail price of electricity at the moment is no more than 11p per kWh,\" he said. Newman argued that China will continue to take more fossil fuel and believes peak oil will begin to bite in 2013, which will both contribute to rising prices in fossil fuel electricity. Other parts of the world, such as Spain and California, have already achieved grid parity on the price of solar, but only for large installations rather than small scale ones for homeowners."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/mar/18/solar-energy-feed-in-tariffs-monbiot","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-18T10:40:10Z","webTitle":"Feed-in tariffs are not suppressing innovation | Jeremy Leggett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/18/solar-energy-feed-in-tariffs-monbiot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/mar/18/solar-energy-feed-in-tariffs-monbiot","fields":{"headline":"Feed-in tariffs are not suppressing innovation in Germany or the UK","bodyText":"George Monbiot's third article on government grants for domestic solar panels ignores the errors that I and others have protested about in the opening assertion in his first article. He alleged that the UK government's feed-in tariff regime is \"about to transfer £8.6bn from the poor to the middle classes\". In saying that, he managed to get three things wrong. The actual sum raised from the tariff levy from all electricity consumers, not just households, to 2030 will be £6.7bn; it will be spread over 20 years; and it will be more than offset – if the government is true to its word – by energy efficiency savings stimulated in parallel market-building schemes. Yet we see no retraction in George's latest, much less an apology for trying to turn feed-in tariffs into a new form of class war on a false premise. That was just where the problems began in the first article. In his third, he rewords many of his original mistaken views. I address those one by one on my website. The main new item in George's latest involves using a report from what he calls the \"Ruhr University\" to back his assault on the German feed-in tariff programme. He did not tell his readers – maybe he didn't know – that this study's \"editorial office\" is RWI, an organisation well known for being a thinktank helpful to the big German energy companies. There is an irony in a campaigner such as George deploying arguments against other campaigners using such a source. Elsewhere in his article George declares that \"I detest the big energy companies that give us our electricity\". Here is what the German ministry for environment, nature conservation and nuclear safety has to say about RWI's arguments against the feed-in tariffs (or the EEG, as they are known in Germany): \"Whereas the International Energy Agency and the European Commission comment that the EEG is an effective and efficient tool, and dozens of countries in the EU and beyond are following the German example, RWI remains stuck in its old way of thinking.\" One of George's restated arguments, echoing RWI, is that \"we have to ensure that we get the biggest available bang for our buck: in other words the greatest cut in greenhouse gas production from the money we spend.\" Let me reword my original retort, which he chooses to ignore. We need to think about how the photovoltaic (PV) bang for buck changes over time as economies of scale reduce costs, and we need to think about spawning a mix of survival technologies, not just one or two that happen to be the cheapest in March 2010. Then there is the question of the relative investments in the feed-in regime and other carbon-cutting options, compared to the prize available. If government and business do nothing together to make the UK solar and other tariffs cost-neutral as promised – an unlikely assumption - the tariffs for all technologies will add a few hundred million pounds a year to the nation's electricity bills. Other forms of energy market support will add billions per year to taxpayers bills, with little or no chance of being rendered cost-neutral. Nuclear waste alone will add more than £3bn a year. I asked Dr Rob Gross, a director of the UK Energy Research Centre and co-author of an immense study for the UK government on the cost-effectiveness of low-carbon technologies, to comment on George's latest. He said: \"It is obvious to anyone who knows anything at all about technologies and innovation that PV is one of the most promising in terms of long run cost reductions … The impact of feed-in tariffs on consumers will be very small compared to the cost of big investments in CCS, grid, nuclear and offshore.\" George argues that the German feed-in tariffs have done little to stimulate innovation in the German solar industry. \"In fact, the (Ruhr) paper shows the scheme has stimulated massive demand for old, clunky solar cells at the expense of better models beginning to come onto the market.\" If George had ever visited a German solar factory, he would have seen plenty of innovation under way. When he speaks of \"clunky old cells\" he offers a telling insight into how little he understands of what is going on in the PV industry. I asked Professor Eicke Weber, director of the Fraunhofer Institute, Germany's premier solar research institute, to comment on George's argument that research and development was preferable to feed-in tariffs. Weber responded that it is vital to understand that \"the decreasing prices of PV are driven down not merely by R&amp;D but rather by the increasing market. The learning curve is cost versus total installed volume and shows … that with each doubling of the globally installed volume, the price comes down by about 20%. This is of course driven by progress in R&amp;D, but this is driven very strongly by market forces\". If we waited until R&amp;D had produced PV capable of generating electricity at today's prices, says Weber, \"it would never happen\". There has been innovation in the German PV industry, and there will be yet more, leading to further incremental improvements in efficiency, design and delivery. But that is always the case in a business revolution. If one had waited for improvements to end in the digital revolution one would still be waiting. So it will be in the solar revolution. George sees little scope for German export of PV, and \"the UK's prospects of building the major export industry Jeremy dreams of are even slighter, as it will now have to take on Germany as well as China and Japan. We've missed the boat by years\". The amount of solar PV installed around the world in 2009, despite the fast growth of the PV industry, was a mere 7 gigawatts last year: the equivalent of around seven typical coal-fired power plants. To say that the UK could not catch up with other nations if we had the will to develop a domestic industry, in a global market still this small, is plainly wrong. Today, in a UK PV market a fraction of 1% the size of the German one, we already have a PV export industry of sorts. Crystallox manufactures ingots and wafers – the raw materials for cells - and exports worldwide. Sharp and Romag manufacture modules for export beyond the currently small domestic market. My company, Solarcentury, manufactures PV tiles and slates for the domestic market and export into Europe. George has ignored all Solarcentury's invitations to visit and see all this. If he had, he would appreciate that there is plenty of scope for British companies to expand into this industry. The most eminent venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, Vinod Khosla, recently said the place will have to be named \"Solar Valley\" within 10 years. This is because the practitioners of the digital revolution are switching en masse into the embryonic solar revolution in the factories that are springing up around Sunnyvale. Given our national design and technology skills, what's to stop a big slug of that revolution being sited in the UK? George makes much of the fact that Asian manufacturers are now exporting cheap PV into Germany. True, the Germans are under great pricing pressure now from the industries they have themselves helped create, with their attractive domestic feed-in tariff, in Asia. But that is globalisation at work. Whether this is a good idea, in a world approaching peak oil, is a whole other debate, and one wherein George and I might find a lot to agree on. But peak oil and the downsides of globalisation actually provide another compelling reason for trying as hard as we can to develop a variety of fully-integrated domestic renewables industries in the UK. And for that we will need feed-in tariffs, for a while. Finally, let me comment on George's premise that anyone who has entered the world of business cannot be trusted, or should have their views discounted compared to \"independents\" such as himself. \"I have no horses in this race,\" George announces, \"I have no products to sell.\" If we believe in the horrors that await a world making little or no effort to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, we all have to back horses. I have gone so far as to set up a company and a charity to back one of my (numerous) favoured horses. As George put it in his book Heat, \"while I (Monbiot) sit on my backside telling people what to do, he (Leggett) spends his time doing it.\" That was then. Now George seeks to wear the fact that he has \"no products to sell\" as a badge of superior credibility.

Last week 240 MPs signed a parliamentary motion supporting the mass rollout of solar photovoltaic (PV) power. The support was the biggest of any such motion introduced in this parliament. Colin Challen MP, who tabled the motion, said: \"There is an enormous opportunity to drive forward this technology through the forthcoming feed-in tariffs.\" Feed-in tariffs (FITs) work by paying a guaranteed, above-market price for any electricity fed into the grid for a period of 20-25 years. They have been designed to offer returns close to 10%, thereby reducing payback times for any household investing in a PV system to 10 years or less. Similar tariffs have boosted solar power in the 50-odd countries that have introduced them in the past decade, in turn promoting production of PV panels and pushing down prices to the extent that PV will not need subsidies for much longer. \"FITs have been very effective at improving take-up,\" Kenichiro Wakisaka, senior manager at the Japanese electronics group and PV maker Sanyo, said at the recent Intersolar trade fair in Munich. \"Japan has reintroduced one and the market there will double at least. The same will happen in the UK and we will increase our allocation to the UK market.\" \"We are very excited about this,\" said Clive Collison, head of Action South Facing, a solar system installer based in Hertfordshire. \"We are now getting all sorts of inquiries from companies, local authorites and individuals. But nothing is guaranteed. We don't know the level it will be set at yet and the big energy companies are still lobbying against it.\" Jerermy Leggett, chairman of the British solar group Solar Century, says the British market has tremendous potential but is also concerned that some officials at the Department for Energy and Climate Change may stall the introduction of the FIT at the behest of groups arguing that nuclear power is the answer. \"If so, UK plc will essentially have to sit and watch as other countries create jobs, tax income and energy security in one of the fastest-growing industries within the emerging green industrial revolution.\" The British market, along with those of China, Japan and the United States, which have also recently announced plans for feed-in tariffs and other forms of support, offers a bright future for the solar industry. After several years of meteoric growth, it has been laid low this year by the credit crunch and a change to Spain's feed-in tariff that has reduced demand in one of the world's fastest-growing markets. The global financial crisis has hit the industry hard because its costs are high and it has had trouble accessing bank financing. This has forced companies to rein in production and cut their prices in a bid to maintain their growth. At the same time the supply of silicon, from which PV panels are made, has finally caught up with, and overtaken, demand, giving another nudge down to prices – to the benefit of consumers. \"Prices to end-users are down about 16% this year,\" says Georg Salvamoser, head of the German solar industry association, BSW. \"This is hard for firms' margins but it does move us an important step towards making solar energy cheaper.\" He predicts that the number of projects installed in Germany – Europe's biggest market – will grow this year, although more slowly than in recent years. \"Last year we installed 1.5 gigawatts peak [GWp] of PV in Germany and this year I think there will be slightly more,\" he said. That total is equivalent to the power produced from about two conventional coal or gas power stations. PV in Germany accounts for about 1% of total electricity production but the country hopes to boost that to 12% by 2020 and 25% by 2030. Stefan Dietrich, spokesman for Q-Cells – the world's largest producer of silicon PV cells – said prices had tumbled 20% this year. \"Things have changed a lot. It's a buyer's market right now. But in the short term that is good because it will help the industry reach grid parity.\" \"Grid parity\" – the point at which PV electricity is as cheap as that coming from conventional power stations – is the PV industry's holy grail. It depends on how sunny a country is and the cost of its electricity. Dietrich thinks Italy will be the first country in Europe to hit grid parity – possibly as soon as next year. Other candidates are Hawaii and California, where grid electricity is expensive. Many other countries, including Britain, will achieve parity within three to five years, say experts. Once that happens, demand is potentially infinite. Solar PV also has the advantage that, once installed, the buyer is protected from rising oil and gas prices for several decades. Industry analysts iSuppli forecast in a recent report that worldwide PV installation would tumble by a third this year to about 3.5GWp. But it expects growth to explode again from 2011, reaching 25GWp annually by 2013 and giving the industry an annual turnover of nearly $100bn. But Jerry Stokes, vice-president for strategy at Chinese group Suntech – the world's biggest maker of PV panels – says life has got tougher. \"The market is very challenging now and there is a flight to quality going on,\" he says. \"Project developers and investors are very cautious about what they spend their money on. \"It's not just about cost per watt but the number of kilowatt-hours you will get over the lifetime of a project, 20 years and more. And we are confident that we are in front in the race to grid parity – we don't want to live off government subsidies any more.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/19/ukraine-funding-chernobyl-arch","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-19T13:02:07Z","webTitle":"Ukraine raises $785m to seal Chernobyl under new 'shell'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/19/ukraine-funding-chernobyl-arch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/19/ukraine-funding-chernobyl-arch","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine raises $785m to seal Chernobyl under new 'shell'","bodyText":"The ruined nuclear reactor at Chernobyl is to be sealed within a 20,000-tonne steel shield designed to prevent any further radiation from escaping for 100 years. It would be large enough to enclose St Paul's Cathedral in London, or the Statue of Liberty. Governments from around the world have pledged $785m (£480m) at a conference in Kiev, a week before the 25th anniversary of the nuclear accident in Ukraine – on 26 April 1986 the reactor suffered explosions and caught fire. This brings the total raised for the Chernobyl safety works to $1.8bn. Twenty-eight governments have so far offered money. The European commission was the biggest contributor with $143m at the Kiev Nuclear Safety Summit. The US pledged $123m and Britain, which still has more than 300 hill farms in Wales under radiation restrictions following the fallout from Chernobyl, will contribute $50m. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development announced an extra $172m. Japan, Italy and Canada are considering whether to contribute. The planned arch-shaped structure will be 190 metres (623ft) wide and more than 100 metres tall, taking five years to build. It will replace the concrete sarcophagus erected around the reactor in the months following the accident. This shield now has cracks, raising fears that 95% of the original nuclear material remaining inside the reactor could escape. Radiation levels directly over the sarcophagus are too high for the arch to be built over it, so the structure will be constructed in two pieces, then moved over the site on rails. It is designed so that the authorities could start dismantling the reactor from inside in 100 years. The shield is intended to stay in place until either the radiation threat decreases or the Ukrainian government finds a permanent storage facility for the 200 tonnes of uranium and 1 tonne of plutonium within the ruins. World governments, which had already raised more than $1.6bn in international funding for the shelter, as well as for a permanent nuclear fuel store for other reactors on the Chernobyl site, said that the current crisis at the Fukushima plant in Japan had persuaded them to respond to the appeal by Ukraine, which estimates that Chernobyl has cost the nation more than $12bn. \"Recent events in Fukushima have reminded us of the danger this issue may represent,\" said the European commission president, José Manuel Barroso. The French prime minister, François Fillon, said Fukushima evoked memories of Chernobyl: \"More than ever, our responsibility is to join together our efforts to limit the consequences of such disasters and to prepare for the future.\" Mikhail Gorbachev, president of the Soviet Union at the time of the Chernobyl disaster and now head of the environment group Green Cross International, used the occasion of the 25th anniversary to say nuclear power was not the answer to the world's energy problems or to climate change. In a statement he said: \"Nuclear power has been presented as a financially sound, economically efficient, clean and safe solution that will bring about energy security and drive economic growth. Recently, the so-called 'nuclear renaissance' has hitched a free ride on the back of the need to find low-carbon solutions to the climate crisis. \"The bottom line on the economics of nuclear power is that it simply does not add up. That is why private investment is wisely focusing on better alternatives. \"It is necessary to realise that nuclear power is not a panacea, as some observers allege, for energy sufficiency or climate change. Its cost effectiveness is also exaggerated, as its real cost does not account for hidden expenses. \"In the United States, for example, direct subsidies to nuclear energy amounted to $115bn between 1947 and 1999, with an additional $145bn in indirect subsidies. In contrast, subsidies to wind and solar energy, combined over this same period, totalled only $5.5bn.\" But Mohamed ElBaradei, former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said: \"Today, nuclear power is the only real alternative to fossil fuel as a source of a reliable supply.\" He acknowledged that confidence in atomic energy had taken a severe blow after the tsunami-triggered disaster at Fukushima. \"Fukushima represents a potentially significant setback for nuclear power,\" he told participants at the forum, although he stressed that confidence would be \"re-established in due course\", then added: \"Chernobyl and Fukushima should be shown to be aberrations.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/oct/05/white-house-green-solar-panels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-05T16:10:18Z","webTitle":"White House goes green with solar panels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/05/white-house-green-solar-panels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/oct/05/white-house-green-solar-panels","fields":{"headline":"White House goes green with solar panels","bodyText":"Solar panels will be installed on the White House roof a quarter of a century after they were removed by Ronald Reagan, the Obama administration said today. A mix of solar thermal and photovoltaic panels will be fitted in spring 2011 to generate hot water and renewable electricity, said Nancy Sutley, chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, and energy secretary Steven Chu at a conference on how federal government can green up. It will be the first time since 1986 that panels have sat on the White House, since Reagan removed a solar thermal system installed by Jimmy Carter. In 1979 Carter held a conference on the rooftop, showing off the 32 solar panels and his desire to reduce America's dependence on oil. The move will come as a surprise to many green campaigners, after the White House apparently snubbed a request to install the technology from leading environmentalists last month. \"This project reflects President Obama's strong commitment to US leadership in solar energy and the jobs it will create here at home,\" Chu said. \"Deploying solar energy technologies across the country will help America lead the global economy for years to come.\" The cost and size of the solar panels have not yet been announced. The move by Obama's administration follows lobbying by green campaigners, who called on the president to reinstate solar on the White House and have been driving around the US in a biodiesel-powered van with one of the original panels installed by Carter. Last month they visited the White House, which declined the symbolic request to fit the old panel. Neither did it commit to installing new panels. Bill McKibben, who led the campaign, said he welcomed Obama's decision to fit new panels: \"It's great news … he listened to the American people, who clearly want far more progress on energy than a paralysed congress has provided. We'd rather have a climate bill, but under the circumstances it's a great win.\" He also said in a statement: \"Solar panels on one house, even this house, won't save the climate, of course. But they're a powerful symbol to the whole nation about where the future lies. And the president will wake up every morning and make his toast by the power of the sun (do presidents make toast?), which will be a constant reminder to be pushing the Congress for the kind of comprehensive reform we need.\" This Sunday, as part of a 10/10/10 day of mass participation climate events around the world, the president of the Maldives will also be fitting solar. Mohamed Nasheed, whose low-lying island state is at risk from rising sea levels caused by a warming world, will install the panels donated by solar company Sungevity on his home. The return of solar at the White House follows other symbolic green efforts since Obama took power, including Michelle Obama's creation of an organic vegetable garden in its grounds last year. In the senate Republicans and Democrats are currently trying to push through a renewable energy standard that would require utilities to source 3% of their energy from green sources such as wind and solar power by 2012. But it also comes after the dropping of a climate bill to cap carbon emissions in the summer and a survey that shows all the 48 Republican midterm candidates do not believe in man-made climate change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2011/jul/22/glamping-france-family-avignon-languedoc","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-22T21:45:04Z","webTitle":"Why glamping works for mum and dad","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/jul/22/glamping-france-family-avignon-languedoc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2011/jul/22/glamping-france-family-avignon-languedoc","fields":{"headline":"Why glamping works for mum and dad","bodyText":"\"Do you think we're nearly there?\" This question is not from my son, who is only 14 months old, but from my partner who has pointed out several times that we would have arrived at our destination by now had we flown rather than take the train down to the south of France. At the time, Eurostar seemed like a good idea: more relaxing, more comfortable and more in keeping with our destination – a family-run, eco-friendly glampsite. The reality is we have to take turns monitoring our son Ossian's mission to set a new world record for the number of circuits a small child can make of a train carriage. So we are a teensy bit frazzled by the time we finally arrive at La Pierre Verte, exactly 12 hours after leaving our house, wondering whether we should have chosen to go glamping in Kent, instead of the Languedoc. However, all three of us brighten up instantly on our arrival – Ossian at the sight of a cat he can chase; me and my boyfriend on hearing the words cold beer and honesty bar. La Pierre Verte is a three-acre woodland in the Languedoc, run by twentysomething Brits Ella and Ed Cade, who live on site with their five-year-old daughter, Lily. Alongside their own house, designed by Ella's architect grandfather, there is a yurt, bell tent and mazet, a former shepherd's shelter converted into a one-bed apartment, all spaced out enough to feel private but with shared use of a pool surrounded by lavender and rosemary bushes, an organic garden and a chicken coop. It's easy to mock glamping. Originally favoured by a hippy minority, it soon became a hit among the yummy mummy set with the launch of Feather Down Farms' faux-vintage tented cottages in 2006. With the latest trend for glampsites in the grounds of five-star hotels, complete with hot tubs, bathrobes, flatscreen TV, Wi-Fi and freestanding baths, it's lost all vestiges of being alternative: check out the Hot Tub Safari at Pentre Mawr Country House, in north Wales (pentremawrcountryhouse.co.uk). Glamping has become as cliched as holidaying in a Tuscan villa. But there's a reason glampsites have mushroomed across the UK and Europe – they are brilliant compromise holidays for families. Ossian loved having a posse of playmates by the pool. I loved the peace and quiet, and eating breakfast outside after a decent night's sleep. My other half enjoyed swearing at the barbecue. The camping purists can sneer all they like, I'll take glamping over a damp two-man any day. And anyhow, not all glampsites look like a Cath Kidston photo shoot. Some, like La Pierre Verte, strike just the right balance between getting back to nature and comfort. The tents have proper beds, and Ella will knock up a G&amp;T for you from a garden shed that doubles as a bar, but you don't feel like you've copped out completely. There's nothing glamorous about the outdoor compost loo that the two tents share or the kitchen shack where they cook. Despite the mazet (where we were staying having booked too late for the tents) providing the option of a stay in (hemp) bricks and mortar, the emphasis is on the simple life. The ecocredentials include solar energy for the tents, composting all food waste and a certified organic garden, and there are plans to open a vegetarian restaurant on the site, too. It's back to basics with some simple luxuries – you can get a takeaway coffee and freshly-baked bread from the Shed every morning. For a touch of glamour you only need to drive five minutes past fields of sunflowers and wheat to the sophisticated town of Uzès. Strolling across the main square, place aux Herbes, feels like stepping on to the set of Chocolat, painted by Farrow &amp; Ball. An accordion player provides the soundtrack. In one corner is a clothes shop that sells only white garments, in another La Maison de la Truffe is a temple to decadent, truffle-infused foods from oils and vinegars to risotto and chocolate. Perhaps the most indulgent of all are the foie gras and truffle macaroons, which I imagine the women of Uzès eat as they lounge about in their elegant white clothes. At the other end of town, near the cathedral, a handful of antique and bric-a-brac shops are stuffed full of gorgeous vintage furniture, lighting and clothes. Not cheap, but lovely places to browse – and drink. Several of them have bars or patios. There are plenty of easy excursions you can make from La Pierre – even with a baby in tow. We managed to tick off the Pont du Gard, near Remoulins, part of a 50km-long Roman aqueduct that runs between Uzès and Nîmes. There's a museum but we paddled, or in Ossian's case sat, in the cool shallows of the Gard river admiring the magnificent three-tiered aqueduct towering above us. On another day we drove to Nîmes and toured its crowd-free Roman ruins and the Carré d'Art, a Norman Foster-designed contemporary arts museum. We ate our best meal of the week at Le Vintage (7 rue Bernis, +33 4 6621 0445), where thanks to our friendly fellow diners and waiter who entertained Ossian, we managed to sit down long enough to eat three delicious courses. The town of Saint-Quentin la Poterie, renowned for its ceramics, was also worth a visit. At least a dozen artists have studios here, many producing fairly chunky rustic work in earthy colours. Most nights we barbecued on our little terrace, but we did venture into Uzès one evening when the whole town was en fête. Families gathered in the main square to listen to a band playing Gypsy Kings covers. The atmosphere was fantastic – the whole square twinkling with fairy lights and kids haring about excitedly, all set against the backdrop of golden-hued medieval buildings. As we drank our beers, Ossian had a ball, following other children around and dancing in front of the stage. Now we wouldn't have had that in Kent. • La Pierre Verte (lapierreverte.eu) has a bell tent for €450 per week, yurt €550, mazet €795. Prices are based on two sharing.

The California Energy Commission's approval of the Beacon Solar Energy project wasn't the only development milestone for big solar development this summer. Five other projects have reached the home stretch of approval by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. But while those projects and others have cleared regulatory hurdles, they're also facing a major roadblock—the expiration at the end of this year of a federal program that would pick up the tab for almost one-third of each project's costs. Now, urged on by national renewable energy advocates, a bipartisan group of federal lawmakers is pushing to extend the program for two years, a move they say would spark billions of dollars in investment and create thousands of jobs, but election season politics and a crowded legislative calendar make passage uncertain. An extension to the program was introduced by U.S. Senators George LeMieux (R-Fl), and Maria Cantwell (D-WA) while Rep. Sander Levin (D-MI) introduced a bill in the house that would also extend the program through 2012. The U.S. Treasury cash grant program was introduced in 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act as a way to compensate for the absence of investors interested in renewable energy projects in the aftermath of the housing mortgage meltdown. Before the financial crisis, investors would support projects with cash in return for the tax credits clean energy projects could generate. But these tax equity investors, walloped by the economic downturn, closed their wallets. \"The tax equity market has yet to recover and large scale renewable energy projects require such significant amounts of tax equity that most deals are not possible in today's market,\" according to a letter sent earlier this year to U.S. Senate leaders by 19 senators. The Treasury Grant Program avoids these high transaction costs and directly stimulates clean energy jobs, the senators said. Administered jointly by the U.S. Treasury and the Department of Energy, the grant program allows renewable energy project developers to receive a 30 percent cash grant in lieu of tax credits. \"The grant helps by bringing down the costs of these projects, so they're cheaper to build,\" Solar Energy Industries Association spokeswoman Monique Hanis said. The program is meeting its goal of jumpstarting new renewable projects, according to a preliminary assessment of the program released in April by the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. The report estimated that in 2009, the program spurred development of more than 2,400 megawatts of wind power that would not have otherwise been built, which resulted in more than 55,000 short- and long-term jobs being created. In the solar sector, projects built since the grant program's launch have supported more than 15,000 direct and indirect jobs, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, a national trade organization that is among the groups pushing for an extension of the program. As of September, the grant program had directed $5.2 billion to more than 1,110 projects nationwide. About 80 percent of those projects were solar installations, though wind projects have received almost 90 percent of the total dollars spent by the program thus far. However, to be eligible for the grant program, projects must begin construction by the end of 2010. Most of the solar projects that have benefited from the grant program so far are small projects—the challenge is in the larger projects, especially in permitting and project financing, Hanis said. There are more than 23 gigawatts of utility-scale solar projects in the development pipeline, many of which are still going through the complicated permitting stage with the BLM and state agencies. Most of those projects are in California, where state officials in late 2009 agreed to develop an expedited review and permitting process for renewable energy projects with an eye toward helping projects meet the December 2010 deadline. That followed a move by the federal agency to fast-track permitting for solar projects that were close to approval. Currently, 14 solar projects are sitting on the BLM's fast-track list, along with a handful of wind, geothermal and transmission projects. Those projects are far enough along that they could break ground by the end of the year and take advantage of the grant program, according to the BLM. Among the farthest along, having received final environmental reviews from the BLM, are five proposed solar projects totaling more than 3,000 megawatts, from developers including Tessera Solar, Chevron Energy Solutions, Solar Millennium and BrightSource Energy. BrightSource, which has received a conditional commitment for $1.37 billion in federal loan guarantees, says its 3,600-acre Ivanpah project would create about 650 jobs per year during its three-year construction and pump $650 million in employee wages into the economy over the plant's 30-year life span. Those are the kind of results backers of the treasury grant are touting when they highlight the program's potential to spark a green collar job boom. \"These provisions have worked,\" Hanis said. \"But we're running out of time.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/may/26/china-invests-solar-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-05-26T21:48:56Z","webTitle":"China's new faith in solar energy projects is hailed by environmentalists as a milestone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/26/china-invests-solar-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/may/26/china-invests-solar-energy","fields":{"headline":"China's new faith in solar energy projects is hailed by environmentalists as a milestone","bodyText":"Deep in the deserts of Gansu province, in an area declared off-limits by Chinese state security, is a clean, hi-tech vision of the country's energy future.

While China's dependency on coal is unlikely to change for decades, senior scientists have told the Guardian that solar is the key to the long-term energy security of a country that has many of the world's biggest deserts. \"Solar is most important for the future of China,\" said Professor Can Li, head of the recently established National Laboratory for Clean Energy. \"We have a lot of land that is not suitable for farming. Gansu and Xinjiang are all desert. We estimate that if we covered a third-to-half of the area in solar cells and caught only a tenth of the energy, then we would be able to meet the current energy requirements of the whole country.\" The closest this vision has come to being realised is the solar farm completed last year outside Wuwei city in Gansu, behind a zoo and breeding centre for endangered animals. Although the company that runs the plant gave the Guardian permission to visit, the staff at the centre said state security forbade entry to unaccompanied foreign journalists. We were allowed, however, to visit the zoo. At the back, between dozing Bactrian camels and half a dozen Przewalski's horses, the solar panels were visible along with advanced wind-lens turbines that are three times more efficient than conventional ones. Huatang, a subsidiary of one of China's five biggest utilities, has invested 28m yuan in the project, along with a 12m yuan research grant from the government. Wuwei's municipal government provided free land. \"For us, this is just the beginning phase for solar power,\" said Lu Ning, one of the project managers at the company's headquarters in Lanzhou, the provincial capital. \"This is [just] a sample to show that we have entered the market.\" The Wuwei facility generates 500 kilowatt hours of electricity. It is not the biggest solar plant in China, but it is the first on such a scale to be tested in desert conditions and linked to the grid. Dust and fierce winds cover and scratch the panels, reducing efficiency by between 5% and 15%, but the scientists involved in the project say it remains a success. Gansu has recently accepted bids to build a far bigger solar PV plant that has been approved at Dunhuang. With a 10 megawatts capacity, it will be one of the biggest in the world, but not for long. Reports of new solar plants appear with increasing frequency in the domestic media. In the past year, Gansu, Qinghai and Inner Mongolia have all declared their intention to build solar power stations of 20MW or more. Their success will depend largely on the amount of government support they get. Solar electricity generation costs are about 10 times higher than for coal. But the price is falling fast. Wuwei generates electricity for 3 yuan a kilowatt, more than 20 times cheaper than expected thanks to a sharp fall in the cost of photovoltaic cells. When Dunhuang is completed, experts say the price could fall to less than 1 yuan. Between 2015 and 2020, solar energy prices could reach grid parity with coal-fired power. Renewable energy production is surging forward in China under a government plan to use clean sources for 15% of the country's energy by 2020. Wind power has benefited most, doubling every year since 2004. In the area of solar water heaters, China has become a world leader. Until now, lack of government support and the high price of the silicon-based cells has meant photovoltaic energy for the grid has lagged behind. Although Suntech and other major firms help China to manufacture more panels than any other country, more than 95% of their products are exported. This is about to change dramatically. Earlier this year, Jiangsu province – the home of Suntech – announced 1bn yuan of incentives aimed at building up solar energy generation capacity to 260MW by 2011. This is astonishingly ambitious given the target for the entire nation next year is 300MW. It is just the start. According to Can Li, about 10 local governments in China have submitted plants for solar energy plants in the expectation of the central government stepping in. Environmentalists say the infusion of extra funds will help to build up the domestic market. But Li cautions against over-expectations. While the sun's power will be tapped like never before, he said it will be a long time before the deserts of Gansu are covered in photovoltaic cells. • This article was amended on 28 May 2009.

The explosion at the Fukushima nuclear plant caused particular financial upheaval, as investors moved money from companies exposed to the nuclear sector and into other forms of power generation. The biggest riser among the top 100 stocks was Aggreko, the fast-growing temporary power supplier. A company spokesperson said the business was \"ready to help Japan and its people in any way it can by supplying temporary power if asked\". Its shares rose more than 8%, finishing 116p up at £15.23. The FTSE index of 100 leading shares fell 53 points, or nearly 1%, to 5775 – its lowest point since the beginning of December last year. Shares in companies linked to nuclear power fell around the world, particularly after the Swiss government took the decision to suspend approvals for new nuclear projects. American group General Electric was down in early US trading, while French company EDF, which is among those looking to build 12 proposed new nuclear power stations in the UK over the next few years, saw its shares fall 5%. London-listed Amec, which also has a big nuclear business from new build to decommissioning, was also hit, falling 3.2%, or 37p, to reach £11.15. A number of uranium explorers listed on the London markets were also suffering. Kalahari Minerals, an AIM-listed miner that specialises in uranium, gold, copper and other base metals in Namibia, saw its shares fall 7.7%, wiping £60m from its market value. Spanish uranium explorer Berkeley Resources was also down, by 15%. Solar energy companies, by contrast, were up. First Solar, a US solar specialist, saw its shares rise almost 7%. As well as weighing up the impact on energy generation, investors were moving their money out of the luxury goods sector. Japan is the third largest market for luxury goods, with the consultancy Bain suggesting the market there was worth €18bn (£15.6bn) in 2009. An expectation that the Japanese economy, if not just consumer spending, would be hit, pushed Burberry's shares down. The market generates 7% of Burberry's sales, and as a result it was the largest faller among FTSE 100 stocks , losing 4.3%, or 51p, to finish at £11.23. That trend was replicated worldwide too, with the top European luxury goods companies all reeling from the impact. In Paris, shares in LVMH were down more than 3% while Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent owner PPR was off 2.5%. Analysts at MF Global suggested demand for luxury goods could be \"badly impacted\" in the short term. The effect on insurers was also worrying investors. Though few UK insurers have bills to pick up from the Japanese disaster, the effect on reinsurers and a potential hardening of the insurance market were of concern. Shares in Aviva fell in particular, with the UK's largest insurer down 3%, or by 14p, to 440p. One Lloyds insurer that did insure Japanese assets, Chaucer Holdings, was at pains to point out the limits of its involvement. Its specialist nuclear syndicate provides cover to the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which runs the Fukushima nuclear plants. Chaucer said its policy specifically excludes earthquakes and tsunamis. Insurers will only be called on to cover commercial losses, since the Japanese government covers residential losses from earthquakes. Kathy Fear, an insurance analyst at UBS, said in a note that some of the share price drops for the insurers were probably overdone: \"Given the scale of the earthquake and the global spread of insurers and reinsurers in the region, it is too early to estimate either the total industry loss or the individual company losses.\" Coming on the back of the New Zealand earthquake and the Australian floods, global reinsurers are expected to be under pressure to meet their profits figures as a result of the unprecedented sequence of natural disasters. Reinsurers Munich Re, Swiss Re and Hannover Re have collectively lost €3.1bn (£2.6bn) in market valuations since the disaster on Friday. All three were falling further, with declines of about 3-4%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/infrastructure-buildings-low-carbon-future","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-16T14:12:00Z","webTitle":"Significant changes to infrastructure are required for a low carbon future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/infrastructure-buildings-low-carbon-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/infrastructure-buildings-low-carbon-future","fields":{"headline":"Significant changes to infrastructure are required for a low carbon future","bodyText":"Any significant change in how an economy works has physical consequences. You can see it and touch it, often smell it too. Go back to an area you used to live in or know well, and you can read the economic changes which have taken place, in the shops which have opened or closed, the look of the houses, the amount of traffic on the roads. Think of any major economic transition, such as the industrial revolution, and you can visualise the factories, railways, and urban areas that were built. In thinking now about \"the good transition\", the transition to a green economy in which we can live within the planet's limits, there is a physical aspect to this change, alongside the more abstract questions about how finance circulates and what requirements are written into company law. What sorts of buildings and infrastructure would there be? Probably the most visible consequence of such a transition in urban areas would be in the shift to decentralised, distributed, energy generation. Every building is potentially an energy source, particularly through solar energy (as in Freiberg, Germany). Along with that, though less visibly, would go a smart grid, an electricity grid designed to deal with decentralised generation, with millions of consumers who are also producers, therefore essentially a two-way grid rather than one simply leading from generator to consumers. Along with a change in energy supply, there would be a change in transport systems. Parked cars would be plugged in to electricity sources. Spain is likely to see a million electric vehicles on the road 3 or 4 years from now. More areas would be car-free. New railway and light railway lines would be opened, in some cases reopening lines closed under the Beeching closures of the 1960s. March 15 this year marks the 50th anniversary of Dr Beeching taking charge of the railways: not a cause for celebration, though perhaps it should be marked in some way. Advertising in its current form would be regarded as sending messages every bit as questionable and controversial as party political broadcasts, therefore needing to be balanced by a right of reply, funded by the advertisers, so that the dubious claims being made could be opened up to public scrutiny. In rural areas, there would be a very visible change in the landscape, with more trees, valued amongst other reasons because of their capacity for storing carbon, and less land being taken up by livestock and the crops necessary to feed them. This shift in land use implies a shift in diet. Perhaps it will be carbon sequestration and land use change, rather than ethical concern about the principle of eating animals, which will drive change in eating habits. Changes such as these would not turn the UK into a utopia. Far more would be needed to get anywhere near that. However these suggestions provide a flavour of what we would need to see around us in 10 or 20 years time if we took seriously in the near future the idea of moving off the business as usual trajectory. That trajectory is not only proving devastating to ecosystems worldwide, but also in the process destroying the foundations of economies, all of which are based in the final analysis on the most basic physical things we easily take for granted: plants, animals, metals, air, water, soil. Although economics is capable of very highly sophisticated abstractions, all of that is of little value if we do not concern ourselves with these basics.

What makes the situation even worse is that the banking sector is showing a distinct lack of enthusiasm for offering to fund longer-term projects. That's why GE sees itself as a solutions based company because it recognises that innovation has to reach well beyond the research and development department. By creating innovative financing methods, GE is not just able to encourage sales of more efficient products and services but also offer customers more effective performance guarantees. If, for example, a company is selling a total integrated lighting system rather than merely low energy light bulbs, it is much more likely to stipulate exactly how its products are expected to perform and what the financial benefits will be. To give a sense of how this works in practice, it's worth looking at the partnership GE formed last year with Solarcentury, one of the UK's most experienced solar energy companies, to provide financial services support for its Solar4Schools programme. Our financial services arm GE Capital is offering an exclusive financial package for schools which will enable them to save up to £840 a year on electricity bills and generate an income of over £3,000 a year, without the full upfront cost of buying solar. The school pays back the equipment cost over 15 years using income generated from the recently introduced feed-in tariffs. So over a 25 year period a typical secondary school could see income and savings of around £68,000. The funding model which has been applied to the Solar4Schools programme, which ties technology to finance and assets, is a great way to provide access to emerging technologies that the private and public sectors want in their efforts to meet carbon targets, but cannot necessarily afford straight away. One of the issues that impacts on the effective procurement of the very latest green technology is the fact that the pace of innovation is dictated by the technology companies. Clients or even their advisors are not knowledgeable enough to maximise the available technology or applications. Therefore tender specifications are typically vague and open to interpretation. This can result in clients being frustrated that the tender does not meet their expectations, yet they did not give the level of detail necessary for a compliant tender. One way to address this is for suppliers to work on a negotiated principle in a collaborative group. This simplifies the supply chain reducing the procurement cost and overall project costs for the client. All of this raises an important question. Is there a need to review the options open to the public sector on negotiated contracts, to enable public sector organisations commissioning infrastructure projects to engage with consortia that comprise design delivery and technology? If this is done in a non-competitive but audited way, it is a way to safeguard technology IP for suppliers. So, what is the key to the private and public sectors being in a position to innovate in tough economic times? Ultimately there is a need to challenge the conventional procurement systems and buying regimes that all too often focus on cost, sometimes at the expense of performance. It is a stark reality that private companies will only be in a position to deliver the very latest environmental technologies and innovations in product IP in an appropriate environment and one which encourages a collaborative approach. Effective procurement should be all about encouraging the best and most innovative ideas at a competitive price, as opposed to a compliant bid at a low one. This principle applies as much in constrained financial markets as in times of prosperity.

Caught red-handed in the act of sabotaging the fledgling feed-in-tariffs that pay people for producing solar energy, climate minister Greg Barker has thrashed around wildly for someone to blame it on. \"It was them, guv'nor!\" he says, pointing a shaking finger at the previous government, or poor economic modelling (ie the civil servants), or the nasty capitalist solar park developers. The minister justifies his shock treatment of the sector by \"put[ting] a stop to the threat of larger scale solar soaking up the cash\". Yet he hasn't only stopped what he initially fingered as the villains in the piece (the very large solar parks on greenfield sites). He hasn't just stopped larger industrial installations on supermarkets or huge industrial buildings. He has also jeopardised medium-sized installations above 50 kw – including many schools, hospitals, churches and community facilities – which would have dramatically scaled up the jobs in manufacturing and installation and servicing, and helped reduce carbon emissions. There is an unedifying arrogance to this so-called \"greenest government ever\" which is beginning to worry the wider renewables sector. Rather than try and fix a problem by working with and consulting with the solar sector and with the green groups who supported the feed-in tariff, the government has provided a case-study in how not to amend policy: • First, put uncertainty into the market by signalling an earlier than expected review of a sector that is only just beginning to bloom. Later, justify that uncertainty by background briefing from a former Cameron aide, who explains it was a deliberate ruse to take steam out of the sector, adding insult to injury. This isn't Machiavellian politics … it's Captain Mainwaring. • Secondly, in discussions with industry during the autumn, signal to them that the adjustments would be carefully considered to deal with the identified problem: suggest that the megawatt capacity may be reduced, maybe to as low as 2MW, or even 1 MW; that greenfield sites may be completely ruled out. But stress that you're going to be careful not to cut the legs off the scheme. • Lastly, cut the legs off the scheme. Shock everyone by going way beyond what you've indicated to them in private meetings, destroying their belief in anything you say, and in so doing destroying your credibility with renewables investors and green organisations. And yes minister, the ripples from this fiasco go beyond the solar sector, as the renewables sector and the related investment community are a small and intimately connected bunch. To top it all, then tell everyone how they can trust this government with future reviews of the feed-in-tariffs (as the laughter begins) and the Renewable Heat Incentive (laughter rises); that the Green Investment Bank is safe in their hands (now deafening laughter); and that investors can trust this government to provide a stable platform for renewables investment in the UK (stop there, you're killing me!). So we now have until May to persuade ministers to start listening to people like Ray Noble of the Renewable Energy Association who have said: \"It's an absolute disaster … no new projects will start after this [the review changes] comes into effect,\" adding \"this industry has been strangled at birth\". Or Barbara Hammon, chair of West Oxford Community Renewables – the very sort of social enterprise the government says it wants to support – who complains: \"This government came in saying they are all about the 'big society', but this is big government writ large.\" Or Andrew Lee of Sharp Solar, who employs 1,100 in manufacturing in Wrexham, who describes this as: \"Terrible news for the renewable energy sector – the steep rise in job creation will stop and morale within the industry will drop as a result of this remarkable U-turn.\" Or Friends of the Earth, or the Solar Trade Association, or the Micropower Council … I could go on. The voices are legion, and very angry because of this shameful betrayal. So, minister, a helpful word from the opposition benches. From someone who recently wrote to you offering help in extricating yourself from this mess. Work with us and green groups and the solar sector to get this right by May. Your temporary embarrassment can be eased by swallowing some humble pie, and listening to wise counsel. More importantly, we can rescue the situation and put confidence back in the renewables sector overall, grow our green jobs again, and hit our carbon reduction targets. PS. Minister, by the way, talking about uncertainty: already I'm hearing murmurings of discontent over your decision to delay the domestic tariff on the Renewable Heat Incentive.

The southern German state – the country's most prosperous together with its neighbour, Baden-Württemberg – has tried hard to shed its buttoned-up image. Historically an agricultural region that lacked natural resources, its transformation into a more hi-tech economy began after the second world war. That doesn't mean Bavarians have given up their traditions. Michael Hinterdobler, director of international relations at the state chancellery, says both Bavarias are thriving: \"There has been a renaissance. Young people go out with their iPod but also have a dirndl at home. It's not a contradiction any more.\" Post-war Bavaria benefited from being under American occupation, and companies such as Siemens relocated from Berlin to Munich. The region around the state capital, which generates a third of Bavaria's total output, is home to heavyweights such as BMW and MAN, but also hundreds of smaller biotech, IT and environmental technology firms that have sprung up in the past couple of decades, as well as 550 US IT firms. Recent start-ups include Linguatec, which produces automatic translation software and dictionaries, and Greenrobot, which creates mobile apps such as Quick Search and GroovieMovie.TV. It hasn't all been plain sailing. Having built up a reputation for electronics and advanced manufacturing in the postwar years, Munich found its competitive position under threat in the mid-1990s. It was hit by a double whammy of the 1993-94 recession, which knocked its export-oriented industries, and a drop in demand for defence and aerospace, one of the region's strengths, as the cold war came to an end. The state of Bavaria came to the rescue, selling €2.9bn (£2.5bn) of shares in government-owned energy and infrastructure companies and pumping the bulk of it into initiatives to nurture hi-tech industries. Bayern Kapital, a subsidiary of LfA Förderbank Bayern, Bavaria's state bank, was established with €75m in state money to provide venture capital for start-ups, especially in the risky hi-tech sectors. Martin Zeil, Bavaria's deputy prime minister and minister for economic affairs, admits Germany is \"far behind\" in terms of developing a venture capital industry. LfA loans are granted to mittelstand companies – small and medium-sized firms – through their regular lenders. But a factor in the region's success is a close-knit network of 13 universities and a plethora of public research organisations such as the Fraunhofer and Max Planck institutes. Academics at the London School of Economics laud Munich as a model of \"institutional thickness\". \"Money was put into universities, technical colleges and institutes of applied science, there was always a network,\" said Zeil. \"What attracts foreign investors is this network.\" More than 55,000 people work in research and development in and around Munich. For over two decades, Munich has had Germany's highest share of technology patents by population. Max Nathan, a research fellow at LSE Cities, who co-wrote a paper on Munich published last December, has found many parallels between Munich and California's Bay area. \"Over the past 60 years, both have shifted from mainly rural communities to hi-tech hubs. Both offer a strong economy and an excellent quality of life – something that's helped keep people in the area,\" he wrote. Some 220 miles east in Dresden, Silicon Saxony is following the Munich model. It is an industry association of nearly 300 companies in the microelectronic, semiconductor, photovoltaic and software sectors, clustered around Dresden. Germany has led the way on investing in renewable energy and is the biggest market in the world for solar module installations. One of the main players, and one of the pioneers, is Solarwatt, based in Dresden, which has been operating for 18 years and now employs 480 people, with a turnover of €300m. More than a quarter of that comes from building solar power stations, the rest from domestic rooftop and small-scale commercial installations. Detlef Neuhaus of Solarwatt said the feed-in tariff Germany introduced a decade ago, which pays solar energy producers for any excess power they produce, has been crucial to its success. \"In Germany, electricity generation from solar modules has found widespread acceptance,\" he said. Efforts to turn Germany's former industrial heartland along the Ruhr and Rhine rivers into a European base for biotechnology have met with mixed success, however. North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, is using state subsidies to foster a network of biotech firms to transform the Ruhr region, which had been Germany's coal mining and steel powerhouse since the early 19th century. But Boris Mannhardt, managing director of BIOCOM Project Management, which set up a biotechnology website for the federal ministry of education and research, said dragging the Ruhr into the digital age is a big ask: \"The scientific basis is quite weak in the Ruhr region. It's not strong enough for a commercial biotechnology industry to emerge.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/blog/2012/feb/01/nuclear-power-carbon-emissions-target","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2012-02-01T17:33:30Z","webTitle":"Can the UK achieve its carbon targets without nuclear power? | Leo Hickman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/blog/2012/feb/01/nuclear-power-carbon-emissions-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/blog/2012/feb/01/nuclear-power-carbon-emissions-target","fields":{"headline":"Can the UK achieve its carbon targets without nuclear power?","bodyText":"10.26am: A new report, which has attracted cross-party support, is claiming that the government's decision in favour of nuclear power was \"corrupted\" by \"false\" information. Corruption of Governance? (pdf) was jointly written by Unlock Democracy and the Association for the Conservation of Energy and it argues that \"this corruption of governance can only be rectified if Parliament re-opens this debate, and MPs vote on this issue having seen the correct information\". One of the report's central arguments is that, according to the government's own figures, \"there is absolutely no need for any more nuclear power stations to deliver energy security ('keep the lights on') and achieve 80% reductions in carbon dioxide by 2050\". In part, it says that this is down to the fact that the government stated that the UK's electricity supply will need to \"double or even triple\" in order to achieve a low-carbon economy. But the report states that this was based on flawed information and assumptions about electricity \"needs\" by 2025 and beyond. It led to some contorted thinking, it adds: The [government's] pre-determined policy of [needing] 10 new nuclear power stations created the 'central assumption' of the need for them. Rather than the need driving the policy, the policy dictated the so-called need. The report also criticises the government's assessment of its own \"pathways\" to achieving an 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050. In six of the 16 different pathways put forward by the government last year, nuclear power was according \"level 1 activity\", or, translated, \"little or no action\". The six such scenarios were described as: \"Biofuels: solid\"; \"Renewables emphasis\"; \"Offshore emphasis\"; \"CCS emphasis\"; \"Gas emphasis\"; and \"Microgeneration\". Compounding the problem, says the report, is that the government displays a \"continued refusal to asses the potential for energy savings\". On page 15 of the report (pdf), you can see its summary of the \"false information\" it says has led the government to conclude that it cannot \"keep the lights on\" and achieve its emissions reductions targets by 2050. It then describes it own suggested pathways, all of them with \"little or no action\" on nuclear power. They are too detailed to summarise here, but you can view its assumptions in \"Appendix 2\" on page 30-31 (pdf). (It should be noted, I feel, that despite the report declaring at the beginning that it \"is published by two organisations that are not formally opposed to nuclear power\", the authors, Ron Bailey and Lotte Blair, are part of No Need for Nuclear.) In December, the Department of Energy and Climate Change published an open-source \"2050 pathways calculator\" which allowed any user to design their own \"cost-optimised scenarios\". It ended up generating a lot of heat and attention, but at least it allowed the public to better interrogate the \"assumptions\" the new Corruption of Governance? report is keen to criticise. We should, therefore, now have the information to hand to try and answer the headline question: can we really do without nuclear power? But what are your own thoughts and conclusions? If quoting figures to support your points, please provide a link to the source. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate, too. And later on today, I will return with my own verdict. 11.18am: Last December, the European Commission published its \"Energy Roadmap 2050\". It, too, set out various pathways for meeting the EU's \"decarbonisation objective\" of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to \"80-95% below 1990 levels by 2050\". In \"scenario 6\" (pdf) it described how this could be achieved with \"low nuclear\": Nuclear developments depend on policy assumptions taken and ranges from 2 to 18% share in primary energy consumption. The share of gas is the highest in Low nuclear scenario with significant CCS penetration. Oil and solids decline. Electricity share in final energy consumption doubles from current levels and electricity become the most important final energy source. It also adds that the low nuclear scenario has the \"highest prices by 2030\". Go to page 38 of this pdf for a full breakdown of the assumptions upon which all the scenarios are based. 11.43am: Last October, WWF published its \"Positive Energy\" report (pdf). It, too, set out a range of scenarios for achieving \"near decarbonisation\" of the power sector by 2030 without any new nuclear power stations. It explains each scenario in detail from page 26 onwards. Of the four main scenarios, WWF's preferred future electricity system is scenario B2. This scenario includes high levels of ambition for reducing demand and creating interconnection with Europe, and the lowest capital costs. Scenarios B1 and B2 also need much smaller gas generation capacity than the A1 and A2 scenarios. This reduces the risk of the UK building surplus long-lasting gas generation infrastructure, which might require subsidy to operate at low load factors (as required in the A scenarios) or risk locking the UK into carbon intensive generation infrastructure. However, as made clear in the additional stretch scenarios C1 and C2, there is scope for renewables to provide much more than a 60% share of UK electricity...The level of renewable energy deployment envisaged in all scenarios will require bold policies to encourage investment in the UK's renewable energy industry. It points out that nuclear has \"spiralling costs\" and that, even though carbon capture and storage for gas is necessary in most scenarios, again the costs are uncertain. But, I wonder, does building extra \"interconnectors\" to continental Europe, as WWF calls for, mean that the UK becomes increasingly reliant on, say, France's nuclear energy? 12.28pm: More scenarios to consider. This time from the German government, which said last year, of course, that it intended to phase out all its nuclear power plants by 2022. Here's what its Federal Environment Agency said in 2010: Germany's electricity supply could make a complete switch to renewable energies by 2050. The technology already available on the market could make this possible even today, but it requires that electricity be used and produced very efficiently... The Federal Environment Agency explores the conversion to a 100% renewable energies power supply in three basic scenarios. The study now published is based on the 'region´s network' scenario, in which all the regions in Germany largely tap their potentials to use renewable energies and a country-wide electricity conversion results. Only a very small share of electricity would then need to be imported from neighbouring countries...The power supply switch requires that renewable energies, networks and storage systems be expanded large-scale. Furthermore, the means to save electricity must also be used to the fullest extent. The insulation of buildings must be greatly improved so as not to consume too much power to supply their heating. Load management potentials must also be developed in order to better adapt demand for electricity to fluctuating supply, especially from wind and solar energy. And here's the English version (thanks @EcoPilgrim and @geschichtenpost for finding it) of the report (pdf) it published last May called \"Restructuring electricity supply in Germany\": According to Federal Environment Agency estimates, Germany is able to phase out nuclear energy entirely after 2017. In addition to the construction of power stations in progress, there will be further capacity demand of 5 GW at the most, which can be met by new, highly flexible and highly efficient natural gas cogeneration or combined cycle plants, and partly by stepped up expansion of renewable energies as well as additional energy efficiency measures, or through measures to extend the service life of existing power stations. 12.46pm: I have received a comment from Ron Bailey, one of the report's authors, addressing remarks below the line about the report's claims of neutrality on nuclear energy: Your correspondents seem to be focusing on the wrong question. The report did not make a definitive case either for or against new nuclear. The point it made was that Ministers and Parliament were provided with incorrect information on which to base their decisions. The information that they were provided with was an incorrect summary of the information held by the \"government machine\". That is the point made by the report and anyone should be concerned at that, whether they support or oppose new nuclear. Because it constitutes a corruption of governance and an undermining of democracy. 2.46pm: I've just received this reaction from a spokesman at the Department of Energy and Climate Change: We need a range of new energy infrastructure to keep the lights on and reduce our carbon emissions in a secure and affordable way. The UK has everything to gain from becoming a leading destination to invest in new nuclear. This will come alongside investment in other technologies like renewables, clean coal and gas, and improved energy efficiency. We are confident that the Energy National Policy Statements - which will inform decisions on building new infrastructure - are robust documents which took account of all relevant factors. 3.08pm: I've just received this response from Dr David Clarke, chief executive of the Energy Technologies Institute, a \"public-private partnership between global industries and the UK Government\": It is certainly possible to create a future energy system capable of meeting our 2050 targets without nuclear energy. It wouldn't, however, be the most secure, affordable or sustainable system for UK consumers. Affordability must be a key consideration. Although new nuclear stations have a high initial cost, our own peer-reviewed UK modelling system, ESME – Energy System Modelling Environment – shows that in order to keep long-term costs down, nuclear will have to be part of the mix along with more efficient homes, carbon capture and storage, bio energy and offshore wind. Without all of these elements – including nuclear – all of the energy system scenarios we have looked at simply come with too high a price tag to be realistic. 3.23pm: Some comments that have been sent via Twitter: @Cycling_CB official French study shows that electricity from new nuclear stations is more expensive than windmills http://www.lesechos.fr/entreprises-secteurs/energie-environnement/actu/0201873018509-la-competitivite-du-nucleaire-rabotee-par-la-cour-des-comptes-282687.php @victoria_plumb sure you've already heard of historian Gabrielle Hecht - has interesting perspective on nuclear &amp; politics www-personal.umich.edu/~hechtg/ @noorhal if Severn Tidal Power scheme is reviewed again, no need for nuclear power. @iresustain we wrote an interesting piece on this debate recently - take a look http://industryre.com/2012/01/phasing-out-nuclear-energy-is-costly-lengthy-and-could-see-carbon-emissions-rise/ @JosOlivier Can the #Netherlands achieve 80% #GHG reduction in #2050 without #nuclear power?

See the Pathways Calculator tool on the DECC website. DECC may like new nuclear power stations; they may want them - but to claim that we NEED them to keep the lights on and achieve carbon targets is belied by their own evidence as the report shows and the Pathways calculator shows. By repeating false claims they are only serving to further corrupt governance. As the song asks: When will they ever learn? 5.04pm: Professor David MacKay, DECC's chief scientific advisor who designed its 2050 Pathways Calculator, has now posted his response below the line. He concludes: No-nuclear pathways are certainly technically possible, but if we do without nuclear, you necessarily need stronger effort in other sectors (eg lifestyle change and demand reduction), which may already be challenging to deliver. Any successful 2050 pathway involves significant change in lots of sectors. Given how difficult it is to be sure that every one of those changes can be delivered, and that the cost reductions we hope for will actually be delivered in all our favourite sectors, I think it is a wise idea to keep our options open, and push hard at a portfolio of demand-reduction and low-carbon-supply options that slightly over-delivers on our targets, so that we we will be robust to one or two failures or disappointments. 5.05pm: My verdict Meeting the government's decarbonisation targets by 2050 without nuclear power is clearly technically possible, as the various scenarios highlighted today display. But, in a way, that's not really the point. The far harder question to answer is whether it is possible politically and financially. I'm not much of a gambler. Hence, I heartily agree with Professor David MacKay that is a \"wise idea to keep our options open\". I have always favoured as broad an energy mix as can be delivered, with an emphasis on phasing out the most carbon-intensive sources of energy - most notably coal - as fast as we can. It also seems wise to work hard to reduce demand and increase efficiencies, wherever possible. But I think we need to be realistic about what is achievable. In the short- to mid-term, I really cannot see per capita electricity consumption falling in the UK, especially if electric cars become popular in the coming decade or so (still a big if). My beef with nuclear power has always been the dishonesty of its advocates about its unpredictably high construction and legacy costs. But, as with the push to increase our mix of renewables, we have to be honest with ourselves about these costs and square up to them. However, I personally feel there is too much idealism in the argument that we can completely do without nuclear energy. But perhaps the Germanys of this world will prove me wrong?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2010/oct/12/google-invests-wind-power-superhighway","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-12T14:51:09Z","webTitle":"Google invests in $5bn wind-power superhighway","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/oct/12/google-invests-wind-power-superhighway","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2010/oct/12/google-invests-wind-power-superhighway","fields":{"headline":"Google invests in $5bn wind-power superhighway","bodyText":"Google is extending its investment in green technology with a $5bn (£3.2bn) programme to build an undersea, wind energy transmission backbone along 350 miles of the Atlantic seaboard. The grid project, which stands to serve 1.9m homes from Virginia to New Jersey with up to 6,000 megawatts of electric power from dozens of windfarms 10 miles off the mid-Atlantic coast, is the most ambitious of its kind. Google announced it is working with Trans-Elect and two other firms, but has not offered a timetable for construction. \"This system will act as a superhighway for clean energy,\" said Rick Needham, Google's green-business operations director. Investment in both wind energy programmes and the controversial extraction of shale oil from deposits in North Dakota, Montana and Alberta, Canada, has increased since the BP spill over the summer caused US lawmakers to curb permits for offshore oil and gas drilling. For Google, the Atlantic Wind Connection Project is in line with earlier investments. In May, it put $40m into two North Dakota windfarms, its first clean-energy investment. Two days ago the firm announced it had tested a self-driving electric car on Californian highways. Today's announcement offers hope that further investment will pour into the lagging US wind-energy programme. Consistent wind through Montana and the Dakotas, off the South Carolina coast and across the Texas panhandle gives the US windfarm industry an opportunity to supply significant amounts of electricity to the grid. But compared with China, now the leading manufacturer of wind turbines and solar energy equipment, the US had been comparatively slow in adopting the technology. Public opposition to windfarms, including a large project off the presidential holiday island of Martha's Vineyard, has taken years to resolve. That may now be changing: the Global Wind Energy Council industry group estimates wind-power investment may reach $202bn over the next 20 years. Charlie Hodges, a wind industry analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said: \"The North American wind industry hasn't had any players involved with the motivation and financial heft to really move this market forward. Google could play that role.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2013/feb/13/state-of-the-union-full-text","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2013-02-13T02:29:00Z","webTitle":"State of the union address 2013 – full text","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/13/state-of-the-union-full-text","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2013/feb/13/state-of-the-union-full-text","fields":{"headline":"State of the union address 2013 – full text","bodyText":"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, fellow citizens: Fifty-one years ago, John F. Kennedy declared to this Chamber that \"the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress…It is my task,\" he said, \"to report the State of the Union – to improve it is the task of us all.\" Tonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, there is much progress to report. After a decade of grinding war, our brave men and women in uniform are coming home. After years of grueling recession, our businesses have created over six million new jobs. We buy more American cars than we have in five years, and less foreign oil than we have in twenty. Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before. Together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger. But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded. Our economy is adding jobs – but too many people still can't find full-time employment. Corporate profits have rocketed to all-time highs – but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged. It is our generation's task, then, to reignite the true engine of America's economic growth – a rising, thriving middle class. It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country – the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love. It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation. The American people don't expect government to solve every problem. They don't expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue. But they do expect us to put the nation's interests before party. They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can. For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together; and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all. Our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget – decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery. Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion – mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances. Now we need to finish the job. And the question is, how? In 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn't agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars' worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year. These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness. They'd devastate priorities like education, energy, and medical research. They would certainly slow our recovery, and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs. That's why Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts, known here in Washington as \"the sequester,\" are a really bad idea. Now, some in this Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training; Medicare and Social Security benefits. That idea is even worse. Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population. And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms – otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations. But we can't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and most powerful. We won't grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling, or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers, cops, and firefighters. Most Americans – Democrats, Republicans, and Independents – understand that we can't just cut our way to prosperity. They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue, and with everybody doing their fair share. And that's the approach I offer tonight. On Medicare, I'm prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission. Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs. The reforms I'm proposing go even further. We'll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors. We'll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn't be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital – they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive. And I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they don't violate the guarantee of a secure retirement. Our government shouldn't make promises we cannot keep – but we must keep the promises we've already made. To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested, and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and well-connected. After all, why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks? How is that fair? How does that promote growth? Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit. The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring; a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can't pay a lower rate than their hard-working secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that create jobs right here in America. That's what tax reform can deliver. That's what we can do together. I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform won't be easy. The politics will be hard for both sides. None of us will get 100 percent of what we want. But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, and visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans. So let's set party interests aside, and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future. And let's do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors. The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next. Let's agree, right here, right now, to keep the people's government open, pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America. The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another. Now, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda. But let's be clear: deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan. A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs – that must be the North Star that guides our efforts. Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation: How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills needed to do those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living? A year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than one million new jobs. I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda, and I urge this Congress to pass the rest. Tonight, I'll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago. Let me repeat – nothing I'm proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime. It's not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth. Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing. After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three. Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan. Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. After locating plants in other countries like China, Intel is opening its most advanced plant right here at home. And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again. There are things we can do, right now, to accelerate this trend. Last year, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio. A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything. There's no reason this can't happen in other towns. So tonight, I'm announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, where businesses will partner with the Departments of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs. And I ask this Congress to help create a network of fifteen of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is Made in America. If we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas. Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to our economy. Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer's; developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs; devising new material to make batteries ten times more powerful. Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation. Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race. And today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy. After years of talking about it, we are finally poised to control our own energy future. We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years. We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas, and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar – with tens of thousands of good, American jobs to show for it. We produce more natural gas than ever before – and nearly everyone's energy bill is lower because of it. And over the last four years, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen. But for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change. Yes, it's true that no single event makes a trend. But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and floods – all are now more frequent and intense. We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science – and act before it's too late. The good news is, we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth. I urge this Congress to pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago. But if Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will. I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy. Four years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it. We've begun to change that. Last year, wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America. So let's generate even more. Solar energy gets cheaper by the year – so let's drive costs down even further. As long as countries like China keep going all-in on clean energy, so must we. In the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence. That's why my Administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits. But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and water. Indeed, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together. So tonight, I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good. If a non-partisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea, then so can we. Let's take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we've put up with for far too long. I'm also issuing a new goal for America: let's cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next twenty years. The states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make it happen. America's energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair. Ask any CEO where they'd rather locate and hire: a country with deteriorating roads and bridges, or one with high-speed rail and internet; high-tech schools and self-healing power grids. The CEO of Siemens America – a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina – has said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, they'll bring even more jobs. And I know that you want these job-creating projects in your districts. I've seen you all at the ribbon-cuttings. Tonight, I propose a \"Fix-It-First\" program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country. And to make sure taxpayers don't shoulder the whole burden, I'm also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most: modern ports to move our goods; modern pipelines to withstand a storm; modern schools worthy of our children. Let's prove that there is no better place to do business than the United States of America. And let's start right away. Part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector. Today, our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007. Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years, home purchases are up nearly 50 percent, and construction is expanding again. But even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected. Too many families who have never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no. That's holding our entire economy back, and we need to fix it. Right now, there's a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at today's rates. Democrats and Republicans have supported it before. What are we waiting for? Take a vote, and send me that bill. Right now, overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home. What's holding us back? Let's streamline the process, and help our economy grow. These initiatives in manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, and housing will help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new jobs. But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs. And that has to start at the earliest possible age. Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road. But today, fewer than 3 in 10 four year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program. Most middle-class parents can't afford a few hundred bucks a week for private preschool. And for poor kids who need help the most, this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives. Tonight, I propose working with states to make high-quality preschool available to every child in America. Every dollar we invest in high-quality early education can save more than seven dollars later on – by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime. In states that make it a priority to educate our youngest children, like Georgia or Oklahoma, studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level, graduate high school, hold a job, and form more stable families of their own. So let's do what works, and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind. Let's give our kids that chance. Let's also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job. Right now, countries like Germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges, so that they're ready for a job. At schools like P-Tech in Brooklyn, a collaboration between New York Public Schools, the City University of New York, and IBM, students will graduate with a high school diploma and an associate degree in computers or engineering. We need to give every American student opportunities like this. Four years ago, we started Race to the Top – a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards, for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year. Tonight, I'm announcing a new challenge to redesign America's high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy. We'll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers, and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering, and math – the skills today's employers are looking for to fill jobs right now and in the future. Now, even with better high schools, most young people will need some higher education. It's a simple fact: the more education you have, the more likely you are to have a job and work your way into the middle class. But today, skyrocketing costs price way too many young people out of a higher education, or saddle them with unsustainable debt. Through tax credits, grants, and better loans, we have made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years. But taxpayers cannot continue to subsidize the soaring cost of higher education. Colleges must do their part to keep costs down, and it's our job to make sure they do. Tonight, I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act, so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid. And tomorrow, my Administration will release a new \"College Scorecard\" that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria: where you can get the most bang for your educational buck. To grow our middle class, our citizens must have access to the education and training that today's jobs require. But we also have to make sure that America remains a place where everyone who's willing to work hard has the chance to get ahead. Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving, hopeful immigrants. And right now, leaders from the business, labor, law enforcement, and faith communities all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Real reform means strong border security, and we can build on the progress my Administration has already made – putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history, and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years. Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship – a path that includes passing a background check, paying taxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally. And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods, reduce bureaucracy, and attract the highly-skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy. In other words, we know what needs to be done. As we speak, bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill, and I applaud their efforts. Now let's get this done. Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away. But we can't stop there. We know our economy is stronger when our wives, mothers, and daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace, and free from the fear of domestic violence. Today, the Senate passed the Violence Against Women Act that Joe Biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago. I urge the House to do the same. And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts, and finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act this year. We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day's work with honest wages. But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year. Even with the tax relief we've put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line. That's wrong. That's why, since the last time this Congress raised the minimum wage, nineteen states have chosen to bump theirs even higher. Tonight, let's declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour. This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families. It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank; rent or eviction; scraping by or finally getting ahead. For businesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets. In fact, working folks shouldn't have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher. So here's an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year: let's tie the minimum wage to the cost of living, so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on. Tonight, let's also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work, it's virtually impossible to get ahead. Factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up. Inescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults are still fighting for their first job. America is not a place where chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny. And that is why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them. Let's offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who've got what it takes to fill that job opening, but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance. Let's put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in run-down neighborhoods. And this year, my Administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest-hit towns in America to get these communities back on their feet. We'll work with local leaders to target resources at public safety, education, and housing. We'll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest. And we'll work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low-income couples, and doing more to encourage fatherhood – because what makes you a man isn't the ability to conceive a child; it's having the courage to raise one. Stronger families. Stronger communities. A stronger America. It is this kind of prosperity – broad, shared, and built on a thriving middle class – that has always been the source of our progress at home. It is also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world. Tonight, we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to protect us. Because of them, we can say with confidence that America will complete its mission in Afghanistan, and achieve our objective of defeating the core of al Qaeda. Already, we have brought home 33,000 of our brave servicemen and women. This spring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan security forces take the lead. Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan. This drawdown will continue. And by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over. Beyond 2014, America's commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change. We are negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two missions: training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos, and counter-terrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates. Today, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self. Different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged – from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa. The threat these groups pose is evolving. But to meet this threat, we don't need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad, or occupy other nations. Instead, we will need to help countries like Yemen, Libya, and Somalia provide for their own security, and help allies who take the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali. And, where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans. As we do, we must enlist our values in the fight. That is why my Administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism operations. Throughout, we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts. I recognize that in our democracy, no one should just take my word that we're doing things the right way. So, in the months ahead, I will continue to engage with Congress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention, and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world. Of course, our challenges don't end with al Qaeda. America will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world's most dangerous weapons. The regime in North Korea must know that they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations. Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only isolate them further, as we stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defense, and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats. Likewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution, because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations, and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon. At the same time, we will engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals, and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands – because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead. America must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber-attacks. We know hackers steal people's identities and infiltrate private e-mail. We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets. Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, and our air traffic control systems. We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy. That's why, earlier today, I signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy. Now, Congress must act as well, by passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks. Even as we protect our people, we should remember that today's world presents not only dangers, but opportunities. To boost American exports, support American jobs, and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership. And tonight, I am announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union – because trade that is free and fair across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs. We also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us all. In many places, people live on little more than a dollar a day. So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades: by connecting more people to the global economy and empowering women; by giving our young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve and helping communities to feed, power, and educate themselves; by saving the world's children from preventable deaths; and by realizing the promise of an AIDS-free generation. Above all, America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change. I saw the power of hope last year in Rangoon – when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into the home where she had been imprisoned for years; when thousands of Burmese lined the streets, waving American flags, including a man who said, \"There is justice and law in the United States. I want our country to be like that.\" In defense of freedom, we will remain the anchor of strong alliances from the Americas to Africa; from Europe to Asia. In the Middle East, we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights, and support stable transitions to democracy. The process will be messy, and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like Egypt; but we can – and will – insist on respect for the fundamental rights of all people. We will keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that has murdered its own people, and support opposition leaders that respect the rights of every Syrian. And we will stand steadfast with Israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace. These are the messages I will deliver when I travel to the Middle East next month. All this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk – our diplomats, our intelligence officers, and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces. As long as I'm Commander-in-Chief, we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad, and we will maintain the best military in the world. We will invest in new capabilities, even as we reduce waste and wartime spending. We will ensure equal treatment for all service members, and equal benefits for their families – gay and straight. We will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters, because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat. We will keep faith with our veterans – investing in world-class care, including mental health care, for our wounded warriors; supporting our military families; and giving our veterans the benefits, education, and job opportunities they have earned. And I want to thank my wife Michelle and Dr. Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they serve us. But defending our freedom is not the job of our military alone. We must all do our part to make sure our God-given rights are protected here at home. That includes our most fundamental right as citizens: the right to vote. When any Americans – no matter where they live or what their party – are denied that right simply because they can't wait for five, six, seven hours just to cast their ballot, we are betraying our ideals. That's why, tonight, I'm announcing a non-partisan commission to improve the voting experience in America. And I'm asking two long-time experts in the field, who've recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romney's campaign, to lead it. We can fix this, and we will. The American people demand it. And so does our democracy. Of course, what I've said tonight matters little if we don't come together to protect our most precious resource – our children. It has been two months since Newtown. I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence. But this time is different. Overwhelming majorities of Americans – Americans who believe in the 2nd Amendment – have come together around commonsense reform – like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun. Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals. Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because they are tired of being outgunned. Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. If you want to vote no, that's your choice. But these proposals deserve a vote. Because in the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, and anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun. One of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton. She was 15 years old. She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss. She was a majorette. She was so good to her friends, they all thought they were her best friend. Just three weeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her classmates, performing for her country at my inauguration. And a week later, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a mile away from my house. Hadiya's parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this chamber tonight, along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence. They deserve a vote. Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. The families of Newtown deserve a vote. The families of Aurora deserve a vote. The families of Oak Creek, and Tucson, and Blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence – they deserve a simple vote. Our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country. Indeed, no laws, no initiatives, no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges I've outlined tonight. But we were never sent here to be perfect. We were sent here to make what difference we can, to secure this nation, expand opportunity, and uphold our ideals through the hard, often frustrating, but absolutely necessary work of self-government. We were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they look out for one another, every single day, usually without fanfare, all across this country. We should follow their example. We should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu Sanchez. When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness, her thoughts were not with how her own home was faring – they were with the twenty precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe. We should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline Victor. When she arrived at her polling place, she was told the wait to vote might be six hours. And as time ticked by, her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet, but whether folks like her would get to have their say. Hour after hour, a throng of people stayed in line in support of her. Because Desiline is 102 years old. And they erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read \"I Voted.\" We should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy. When a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, and Brian was the first to arrive, he did not consider his own safety. He fought back until help arrived, and ordered his fellow officers to protect the safety of the Americans worshiping inside – even as he lay bleeding from twelve bullet wounds. When asked how he did that, Brian said, \"That's just the way we're made.\" That's just the way we're made. We may do different jobs, and wear different uniforms, and hold different views than the person beside us. But as Americans, we all share the same proud title: We are citizens. It's a word that doesn't just describe our nationality or legal status. It describes the way we're made. It describes what we believe. It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations; that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others; and that well into our third century as a nation, it remains the task of us all, as citizens of these United States, to be the authors of the next great chapter in our American story. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/26/masdar-city-desert-future","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-26T19:51:04Z","webTitle":"Masdar City – a glimpse of the future in the desert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/26/masdar-city-desert-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/26/masdar-city-desert-future","fields":{"headline":"Masdar City – a glimpse of the future in the desert","bodyText":"A dusty construction site on the edge of an Arabian desert is an unlikely place for a model of green living. But this is Masdar City, an $18bn (£11bn) Norman Foster-designed project where just a few hundred people are guinea pigs in the world's most advanced laboratory for hi-tech environmental technology. Here, residents live with driverless electric cars, shaded streets cooled by a huge wind tower and a Big Brother-style \"green policeman\" monitoring their energy use. Conceived in 2006, phase one of the city is now complete after three years' work and a spend of $1.4bn. The development, near Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, consists of six main buildings, one street, 101 small apartments, a large electronic library, and the Masdar Institute. This offshoot campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has 167 students and 43 academics, most of whom are from other countries, the US, Europe, Asia and elsewhere in the Middle East. On campus there is a bank, a sushi bar, canteen, organic food shop and a concrete basement where 10 driverless vehicles whiz people along the 800 metres from the entrance of the city to the institute. Here are some of Masdar City's other features. The 45-metre Teflon-coated wind tower shows citizens how much energy the community is using; argon gas insulates the rammed earth and steel walls; solar air-conditioning and desalination plants are being tested, as are thermal energy and \"beam down\" solar plants that use mirrors to concentrate the sun and heat water to generate electricity. Phase two, due to be finished this year, will add 222 more apartments, and more streets and shops. An $800m HQ, which will house the new International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), should be finished by 2013. By 2015, Masdar City is expected to have 7,000 residents and 12,000 people commuting from Abu Dhabi. \"It felt like culture shock,\" Laura Stupin, a young American engineer and one of the first inhabitants of the city, wrote on her blog. \"The buildings are beautiful here, and they look so different from anything I've ever seen, anywhere. I keep telling people that it feels like I'm living in a psychology experiment. Every time I flip a light switch in the living room and the faucet in the bathroom starts running, or I desperately push all the buttons on the stove to try to turn on a burner, I can't help looking over my shoulder and wondering if there's a scientist observing my behaviour and reactions in this strange environment.\" That's because of the monitors, which analyse every human and mechanical action requiring electricity. Every machine the students use, every fridge door they open, or light they leave on, is recorded via an intelligent digital grid that senses and controls energy use and lets the power provider intervene. Showers turn off after a few minutes, sensors switch on fridges and lights. Temperature and water use can be centrally controlled. \"The city is a laboratory for the future,\" says Martyn Potter, director of operations at the institute and dubbed the \"green policeman\". The Big Brother approach to cutting energy is likely to become the norm as computerised smart grids are rolled out in Europe and the US, he adds. \"I want to know exactly how these buildings work. I can pinpoint who is using most energy and water, whether in an apartment or the academy. Certain students have been used to having the air conditioning on at 16C (61F), here it is 24C. Yes, they complain. But I have told them that's how it is.\" Fred Moavenzadeh, head of the institute, and a Harvard professor, says: \"The shock of having to conserve energy is part of the Masdar human experiment. We are living and experiencing what we are trying to … educate people about … We're using roughly half the energy of a normal building of this size. We are producing no carbon because it's all renewable. Our water consumption is less and our waste generation is relatively low.\" The plan was to make Masdar the world's first zero-carbon city, but as the global \"cleantech\" market stalls in the recession, compromises are made. Foster planned to accommodate 50,000 residents and 40,000 commuters and the city was due be completed by 2016; now the final population will probably not exceed 40,000 and the completion date has been put at 2021 or 2025. The idea of a second Masdar City has been dropped; a $2.2bn hydrogen power project has been called off, as has a \"thin film\" solar manufacturing plant, intended for Abu Dhabi. \"The Masdar master plan is changing as the world economy changes,\" says Dale Rollins, a former Shell executive, now Masdar's chief operating officer. \"It's unfair to say that what was decided in 2006 will hold for ever more. The objectives have not changed but we have re-worked the master plan. The technology and the market has moved on. We say we can do it better and we can do it in less expensive ways.\" Foster's vision was for Masdar's streets to be pedestrian-only with pilotless vehicles running via magnets and fibre-optic cables. But this is now thought a white elephant. The rest of the city will be built on one floor, saving hundreds of millions of pounds. And people might move about in \"golf buggy\" taxis. The master plan was to desalinate groundwater with solar energy, but for now water is piped in from one of Abu Dhabi's gas-fired, high-energy, desalination plants. The revised plan no longer counts on-site energy generation as the only source of power. The idea of coveringA scheme for covering all roofs with solar panels was found to be more costly than a centralised power plant. Meanwhile, the photovoltaic panels outside the city are proving less efficient than expected because of dust storms and haze, which can cut solar insolation by 30% – the panels must be cleaned by hand. People living in the city say they quickly get used to the technology but not the setting. \"It's quite a mind flip to be in such a strangely beautiful environment, then look out of a window and see flat dusty landscape stretching out to the horizon. It makes me feel like I'm living in a science fiction novel,\" wrote Stupin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"edinburgh/2010/sep/28/edinburgh-renewables-centre-telford-college-students-education","type":"article","sectionId":"edinburgh","sectionName":"Edinburgh","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-28T12:49:18Z","webTitle":"Granton rainwater and sunshine on Leith will be key elements of new renewable energy course","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/edinburgh/2010/sep/28/edinburgh-renewables-centre-telford-college-students-education","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/edinburgh/2010/sep/28/edinburgh-renewables-centre-telford-college-students-education","fields":{"headline":"Granton rainwater and sunshine on Leith will be key elements of new renewable energy course","bodyText":"As we reported this morning, renewable energy is high on the agenda in Edinburgh this week as business leaders meet at the EICC for the Scottish Low Carbon Investment Project conference. Now a local college is adapting for the growing low-carbon industry by opening a training centre dedicated to churning out graduates specifically for this industry. The Renewable Energies Training Centre in Granton is due to open in December. Edinburgh's Telford College will use it to teach students about solar energy, rain water recycling and underground heat source pumps. It means that the sunshine on Leith, as famously celebrated in The Proclaimers' hit song, will become part of the students' coursework. The new centre's aim is to help the building industry in Edinburgh and the east of Scotland to build zero carbon, modern, efficient, affordable homes. It will also have an eco apartment to showcase new building methods geared towards being more environmentally friendly. The college will invite other universities and people from the engineering industry to see new building methods in action. The course is being organised by York-based renewable specialists PPL Training. After signing the deal with PPL yesterday, Telford principal Miles Dibsdall OBE said now is the time to supply the energy sector with the people it needs. He said: \"Now is a very exciting time to pursue a career in renewable energies - despite the recession, the renewable energies sector seems to be doing quite well, especially in Scotland. \"Within the renewable energy industry, Scotland is one of the best places in Europe to be for its rich natural resources - the country has more than enough raw energy from wave, tidal and offshore winds to meet its own needs many times over and could become Europe's leading supplier of sustainable energy. \"Edinburgh's Telford College is therefore naturally delighted to be able to offer renewable energy courses to provide environmentally-aware students with the skills to pursue an extremely rewarding career in renewable energies.\" The first courses at the Renewable Energies Training Centre will start in December 2010, with all certificated courses being available from January 2011 in solar photovoltaics, thermal, ground and air source heat pumps, rain and gray water recycling. The college is attended by over 20,000 students and employs over 600 staff. What do you think about renewable energy power in homes? Do you create your own energy at home?

They can take it for trips along the canal but, more often than not, they are resident at a mooring. And for the sake of our comparison, let's assume that they might otherwise be living in a two-bedroom flat. We should now be able to start making some fairer estimates of how much energy they are likely to consume over the course of a year. If any canal boat residents are reading this, please provide us with some details about what type of fuel sources you rely on (diesel, mooring's mains electricity, wood-burning stove, solar energy?), and how much you typically use throughout the seasons. Is your boat comfortable during the winter, or is it a constant struggle to keep it warm? And what about waste? How do you deal with your sewage? What happens to your bathing water?

Conservation experts have already signalled that the world is in the grip of the \"sixth great extinction\" of species, driven by the destruction of natural habitats, hunting, the spread of alien predators and disease, and climate change. However until recently it has been hoped that the rate at which new species were evolving could keep pace with the loss of diversity of life. Speaking in advance of two reports next week on the state of wildlife in Britain and Europe, Simon Stuart, chair of the Species Survival Commission for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature – the body which officially declares species threatened and extinct – said that point had now \"almost certainly\" been crossed. \"Measuring the rate at which new species evolve is difficult, but there's no question that the current extinction rates are faster than that; I think it's inevitable,\" said Stuart. The IUCN created shock waves with its major assessment of the world's biodiversity in 2004, which calculated that the rate of extinction had reached 100-1,000 times that suggested by the fossil records before humans. No formal calculations have been published since, but conservationists agree the rate of loss has increased since then, and Stuart said it was possible that the dramatic predictions of experts like the renowned Harvard biologist E O Wilson, that the rate of loss could reach 10,000 times the background rate in two decades, could be correct. \"All the evidence is he's right,\" said Stuart. \"Some people claim it already is that ... things can only have deteriorated because of the drivers of the losses, such as habitat loss and climate change, all getting worse. But we haven't measured extinction rates again since 2004 and because our current estimates contain a tenfold range there has to be a very big deterioration or improvement to pick up a change.\" Extinction is part of the constant evolution of life, and only 2-4% of the species that have ever lived on Earth are thought to be alive today. However fossil records suggest that for most of the planet's 3.5bn year history the steady rate of loss of species is thought to be about one in every million species each year. Only 869 extinctions have been formally recorded since 1500, however, because scientists have only \"described\" nearly 2m of an estimated 5-30m species around the world, and only assessed the conservation status of 3% of those, the global rate of extinction is extrapolated from the rate of loss among species which are known. In this way the IUCN calculated in 2004 that the rate of loss had risen to 100-1,000 per millions species annually – a situation comparable to the five previous \"mass extinctions\" – the last of which was when the dinosaurs were wiped out about 65m years ago. Critics, including The Skeptical Environmentalist author, Bjørn Lomborg, have argued that because such figures rely on so many estimates of the number of underlying species and the past rate of extinctions based on fossil records of marine animals, the huge margins for error make these figures too unreliable to form the basis of expensive conservation actions. However Stuart said that the IUCN figure was likely to be an underestimate of the problem, because scientists are very reluctant to declare species extinct even when they have sometimes not been seen for decades, and because few of the world's plants, fungi and invertebrates have yet been formally recorded and assessed. The calculated increase in the extinction rate should also be compared to another study of thresholds of resilience for the natural world by Swedish scientists, who warned that anything over 10 times the background rate of extinction – 10 species in every million per year – was above the limit that could be tolerated if the world was to be safe for humans, said Stuart. \"No one's claiming it's as small as 10 times,\" he said. \"There are uncertainties all the way down; the only thing we're certain about is the extent is way beyond what's natural and it's getting worse.\" Many more species are \"discovered\" every year around the world, than are recorded extinct, but these \"new\" plants and animals are existing species found by humans for the first time, not newly evolved species. In addition to extinctions, the IUCN has listed 208 species as \"possibly extinct\", some of which have not been seen for decades. Nearly 17,300 species are considered under threat, some in such small populations that only successful conservation action can stop them from becoming extinct in future. This includes one-in-five mammals assessed, one-in-eight birds, one-in-three amphibians, and one-in-four corals. Later this year the Convention on Biological Diversity is expected to formally declare that the pledge by world leaders in 2002 to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010 has not been met, and to agree new, stronger targets. Despite the worsening problem, and the increasing threat of climate change, experts stress that understanding of the problems which drive plants and animals to extinction has improved greatly, and that targeted conservation can be successful in saving species from likely extinction in the wild. This year has been declared the International Year of Biodiversity and it is also hoped that a major UN report this summer, on the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity, will encourage governments to devote more funds to conservation. Professor Norman MacLeod, keeper of palaeontology at the Natural History Museum in London, cautioned that when fossil experts find evidence of a great extinction it can appear in a layer of rock covering perhaps 10,000 years, so they cannot say for sure if there was a sudden crisis or a build up of abnormally high extinction rates over centuries or millennia. For this reason, the \"mathematical artefacts\" of extinction estimates were not sufficient to be certain about the current state of extinction, said MacLeod. \"If things aren't falling dead at your feel that doesn't mean you're not in the middle of a big extinction event,\" he said. \"By the same token if the extinctions are and remain relatively modest then the changes, [even] aggregated over many years, are still going to end up a relatively modest extinction event.\" Species on the brink of being declared extinct The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists 208 species as \"possibly extinct\", more than half of which are amphibians. They are defined as species which are \"on the balance of evidence likely to be extinct, but for which there is a small chance that they may still be extant\".

We would expect investment in renewables, especially solar, to increase. Nuclear has become politically unacceptable,\" she said. Rupesh Madlani, a renewables analyst at Barclays Capital in London agreed. \"At the very least, we would expect significant investments in nuclear power to be delayed, or deferred, for one to two years.\" But some leading environmentalists who have backed the technology as a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels said the accident should not slow new nuclear investment. The climate scientist James Lovelock said the problems in Japan should not put people off nuclear power. \"There is a monstrous myth about nuclear power. I would make a strong guess that of the tens of thousands of people killed in Japan, none of them will be from nuclear power.\" He said that people were \"prejudiced\" against nuclear power unreasonably. \"It is very safe,\" he said. Chernobyl, for instance, was \"an idiotic mess-up that could only have occurred in the Soviet Union\", and according to UN estimates had killed only about 56 people. More people are routinely killed in oil refineries and coal mines, he pointed out. He added that the reactors affected in Japan were among the oldest still operating, and that newer plants had more safety features. Mark Lynas, another environmental campaigner who has espoused nuclear power as a way to limit climate change, was also strongly supportive of the technology, but pessimistic about how it would be perceived after the Japanese experience. \"It's too early to make a final diagnosis of what is happening in Japan, but what is obvious is that this will be a colossal setback for the nuclear industry at just the moment at which climate change is sparking a real renaissance,\" he said. While he said there was unlikely to be serious damage resulting from the problems at nuclear power stations in Japan, he said the public perception of events was likely to taint the reputation of nuclear power. He said the events in Japan were \"extremely bad\" for nuclear energy, even though Japan had little opportunity to generate more energy from renewable sources, because of a lack of land for wind power and a lack of sun to generate solar energy. \"It's about public acceptability,\" he said. \"If people do not think nuclear power is acceptable, then the most likely outcome is a return to fossil fuels.\" But Benny Peiser, director of climate sceptic group Global Warming Policy Foundation, doubted that the accident would benefit renewables. \"Japan's nuclear disaster will only intensify the global race for cheap fossil fuels while most future energy research and development will go into nuclear safety,\" he said. The Green MP Caroline Lucas said the Japanese accident strengthened the case against new nuclear construction. \"You will never be able to completely design out human error, design failure or natural disaster,\" said Lucas, whose party backs energy efficiency and more renewable energy to meet Britain's energy and climate change goals. Walt Patterson, associate fellow at Chatham House thinktank, said that the financial damage could also be severe. \"Somebody is going to wind up paying the bill and it will probably be the Japanese public one way or another,\" he said. \"That is undoubtedly going to filter back to the debate in Europe as a further factor in the very dubious economics of these plants,\" he told Reuters. European governments yesterday scrambled to step up efforts to assess nuclear safety. Germany is to take seven of its 17 nuclear reactors offline for three months while the country reconsiders plans to extend the life of its atomic power plants. Switzerland has said that it will impose a moratorium on three new plants and Finland will review the safety of its nuclear reactors. On Tuesday, a meeting of EU energy ministers, nuclear regulators and industry officials agreed in principle to a series of \"stress tests\" for European nuclear power stations. \"I think it will make a lot of governments, authorities and other planners think twice about planning power stations in seismic areas,\" said Jan Haverkamp, European Union policy campaigner for environmental group Greenpeace, which opposes new nuclear reactors and wants existing ones phased out. Other analysts said they expected confidence in nuclear power to drop significantly as it did in the aftermath of other major accidents. Political confidence took at least three years to recover after the partial core meltdown in Unit 2 of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the accident slowed growth, but led to a large number of new safety measures. But any renewed confidence was shattered six years later in April 1986 after the Chernobyl accident – the most devastating in the history of nuclear power. World leaders categorically declared their continued intention to rely on the source of energy within weeks of the catastrophe, but funding for nuclear energy research dried up, the public became hostile and financiers in the US and Europe shunned the industry. No new reactors were ordered in the US for 25 years while Germany, Italy and many other European countries banned the expansion of the energy source."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2011/apr/14/china-environmenal-press-awards","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-14T15:42:00Z","webTitle":"Toxic tale shines at China environmental press awards | Jonathan Watts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/apr/14/china-environmenal-press-awards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2011/apr/14/china-environmenal-press-awards","fields":{"headline":"Toxic tale shines at China environmental press awards","bodyText":"A horrifying investigation of a toxic spill from China's biggest gold mining company was among the winners at the second China environmental press awards on Wednesday. Investigations of solar panel subsidies and corporate greenwashing were also recognised with prizes as Chinese journalists reflected on the challenges and changes facing their coverage of arguably the world's worst environmental crisis. The awards, which were launched last year, are jointly organised by the Guardian, chinadialogue and Sina, the leading Chinese web portal. The increased quantity and quality of story submissions reflected another tumultuous year for the Chinese environment, which was buffetted by outbreaks of heavy metal poisoning, the Dalian oil leak, river pollution and over-exploitation of resources. Yang Chuanmin of Southern Metropolitan Daily won the in-depth investigation award for the second year in a row, firmly establishing herself as one of China's environmental journalists. Her report on a toxic spill from Zijin Mining – China's biggest gold mining company - ripped apart the company's claim to \"Double Excellence\" in balancing economic gains and environmental protection. The full article is here, but you can get a taste of the grim landscape and its dire health implications in the following two extracts: \"The village secretary, Huang Jingxin, said: \"Your hands start to itch as soon as you come into contact with the river water.\" Even the colour of the Ting River scares them. When there is no wind or rain the water is green. But when it rains heavily, sediment from the bottom of the river is brought up and the water turns into a rusty sunset colour.\" \"Ten years of mining has turned Yueyang into a 'cancer village'. There are more than 3,000 people living in the three administrative villages of the Yueyang area. In the past five years, about 60 to 70 cancer patients have died in these villages, many of them married couples or siblings. The youngest cancer patient is only 18 years old. Southern Metropolis Daily obtained a detailed case list. The most common causes of death were stomach cancer, lung cancer, esophageal cancer and liver cancer. Yuan Ying won the award for most influential report with an expose of shortcomings in the state's solar energy subsidy program that prompted the government to shift direction. Yuan said she received irate calls from senior officials who were upset that she had cast them in an embarrassing light. \"They should not blame the report. My aim is to improve the industry.\" Liu Jianqiang, a veteran journalist who led the judging panel as a representative of chinadialogue, noted that all but one of the 14 short-listed stories adopted a critical tone. He said these types of report played an increasingly constructive role in society. \"When I started writing, it was impossible for environment stories to get on the front page, but now they do,\" he said. \"I've come to realise that coverage of the environment can make a bigger impact and result in more positive change than the usual stories about crime.\" Selection was difficult because of the depth of good entries. I found it particularly tough. My language skills are regrettably not up to the task of assessing the quality of the writing, which I left to my two Chinese fellow judges. Instead – with the help of my research assistant and friends - I focussed on the detail of the investigations, the strength of the impact and the originality of the approach. The country is catching up not just with ecological awareness, but also dubious \"greenwashing\" marketing campaigns. One of the most highly praised award winners was a humorous investigation of a paper company's claim to be improving the environment by adding non-biodegradable plastic to its products. Off the usual track of pollution and climate, the judges added an award this year for the best human interest story, which was won by an empathetic profile of a bird-watching Tibetan monk. The writer, Geng Dong spent months researching this piece. He said his aim was to make readers reflect on their views of wildlife. \"The lama had a very different relationship with nature than that of someone from a conventional education system. His observations of birds were both distinct and remarkable. I wanted to pose the question whether his way of seeing was best or ours.\" Each of the five main prizes was worth 8,000 renminbi (about 800 pounds), while nine runners up received 2,000rmb. Peter Preston, co-director the Guardian Foundation, which provides most of the funds, said he was encouraged by the development of the award : \"It's tremendously exciting to see expert, vivid and independent environmental journalism develop so swiftly in China - and a pleasure to help sponsor a contest which demonstrates rising standards and rising awareness so clearly\". The winners highlight the longstanding strength of the Southern newspaper group based in Guangdong and the pioneering role played by a handful of investigative magazines. But the media industry is undergoing a transformation. During the ceremony and following discussions, participants described changes in tastes and technology that will challenge conventional news gathering and reporting. The event was cosponsored by Sina, the nation's biggest web portal and the host of the Weibo microblog - China's twitter, which is an increasingly influential source of news. Sina representative, Zhou Xiaopeng said the company hoped to boost its role in green issues. \"We want to use Weibo to build a circle for people interested in the environment. Our hope is that this turn into an influential forum.\" As elsewhere in the world after the Copenhagen conference, the appetite for climate related stories also appears to have waned in China. \"It became harder last year to interest editors and readers in stories about climate change so I'm focussing more on renewable technology,\" said Yuan of Southern Weekly. Hopefully, the awards will continue to highlight and encourage different approaches. Translations of the winning stories will appear on chinadialogue and select ones will be republished on the Guardian Environment Network.

But a leading American power company is hoping to turn the stuff of speculative fiction into reality by supporting a project that would put solar panels into orbit. Pacific Gas and Electric Company, which serves San Francisco and northern California, has agreed to buy electricity from a startup company claiming to have found a way to unlock the potential power supply in space. The initial plan is for the firm Solaren Corp to provide some 200MW of electricity. Solaren, which is based in Manhattan Beach, California, says it will launch a satellite with an array of solar panels around 22,000 miles above the earth's equator using existing rocket technology, and then convert the power generated into radio-frequency transmissions. The radio waves would be beamed back down to antennae in Fresno, California and then converted into electricity and fed into the regular power grid, PG&amp;E said. Although spacecraft and satellites routinely use solar panels, the project marks the first serious attempt to take advantage of the powerful and near-constant supply of sunshine in space. Though solar power advocates of solar power regularly extol its potential on land as solar panels become more efficient, it is a fraction of the energy resources thought to be available in space. Orbiting solar farms are not new a new concept: Nasa and the Pentagon have been studying the technology since the 1960s. Critics argue that the major barrier is cost, because sending rockets carrying solar panels into space is so expensive. The idea has also captured the imagination of screen writers, with Blofeld, the evil villain of James Bond movies, plotting to launch a giant death ray-emitting satellite into space that could hold the world to ransom. But Solaren Corp, founded by a former spacecraft engineer, says it has developed a technology that would make it commercially viable within the next seven years. The company had been in discussion with PG&amp;E for 18 months before the company announced this week that it had agreed to buy 200 megawatts of electricity from Solaren starting in 2016. The deal has yet to be approved by California state government regulators and PG&amp;E has not put any money into Solaren, but the promise alone has turned the notion of space based solar power from fantasy to reality. Because sunshine in space is practically constant, apart from a few days around the spring and autumn equinoxes, the space-based solar panels could potentially produce a steady supply of electricity. The sunlight hitting the solar panels in space would be 10 times as powerful as the light coming to Earth via the atmosphere. Solaren's founder, Gary Spirnak, did not give details of how the technology would work but said it was based on what is currently used by communications satellites, describing it as \"very mature\". And there most definitely won't be any death rays, Spirnak joked, while not stroking a sinister white cat. He said the radio beam would pose no danger to people on the ground or even aircraft that fly through it. The satellites would project a large oval footprint on earth at the receiving point. They would also shut down automatically if the signal goes astray. Daniel Kammen, professor in energy and resources at the University of California, Berkeley, said: \"The ground rules are looking kind of promising ... it is doable. Whether it is doable at a reasonable cost, we just don't know.\" Others have paved the way. In 2008, John Mankins, a former Nasa expert on space solar power, proved it was possible to transmit solar power as radio waves when he beamed a signal between two Hawaiian islands 90 miles apart. But Spirnak will face a challenge raising funds for his project during a recession. He said he was seeking in the low billions of dollars in investment, under $5bn. But that is still much higher than the usual $100m (£67m) to $200m costs for projects in renewable energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2011/may/13/cribsheet-english-maths","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-13T11:18:32Z","webTitle":"Cribsheet 13.05.11","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/may/13/cribsheet-english-maths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2011/may/13/cribsheet-english-maths","fields":{"headline":"Cribsheet 13.05.11","bodyText":"Two more years of school for you. That's Michael Gove's message to pupils who fail English and maths GCSEs, in a bid to cut the numbers leaving school without a good grasp of basic subjects.

Ideally, that would be a C or better at GCSE, but high-quality alternatives will be identified following a consultation this summer. Last summer, 45% of 16-year-olds missed a C grade in the subjects – so a lot more schoolwork could be needed to get basic skills up to scratch. Gove's remarks came as he accepted the findings of Professor Alison Wolf's review for the government in March into vocational qualifications. Wolf also found that up to 400,000 teenagers were wasting their time on college courses that did not lead to jobs or further training. His announcement to MPs also said a host of vocational courses would no longer count in school league tables. Education news from the Guardian • Private schools send in the debt collectors.

David Green, vice-chancellor of the University of Worcester, told the Independent: \"It would mean turning university education into a retail commodity and university education just isn't like that. The proposition is based on ignorance and I think it has been made because the Government has made such a mess of tuition fees already.\" Shadow universities minister Gareth Thomas told the Daily Mail: \"You can't treat university like a lastminute.com holiday.\" @meganknight sums up the disbelief when she tweeted: Willetts is blagging it worse than a hungover undergrad who forgot there was an exam.

While most negotiations ahead of the UN's climate change summit in Copenhagen next month have been concerned with which nations should slash greenhouse gas emissions and by how much, the method in which these cuts will be achieved has received far less attention. Yet the importance of green technology – from wind turbines to electric cars to zero-carbon buildings – is enormous. Developing nations argue that the costs should be paid by the rich nations, and that a new global body is required, perhaps working as part of the UN, to direct the world's low-carbon transformation in sectors as diverse as power, transport and heavy industry. \"We know that, to limit global temperature rises to below 2C, we'll need a step change in global innovation and technology transfer,\" said Shane Tomlinson of environment consultants E3G. \"In the period to 2020, it's vital we avoid high carbon lock-in. The infrastructure decisions that developing countries are taking today, such as new power stations, are going to determine their emissions pathways for 20-30 years.\" In the short term, that means rolling out proven technologies such as onshore and offshore wind power, solar photovoltaics and energy efficiency measures. A recent analysis by the Climate Group found that, to meet the emissions targets already agreed by nations, 9.3bn tonnes of CO2 must be prevented from entering the atmosphere by 2020. But these will not be enough for the deep cuts – 80% or more on 1990 levels – that many rich countries will have to deliver by 2050, if the world is to limit warming to the 2C that scientists agree is the safe limit. By then, according to the International Energy Agency, 17 technologies will have to be developed and rolled out to deliver a reduction of 42bn tonnes of CO2. Most of that technology – ranging from carbon capture and storage, solar power and zero-emission vehicles – will need to be deployed in emerging economies. At Copenhagen, the first decision on technology will be to decide if a new co-ordinating body should have powers to command the clean tech roll out. \"The G77 [group of developing nations] and China have proposed a new central executive, political body,\" said Tomlinson. It would be part of the existing UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which administers the Kyoto protocol. However, Europe and the US want only an advisory committee – their main concern is that a strong political body may end up channelling funds into state enterprises rather than keeping a level playing field for all businesses. Developing countries say an advisory body would have little power to drive the dramatic changes needed. The polarised debate has led some to compare the sharing of IP in green technology to arguments over whether pharmaceutical companies should give up patents for expensively developed HIV or malaria drugs in those nations blighted by the illnesses. Alia al-Dalli, deputy resident representative in Morocco for the United Nations Development Programme, said that without local education programmes, the only winners from Copenhagen will be multinational technology companies. \"Capacity-development is very important – people need to be educated and aware. You've got to be able to produce technologies by the south for the south, in the south,\" she said. \"It will not merely be technology transfer.\" Ambuj Sagar, a professor of policy studies at the Indian Institute of Technology – Delhi, said: \"The best step would be if we stopped using the term technology transfer and started using something like innovation co-operation to signify that this is not a simple issue. It is not a hand-off from producers of technology to users of technology. We need co-operation instead of a simple reliance on markets to tackle what is an immense challenge.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/apr/01/turanor-solar-power-yacht-launch","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-01T10:41:16Z","webTitle":"Solar-powered boat Türanor raises hopes of a sun-fuelled future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/apr/01/turanor-solar-power-yacht-launch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/apr/01/turanor-solar-power-yacht-launch","fields":{"headline":"Solar-powered boat Türanor raises hopes of a sun-fuelled future","bodyText":"Considering its 85 tonnes and its potential to shape the future of maritime travel, the launch of Türanor was a surprisingly reserved affair. The world's largest solar-powered boat made a gentle plop as it was lowered by a huge crane on to the waters of the Kiel firth in northern Germany today, and triggered the polite applause of onlookers – mainly fishermen and shipyard workers. \"We've made it, she's safe, and she floats,\" whispered its owner, Immo Ströher, with tears welling in his eyes. But the real challenges for the gleaming white catamaran still lie ahead, as its makers seek to use it to prove that the sun can fuel our world. Next year, after an intense testing phase, Türanor – the name, inspired by JRR Tolkein's Lord of the Rings, means \"power of the sun\" – will embark on her maiden voyage, a round-the-world trip during which her two-man crew will attempt to chase the sun in order to capture as much available solar power as possible and navigate her at an average speed of 7.5 knots. Ströher's granddaughter christened her today by smashing a bottle of champagne against her teak deck, and pronouncing: \"May you always have plenty of water under your bows, and sun on your deck.\" The 31-metre-long multi-hull vessel, the brainchild of Swiss former ambulance driver Raphael Domjan, is topped by scores of photovoltaic panels, with a total area of more than 600 sq metres, that covers most of the catamaran's surface. Additional panels are attached to outriggers on its starboard, port and stern sections, that can be retracted in stormy weather. The solar energy, which will be stored in the largest lithium ion battery in the world, will power the vessel's silent, pollution-free electric motor. \"The mission of the skippers will be to chase the sun,\" said Dany Faigaux, a member of PlanetSolar, the Swiss team behind the ambitious project. \"Up until now, sailing navigation has involved working with the three parameters of the waves, wind and tide. But we've added two new dimensions – namely, sunlight and the lithium ion battery. It's a completely new form of energy management.\" The £16m catamaran – chosen for its energy-saving ability to \"slice\" rather than \"ride\" through waves – will store energy in its batteries by day. It can run on its stored energy in the absence of sunlight for around three days at 7.5 knots, the speed of an average oil tanker. At slower speeds it could run for up to 15 days, according to its makers. Türanor, which will travel along an equatorial route – to take most advantage of the sunshine – will be helped by French meteorologists who will advise the most efficient path along which to steer it according to current conditions and forecasts. If it is a particularly cloudy day, they might recommend a diversion to sunnier parts, even if the route turns out to be longer. \"Its all about maximising its energy efficiency,\" said Faigaux. The 34,000-mile journey will take the vessel across the Atlantic, the Panama Canal, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean and the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean over a scheduled 160 days. The voyage is intended not so much to revolutionise sea travel – the technology requires the vessel to be as light as possible, so it would not be suitable for heavy container ships – as to prove the under-exploited potential of solar energy. \"We want to be the Phileas Fogg of the 21st century,\" said 38-year old Domjan, the project's pioneer. \"But beyond Jules Verne's dream, our project is meant to serve the environment and to enable solar energy to replace fossil fuels, and to motivate engineers and scientists to develop these technologies,\" he said. Appropriately, one of the patron's of the project is Jean Verne, the great-grandson of the French author of Around the World in Eighty Days. \"I don't know why no one has tried it before,\" added Domjan, whose company also boasts what they say is the world's only solar-powered computer server. \"But what we want to show is that all the technology that is in this boat is technology you can already find on the market, rather than just in the lab, and all of it can be applied to our normal, everyday lives.\" Gerard d'Aboville, his fellow skipper for the forthcoming voyage, is no stranger to maritime challenges, having become the first person to row across the Atlantic Ocean in 1980. \"We'll have to learn a new kind of navigation,\" he said. \"It's very different from any of the other challenges I've faced, which is what makes it so interesting. It's strongly symbolic for the future of solar energy, but I would not dare to say that tomorrow a merchant boat or a passenger plane will be powered by the sun.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2011/jun/24/india-barefoot-college-solar-power-training","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-24T14:35:13Z","webTitle":"The women of India's Barefoot College bring light to remote villages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/jun/24/india-barefoot-college-solar-power-training","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2011/jun/24/india-barefoot-college-solar-power-training","fields":{"headline":"The women of India's Barefoot College bring light to remote villages","bodyText":"Securing the end of her bright yellow and orange sari firmly around her head, Santosh Devi climbs up to the rooftop of her house to clean her solar panels. The shining, mirrored panels, which she installed herself last year, are a striking sight against the simple one-storey homes of her village. No less remarkable is that this 19-year-old, semi-literate woman from the backwaters of Rajasthan has broken through India's rigid caste system to become the country's first Dalit solar engineer. While differences of caste have begun to blur in the cities, in rural India Dalits – also known as \"untouchables\" – are still impoverished and widely discriminated against. Growing up, Santosh had to avoid the upper caste people of her village or cover her face in their presence. Nowadays, they seek her help. \"For them, I am a solar engineer who can repair and install the light installations,\" she says. \"From looking down on the ground when higher caste people passed to looking them in the eye, I never imagined this would have been possible.\" Santosh trained to be a solar engineer at the Barefoot College in Tilonia, 100km from Jaipur. The college was set up in 1972 by Sanjit \"Bunker\" Roy to teach rural people skills with which they could transform their villages, regardless of gender, caste, ethnicity, age or schooling. The college claims to have trained 15,000 women in skills including solar engineering, healthcare and water testing. Roy, 65, says his approach – low cost, decentralised and community driven – works by \"capitalising on the resources already present in the villages\". The college, spread over eight acres, runs entirely on solar energy, maintained by the Barefoot solar engineers. Since the solar course was launched in 2005, more than 300 Barefoot engineers have brought power to more than 13,000 homes across India. A further 6,000 households, in more than 120 villages in 24 countries from Afghanistan to Uganda, have been powered on the same model. Only villages that are inaccessible, remote and non-electrified are considered for solar power. A drop in the ocean, perhaps – 44% of rural households in India have no electricity – but these women are making an important contribution to the nation's power needs. Rural India, comprising 72% of the population, continues to depend on fossil fuels, which will be a setback for the country's environmental goals unless the government is able to transfer this dependence to renewable sources. In India, Roy's engineers already save at least 1.5m litres of kerosene a year, which would otherwise have been used to power lamps and stoves, according to Bhagwat Nandan, the co-ordinator of the college's solar division. Marked by a stick fence, Santosh's predominantly Dalit village, Balaji Ki Dhani, is a hamlet consisting of about 20 mud houses scattered over five acres of semi-arid land. The only incongruous element in what could otherwise pass as an 18th-century rural set-up is the cement-built home – the only one in the village – where Santosh lives with her husband, baby son and in-laws. The house has two bedrooms, two mud huts in the courtyard – one housing goats, the other a kitchen – and a third room that functions as Santosh's workshop. Here she spends around six hours a day repairing solar lanterns. Santosh built the house with money she made as a solar engineer. Thanks to her, the other households in the village now have solar power too. Under the Barefoot model, they pay a monthly fee based on how much they would have spent on kerosene, batteries, wood and candles. Some of the money goes towards the solar engineer's monthly stipend, while the rest pays for components and spare parts. Choti Devi, an upper caste Hindu in her late 60s, is Santosh's immediate neighbour. She can't stop gushing about her solar lanterns. \"With the light, it is easier to make the beds at night. During the rainy season many poisonous insects roam around, but now that we have light in the night we do not worry as much. The lanterns have also helped us to guard our cattle properly while getting them back to the house in the evenings,\" she says. As is the custom in rural India, women do the bulk of the housework and agricultural labour. Although Santosh doesn't work in the fields any more, at home she is endlessly busy. If she is not tending to her 17-month-old son, she is milking the cattle, feeding the livestock, attending to customers at the small grocery store she runs from home and repairing solar lanterns. She is quick-witted and confident, although she admits the first day at college was scary. \"I thought I would never be able to understand anything – let alone be able to do it on my own. I didn't even know that we could use the sunlight to light up our homes at night ... I was as amazed as the other villagers.\" Since she became a Barefoot solar engineer, the total income of the family has doubled. \"Before, I worked in the fields the whole day and then I had to rush back so that I could cook dinner while there was still daylight. I hardly got a moment to breathe,\" says Santosh. At the Barefoot College, the women learn through listening and memorising, using colour-coded charts that help them to remember the permutation and combination of the wires without needing to read or write. The model is being replicated in Africa, Latin America and south Asia. The first batch of Barefoot engineers from Tanzania, Uganda, Gambia, Malawi, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda and Bhutan completed their six-month residential training at Tilonia between 2008 and 2009, and have since set up solar power in their villages. Any woman over 35 from a remote, inaccessible, non-electrified area can enrol for the international course, provided she is backed by her village. As Roy says: \"It makes sense to choose women, especially older women, as they are more loyal to their roots and less impatient to try out new pastures, which men are wont to do as soon as they are given a certificate.\" Precious Molobane Mamogale, 42, a mother of four who lives in a village around 500km from Johannesburg in South Africa, is frowning in concentration at a circuit board in one of the college workshops. She looks uncomfortable. \"I didn't expect India to be so hot,\" she says. However, despite the conditions and the vegetarian diet, she is full of hope for the future. \"I want to go back to my country and bring light to my province – and want to open a college like this there so that I can train more women,\" she explains. Back home, Precious was unemployed and survived on state benefits that she received for her last two children; \"not enough to feed a family of six\", she says. Her husband sometimes earned money by working as a taxi driver in the nearest town. When she heard about the course, she was immediately attracted by the opportunity to learn something of benefit to her community and to the family coffers. The class is conducted in a large, rectangular workshop, with a long worktable running through the middle, around which the women sit with their individual colour sheets and panels. Neat rows of solar lanterns line shelves, while charts detailing the colour codes hang on the walls and flutter in the breeze of the fan. The room is airy, but the heat, even at 10am, scorches the ground outside. Guman Singh, their short, bespectacled teacher, calls the women to the blackboard to read out the colour codes. One of them uses her knowledge of English to help her compatriots learn the words for the colours in their local language. \"It is always very difficult in the beginning. Sometimes we feel like tearing our hair in frustration,\" Singh says. \"But once they start getting the colour codes it is easy. We also teach them through sign language and practical demonstrations.\" Further down the long table, Matildah Chikwata, 43, from a village in Zimbabwe, grapples with the workings of a solar panel. Back home she was a vegetable seller, earning around $5 a day. \"We could afford nothing – not even taking the vegetables to sell at the nearest town, so we depended on the villagers coming to buy from us,\" she says. \"People here are poor too. But they are using their hands to make their lives better. I want to go back home and teach people to use their hands. If I can learn at this age, so can anyone.\" Back in Balaji Ki Dhani, Santosh climbs down from her roof and reflects on her modest ambitions for her family: a television, a grinder to make flour, and a motorbike for her husband, who has to walk the 10km to work every day. With her livelihood secure thanks to her training, these small luxuries are now within reach. \"I never thought I would be able to do anything worthwhile,\" she says proudly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/aug/07/richard-parks-interview-extreme-therapy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-08-06T23:04:02Z","webTitle":"Richard Parks interview: Extreme therapy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/07/richard-parks-interview-extreme-therapy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/aug/07/richard-parks-interview-extreme-therapy","fields":{"headline":"Richard Parks interview: Extreme therapy","bodyText":"It's more than possible that Richard Parks is the nicest man I have ever met, or you will ever meet, and I do hope you get the chance. I use the word \"nice\" in its utterly best modern sense. In the vernacular of modern fame, you might expect a tall, tanned, good-looking former Welsh rugby international who is, when I first meet him in Cardiff, 12 frantic days away from setting the rather astonishing record of visiting both of Earth's poles and climbing the highest mountains on all seven continents within seven months, to carry a certain arrogance, hauteur; even some simple sway. Instead, he apologises for putting his bacon roll too close to my coffee, then tries to shrink into his seat and hide, nicely. This is the slowest-burn story of adventurous heroism there has ever been in this media age. Those few weeks ago, in Cardiff, I was rather taken by the story of Richard, a fine flanker who had to give up professional rugby four years ago after a severe shoulder injury and decided, after a few desperate dark nights of the soul, to start climbing instead. He used his life savings from rugby, re-mortgaged his home, as did his parents theirs, to learn how to do it, found his fitness worked at altitude and that he could climb, and, somehow along the way, with urging and backing from friends, it morphed into the 737 Challenge. The seven hugest mountains on our seven continents, including Everest (roughly acknowledged by most now as a \"pole\", being the highest point on the planet), plus both poles, and all within seven months. Quite an achievement to aim for; quite an achievement to finish. Which he just did. But I couldn't understand, back that day in Cardiff, why there weren't legions cheering; why there had been frankly derisory media coverage; why people weren't more excited. It hit me on the train back to London: it's half because Richard is a lovely, shy, brave, determined, quiet, nice non-prick, and half because – well, these challenges. These \"journeys\". There isn't a peak unexplored, very few last, dark, twisty corners of our planet unwormed by the wormers. What was the point? And then suddenly, finally, a couple of weeks ago, just after Richard had managed to do Russia's Mt Elbrus, his increasingly dodgy rugby-d knees and one severely Everest-frostbitten toe (he named it Lazarus; it's still there) and the militant armed border skirmishes notwithstanding, he'd done it. Got home. To Cardiff, which, despite everything he's seen, he would \"never leave\". And it all began to happen. A huge government-sponsored reception; thousands of children queuing for his autograph. Richard is about to take off, and deservedly so. \"But I never started it with the intention of recognition,\" he says. \"I didn't want to break some record for the sake of it. I had pretty personal reasons at the beginning. Gosh, I'm probably more reluctant now and more embarrassed than before to talk about it, as the profile rises. \"I didn't take it well, the injury, if I'm being honest. It was easily the most difficult year of my life; 26th of May 2009 – I was 30, and pretty wary and scary of what else I could do. I loved rugby and simply wasn't ready to finish, and wanted to play more for Wales; it was a real kick in the nuts, if I can use that phrase. It was a lifestyle and privilege to earn money for something I would do for free. Rugby had controlled all my adult life, but not in a negative way. \"So when that last injury came and the consultant told me I could never play again, the overriding feeling was just fear – nearly agoraphobic. All of a sudden, with no plans in place for my life, I had out of the blue no structure, no regime. The decision to finish hadn't been in my control. \"I read, and I thought. Two years before that my nana, Gwen, had passed away. At her funeral I remembered a sentence: 'the horizon is only the limit of our sight' – it resonated with me at the time, but I hadn't fully understood it. Then, lying in bed, the full meaning of that sentence became clearer. Rather than being scared of the future, of the unknown, I could try to embrace it. I'd always been into outdoors, mountain biking and stuff like that, but had never climbed a mountain. I was just googling, and I came across the seven summits. They're climbed quite regularly by a reasonable amount of people. I just wanted to find out if I could do it.\" He could. He went to an expedition company in Sheffield called Jagged Globe, and met a man called Simon Lowe with whom he has now done several summits. \"Simon's become a very big part of it since, a bit of a mentor. My original plan was to climb all seven over three years, just to learn the skills – but then there was a mixture of different people becoming involved, and suddenly… well, the idea. I wanted to raise a ton of money for Marie Curie.\" And, he says, 'The challenge wasn't necessarily climbing them. There are commercial companies who take novices up, haul you up. It was learning the skill of mountaineering, a new skill, testing myself in a new environment with, I suppose, a hope of closing the door on my rugby career. I found I was lucky in that I acclimatise easily, but there's no real way to tell who will and who won't; it's almost nothing to do with physicality. So, anyway, I trained on Mont Blanc, actually a serious mountain, fairly pleased with the way I performed. At that stage it was just an adventure, a toe in the water, just seeing how it suited. Suddenly the whole thing blossomed.\" All these months later, does Richard think he's learned things? \"Perspective. One of the blessings it's given me is life perspective. We worry about what to wear, what to eat. Hmm. When I came back from Everest, the longest I was back, maybe about two weeks, and I didn't change clothes for about a week. I wasn't trying to be dirty, or \"cool\", you simply get into the habit of not choosing what to wear – that was the first time I was really hit by how alien things were, on both sides. \"Also, strikes in Chile, Russian politics, waiting for eight days for a plane. I learned really quickly, the first leg in Antarctica, many delays, went quite quickly from me being stressed about it to finding it quite comical. Learned not to worry about things you can't control. It's terribly similar to climbing – nature is so much more powerful than you, so don't even think you can control it.\" Your best dream or memory, Richard? \"Dreams were horrendous. They always are at altitude. Don't try it. But memories… Antarctica has never left me. I have every intention of going back, if I'm ever fortunate enough. Some of the guys I learned with are grand polar travellers – you learn systems, planning, operating in something which isn't a mountain but is an equally hostile environment. It comes down to the lightest gear, knowing exactly where everything is on your body all the time so you can get at it instantly. There's a weird phrase: 'moisture management' – God, it all sounds so boring but it's incredibly important; it can be fatal. If you sweat excessively you'll have a layer of ice next to your skin, even though your outside jacket's dry – and there's very little solar energy, especially on the north pole. The average temperature was -39C, 24 hours a day for seven days, so you couldn't dry anything: once something's wet it's wet for the whole expedition. It's these boring, tiny, disciplined things. Actually I quite enjoyed them. Every second of the day you have to (or I chose to) be doing something constructive: to keep warm, or keep your circulation going, then ski again – the only time you rest is in your bag. Glove rotations. You'd be amazed. Even in severely cold conditions there's sweat.\" But, Richard – glove rotation? Where's the romance? \"It's there, I promise, it's there – I just needed to stay alive and keep those brilliant people with me alive. I was organised, but conscious of history, of course. I left Cardiff 100 years after Scott's expedition left Cardiff. I'd read up on him, Shackleton, the history, the heroic age, and I don't use the word lightly, I promise, but I felt privileged to be down there for the centenary for Amundsen's reaching the south pole. Antarctica simply rocked me. I felt a strange connection with that past: I wouldn't have been there without their efforts. I'm fascinated by the gear and am lucky to be using the best you can get. But it didn't stop me thinking all the time, on the poles and also on Everest, thinking about Hillary, that they were doing all this with the kind of gear we wouldn't, now, take the dog out for a walk in.\" There is from Richard, more, so much more. The horrendous crevasse fall on Denali, Mount McKinley; the serious drip of frozenly cold water which almost did for him. \"Over an hour is a long time to spend in a crevasse, below 40, wet, and looking into the cavern which I almost slid into, the size of a huge cinema. That would have been it.\" This is the closest I've come to seeing this fine man's eyes retrospectively scared. Wales, finally, loves this man. It's just woken up to him. He won't push it, not his style – but he should. He has raised little of his targeted million for cancer care, but I suspect he will within the next year. He is changing, and he's done it. What next? We have a later, less professional or less tetchy over-the-phone and slightly more emotional conversation – he's done it! – and I ask: what, when you are a grandfather, will you tell? \"I'd like to think if I do ever make it to, say, 80, that when I look back on it I'll think, yes, of nature, but more pertinently of all the friends I've made. Everywhere. God, I've been lucky to do this. It wasn't trying to break some record – many people can break records – it was trying to get me through the loss of something. I think I've done that. No, absolutely no idea now what I'll do. I'm stone broke.\" Richard's charmingly shy story is just, I suspect, beginning.

In a study published in Science this month (12 August) British researchers outlined a vision for flexible and more user-friendly nuclear technologies, as worries over the climate change, energy supply security, and depletion of fossil fuels, are overturning decades of hesitancy over the safety of nuclear power plants. Robin Grimes, materials researchers at Imperial College London and William Nuttall, senior lecturer in technology policy at the University of Cambridge, believe nuclear power will become viable for energy production in developing countries post-2030. \"Outside currently established nuclear countries, flexible nuclear technologies will be especially attractive, reducing the need for grid infrastructure,\" Grimes told SciDev.Net. The authors envisage ship-borne power plants providing energy to big cities, requiring less grid infrastructure and making it easier to invest in cost-effective nuclear energy from scratch. Grimes also suggested 'fuelled-for-life core reactors' — fully sealed modular reactors that could last 40 years and remove fuel handling from the energy production process. These would also reduce workers' exposure to radiation, reducing the need for expensive monitoring. Another idea is to develop reactors with replaceable parts to extend their 40–50 year life span, so that investment in reactors was more cost effective. Technologies now under development could mean 'fast reactors' using uranium 15 times more efficiently than at present. They could become available by 2030, reducing the cost of raw materials. But any country, developing or not, must show both an \"economic need for nuclear energy\" and \"a clearly independent nuclear regulatory body that has access to the necessary facilities and the people to carry out its work,\" Grimes told SciDev.Net. Safety and nuclear proliferation criteria as laid down by the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty would need to be met, as well as compliance with the International Atomic Energy Agency, standards. If these criteria are met, reducing reliance on grid infrastructure is a key point for developing countries wishing to join the predicted renaissance, as it keeps costs low, Grimes said. But some experts are doubtful. Referring to solar energy, John Finney, chair of the British Pugwash Group but speaking in a personal capacity, said that other options such as solar power might also suit developing countries. Bob van der Zwaan, senior scientist at the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands said that nuclear energy was not a silver bullet, but could address climate change, pollution, and energy dependency problems \"along with other options such as renewable\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/apr/15/ocean-missing-heat-global-warming","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-15T18:00:01Z","webTitle":"Global warming monitoring needs to find 'missing heat', say scientists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/apr/15/ocean-missing-heat-global-warming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/apr/15/ocean-missing-heat-global-warming","fields":{"headline":"Global warming monitoring needs to find 'missing heat', say scientists","bodyText":"Experts need to beef up ways to measure the heat content of oceans as a way to track more reliably the course of global warming, scientists say today. Kevin Trenberth and John Fasullo, climate scientists at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, say that only about half of the heat believed to have built up in the Earth in recent years can be accounted for. New instruments are needed to locate and monitor this missing heat, they say, which could be storing up trouble for the future. \"The heat will come back to haunt us sooner or later,\" Trenberth said. \"The reprieve we've had from warming temperatures in the last few years will not continue. It is critical to track the build-up of energy in our climate system so we can understand what is happening and predict our future climate.\" Although the rise in surface temperature in recent decades is the most well-known consequence of the thickening blanket of greenhouse gases around the Earth, it represents just a tiny fraction of the extra heat trapped. Most of the extra solar energy heads straight into the oceans, where it is stored as warmer water. Some goes into melting glaciers and polar ice, as well as warming the land and atmosphere. Writing in the journal Science, the scientists say their calculations show that current measurements can only account for half the extra heat trapped by human emissions. Much of the rest is probably in the deep ocean, they say. Some heat increase has been detected in the upper ocean, but there is no routine monitoring below depths of about 3,000m. Fasullo said: \"Global warming at its heart is driven by an imbalance of energy. More solar energy is entering the atmosphere than leaving it. Our concern is that we aren't able to entirely monitor or understand the imbalance. This reveals a glaring hole in our ability to observe the build-up of heat in our climate system.\" The missing heat is important, they say, because it could be released as weather phenomena such as El Niño, in which the upper waters of the tropical Pacific ocean warm, and La Niña, which often follows. La Niña events have been linked to cold weather, while El Niños drive storms. The scientists say: \"How can we understand whether the strong cold outbreaks of December 2009 are simply a natural weather phenomenon, as they seem to be, or are part of some change in clouds or pollution, if we do not have adequate measurements?\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/blog/lust-marmite-clean-technology-cleantech","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-01T12:26:37Z","webTitle":"Lust, Marmite and clean technology","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/lust-marmite-clean-technology-cleantech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/blog/lust-marmite-clean-technology-cleantech","fields":{"headline":"Lust, Marmite and clean technology","bodyText":"Given that versions of this column will appear not just in various forms of English, but also in Mandarin, Japanese, Danish and Brazilian Portuguese, it is reassuring that the English word 'lust' translates easily into all of them. Lust is cross-cultural. But Marmite, now owned by Unilever, isn't. Introduced over 100 years ago, this is a powerfully flavoured food product made from yeast cells, famously dividing people into those who love it and those who hate it. In the clean technology world, solar energy is now the 'Marmite' sector, with some experts supportive, others not. The 'Marmite' company is Bloom Energy, which was just emerging from 'stealth' with its new fuel cell product when I was in California earlier this year. There was considerable excitement in the Valley, but already critics were arguing that the whole thing was being over-hyped. All this came to mind when I was reading a fascinating new report by the Cleantech Group and the Guardian, The Global Cleantech 100. It provides a barometer of how the cleantech experts view progress to date, which privately held companies they see as most promising, and how they view future challenges. The project is part of a wider Global Cleantech programme, jointly developed with the UK's Guardian Media Group. This includes a newspaper supplement produced and distributed by The Guardian in the UK and online, and the annual Guardian Cleantech Summit held on 23 November. From the work done as part of the programme and elsewhere, it is clear that the sector remains enormously volatile. Of the 100 companies in the 2010 list, only 43 were in the 2009 version. \"High turnover is consistent with the relative infancy of the cleantech wave of innovation,\" we are told. \"External forces, such as financial market sentiment and government decisions - on feed-in tariffs, subsidies and stimulus funding - can have a quick impact on fashions and fortunes.\" Then there is the 'Lust List', a sub-set of the top 100 made up of companies most admired by their peers, but with none of the 60 strong expert panel giving critical views. Silver Spring Networks topped 2010's listing, and was also the highest ranking Global Cleantech 100 company. It supplies networking communication infrastructure to utilities, for advanced metering, distribution automation and demand side management. The other companies on the list are Zipcar (car sharing services), Opower (smart grid and energy management software), Bridgelux (energy-efficient LED lighting systems) and BrightSource Energy (solar plants for utilities and industrial companies). Most people, at best, will have heard of one or two of these companies, but the sector is maturing: 63 of the top 100 are already shipping product. The growth regions are North America (whose share of the top 100 has risen from 55% to 57%) and Asia-Pacific (up from 3% to 7%), while Europe and Israel have slipped (42% to 37%). Big corporations are increasingly active, as investors, partners, licensees, customers and acquirers of companies. Google, General Electric, IBM, PG&amp;E and Siemens are the most active corporate partners of this year's top 100 companies, with the smart grid the hottest area for partnerships. But there is also a critical role for governments, in funding research and development, incentivising investment and in helping citizens see the huge potential to tackle the environmental and natural resource challenges that now face us, wherever in the world we may live - and whatever language we may speak.

The Renewable Energy Association (REA) said it was \"astonishing\" and worrying that solar grants had been frozen since 26 February although there was still money in the building programme's budget. \"This latest disaster in the low carbon buildings programme is completely at odds with the green new deal we hear so much about,\" said Philip Wolfe, the director general of the REA. \"We are talking about relatively small sums to support UK manufacturing, technological innovation and local jobs. This is an industry with a very bright future and a key contributor to the low-carbon future we are aiming for,\" he added. Last December an extra £7m was allocated to fund solar projects under the LCBP to tide it over until the programme closed but this cash was used up by the end of last month. The REA claims a further £12m-£15m still remains in the wider programme budget and predicts that £8m of that will remain unspent by the end of the programme at the current rate of take-up. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has said the programme will not be extended and any funds left over will be sent back to the Treasury, according to Wolfe. The government department, which only days ago launched a new green industrial strategy with great ministerial fanfare, denied last night that any definite decision had been made about the cash that was still available inside the LCBP budget. \"We recognise that the popularity of the low carbon buildings programme has led to an over-subscription in solar PV applications,\" said a spokesperson. \"We are discussing with industry what options are open to us to address this. From 1 April people who install small-scale energy equipment like solar panels or wind turbines will be able to claim double the financial support through the renewables obligation and from April next year we will introduce a new system of guaranteed cash payments.\" The REA said it had warned the DECC of the funding gap in early February. \"The end of the LCBP will leave many REA members in limbo with no funding as the recession bites. It is imperative that the tariffs are implemented as soon as possible and that the renewable electricity and heat tariffs are introduced together by 2010 at the latest. Otherwise the industry is looking at a serious funding gap and contraction as some firms are unable to stay afloat,\" it added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2011/jan/15/optimist-future-mark-stevenson-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-15T00:05:21Z","webTitle":"An Optimist's Tour of the Future by Mark Stevenson – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/15/optimist-future-mark-stevenson-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2011/jan/15/optimist-future-mark-stevenson-review","fields":{"headline":"An Optimist's Tour of the Future by Mark Stevenson – review","bodyText":"Twenty-first century futures talk betrays an odd collective state of mind. Many refuse to take the future seriously, citing past predictions that failed to materialise. We passed 2000 a decade ago, dammit, so where are our jetpacks, flying cars, undersea cities and space colonies? If we can't have the toys we were promised, we won't believe any new forecasts. A different note comes from those who take the future very seriously indeed. They don't believe in jetpacks either. They see multiple disasters ahead, in a world beset by climate change, resource wars and new epidemics, and the collapse of ecosystems and even human societies. Less prominent are the optimists. They concede there are problems – helping 9 billion people make some kind of decent life in the next few decades without wrecking our planetary support systems will be a non-trivial task. But with some determined innovation, perhaps it can still be done. Mark Stevenson thinks it can. But as he travelled the world meeting people with the most promising ideas, he also sought out the more radical optimists. He listened eagerly to Aubrey de Grey, who wants to abolish ageing, computer expert Ray Kurzweil, who sees us sharing our world with machine intelligences more powerful than human brains, and Eric Drexler, with his vision of molecular manufacturing reducing the production cost of all goods to more or less zero. In short, biotech, infotech and nanotech will usher in a post-capitalist and, ultimately, a post-human world. Our tourist is not uncritical of these visionaries, though he gives them a fairly easy ride. He finds radical life extension especially appealing. He is also very taken with the schemes of several other innovators, more prosaic but more immediately vital, including printing thin films which can capture solar energy, capturing carbon dioxide from the air and using it to make new biofuels, and controlled grazing that increases carbon capture by grasslands. Climate change takes up several chapters here, as it should. His point is not that any one of these will solve the problem – establishing that would demand closer attention to numbers and timescales than he offers – but that there is a wealth of ideas and invention on offer. How optimistic is he, then? He accepts there are potential drawbacks to most of the new tech coming our way. Stem cells and private space travel are fine and good, yet synthetic biology, for example, promises tailored organisms for agriculture and industry, but also for bio-terrorists. There will, he remarks more than once, be Chernobyls and 9/11s in our future. At times it will be a rough ride. On the other hand, he finds hope that the internet will increase cooperation and reinforce the current trend – hard to credit in the face of the constant media feed of horrors – for violence to decrease. And he is much beguiled by the notion that innovation and ideas feed on themselves and become self-reinforcing. Here, he echoes the case outlined in Matt Ridley's recent Rational Optimist, and flirts with Kurzweil's view of a technological future which moves out of sight through what he calls the law of accelerating returns. Kurzweil holds that all technologies increase in performance exponentially – as computers have in the past 50 years. If so, then we will soon see technology and magic become more or less indistinguishable, and the future become so strange it is impossible to write about from this side of the event horizon. Meanwhile, the less radical but more immediately realisable ideas Stevenson has sought out should help keep our spirits up. He is pretty keen on technical fixes, and there are plenty of problems his tour passes by. But he makes a good case that human inventiveness is a huge asset if we get on and deploy it energetically in tackling crises foreseen and unforeseen. So can a call to optimism actually make us more hopeful? Perhaps it can. The current contradiction in attitudes is not the starkest there has been. The visions of instant meals, wipe-clean homes and a flying car on every driveway date from the depths of the cold war. In the newly prosperous age of \"mutually assured destruction\" it was easy to believe that the civilised world might end at any moment, and that the living would envy the dead. A look back at the Cuban missile crisis, still less than 50 years ago, makes it hard to see the perils we face now as quite so acute. True, the bad news about climate change is underpinned by science, but if we have confidence in the power of science to measure the damage, perhaps we should have a bit more hope in its capacity to help put things right again. Stevenson's journey is a measured effort to take stock of the reasons for that hope, and to keep faith with the enlightenment project. You don't have to find all the people he meets persuasive, or go along with all his judgments of their projects. But he makes a good case for believing that we can have a future worth making an effort to reach.

Plus he had a newborn son, George. Not that anyone was sympathetic. \"You cannot convince anyone that making a TV series like that is hard work,\" he says. \"But 2009 was spent absolutely flat out, it really did wipe me out.\" The 42-year-old physicist is feeling little more refreshed now. The five-part TV series exceeded expectations, attracting more than 6 million viewers against a prediction of 3 million tops. It turned the 42-year old physicist into a household name: he was \"pretty much mobbed\" at the Cheltenham science festival and papped while out shopping with his wife. \"We were just going into Waitrose and a guy with a long lens jumped out at us. It wasn't like we were at the Ivy or somewhere like that. \"All that,\" he adds, \"is unusual for a scientist.\" The irony is that Cox – whose work now takes place partly at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN – used to be a pop star, of sorts: a member of D:Ream, the band whose \"Things Can Only Get Better\" was the soundtrack to Labour's election victory in 1997. The last gig he played was the Labour bash on the South Bank on their night of triumph. \"But,\" he says, \"I was just the keyboard player; I'm much more widely recognised now.\" For some, the success of Wonders of the Solar System might have been down to Cox's \"gleaming skin, artfully floppy hair and extremely good teeth,\" as the Daily Mail swooned. But the professor prefers a simpler explanation: \"It's utterly obvious to me that people are interested in science, but what hadn't been tried for a long time is an old-fashioned series like that, with a presenter offering opinions about the value of exploration as well as facts.\" Cox grew up as a \"very, very nerdy child\" during what he describes as a \"golden age\" of science on TV. He cites the influence of presenters such as Carl Sagan and Jacob Bronowski and what shone through on Wonders was his enthusiasm, memorably scenes such as one in Death Valley, when he repeated a 19th-century experiment to calculate how much solar energy falls on Earth, concluding with sweat dripping off his brow and saying: \"And that's why I love physics.\" The series even inspired a YouTube mash-up with footage cut together to portray Cox as a blissed-out stoner saying things like \"I've come to one of Earth's natural wonders... to do something I've always wanted to do: I'm about to get incredibly high.Kudos from certain fans was forthcoming when Cox tweeted a link to the video himself; similarly feted were his blunt attacks (\"I'm from Oldham, I believe in a straight-talking version of science\") on the creationist views of the likes of Sarah Palin. More seriously, he campaigned vigorously against cuts to the science budget during the government's spending review. \"You know David Cameron wants a big idea?\" he tells me. \"I think making Britain the best place in the world to do science would be a great big idea. The success of our economy rests to a large extent on the health of our universities and of our science-based industries.\" In the end, he professed himself satisfied with the outcome – a freeze on the £4.6bn yearly spend on scientific research – while yet questioning the threat to higher education posed by the government's other reforms. And he is keen to highlight two triumphs for British science this year: the Nobel prize in physics that went to Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov for their research into graphene at the University of Manchester, where Cox is a professor; and the breakthroughs achieved by the partially British funded LHC. Filming for a new series for the BBC due in the spring and now called Wonders of the Universe (\"it wasn't originally, but I suppose it's a brand now\") has taken him around the world once more in recent months. When we speak, he has just returned from New Mexico; he professes himself particularly pleased with a sequence in which he unpicks the concept of entropy, which is something, he says, even undergraduate students struggle with.Somehow he has still managed to publish a scientific paper this year – a look at \"a novel way of measuring the strength of the Higgs coupling to gluons\". Next year will involve a break from TV work for at least six months. \"My wife and son will be pleased that I'm around more,\" he says, adding, bubbling once more with trademark enthusiasm, \"And the LHC is so exciting right now!\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/solar-heating-regulation-maung","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-30T15:40:19Z","webTitle":"Window of opportunity for solar heating fraudsters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/solar-heating-regulation-maung","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/solar-heating-regulation-maung","fields":{"headline":"Window of opportunity for solar heating fraudsters","bodyText":"Following an undercover investigation in the May edition of Which? magazine, claiming that 10 out of 14 solar thermal installers exaggerated the technology's potential energy savings, experts are questioning the UK government's attempts to regulate the industry before a feed in tariff for renewable heat comes into place next year. Consumer watchdog Which? asked 14 companies earlier this year to quote for the installation of a solar thermal system at a property in south-east England. The investigation revealed that a number of solar heating installers, such as Everest and Ideal Solar Energy, used high-pressure sales tactics and hugely over-stated the potential benefits of installing a solar thermal system. An independent expert calculated the proposed system would cut 10% from the Which? household's annual gas bill. Ideal Solar Energy quoted savings of 50%, while Everest quoted a 43% cut. Everest also wildly exaggerated cost savings, claiming the homeowner would save £35,000 over 20 years. The UK government's Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) says its quality assurance scheme for small-scale renewable energy, the Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS), will prevent false claims from being made when a renewable heat subsidy, the Renewable Heat Incentive, becomes available in April next year. MCS accredited installers must be members of a consumer code of practice under the scheme. MCS also offers consumers routes for any complaints over pressure selling and \"over promising\" on likely outputs, according to DECC. However experts in the solar industry question the robustness of the MCS installer accreditation and warn that cowboys will slip through the MCS's regulatory net. Few customers would fall for a salesman who tries to sell a simple electric kettle for £700 with the promise that it'll cook all your meals and do your dishes Chris Laughton, managing director of the Very Efficient Heating Company and a fellow of the Institute of Domestic heating and Environmental Engineers, claims the MCS accreditation is \"predominantly a paperwork exercise\". He points out that the MCS accreditation does not require the installer to have any specific professional qualifications. One redeeming feature of the MCS scheme, according to Laughton, is that it provides a standard method for working out the average energy produced by a renewable technology, which if used properly should allow customers to get a accurate estimate of their energy generation potential plus or minus 15%. Tobi Kellner, information officer at the Centre for Alternative Technology in Wales, calls for the government to educate consumers about what to expect from solar heating. The MCS customer complaints system will not work, he says, if customers do not realise they've been duped. \"Few customers would fall for a salesman who tries to sell a simple electric kettle for £700 with the promise that it'll cook all your meals and do your dishes. But with solar water heating systems, many customers just don't know what's realistic in terms of price as well as benefits from the system.\" In anticipation of the government's Renewable Heat Incentive scheme offering UK energy consumers financial incentives to generate renewable heat from 2011, Kellner says now would be the right time to roll out a government campaign explaining to people what to expect from the technology. He explains, in simple terms, \"a solar water heating system … costs £2,000 to £5,000 and you'll save £200 to £300 every year for 20 years.\""},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2009/oct/27/obama-administration-environment-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-27T19:54:14Z","webTitle":"Senate Democrats push for climate bill ahead of Copenhagen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/27/obama-administration-environment-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/oct/27/obama-administration-environment-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Senate Democrats push for climate bill ahead of Copenhagen","bodyText":"The epic confrontation about how America will power the economy of the future formally got underway today amid stark warnings from the Obama administration of the costs of inaction on energy reform. Today's hearing, the first of three blockbuster sessions in the Senate, marks a last heave by administration officials and Democratic leaders to advance a bill to reduce America's greenhouse gas emissions before an international climate change meeting at Copenhagen, now just six weeks away. They were met with strong opposition from a powerful Democrat as well as Republicans on the environment and public works committee. With the clock running down to Copenhagen, the administration wheeled out four top officials to make the case that failure to act now on climate change would relegate America to lower tier status in the global economy. \"When the starting gun sounded on the clean energy race, the United States stumbled,\" Steven Chu, the energy secretary, told the environment and public works committee. \"If we don't choose to begin the development of this new technology, China and other countries will.\" American legislation on climate change is seen as essential to reaching a meaningful deal at Copenhagen. But the White House held up action in the Senate on a climate change bill to focus on healthcare reform. The proposed law, which now stretches for more than 900 pages, would cut America's greenhouse gas emissions by 20% over 2005 levels by 2020 and encourage the development of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. Democratic leaders in the Senate are now struggling to advance a bill - which does not have solid support even among their own party - before the meeting in Copenhagen. In an ominous sign for those prospects, Max Baucus, who ranks second on the environment committee and chairs the finance committee which will also review the bill, said the proposed 20% reduction target was too steep. \"I have some concerns about the overall direction of the bill,\" he said. \"We cannot afford the unmitigated impacts of climate change but we also cannot afford the unmitigated effects of legislation.\" For weeks, the White House, Democrats, and environmental organisations have lobbied hard to frame the bill as an economic opportunity. Obama picked up the theme again in a visit to a solar plant in Florida where he announced $3.48bn in government grants to projects modernising America's electrical grid. In introducing the bill today, Barbara Boxer leaned heavily on an analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency that showed the shift away from oil and coal would cost just 22 to 30 cents a day. Global warming isn't waiting for who is a Democrat or who is a Republican. Either we are going to deal with this problem or we are not,\" she said. John Kerry, who co-wrote the bill with Boxer, said it would usher in a technological revolution akin to the rapid growth of the internet in the 1990s. \"We are going to create the equivalent of five or 10 Googles and that is going to drive the economy of our country,\" said John Kerry, the former presidential candidate who is the other co-author of the bill. But their arguments appeared to make little headway with Republicans on the committee. James Inhofe, the Okalahoma Republican who notoriously declared global warming a hoax, called the bill a \"temple of doom\" which would cost Americans up to $400bn a year. Some Republicans pressed for investment to build 100 new nuclear plants over the next decade, or to expand offshore oil drilling to meet America's future energy needs. Others argued that America would be damaging its own interests if it embarked on costly energy reforms - while emerging powers like India and China did not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2010/feb/06/solar-power-bright-investment","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-06T00:05:47Z","webTitle":"Is solar power a bright investment?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/feb/06/solar-power-bright-investment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2010/feb/06/solar-power-bright-investment","fields":{"headline":"Is solar power a bright investment?","bodyText":"If the government offered to pay you £1,000 a year for the next 25 years, in return for an up-front investment of £12,500, you'd snap it up in a second. Well, that's pretty much the deal on offer this week after the government finally revealed what it will pay those who install electricity generating solar panels – in and around their homes – through the new \"Feed-in Tariffs\" (FITs). After years of campaigning by environmental groups – helped in small part by this newspaper – the government has finally agreed to reward households and businesses installing electricity-generating measures with enough of a return to make it a serious financial, as well as an environmental, investment. If you've got the money (which is a big \"if\") and, crucially, a sunny, south-facing roof, you can earn a 7%-10% tax-free return, an income that will rise in line with inflation. At the same time, you get to do more than your fair share in reducing the UK's carbon emissions. In the week that the energy regulator, Ofgem, warned the nation to expect 20% electricity price hikes by 2020, and warned future supplies were in jeopardy, investors in solar panels will have the added benefit of being a net provider of electricity, and largely insulated from future price hikes that could see household bills top £2,000 a year by 2020. Announcing the new tariffs' introduction this week, the energy and climate change secretary Ed Miliband said the guaranteed income would be a big incentive for householders \"to make the move to low carbon living\". \"The feed-in tariff will change the way householders and communities think about their future energy needs, making the payback for investment far shorter than in the past.\" Although Milliband announced a number of tariffs – including what the government will pay those installing wind turbines – the one that will appeal most to the average UK householder will be for installing photovolatiac (PV) solar panels – at a typical cost of £10,000-£12,500. From 1 April, households with approved schemes will be paid for the electricity they generate, even if they use all of it themselves. The level of payment depends on the technology and whether it is being fitted to an existing home, or installed as part of newbuild. Importantly, future payments are guaranteed for the next 25 years and have been, unexpectedly, linked to inflation. Anyone fitting a typical £12,500, 2.5kW PV system to their existing home will initially be paid 41.3p per kilowatt hour (kWh) generated. Enough, according to Miliband, to reward them with up to £900 in the first year on top of a £140-a-year saving on their bills. The measure, which is inevitably quite complicated, is designed to reward those who reduce their own electricity consumption by installing low-energy lighting and A-rated white goods, and to ultimately export excess electricity generated back to the grid. Households get an extra 3p for each kWh they export on top of the 41.3p they get paid for all units generated. Those building PV roof panels into a new-build home get a slightly lower tariff (36.1p per kWh). The fact that the payments are not taxed make it a particularly rewarding investment for higher-rate taxpayers – those earning more than just over £43,000. Regulated payments The feed-in rates change depending on which year you install the technology. They will also apply to installations commissioned since July 2009 when the policy was announced. Early adopters, who have installed grant-assisted PV and registered for the ROC scheme, will also receive payments, but at just 9p/kWh. The payments will physically come from your existing electricity supplier, but will be overseen by the regulator Ofgem. Jeremy Leggett, chairman of SolarCentury, the biggest supplier of PV systems to UK homes, says homeowners need a largish (8m2), unshaded, south-facing roof, or similar place to mount panels. \"Feed-in tariffs are going to be a big boost for the industry and for the first-time, homeowners can see a decent financial return,\" he says. \"We estimate homeowners can save and earn more than £1,000 per year for 25 years, increasing with inflation, giving a payback in around 10 years.\" He says homeowners with flat roofs may well find they can install a system, as will those with conventional roofs that face a few degrees either side of south, east or west. Panels perform best in unshaded sites angled towards the sun at a pitch of 30-40 degrees. Prior to this week's announcement, grants of up to £2,500 had been available to those installing PV panels under the terms of the government's Low Carbon Buildings Programme. There are still grants available for other green technologies. FITs now provide the entire financial incentive for PV installers. Dave Timms, climate and energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, says the new tariffs will allow people to turn their homes into mini-power stations. \"We were hoping the government would go further, but this is very welcome and long overdue,\" he says. \"For householders who have a south-facing roof, PV panels are really worth looking at. Not only are they a sound financial investment, they will also allow you to do your part in tackling climate change. \"Our homes are responsible for over a fifth of UK emissions, but by fitting renewable electricity systems and wind turbines, we can be part of a greener, safer future.\" There is an expectation, he says, that once investors and banks see the benefits of the scheme, specialist loans or top-up mortgages will become available for those who want to install a system, but can't raise the capital. Take it from me – it's worth it This week's announcement on solar panels is good news for homeowners wanting to install green energy systems, simplifying the procedures and shortening the payback time of renewable technologies, writes Ashley Seager. I fitted solar photovoltaic panels on my house nearly three years ago. They are great – we get 90% of our electricity off our own roof over the course of the year. And three years ago the panels were more expensive than they are now. We spent £17,000 but got half of that back in a grant from the Low Carbon Buildings Programme, which was dogged by complexity and stop-go decisions by the government. It is much easier now. You install the solar panels or wind turbine and away you go – no messing about with grant applications that take months. The pain for people like me who have already fitted such technologies is that we will only get a tariff of 9p per kWh, roughly equivalent to the payments we already get from the government's renewable obligation certificate scheme. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) argues that it is incentivising new installations, not helping people who have already done one and may have got a grant for it. But that means early adopters – many of whom stuck their hand in their pocket for a lot of money and became evangelists for the new technologies – get a lower return than they would get if they had waited. Pity. But, undeterred, I am looking at fitting solar thermal panels elsewhere on the roof to generate most of our hot water. That is because, as well as announcing the cashback for green electricity schemes, DECC also published its proposals for payments for renewable heat gear such as solar thermal or ground source heat pumps. I reckon that from next April a normal solar thermal system could generate around £200 a year, based on the 18p per kWh DECC is proposing. Added to the £150-odd you save in heating water, you approach a 10% return, assuming you pay £3,000-£3,500 for your thermal system. Go for it! Your questions answered I have a PV system and am furious I'm not getting the new tariff. Can I rip it down and start again? Technically, it has to be \"new\", and everyone in the industry has speculated as to whether this is possible. Unclear at best. These figures look great on paper, but are they guaranteed? How much electricity your system generates, and the resulting returns will depend on the size and quality of panel and its position. Shading has to be avoided – even a telegraph wire. But sun-hours in the UK are remarkably stable and well documented – so you should get close to the promised figures. What happens if I move house? The most obvious drawback, but it needn't put you off. Estate agents will get used to selling their benefits, and a PV scheme should add to the value. Lots of people spend £12,000 on a kitchen and don't expect to get the money back. If your buyer won't pay up, find another or take the system with you. Are there any planning problems? In England and Scotland, you don't need planning permission for most home solar electricity systems, as long as they're below a certain size – but you should check with your local planning officer if the building is listed, or is in a conservation area. In Wales and Northern Ireland, you still need permission. Is it just solar PV? No the government has announced tariffs for those fitting wind turbines – good out in the countryside – and also hydro schemes. Perhaps more importantly, it has said it will be giving feed-in tariffs to households installing solar water heaters, from April 2011. These are much cheaper (£3,500). There's also help for air and ground-source heat pumps. Money will be returning to this subject in forthcoming articles. Have they got to be on the roof? Do they require maintenance? No. People have installed panels in gardens and on south-facing walls – although given their cost, you will want to find a secure spot where they can't be easily stolen. There are no moving parts and they require no maintenance – PV systems are designed to last 20-30 years.

(SBU) Saudi officials are eagerly awaiting your visit, which they expect will begin a new chapter in our bilateral energy dialogue. You will arrive at a time when Saudi Arabia is confronting a number of difficult challenges. While it has managed to weather the international financial crisis, Saudi officials are keenly aware of the need to foster economic development quickly to provide jobs for its rapidly growing population (more than 2% per year). They are also anxious to diversify the base of the economy away from its current predominant reliance on hydrocarbons, which directly provide close to 50% of GDP and indirectly account for much of the rest of Saudi industry. Saudi officials understand the challenges they face, including the need to make Saudi education more relevant to today's workplace and the need to increase the role of women in the economy, both of which are controversial in the socially conservative Kingdom. Saudi officials are looking to the U.S. to help them meet these challenges, both through increased engagement at the government level, including educational exchanges, and more Foreign Direct Investment, particularly in energy, high tech, and manufacturing. Saudi officials strongly welcomed the President's Cairo speech and its promise of greater outreach, which provides a good context for your visit. 2. (SBU) Saudi officials feel under the gun, as they are aware that a number of other countries are years ahead of them in pursuing the same strategy. They are very concerned by the tenor of discussion in the West about shifting away from reliance on oil and gas, and moves to develop \"energy independence.\" While they, too, want to develop a more sustainable economy and address environmental degradation, they are concerned that the world will turn away from their main source of livelihood before they have a chance to catch up. In that regard, your visit offers a great opportunity to reset our energy dialogue with Saudi Arabia and explore areas of energy interdependence, rather than energy independence. Your visit will also demonstrate our continued interest in helping Saudi Arabia fulfill the King's vision of developing a knowledge-based economy, which dovetails nicely with the agenda of the President's Cairo speech. It also offers the opportunity to encourage the Saudis to be more forthcoming in areas of concern to us, such as climate change. Schedule -------- 3. (SBU) We have scheduled meetings for you in Dhahran with Minister of Petroleum Ali Al-Naimi, CEO for Saudi Aramco Khalid Al-Falih, and in Riyadh with the President of the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST, Saudi Arabia's Science Ministry) Abdullah Al-Suweil and the Governor of the Electricity and Co-Generation Regulatory Authority (ECRA) Fareed Zedan. We have also scheduled your participation in the quarterly review of the critical infrastructure protection initiative with the Ministry of Interior. You will also have an opportunity to meet leading members of the Eastern Province's business community in Dhahran in a dinner at the Consulate, and informally meet Ministry of Petroleum Officials at a dinner in Riyadh. Saudi Aramco ------------ RIYADH 00001557 002 OF 004 4. (SBU) On your first day, you will meet Minister Al-Naimi and Aramco CEO Al-Falih in Aramco's offices in Dhahran, which will give you an opportunity to tour this fascinating facility, including Aramco's advanced technology operations center. In the 20 years since its amicable nationalization, Aramco has developed into one of Saudi Arabia's most efficient and modern institutions, developing several generations of world-class leaders, like Al-Falih and his predecessor once removed, Al-Naimi. It is noteworthy that, when the King wants something done quickly and right, like completion of his signature project of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), he turns to Aramco. It is also noteworthy that Aramco continues to enjoy very close relations with the USG and with American companies, based in part on the fact that many top officials studied in the U.S. Direction of markets -------------------- 5. (SBU) Saudi Minister of Petroleum Ali Al-Naimi is most interested in pursuing two topics with you, a discussion of current oil market issues and the potential for future cooperation. In terms of current issues, Al-Naimi and Aramco CEO Al-Falih will be very interested in your views of the long-term direction of international oil and gas markets. They will be particularly interested in your sense of what policies the Administration will introduce to improve energy efficiency and reduce overall demand, as well as your sense of the prospects for a Climate Change bill from Congress. You may wish to elicit their views on long-term prospects for Asian markets, especially China, which has become a more important destination for Saudi crude. Recognizing the long-term prospects for this market, on November 11, Aramco and Exxon opened a multibillion dollar joint venture with SINOPEC in Fujian, China, to add 8 million tons of annual refining capacity. Chinese firms are also performing significant engineering and construction work in the Saudi petroleum and petrochemical sectors. Saudi officials have recently reaffirmed to us that they continue to value being a major crude supplier to the U.S. market, although they are watching the direction of future demand carefully, and will make sure they retain a significant position in all the major Asian markets. 6. (SBU) Saudi officials (including Saudi Finance Minister Al-Assaf and Al-Naimi) have made it clear both publicly and privately they do not support moves to shift oil pricing away from dollars. They are concerned, however, about volatility in oil markets, which they believe are unduly influenced by speculation. Saudi officials explained to us (septel) that they will shift in January from reliance on the WTI benchmark to the Argus Sour Crude Index because they believe ASCI is less subject to speculative price swings, which in turn will help protect their revenue stream. Saudi officials are keenly interested in keeping the world economy on track for sustainable recovery, and therefore support a continuation of stimulus measures, coordinated through the G20 process. They also want to avoid any undue shocks to the international economy, and support the current price level, which the King has declared is \"fair.\" Saudi Arabia is committed to maintaining sufficient reserve capacity to stabilize prices. Aramco is completing its $120 billion worth of projects to increase production capacity towards 12.5 million barrels a day, an investment that Saudi officials have noted the Kingdom made at the peak of prices for engineering and construction services. The Kingdom is also exploring other projects to bring non-conventional oil on line to meet the evolving needs of the international market and expand reserves, such as Saudi Arabian Chevron's project in the Partioned Neutral Zone with Kuwait to steam flood heavy oil in limestone cavities (septel). Thanks to this project, which Al-Naimi strongly supports, Chevron is the only International Oil Company producing oil upstream in the Kingdom. Future cooperation on renewables and efficiency projects -------------------------------- 7. (SBU) Al-Naimi is keen to discuss potential areas of cooperation, particularly on solar energy (ref a). He has publicly called for Saudi Arabia \"to become the Saudi Arabia of solar energy.\" Al-Naimi also supports biomass energy projects, including involving algae. As Chairman of the RIYADH 00001557 003 OF 004 Board of the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology (KAUST), he will want to brief you on research projects in these areas going on at KAUST, and invite DOE participation in joint projects. Al-Naimi is very much looking forward to escorting Secretary Chu to meet the scientists involved in these projects early in the new year when the Secretary visits the Kingdom. 8. (SBU) Saudi officials in several ministries have explained their interest in developing renewable energy projects, which they expect to play a major role in meeting the Kingdom's future energy needs (electricity demand is growing at 8-10% per year, ref b). Developing renewables will reduce the need to divert increasing amounts of crude from exports to fuel domestic electricity generation. It will also help the Kingdom deal with growing pollution. KACST plays a major role in researching renewable energy potential. As part of our bilateral Science and Technology dialogue, KACST and Aramco expressed interest in holding an energy working group to explore opportunities for joint projects and cooperation in a number of areas, including renewables and in oil production technology. Your visit offers an ideal opportunity to explore in greater detail their areas of interest. KACST would like to identify key players for a working group in January or February, which could schedule scientific exchanges over the next year and agree on a list of joint research projects by December 2010. 9. (SBU) The Electricity and Co-generation Regulatory Authority (ECRA) is working hard to maintain a difficult balancing act between meeting the rising demand for electricity, which is fueled by a heavily subsidized price, and encouraging private investment in new generating facilities. ECRA is the main driver behind the moves to unify the electricity grids of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations, which formally happened this year. This linkage will help national power generation authorities meet peak demands in other countries, which ECRA estimates will make the whole system more efficient and reduce the need for new generation plants in the short-term. Over the longer term, ECRA is acutely aware that it must continue to scramble to meet projected increases in demand. ECRA is very interested in any potential cooperation on efficiency projects, both for generation and for transmission. It has recently persuaded Saudi authorities to approve differentiated prices, which it hopes will begin to moderate residential demand. Civilian nuclear program ------------------------ 10. (SBU) KACST also supervises Saudi Arabia's civilian nuclear energy program. Saudi Arabia is actively considering the development of a civilian nuclear program, which a number of analysts believe is the only possibility the Kingdom has to generate sufficient electricity to meet projected demand from economic and population growth and increasing affluence without wastefully burning large quantities of fuel oil. In May 2008, the United States signed an MOU with Saudi Arabia on the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy and offered to exchange technical experts to discuss areas for potential cooperation. Since that time, the French and other potential suppliers have actively talked about supplying Saudi Arabia with a nuclear power plant. Regional energy experts believe that only two plants are likely to be needed to meet the needs of the entire GCC, and expect that the UAE is likely to be the first country to announce a contract to build a plant, perhaps as early as January 2010. It would be useful to ask your interlocutors about their plans to develop nuclear power, noting our willingness to exchange technical experts. The importance of the IEF ------------------------- 11. (SBU) The International Energy Forum (IEF) has provided a forum for producers and consumers to talk frankly for more than 20 years. Al-Naimi and his senior officials strongly support this organization. At the December 2008 London energy meeting, later referenced in the G-20 Pittsburgh Summit leader's statement, the IEF was asked to prepare a report on the causes of oil price volatility and potential measures to deal with them, which would be considered at the next IEF energy minister's meeting in Cancun in March 2010. The IEF selected a group of experts who prepared a report in October that suggested the formalization of the IEF RIYADH 00001557 004 OF 004 secretariat. Saudi officials made it quite clear that they consider it critical that the U.S. remain involved in the IEF. They offered the U.S. a blank sheet of paper to suggest what the organization's goals should be. We strongly recommend that we take the Saudis up on this offer and provide specific suggestions reflecting our key priorities. Our constructive participation in this organization would demonstrate that we take seriously Saudi Arabia's long-term economic and political concerns, set a precedent for engagement on other USG priorities, and steer the IEF in a direction that better supports U.S. interests. Climate change -------------- 12. (SBU) Despite sharing similar interests in developing renewable energy and viable technological solutions to mitigate carbon emissions, such as Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS), the Saudi delegation has been very unhelpful in technical talks leading up to the Copenhagen summit. The delegation has insisted that no changes be made to the structure of the UNFCCC (UN framework convention on climate change) agreement, despite the fact that the underlying economic condition of a number of developing countries has changed since the agreement was drafted. Saudi delegates have insisted that any such change would represent a diminution of developed countries' commitment to help developing countries cope with the requirements of new technology. They also have pushed for some form of compensation for energy producers. Privately, Saudi officials have stressed their interest in capturing investment credits for clean development mechanisms in the Kingdom. They believe that no agreement can be reached without a U.S. commitment to cut emissions. Your visit offers an important opportunity to engage one of the leading Saudi decision-makers, Al-Naimi, on what the U.S. will be looking for in Copenhagen and beyond. Eastern Province merchants -------------------------- 13. (SBU) Several of the powerful business family groups that dominate the EP trace their origins to modest but industrious Saudi employees of Aramco, encouraged by their American managers to become private contractors in the late 1940s and 1950s. Many of the younger generations of these families have been educated in the U.S. These families often have informed and insightful views on a host of issues. The Consulate in Dhahran has arranged a dinner in your honor that will include several notable merchant families, which will give you a flavor of the commercial operating environment in this important part of the Kingdom. OPM-MOI ------- 14. (SBU) In May 2008, the Secretary of State and the Saudi Interior Minister signed an agreement creating the Office of Program Management - Ministry of Interior (OPM-MOI). OPM-MOI is a State-led interagency effort to assist the Saudi MOI with protection of critical infrastructure, including Aramco's petroleum production and transport facilities, which were the subject of a terrorist attack on the Abqaiq production facilities in Dhahran in 2004. OPM-MOI is developing projects in a number of areas, which will improve the security of Saudi Arabia's critical ports, electricity transmission lines and oil pipelines. OMP-MOI is also training a new 35,000-man Facilities Security Force, largely trained and equipped by DOD elements, which will protect key critical infrastructure sites throughout the Kingdom. The Ministry of Interior has invited you and your delegation to participate in the quarterly review, which will give you an up-to-date understanding of the project. MOI officials are very appreciative of DOE's very constructive role in this important, high-profile initiative.

Even that was a sixteenfold increase on 2009, when just one electric car was registered. Although the plan also includes subsidies for hybrid electric and petrol-driven cars, makers said they only planned to sell half a dozen of these in Spain this year, according to the ABC newspaper. That makes the stated goal of having 2,000 electric vehicles circulating by the end of this year almost unachievable. Next year's target had been to get 20,000 electric and hybrid cars on the road. The failed attempt to kickstart Spain's electric car market comes despite pledges of 80m euros of subsidies for those who buy by the end of next year – with the government funding 20% of the purchase, or up to 6,000 euros, on each car. The government-sponsored Wind Power and Electric Vehicles group tried to put a brave face on the situation. \"The figures are similar to what happened in their day to personal computers or mobile phones,\" it argued. \"The first models are expensive and with few extras and sales are slow. But somewhere around 2012 dozens of electric vehicles with lithium batteries and at a lower price will reach the market – and the recharging infrastructure will be in place.\" The group did not say it felt the target of 100,000 sales in 2014 looked impossible. Spain's lack of enthusiasm for electric cars emerged as austerity measures reduce the funding of other green projects. Solar-generated electricity \"farms\" are likely to be worst hit, with subsidies for new solar projects to be slashed by 25-45%. \"It is a real blow,\" said Juan Laso of the Photovoltaic Business Association. Solar farms blossomed across Spain until 2008 as special feed-in tariffs were so high that they guaranteed a 10% return on investment. Banks offered generous loans and a solar-power rush saw the sector damaged by corruption allegations. The government last month said it would inspect a quarter of Spain's solar energy plants, with officials saying that up to 15% of the 3bn euros paid to them last year were claimed fraudulently."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2010/dec/16/electricity-energy-reform","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-16T17:05:38Z","webTitle":"Electricity market reforms: two cheers | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2010/dec/16/electricity-energy-reform","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2010/dec/16/electricity-energy-reform","fields":{"headline":"Electricity market reforms: two cheers","bodyText":"Cost, reliability and carbon: those are the three crucial factors that must be considered in any analysis of a new energy policy, like the proposals on electricity market reform put forward today by the government. Cost naturally hits the headlines, with a £500 a year hike in household bills featuring prominently. The Department for Energy and Climate Change's (Decc) own estimate is a £160 a year rise in electricity bills by 2030, from an average of £500 today. A 32% rise over 20 years is little more than inflation. Decc also estimates that no change on policy would lead to slightly higher rises in bills. The higher headline figure touted by some appears to include gas bills – not part of today's proposals, and use what an Ofgem spokesman calls \"an extreme scenario\". But \"bills to rise by slightly less than otherwise\" is not much of headline. There are real concerns about the affordability of energy for the poorest in the UK, especially since Decc announced yesterday (without emailing the press release to journalists) that the £345m Warm Front scheme has now run out of money and won't take new applications till April. That's a political scandal, but not a reason to oppose the electricity market reform proposals. Lastly on cost, the £110bn of investment is a vast sum of money. But a good chunk of that is replacing the 25% of today's capacity that will have to be retired in the next decade - ie, we'd be spending it anyway. The balance is for the additional cost of low-carbon plants, though they will get cheaper as more are built, and new grid connections. And the £110bn isn't burned inside new power stations, it goes to the operators and suppliers, ie jobs, which are in short supply at the moment. On reliability, there's two sides: intermittency of supply and security of supply. Low-carbon electricity from wind and solar is more intermittent than fossil fuels but more secure. Russia can't refuse to allow the wind to blow over the UK. With investment in the grid, plus new nuclear power stations, the lights are not going to go out. The third factor is carbon. The new proposals set the UK on the right track to meet its legally binding targets on greenhouse gas emissions, and will help to UK play a responsible international role in combating global warming. If you are wondering why on earth the UK should cough up a bit extra for a low-carbon energy supply while the rest of the world happily smokes away, the answer is that the rest of the world is simply not doing that. Consider these recent stories from newspapers which can hardly be described as treehuggers: Financial Times China has surged ahead of the rest of the world in renewable energy, creating a \"new world order\" in the low-carbon sector. The rapid growth of Chinese investment has prompted venture capital and private equity companies in Europe to call for more regulation and greater government assistance, warning that without such help, the European economy will fall behind. The country's spending on wind energy in the second quarter of 2010 amounted to about $10bn, or about half of the global total of $20.5bn. Wall Street Journal: India is on track to add 1.1 gigawatt of grid-connected solar-power generation capacity by 2013, as part of its target to reach 20 gigawatt of solar power by 2022. The country has set an ambitious target for solar energy generation to help cut down carbon emissions, trim peak-hour power shortages and bring electricity to millions of rural households Lastly on carbon, these electricity market reforms are good but the government is failing badly in other areas, and we'll need every tool in the box to meet the UK's carbon targets. While Chris Huhne has grasped the need to enable investment in the UK's neglected energy infrastructure, he has failed to win the argument on the need for a fully functioning green investment bank (GIB) which can help provide that investment. Thanks to Treasury trolls, the GIB now seems doomed to be a feeble fund. The government's other major green policy – enabling loans for home energy-efficiency improvements that pay for themselves – remains reliant on trusting the big energy companies to eat their own lunches, and cut their customers' demand for energy. Another more technical but important problem is the U-turn that the government has performed since taking office on \"emissions performance standards\", ie the maximum carbon emissions that power stations will be allowed to emit. In opposition they promised to cap pollution a the level of a modern gas plant - about 300-400g of CO2 per kilowatt hour. In government, they are consulting on a level of between 450-600g CO2/kWh. So, overall, two cheers for the new proposals. • Note: My original post said the Warm Front announcement was made on Thursday, the same day as the electricity market proposals, and asked if it was a good day to bury bad news. In fact the press release I linked to was posted on Decc's website on Wednesday. No email was sent about it, whereas I got three about the electricity proposals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"/Public/apse-environment-financial-cuts-councils","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-06T11:10:10Z","webTitle":"A ray of hope","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com//Public/apse-environment-financial-cuts-councils","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com//Public/apse-environment-financial-cuts-councils","fields":{"headline":"A ray of hope","bodyText":"Councils are under pressure to save money and are also committed to tackling climate change. Fortunately many are finding ways of doing both simultaneously. The Association for Public Service Excellence (APSE) has 260 members from councils providing frontline services across the UK and we have been looking at ways in which public services can deliver efficiency savings in the face of huge budget cuts. We have been impressed by positive stories of financial as well as environmental benefits being delivered through projects to reduce energy use, carbon emissions and landfill. While local government's green initiatives are born out of a desire to do the best for communities and the planet, there is undeniably a budgetary imperative. With the looming comprehensive spending review (CSR) likely to mean 25% reductions in funding, councils can't risk penalties for failing to meet targets under the carbon reduction commitment, the national mandatory carbon trading scheme that came into effect in April. Nor can they incur additional charges under a Landfill Tax set to reach £80 per tonne by 2014. Best practice examples Just a dozen examples of green schemes cited in our recent briefing on maximizing economic and environmental performance have saved £1.6m a year and cut 2,700 tonnes of CO2 collectively. These best practice examples include Calderdale Council, which has converted 1,000 tonnes of leaf waste from street cleansing into compost used by its grounds maintenance staff – saving the authority £70k a year. Aberdeen City Council has reduced carbon emissions from its vehicles by 76% as a result of reprocessing used vegetable oils to produce biodiesel to run its fleet. The previous 33p per litre cost of collecting the waste oil has been saved and running the vehicles on biodiesel is 10p per litre cheaper. A1 Housing, which manages Bassetlaw District Council's homes, is installing renewable energy systems in 20% of its stock as a means of cutting both emissions and fuel bills. Ground source heat pumps, which use solar energy naturally stored in the ground, are reducing CO2 and an air source system currently being piloted is achieving 60% CO2 emissions savings and reducing tenants' fuel bills by up to £6 each week. The planned installation of wind turbines will also save on electricity bills by generating 25% of the energy required for A1's offices and maintenance depot. Staffordshire County Council's new gully waste treatment facility cut down on transport costs, diverted 432 tonnes of waste from landfill and generated carbon reduction savings of 34 tonnes in one year alone. Total cost savings of £60k have been identified as a result. Other authorities are finding inspiring ways of reducing the amount of energy they use, improving the energy efficiency of their buildings and turning their waste into a resource. As well as immediate financial benefits stemming from innovative green solutions locally, further national investment in environmentally friendly technologies and skills could make the UK more competitive internationally. Local government has a leading role to play in meeting environmental targets and continued investment in a green public sector infrastructure should be a foundation for lifting us beyond the current austerity. With a tough CSR round the corner, these approaches offer a glimmer of hope in showing how transforming services to make them more efficient and sustainable for the longer term offers a better way forward than simply slashing to the core public provision upon which we all rely.

As terms such as photovoltaic, solar fractions and low-e layers suffused the balmy Middle Eastern air, memories of remorseless boredom relieved only by an unfortunate incident with a Bunsen burner flooded back. Fortunately this latest lecture swiftly proved much more fun. Delivered inside a miniature football ground, it detailed how Qatar will harness carbon neutral solar energy to air-conditioned stadiums if it wins the race to host the 2022 World Cup. The technological wizardry is already virtually foolproof but, to a scientific dunce, the really exciting thing about such innovation is its potential geopolitical and historical impact. If the 40C June heat no longer presents an insurmountable barrier, a key excuse for failing to award the Middle East a World Cup is removed. And, as everyone I spoke to said: \"Qatar winning this would be about far more than just football.\" An unprecedented opportunity awaits to forge fresh, enhanced understanding with the Arab world. This chance to deconstruct some tired preconceptions about Muslim mindsets should not be shunned lightly. With a successful tournament serving as a highly effective slap in the face of extremism, Islamic fundamentalists could even be in for some overdue marginalisation.Admittedly passports bearing Israeli stamps do not exactly go down a storm in the Gulf but Qataris are adamant that, were Israel to qualify, they and their supporters would receive warm welcomes. It is surely not impossible that greater regional rapprochement could be achieved through impromptu political talking shops convened alongside the football fields of Doha than during countless conventional conferences in Washington, Jerusalem or Sharm el-Sheikh. Not that the game's international showpiece would be a sideshow. Whether wearing sparkling white dishdashas, the hijab or the latest, tightest, western fashions, the Qataris who packed the Khalifa Stadium to 50,000 capacity for last Wednesday's Brazil v Argentina friendly certainly thrilled to Lionel Messi's brilliant late winner. If their enthusiasm served as a reminder that no Arab country has staged a World Cup, the number of Anglo-Saxon footballers who take regular June holidays in Dubai suggests Qatar's scorching summer heat is far from a deal breaker. Particularly as not only stadiums but training grounds and fan facilities would be air-conditioned and the security and convenience peerless. Liberated from the hassle of constantly changing hotel rooms and draining cross country travel, those attending a largely Doha-centric tournament featuring all 12 stadiums within close proximity could attend three matches a day. In-between games, fabulous beach-front hotels, ancient souks, modern shopping malls and the capital's excellent Museum of Islamic Arts should provide high calibre relaxation. Slightly more adventurous types might visit the Al Maha sanctuary, home of the rare Arabian oryx, before camping among desert dunes. With crime nearly nonexistent, Qatar is also very safe, which mattered to a lone woman traversing Doha during the early hours following an overnight flight last week that mattered. Many football fans appreciate similar reassurance. Most northern European supporters also seek alcohol. Although alcohol is rarely available outside hotels – addressing a partly indigenous audience in the Gulf last week Sir Alex Ferguson received distinctly puzzled looks when he blithely reflected: \"You'll have all played for Sunday pub teams\" – restrictions on its consumption would, crucially, be lifted inside all-singing, all-dancing, FanZones. If Manchester United's manager should have known that Friday is the Islamic Sunday, at least Ferguson grasped the bigger picture. Describing Qatar 2022's potential legacy as \"a winner\" he predicted the World Cup magic would endure long after the last empties had been recycled and the final departing fan had carried their toy camel safely through customs. Thanks to an inspired piece of Qatari altruism, an entire air-conditioned stadium would be dismantled and exported to a poor, hot country, for reconstruction, with further chunks of other grounds, most notably seats, distributed to other needy developing nations. At a moment when several of this country's leading commentators are seriously suggesting that the late, eye-catching, introduction of a fresh pair of legs – belonging to brand new royal fiancee Kate Middleton – could somehow revitalise England's 2018 bid such long term strategic thinking looks enviably innovative. With Fifa obsessive about legacy Ferguson believes it is also eminently capable of sparking pan-Arab celebrations on 2 December when the 2018 and 2022 venues are revealed. \"Qatar have got the finances and the purpose,\" he said. \"But, above all, they've got the vision.\" A little earlier the Scot had explained how his initially eyebrow-raising importation of Eric Cantona's on-field prescience sparked the modern day Old Trafford glory era while also securing personal immortality in United's managerial pantheon. Mustering the bravery to hand Qatar 2022 might yet enable Fifa to gift the world a Cantona moment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"global-development/poverty-matters/2011/apr/01/citizens-make-development-happen","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-01T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"How citizens can make development happen | Madeleine Bunting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/apr/01/citizens-make-development-happen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/apr/01/citizens-make-development-happen","fields":{"headline":"How citizens can make development happen","bodyText":"The future of development lies in the hands of millions of citizens. It's a bold statement by Rakesh Rajani, founder of Twaweza, who was in London for the debate on the future of aid organised by the Overseas Development Institute. Only two years old, Twaweza, which means \"we can make it happen\" in Swahili, is attempting to do just that across three east African countries, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. Rajani's strategy is to spread information, believing that crucial to the process of development is access to ideas. Twaweza focuses on what it believes are the five main routes for people to hear new ideas in the region: religion; mobile phones; mass media, in particular radio; fast-moving consumer goods; and teachers. Twaweza builds partnerships in all these areas to spread ideas, draw in new voices and open up conversations. It works rather like a venture fund, initiating ideas and getting new organisations off the ground. Rajani cites Amartya Sen's comment that poverty is not about a lack of money, but about a lack of options. His aim is to find new ways to intervene in people's lives to widen their options. If this sounds vague, how it gets translated into action on specific policy issues is very concrete. Take for example the issue of education. Rajani points out that the Tanzanian schools budget has increased threefold, but there was concern the money wasn't actually getting to the schools themselves. One part of the government's education budget is paid through a capitation fee per child. A Twaweza affiliate, HakiElimu, conducted a sample survey of 50 schools across 14 regions by mobile phone, and was able to publish within a month that only 7% of schools were receiving any of their capitation fee. The survey results were released to the media and published on Facebook. Within a few weeks, the government was taking action to improve and speed up the distribution of funds to schools. This is what Rajani describes as empowering citizens to take action. HakiElimu (Rajani was one of its co-founders in 2001) has recruited a network of 34,000 \"friends of education\" who can be contacted by email and mobile phone. For the first time, on the ground monitoring of schools is possible. Given that one of the biggest problems in education in sub-Saharan Africa is that teachers don't turn up to work, citizen empowerment could make all the difference in ensuring the education system works better. Twaweza is rather like an umbrella organisation, and the work it supports and facilitates is hugely diverse. It has helped a new venture, Daraja, to get off the ground. Daraja aims to make local government more accountable to citizens in rural Tanzania, and has piloted a project in three districts enabling people to report through SMS that their well or water source is not working. Daraja collates the information and sends it to the district water engineer. Every month it produces reports and league tables for districts, which it then sends higher up in the government. It also releases the information to the media and on Facebook. It has proved very effective at \"concentrating the mind\" comments Rajani wryly. Twaweza's role is facilitator, linking bright new social entrepreneurs with the technology companies that might be able to help, as well as potential donors and other innovators working on similar ideas across the world. Rajani is not interested in small, niche ideas. \"We want to engage citizens in their millions,\" he says – and they are constantly looking for new ways to do it. \"We did a deal with the company who produces children's school exercise books in Tanzania, and they have now printed on the inside cover of the books a simple test which parents can do to check on their children's progress. So far, 50 million books now have this test. \"We've produced booklets which tell a story incorporating a theme – for example, on solar energy or governance – and these are distributed alongside basic cooking materials, such as cooking oil, by consumer goods companies. So far we have distributed 700,000 of them in this series of stories which change the world. It's about how you get women engaged and get information out.\" Another initiative involves working with bishops to produce a guide on citizen engagement, which is going out to Bible study groups. Twaweza in Kenya has worked with Catholic bishops on a Lenten guide on the same subject. Rajani is passionate about the crucial role of religious institutions in the region. They have a capacity to reach and engage people, and help bring about change. Yet another initiative developed short, story-based films for television that used humour to explore issues of class and access to education. The films became hugely popular and have provoked plenty of debate. The approach may seem scattergun – firing initiatives in different directions – but Rajani's argument is that information and ideas are a kind of ecology, and carefully aimed interventions at different points can have a catalytic impact. Alongside this experimental and flexible approach, Twaweza has a rigorous evaluation policy. It wants to know what works and why. Some initiatives will fail, admits Rajani, but failure is a crucial part of learning. What he wants to avoid is the distortion of much development in which claims to success – spin – are rewarded with more funding, and effectively incentivised. At the heart of Rajani's approach is the belief that governments will do the right thing when there is sufficient pressure. The failure of governance in many parts of Africa has been the lack of that effective pressure, but that is fast changing. The proportion of people connected to the internet in east Africa may be low compared with the rest of the world, but it is now the fastest growing. Internet connections through mobiles is booming. In Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda the big phone operators have all signed deals to give free access to Facebook, and the impact will transform the region, providing users with the equivalent of 100 free emails a day. \"Within five years, the majority of people will have direct or indirect access to the internet across east Africa,\" says Rajani. There are plenty of new ideas in the pipeline for Twaweza. The next big area Rajani wants to move into is health. One of the biggest problems in the developing world is whether medicines get through to the clinics and whether health workers actually turn up to their jobs. At the moment, Tanzania is building a lot of infrastructure in clinics and hospitals, but it has been estimated that less than half the jobs are filled – and of those nominally filled, many employees don't turn up. One of the most intriguing aspects of Twaweza is that from the outset it has aimed to be regional rather than national. Africa has been plagued by poor communications between countries, and this is part of a growing impetus behind closer regional co-operation. For Rajani it is surfing a wave of increased cross-border engagement. Countries are tackling similar problems and can learn from one another – and be spurred by competition into greater effort. Rajani points to the fact that new research data from Uwezo – another Twaweza affiliate – which monitors educational achievement, shows that the bottom quintile of children in Kenya are performing better than the top quintile in Tanzania. When the research is published, he is hoping it will stir a debate in Tanzania about what it can do to improve educational standards. But Rajani is not sure it will. He believes there is still a deferential culture towards the government, and people don't have that sense of agency that something could – and should – be changed. That sense of entitlement that government services can and should work, is what Rajani is trying to provoke. It is basic to the way western democracies work, so it's hard to appreciate how its absence shapes a political culture. But Rajani hopes this is finally changing, and that a new generation will use the contemporary technologies of communication to transform how countries are governed and public services delivered."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2011/may/23/debbie-harry-blondie-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2011-05-23T20:31:00Z","webTitle":"Debbie Harry: 'I'm sort of a cult figure'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/23/debbie-harry-blondie-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2011/may/23/debbie-harry-blondie-interview","fields":{"headline":"Debbie Harry: 'I'm sort of a cult figure'","bodyText":"Debbie Harry has a reputation for being a prickly interviewee – terse and aloof when she's not in the mood. At 65, and after nearly 40 years in the music business, this is probably her prerogative. When Sunday Times journalist Lynn Barber interviewed her a few months ago, she got so many one-word answers she was reduced to describing Harry as \"a plump granny\" – probably the first time one of American pop's great icons has been likened to a grandmother. Technically, she is old enough, but the Harry who enters the restaurant of a London riverside hotel, carrying a bowl of fruit salad she started eating upstairs in her room, isn't grannyish by any stretch. She's wearing a clash of orange blouse, blue satin necktie, lace-up boxer's boots, candyfloss platinum hair, with – the only visible concession to age – a pince-nez on a chain around her neck. Given her sex, drugs and rock'n'roll lifestyle in the 70s, the years have left a light imprint. \"I don't know if I ever thought I'd live to be 65,\" she says wryly, then changes her mind. \"I thought I'd live to a ripe old age, because I always felt there was a lot to do. I had a driven feeling. I always thought in the present.\" Her speaking voice is like her singing voice, surprisingly youthful and airy, and despite the early start, Harry is in a talkative mood. The first new Blondie album since 2003 is out this month, and after eight years spent doing this and that – a solo album, jazz gigs, an Aids campaign – the singer seems more than ready to reacquaint herself with the fuss Blondie still generate. And the fuss is considerable. When Harry appeared on Desert Island Discs at the weekend, Kirsty Young told her: \"It's a strange feeling to be sitting opposite an icon. When I was younger, I wasted 10 years wanting to be Debbie Harry.\" As did many other women who first encountered her in Blondie's late-70s heyday: a raving beauty, terrifically stylish, artfully appropriating both punk and vintage. Put this together with Blondie's mix of 60s girl-pop and New Wave up-yours attitude, and Harry was irresistible; the album generally deemed the band's best, 1978's Parallel Lines, produced five hit singles, including the worldwide No 1 Heart of Glass. \"We were pounding along, muddling along, trying to build a reputation and repertoire,\" is how Harry remembers those early days now. \"Our first real paying gig was in Central Park on New Year's Eve, 1976. We got the princely sum of $500.\" Still, how does it feel to be an icon? American rock photographer Bob Gruen recently described Harry as \"the Marilyn Monroe of her generation\". \"Iconic?\" she echoes. \"I guess so. But the word 'iconic' is used too frequently – an icon is a statue carved in wood. It was shocking at first, when I got that reference. It was a responsibility, and it's impossible to live up to – you're supposed to be dead, for one thing.\" By her own estimation, Harry isn't famous enough to be an icon: \"I'm still sort of a cult figure. I'm not J-Lo, I'm not in the gossip mags and USA Today. Sometimes I'm in the New York Post.\" Yet if Harry hadn't existed, neither, arguably, would Madonna, or Lady Gaga, whose chart-pop is similarly loaded with ideas about image, art and sexuality. So she is right about the responsibility that goes with her status – people have expectations. She does her best to meet them: later that day, at an album launch party, she gives a lesson in what it means to give good \"presence\". At one end of the room there is a surrealist painting by Dutch artist Chris Berens, blown up to 8ft high, also the cover of Blondie's new album, Panic of Girls. After keeping an industry crowd waiting for an hour, Harry is shepherded in by her publicist, then steps in front of the splashy picture and simply stands alone, motionless, as the room goes silent. It could look ridiculous – small blonde lady hanging around in front of big painting – but it's not. She emanates charisma. Jersey girl v New York hipster Taking a small, catlike bite of tropical fruit, Harry says: \"We wanted to do a new album all along. I don't want our 70s stuff to be 'it'.\" Which is entirely understandable: making a new record that matched Blondie's epochal 70s ones would be a tall order for anyone, let alone a band now comprising only three original members – Harry, her ex-boyfriend and guitarist Chris Stein and drummer Clem Burke. Instead, they've done the next best thing: Panic of Girls is a catchy, modern set that's recognisably Blondie, only with 21st-century electronic textures. Currently without a record label (as are many veteran acts, casualties of corporate budget cutting), the band have struck a deal whereby the album will initially be available with a special Blondie-themed edition of Classic Rock magazine, before a full release in July. In so doing, the band are pitching themselves directly to longtime fans rather than those who have yet to discover them – ironic, given that during recording Harry was adamant the new album should sound \"current\". The result, produced by Killers/My Chemical Romance producers Kato Khandwala and Jeff Saltzman, meets that criterion: the guitars have been mixed down, the keyboards have been brought to the forefront, and the whole thing gussied up with a modish electro-shimmer. \"I don't want to be like the Temptations, kicking my legs out,\" Harry says, swinging one leg up to simulate a synchronised dance routine. She seems to mean she doesn't want Blondie to become some kind of supper-club revival act, although she adds: \"We tried to make a classic Blondie album.\" How would she define that? \"We've always been concerned about producing good songs, and Chris and Matt [Katz-Bohen, the band's current keyboardist] are prolific songwriters [Harry is co-credited on six out of 11 tracks]. Our lyrics have sociological things in them, mixed up with romantic ideas and New York City hipness. We're inspired by film, TV . . . early on, we were inspired by comics, fantasy, science fiction.\" She has said this, or something like it, many times before; even 40 years on, she seems captivated by New York's hipster lifestyle. Does she get involved in production? \"Not too tremendously. I don't like sitting in the studio and hearing a song 10,000 times.\" Harry says she still thinks of herself as \"ultimately just a Jersey girl,\" despite having left New Jersey for Manhattan in the mid-60s. But there's not much Jersey in Panic of Girls – it's a city record, with its slick dance sound and tongue-in-cheek covers of Sophia George's 1985 reggae hit Girlie Girlie and Beirut's indie-folk A Sunday Smile. \"What's-his-name [Beirut's Zach Condon] came in and played trumpet on it,\" she says. While Condon may not take \"what's-his-name\" as a compliment, she mentions it because she says she enjoys working with new artists; she also recorded a track, Live Alone, with Franz Ferdinand for their recently released Covers EP. Nothing on the album says New York more than Harry's favourite song, Mother. While it has been interpreted as a kind of letter to her birth mother, who put her up for adoption when she was only a few months old, she maintains it was inspired by an underground Manhattan club that was one of her regular haunts in the 90s. \"I think it's one of my best lyrics ever. It was about a club called Mother that I used to go to. It sums up my feelings about the place. It has underlying feelings about searching for motherhood, but I don't necessarily apply it to me.\" Though it certainly sounds like more than just a tribute to NYC nightlife (\"Mother in the night, where are you? I'm calling you/ Mother's left the building, we're the abandoned children\"), she insists: \"It's not about my own mom. I'm certainly not searching for my mother at this stage. If there is that [meaning], it's subliminal for me.\" 'I'd be a really good mother' Harry was brought up by shop owners Richard and Catherine Harry, but did track down her birth mother in the late 80s. She did not want a relationship with her daughter. \"But by then, I didn't need that information anyway. I was already successful with Blondie,\" she told Kirsty Young, though you wonder if she's really as indifferent as all that. Does she regret not having had children of her own? \"Sometimes. I've thought of adoption, which I think I'd be really good at. Now that this terrible [earthquake] has happened in Japan, there will be a lot of children needing homes. I spread myself around a lot of causes,\" she goes on. \"I'm concerned about the environment and clean water, and being carbon-free. I also support diabetes [research].\" Maybe she should set up a charitable Debbie Harry foundation, I say. The suggestion intrigues her: \"If I were to do a foundation, it would be to promote solar energy. And I'm worried about drilling for oil. I think it is harming the earth, 'cos it drains the layer of oil under the surface, and that could be causing earthquakes. It's like we're giving the earth arthritis.\" She smiles sheepishly. \"I don't know if that sounds crazy.\" A bit daffy, perhaps, but who knows, she could be right. One day she'll write a song about it. • Extra members – For a chance to win a signed leather jacket or a Blondie fan pack featuring the new album, go to theguardian.com/extra/blondie.

Where most \"green\" celebrities have done little more than chosen a hybrid car or turned down the thermostat, here's one who both knows his stuff and walks the walk – and is hilarious to boot. McGowan isn't exactly short of things to do. Best known as an impressionist and comedian, he's also a playwright, actor and singer. But despite his busy schedule, over the past two decades he's always found time to campaign on environmental issues – and to try and reduce the impact of his own lifestyle. His latest cause is solar energy, and in particular We Support Solar, the campaign to stop the government cutting back on financial subsidies for solar photovoltaic systems. So what is it about this particular energy technology that gets McGowan so fired up? Speaking on his way to visit a new solar roof on a Surrey school, he explains that, in his view, solar power is a no-brainer. \"The idea of being able to harness the sun's energy and power everything we need from it is so amazing, and we now have the technology to do that. [But] other countries are way ahead of us, and I just can't believe that we're not committing to it and engaging with it in the way that we should be.\" He's talking about the shake-up of the feed-in tariffs, the government scheme that promotes renewable energy systems by rewarding their owners for each unit of electricity produced. As part of an recently announced review, the government is consulting on a plan to reduce the level of support for solar systems larger than 50kW, a change that would disadvantage the larger end of solar projects for schools, hospitals and community groups. In McGowan's view, this is an outrage. \"The whole industry is being undermined by government action. Here we are with a government that said in their manifesto that they were going to be the greenest government, but the only green thing about them is the splash of colour on their logo, as far as I can see.\" Are generous feed-in tariffs really so important for solar to succeed? \"Absolutely. Whether you're talking small scale or large scale, one of the things that attracts people – and attracted me when I recently had solar panels fitted on my house – is the fact that you're going to get your money back. You obviously want to do something which is going to benefit the environment … it's fabulous to feel like you're a cottage industry … not just denuding and drawing from the environment, but giving something back … But the financial aspect is important to people – you've got to attract customers, you've got to attract investors, and the feed-in tariff is a huge huge part of that.\" That's a view shared by most green commentators, but there are exceptions. What about the claim by George Monbiot and some others that solar is too expensive and inefficient to make it worth supporting in a cloudy country like the UK? \"Twenty years ago, 30 years ago, videos were expensive\", McGowan replies. \"Last year Kindles were expensive. As soon as there's a demand, things come down in price, and that's what will happen and has happened already with solar. Across Europe, it's being embraced, and obviously we think, well, Spain, that makes sense because they've got a lot of sunshine. It's not about sunshine, it's about daylight … and there's more than enough in this country to make solar viable. One of the leading countries in the whole solar industry is Germany. Their climate is exactly the same as ours, and yet we are, I think, at 0.1% of the take up of solar compared to Germany – 0.1%! – which is absolutely shameful.\" Worrying too much about today's cost, says McGowan, is to miss the point. \"It would be like the government in the 19th century saying no, we're not going to put railways down, everyone else can do that but we don't see the point. Or in the 1950s the government saying we don't want to build roads and motorways, we just don't think it's important … it really is head in the sand stuff.\" So, a clear thumbs down for the coalition. Does McGowan think that Ed Miliband's Labour party would be any more ambitious on green issues? \"It's very hard to say\", he replies, switching with unnerving ease into Miliband's nasal twang (the first of many vignettes he drops into our conversation). He does admire Miliband, he says, but it's always easier to look good in opposition than in power. Politicians needs to be more brave, he says – and that's something they could learn by taking some leaves out of Ken Livingstone's book. It strikes me that McGowan himself is being quite brave by taking such a strong position on environmental issues. Over the years he's worked to raise awareness for WWF, the charity Trees for Cities, recycling, driving, flying, climate change. Does he worry that he might fall into the trap that some other celebrities have, of flying the green flag only to find himself shot down in the press for the eco-imperfections in his own life? \"A little, yes, because there's always something I'm being made aware of – as we all are – that has a huge impact on the environment. Once I become aware of things I try and adjust my behaviour accordingly. Meat, for instance. For many years I went around talking about recycling, reducing car use, and not flying as much, and then suddenly people were saying that one of the worst things for the environment is meat production. Now, I cannot give up meat, but I have tried to significantly cut down. And so in that respect I'm someone who realises how difficult it is to change ingrained behaviour completely. But we can all make some sort of effort.\" One area that many green celebrities really struggle with is flying. Changing one's car is evidently easier than giving up a glamorous jet-setting lifestyle. But in this respect, too, McGowan is unusual. He doesn't just limit his own flying; he was also one of the people who bought a strip of land in Sipson, near Heathrow, to try and block the proposed development of the airport. \"Yes, after we bought the land – I hadn't flown much anyway, but I didn't fly then for three years, and looked into every holiday or job I had in terms of trains and boats. And it's really enjoyable actually to not fly. I think airports are one of the most sad experiences of your life.\" (He adds in passing that airports are what he worries heaven might be like: \"Terribly disappointing, with lots of people from Leicester wondering around not knowing where they're going.\") \"I still had lots of holidays,\" he continues, \"I went to places like Dubrovnik, Vienna and southern Spain on trains and boats, and it's a really enjoyable experience. It becomes part of the holiday. You feel sort of Edwardian, and become really intrepid.\" When McGowan did finally have to travel by air – for a filming trip in South Africa – he found that he \"hated the experience of flying. The whole trip didn't feel like I'd been anywhere – that horrible thing where you're picked up and put somewhere else. But again, I would say that it's impossible to live a completely green life: you can't not have any kind of environmental footprint, but you can make it as faint as you can. Fly when necessary but not all the time.\" McGowan uses travel as a jumping off point for an impromptu comedy routine involving Andy Murray's flying footprint, the potential for Jason Button and Lewis Hamilton to car share, and a series of scarily good impressions of football names such as Rio Ferdinand, Carlo Ancelotti (\"he is, urr, green man, but also blue man\") and his old favourite David Beckham (who McGowan suggests should show the same leadership on environmental issues as he has done on tattoos). It's spooky to watch his whole face morph into those of his characters. McGowan is a football addict, and once tried to combine his two passions by creating the green version of the Premier League, ranking clubs on their environmental standards. He met with the FA about it but the plan was scuppered by the Premier League's branding restrictions. \"But I did persuade Wimbledon tennis club to improve their recycling,\" McGowan says proudly, \"and I pushed the RSC to recycle at Stratford. Wherever I go I make a noise, which I think is the important thing – try to make a noise wherever you are.\" All of which is hugely impressive. But can any of it really make any difference in the broader scheme of things? I wonder whether McGowan, who recently researched his family links in India, ever worries that British impressionists, footballers or even politicians can only tinker around the edges of environmental problems when countries such as China and India are growing so fast. Can Brits really have an impact? \"Yeah, we're one world … the success of one nation's investment in environmental best practice has to then be copied and taken on. If we can see that it works, which [solar] does in Germany, if India and China can see that it would work here, they will embrace it\". \"People are always looking for an excuse not to be part of this greener future\", he adds. \"First of all it was America: why should we do it if George Bush doesn't? Now it's China and India … but we shouldn't forget that the Chinese and the Indians are looking to develop many of their industries in a very environmentally friendly way. And they're going to outdo us soon. Yes, they're building coal-fired power stations, and yes that is a mistake … but they're also looking at the long-term and thinking how can we develop in a more environmentally friendly way. They're going to outstrip us very very soon – as everyone has done.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/aug/31/bjorn-lomborg-climate-fund","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-31T15:01:54Z","webTitle":"Green groups cautiously welcome Bjørn Lomborg's call for $100bn climate fund","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/aug/31/bjorn-lomborg-climate-fund","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/aug/31/bjorn-lomborg-climate-fund","fields":{"headline":"Green groups cautiously welcome Bjørn Lomborg's call for $100bn climate fund","bodyText":"Self-styled \"sceptical environmentalist\" Bjørn Lomborg's call for a $100bn a year global fund for research into climate change solutions was today given a cautious welcome by some leading green groups and thinktanks, but was dismissed by others as politically naive. A Greenpeace spokesperson welcomed the conversion but said it had come two decades too late for Lomborg to be taken seriously. \"At least it confirms the happy maxim that nobody's wrong all the time, apart from Melanie Phillips at the Daily Mail,\" the spokesperson added. \"It appears that the self-styled sceptical environmentalist is beginning to become less sceptical as he enters middle-age,\" said Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Mike Childs, adding that Lomborg's volte face would come as a \"blow to some in the climate sceptics community\". The controversial Danish statistician, who has never denied man's role in global warming but who has provided an intellectual cover for hard-line climate sceptics, has previously argued that countering climate change should be a low priority for governments. But in his new book Smart Solutions to Climate Change he argues that it should now be addressed \"as a priority\". \"Lomborg has acknowledged the need for public spending on man-made climate change. He is right that wind, wave and solar are the energy industries in the future and need much greater support from governments. A carbon tax to raise funds is undoubtedly part of the solution, but regulation and public spending also have their place,\" said Childs. \"But he is still dangerously attracted to pursuing the cheapest, more risky geo-engineering solutions, is putting too much faith in future technologies and R&amp;D, and is not giving enough support to the urgent need to reduce current emissions through rapid deployment of existing solutions and behavioural changes.\" Instead of being near the bottom of actions governments should take, as Lomborg argued in 2004, his new book proposes a global carbon tax to raise around $250bn a year to fight the effects of rising temperatures and sea levels. The money would be divided between clean energy research and development ($100bn); low cost geo-engineering solutions such as reflecting solar energy back into space ($1bn); and adaptation to the effects of climate change ($50bn). He further suggests $99bn of the $250bn should be held back to spend on traditional development activities such as clean water and better healthcare in poor countries. Benny Peiser, director of the free market climate change thinktank Global Warming Policy Foundation said his proposals were more sensible than what those being negotiated at the ongoing UN climate talks which are expected to continue into 2011. \"I am not surprised. He's been saying more or less the same for years. The [UN] process is not working at all. This is better and more realistic. His proposals are much more sensible than any attempts to convince China and India to stop emitting,\" he said. Lomborg's proposals are surprisingly close to those favoured by the governments of industrialised countries who have accepted that $100bn a year should be made available to poor countries to adapt and that there should be a heavy emphasis on research into clean energy. However, the idea of a carbon tax has proved politically unacceptable for many years partly because it is thought to penalise poor countries which depend more on carbon-intensive goods. \"We would agree that at least $250bn should be raised a year to counter climate change,\" said one developing country analyst who asked not to be named. \"But Lomborg seems to be saying that proportionately less money should go to developing countries and more to develop western technology. This looks like being totally unacceptable to most of the world.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2012/apr/29/singularity-university-technology-future-thinkers","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2012-04-28T23:03:03Z","webTitle":"Singularity University: meet the people who are building our future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/29/singularity-university-technology-future-thinkers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2012/apr/29/singularity-university-technology-future-thinkers","fields":{"headline":"Singularity University: meet the people who are building our future","bodyText":"It's day one at the Singularity University: the opening address has just been delivered by a hologram. Craig Venter, who was one of the first scientists to sequence the human genome and created the first synthetic life form, is up next. And later, we will see two people, paralysed from the waist down, use robotic exoskeletons to rise up and walk. But first, the co-founder of the Singularity University, Peter Diamandis, gives us our instructions for the day. Your task, he says, is to pick one of the \"grand challenges of humanity\" – the lack of clean drinking water, say. And then come up with an idea that \"can positively impact the lives of a billion people\". It's 9.30 in the morning. Some of us haven't even had coffee yet. There's about 50 of us present and the room has been divided up into tables, one for education, another for poverty, another for water, and I'm not sure where I should sit. Diane Murphy, the university's PR executive, hesitates for a moment and then directs me over to the table marked \"food\". \"Tell you what,\" she says. \"Why don't you take Ashton Kutcher's chair over there. He's not coming until later.\" (When he does arrive, he pulls up a chair at the next table over. What can I say? If Ashton Kutcher fails to solve global hunger, it will be my fault.) The Singularity University is really not much like a regular university. And not just because it's a place that manages to accommodate the likes of both Venter and Kutcher (and where, during a Q&amp;A session, somebody asks a question about taking the Singularity University into the ghetto, and it turns out to be from the musician will.i.am). Its courses aren't accredited, and it has no undergraduates. Stanford University might have been the cradle for a hundred Silicon Valley startups and the hothouse for some of its greatest technical innovations, but the Singularity University is an institution that has been made in the valley's own image: highly networked, fuelled by a cocktail of philanthro-capitalism and endowed with an almost mystical sense of its own destiny. It is both Silicon Valley's elite future thinktank and its global outreach arm: Google and Microsoft both came to the founding conference and gave money, Nasa provided the campus space, and emblazoned across the website is a quote from Google's co-founder, Larry Page: \"If I was a student,\" he says, \"this is where I'd want to be.\" Its aim is \"to assemble, educate and inspire a new generation of leaders who strive to understand and utilise exponentially advancing technologies to address humanity's grand challenges\". So, no pressure then. Although, of course, the easiest thing would simply to be British about all this and scoff. Ashton Kutcher! (I read later that he's been cast to play Steve Jobs in a forthcoming film and slightly suspect that he thinks he might actually be Steve Jobs.) A billion people! It's the kind of thing you can imagine someone in a white coat writing down as evidence just before they decide to commit you. What's more, Diamandis is the kind of can-do entrepreneur that, as a nation, we're inclined to lampoon and shun. (He's good friends with Richard Branson.) The only problem with this as a strategy is that half the people in the room actually have done things which have had a positive impact on a billion people. Or, in some cases, more. Not just Venter, who has flown in on his private jet; there's also Vint Cerf, who is considered one of the fathers of the internet – he worked on Arpanet, the internet's predecessor – and is now \"chief internet evangelist\" at Google. And Sebastian Thrun, the man behind one of Google's latest and potentially most disruptive technologies yet, the self-driving car. He's also the head of the top-secret Google X lab, part of the firm that most employees didn't even know existed until the New York Times ran a piece on it last November. And then, there's Elon Musk, the co-founder of PayPal and Tesla Motors, who created the world's first electric car, and is working on a replacement for the space shuttle. In the audience is Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn. And Troy Carter, Lady Gaga's strategist. Later in the day, Buzz Aldrin shows up. He is, in this company, a genuine celebrity. All the scientists want to have their photo taken with him, and even Kutcher has the good grace to look a bit bashful. \"What do you make of the Singularity University?\" I ask Aldrin. \"I'm a pretty high achiever,\" he says. \"But I come here and think 'Gosh. I've just got to do better.'\" Star factor Aldrin's lack of achievement notwithstanding – second man to walk on the moon, 66 missions flown in the Korean war, one-time duetter with Snoop Dogg – he has a point. The Singularity University's USP and founding ideology is based on doing better. Its belief in progress is so hard-wired that at times it has a retro-futuristic 1950s flying-cars-and-rocket-packs air about it. Even the name – the Singularity University – sounds like something out of a sci-fi novel. Largely because its name is something out of a sci-fi novel. \"The Singularity\" is a term that its co-founder, the writer and futurist Ray Kurzweil, appropriated from an essay by sci-fi writer Vernor Vinge, and although definitions vary, it's usually taken to mean the point at which computer intelligence surpasses human intelligence. Which, according to Kurzweil's predictions, and he does have some form on this, will be in 2029. Kurzweil is a genuine one-off. He's a scientist, an inventor – he developed one of the first speech recognition systems – an author and a transhumanist: he believes that if he can stay alive long enough for the technology to be invented he'll be able to stay alive for ever. But what he's best known for is being a futurist. He predicted the break-up of the Soviet Union, the growth of the internet, the year in which computers would beat the best human chess players, the e-reader, online education, and dozens more. By his own count 89 of 108 predictions he made in 1999 about where the world would be in 2009 were correct, and another 13 were \"essentially correct\". At the heart of all of Kurzweil's predictions is Moore's law. This is the rule that computing power doubles every two years, first noted by Gordon Moore, who went on to co-found Intel, in 1965, and who predicted the trend would continue \"for at least 10 years\". In fact, it continued for the next five decades, and there's still no end in sight. Computing power shows exponential growth: one becomes two, and two becomes four, and four becomes eight, and when plotted on a chart, it looks like a rocket taking off. Of course, it's one thing to note this about semiconductors, and another to apply it to all other areas of human life, but if you plotted the career path, business plan, and personal wealth of a significant number of people in the room, there would be an awful lot of rocket-shaped lines. Because Moore's law does seem to describe a lot of what's happened in Silicon Valley. And it's really not that surprising, therefore, that some of its wealthiest and most successful inhabitants have bought into the Singularity University's guiding ethos and spirit. Vint Cerf tells me that it was Larry Page's enthusiasm and support for the project that encouraged him to get involved \"and then I came and discovered that there were these stunningly smart people here, both speaking and in the audience. I find coming here like walking through a forest of ideas.\" The standard programme at the Singularity University is a 10-week graduate course which costs $25,000 (£15,500) and last year had 2,400 people applying for 80 slots. It's the Silicon Valley version of an MBA. And demand is such that it has also started doing mini \"executive\" courses, of the type that I attend. \"Billion-dollar companies are springing up overnight,\" says Peter Diamandis. \"And billion-dollar companies are folding overnight.\" Or as Mike Federle, the chief operating officer of Forbes tells me: \"CEOs are desperate to know this stuff. Everyone's trying to figure out what's coming next.\" What's more, instead of being held in the Singularity University's campus at Nasa's Ames research centre in northern California, we're in the heart of the Hollywood dream machine, at Fox Studios in Los Angeles. Jim Gianopulos, the chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, went on a Singularity University course, and has since become evangelical about it. Given the traditional antipathy between Hollywood and Silicon Valley (intellectual copyright versus a great big copying machine), this feels like something of a milestone. These ideas are tipping over in the mainstream: Peter Diamandis's book – Abundance: The Future is Better Than You Think – went straight into the New York Times bestseller list at No 2 last month and is still lingering in the top 30. \"The power of computers per dollar has increased trillionsfold since I was at college,\" Kurzweil says in his opening address, speaking as a 3D holographic head projected into the room from his home in Boston. \"And war, depression, nothing makes an impact. It keeps on increasing exponentially.\" Health used to make linear progress, but \"it has become an exponential technology\". And with 3D printing, so will \"the world of physical things\". Our problem with pondering the future is that our expectation is \"linear, not exponential,\" he says. Things aren't going to change incrementally, they're going to change explosively. And it was this that captured Peter Diamandis's attention – he read Kurzweil's book, The Singularity is Near, while trekking in Chile – and inspired him to set up the university. At the end of the first session of talks, he tells us to \"caucus\" among ourselves and come up with some solutions for our \"grand challenge\". And then, oh dear God, \"one of you will report back on your findings to the rest of the class\". There's seven of us at our table. And the idea is that between us, we're supposed to come up with a solution – or, let's not be unambitious here, solutions – to feeding the world's seven billion people. What would Ashton say, I wonder? Although my assumption is that it'll be a bit like when Mr Gould, my fourth-form maths teacher, used to try a similar technique back in the 80s, and we'd sit around reading Smash Hits until he wrote the answer on the board. But no, the group around my table start unembarrassedly throwing around actual ideas: it's possibly why billionaires are billionaires, and chief executives are chief executives. They actually get on and do stuff. \"What about artificial meat?\" suggests Mike Federle, which in other company might be blue-sky thinking, but here is more factual observation. \"We could make a steak right now,\" says Robert Hariri, a doctor who founded a biotech company that specialises in pioneering stem cell treatments. \"But it'll cost you $20,000.\" I keep my mouth shut and share a sympathetic \"we-can't-all-be-geniuses\" smile with a nice Latino man across the table. \"Ricardo Salinas\", says his name tag. The second-richest man in Mexico (and 37th richest in the world), I discover later. There's a deliberately competitive edge to the proceedings. It plays to the strengths of the chief executives and it's one of Peter Diamandis's guiding principles. He was learning to fly when someone gave him a book about Charles Lindbergh's record-breaking flight across the Atlantic and discovered that it was a journey precipitated by a prize. It was this theory that led him to set up the X prize, which began with a $10m incentive for the first person or company to create a private reusable manned spacecraft (Burt Rutan and Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, won it in 2004 for their SpaceShipOne). The X prize Foundation has launched many more, the most recent being the $10m Qualcomm Tricorder prize to invent a handheld device – or \"tricorder\" as it was called in Star Trek – capable of diagnosing 15 diseases. Abundance of ideas There's a lot to take in. It's not even lunchtime and we've listened to presentations by Craig Venter on his plans to create biofuels made by microalgae: an acre, he believes, will be able to produce 10,000 litres of oil per year, as opposed to corn, which can produce just 18. He's just received $300m of investment from Exxon to make it a reality. Andrew Hessel, the Singularity University faculty member on biotech who is attempting to open-source cancer treatments, talks about how biology is the next exponential technology. The genetic code will become \"a programming language\". We're on the cusp of massive change. DIY bio-hacking has already begun. \"Viruses are coming first,\" he says. \"Viruses are easy to make.\" And then there's Vint Cerf on the \"internet of things\". In the near future, devices will talk to each other, he says. \"You'll be shopping and you'll get a call. It's the refrigerator saying, 'Don't forget the marinara sauce.'\" He ends his talk with his dream of an interplanetary internet. \"Darpa [the US defence department's advanced research projects agency] has issued a grant to develop a spacecraft to get to a star in 100 years. At current propulsion rates, that would take 65,000 years, so we'd need a nuclear-powered spacecraft that can travel at two-thirds of the speed of light. But then we have to work out the communication.\" And he looks slightly regretful. \"And we haven't done anything on an intergalactic scale yet.\" In this context, it doesn't seem quite as preposterous as it should when somebody suggests using 3D printers (machines that build up objects layer by layer from a digital file) to print 3D printers, which can then print a pair of shoes. Or a house. Or dinner. \"Actually, that's already happening,\" somebody else points out. But then 3D printers – and a prototype house made by extruding liquid concrete from a giant \"printer\" has indeed already been made – are just one of the Next Big Things coming down the line. We learn about dozens of them in the next two days. This is the \"abundance\": Diamandis's thesis is that we will soon enter a \"post-scarcity\" world. Forget peak oil. Who needs it when we have \"15 terawatts of power from the sun hitting the earth every 15 minutes\"? The challenge is simply harnessing it. \"And we're getting better at that all the time.\" It's not just that this deters us from changing our own unsustainable behaviour, his critics point out; it's that, as Craig Venter says, this technology is also quite hard. And sometimes doesn't pan out as well as you'd hoped. When he gets up to speak, his microphone doesn't work. \"And we're supposed to print out new life forms,\" he says. At times, Diamandis comes across as, well, the motivational speaker that he is. He has a line in aphorisms that sound like they have come from an auto-lifecoach-o-generator (\"The best way to predict the future is to create it yourself.\" \"If you can't win, change the rules.\" \"Bullshit walks, hardware talks\"). Though he has a knack, too, of encapsulating an idea. One of his best-known quotes is that a Masai warrior with a cellphone has better telecommunications capabilities than the president of the United States did 25 years ago. \"And if he has a smartphone with Google, he has access to more information than the president did just 15 years ago.\" He may be something of a showman, but he's a showman with form. Whom some of the brightest and most successful people in the world take seriously. Last Tuesday, to take just one example, he launched a company – backed by, among others, Larry Page, Google's co-founder, and Eric Schmidt, its chairman – to use spacecraft to mine asteroids for rare minerals. And he has his friend Richard Branson's knack for marketing. Day two of our three-day course finishes with a party on the set of a New York street in the Fox Studios lot. Two paraplegics rise from their wheelchairs to walk across the stage in powered robotic exoskeletons, and will.i.am gives his thoughts on the day: \"It's changed my whole perspective on life. But I'm worried about our inner cities. I've just heard that my niece is going to be dumber than her cellphone. We've had a generation who've wanted to better their bank balances, not their brains. I want to inspire young people to be scientists and engineers.\" There's a neat circularity to this. Peter Diamandis grew up in Brooklyn, the son of Greek immigrant parents, and was himself inspired to become a scientist by the Apollo mission, doing degrees in medicine and molecular biology and finally a PhD in aerospace engineering at MIT. The Singularity University isn't even the first university he's founded. He set up the International Space University while he was still in his 20s and which has now trained an entire generation of Nasa scientists. It's why Buzz Aldrin has come along, and why another astronaut, Dan Barry, teaches the SU's robotics course (Barry's big prediction: cyberdildonics. Robot sex. \"You think it's funny, right? But I'm also a rehabilitation physician, and sex is a basic human drive robots will be able to fulfil for the disabled, the widowed, the elderly. It's going to happen. You might as well accept it and get in on the ground floor.\") Frightening visions The future isn't all thrilling robo-sex and free solar energy though. Barry's talk also includes video of some of the other robots in development. If you think drones are scary, it's because you haven't yet seen the video on YouTube of autonomous swarming quadrocoptors. Or the hummingbird-shaped drone that can hover in the air and then fly in through a window, or Big Dog, which looks like something from Blade Runner, or, just last week, a new one with legs that can go where no Dalek ever could: up stairs. None of these are being developed to help with meals on wheels or palliative care nursing, though. They're war machines, most of which are being developed with funding or support from Darpa. (I meet its head, the formidably impressive Regina Dugan in the ladies: she doesn't seem like a warmonger but then a week later, it's announced that she's leaving to go to Google.) Even Dan Barry, who runs his own robotics company, sounds a warning: \"I don't see any end point here. At some point humans aren't going to be fast enough. So what you do is you make them autonomous. And where does that end? Terminator.\" And it's not just the robots. Or the fact that schoolchildren will be tinkering with DNA. \"Nobody wants their kid to be the first one off the block to make the Ebola virus,\" says Venter. \"Which is a really small genome.\" But nor does there seem to be any practical way, that anyone has thought of so far, of preventing it. It's during the biotech presentation that I hear a British voice pipe up and ask a question about regulation. In the break, I chat to the voice's owner, Simon Levene, a venture capitalist who specialises in technology. He's here, he says, \"because there's nowhere else that is this multidisciplinary. This stuff is changing so much and so fast that it's almost impossible to keep abreast of it.\" He's paid $5,000 for the three days and he reckons it's cheap at the price. \"It's a lot less than an MBA, and I've done an MBA at Harvard, and I've probably already learned more here.\" The technology is astounding, he says. But, he shares my own qualms about Silicon Valley's techno-utopianism. \"There's some potentially lethal side-effects, aren't there? Every solution has unintended consequences. And there are very real ethical and regulatory issues to consider, and which are just being glossed over. The thing is that I don't trust the market to do it. But then I don't trust government either. There needs to be international ethical oversight. There's simply enormous power that's about to be unleashed. Darpa isn't here for fun.\" One of the scariest things I hear, though, isn't ostensibly as scary as autonomous death machines. It's when Sebastian Thrun is talking. He unveiled his driverless car at TED in 2011 – developed in response to a competition held by Darpa – after they'd already driven 200,000 miles across California, a technology that will surely change our lives profoundly. It's been quite a year for Thrun: seeing another presentation at TED by Salman Khan about his online education site, the Khan Academy, Thrun decided to video one of his artificial intelligence classes at Stanford and put it online. An astonishing 160,000 people enrolled, of whom 23,000 graduated. Top of the class was a disabled woman called Melody Bliss, who works full-time, and has kidney dialysis three times a week. It was enough to persuade Thrun to resign his tenure at Stanford and set up Udacity, a free online university, open to all, that may change the face of education. That's the good news. But he's also founded and is head of Google X, Google's top secret special projects division. It's prototyping \"Google glasses\", augmented reality spectacles, that will stream the internet direct to your eyeballs. But it's what Thrun says is around the corner that to me seems as if it could be even more life-changing. Massive data. Of everything. \"I honestly believe that in the next 10-15 years, computers will be able to capture the experience of a life,\" he says. Every aspect of your life will exist online forever. And it's not a lonely scientist in a distant computer lab saying this. Thrun, to remind you, works for Google. Memory, the thing that defines who we are, what makes us human, that distinguishes us intellectually, and gives us a narrative sense of our own lives will \"be outsourced\". That world, says, Thrun, \"is not very far away\". Enjoy the luxurious privacy of your own memories while you still can. And then Diamandis asks the scientists there for their best predictions for the next five to 20 years. \"AI abilities are going to be indistinguishable from those of human abilities,\" says Thrun. Most jobs will no longer exist. \"There will be an explosion,\" he predicts, \"in art and music.\" Our definition of what it is to be human is going to change, says Dan Barry. Normal will no longer be enough. Robots are being taught to emote. We are going to start relating to them. Christopher deCharms, a neuroscientist who has helped develop a new sort of MRI machine that can do brain imaging in real time, goes even further. \"I believe that in 10 to 20 to 30 years, truth detectors will work. And they will be retrospective back today. There is going to be a revolution in privacy. Transparency is going to come all the way back to our thoughts.\" In his opening address, Ray Kurzweil points out that an IBM computer called Watson, had recently beaten the greatest human champions of the TV quiz game Jeopardy: \"And that's not just through statistical analysis. I think it's very significant. It's pattern recognition, which is what people do. It had to understand puns and metaphors and similes and jokes. It can read natural language documents. It read all of Wikipedia. That's 200 million pages of documents. It took three years. But at the end of the three years, there's a natural advantage to machine intelligence.\" The singularity really is near, he claims. It's less than 20 years away. \"I said it would be 30 years from 1999. The consensus then was 50 years. Today the consensus is about 20 years.\" However, when I email Sebastian Thrun and ask his opinion, he says: \"It's not a one-time event; it's a continuum that is well under way. It'll be hard to tell how much of it is already happening. In many ways, computers outsmart people today.\" He has a point. \"Siri [the iPhone voice recognition assistant] reminds me of the woman who's told a dog plays chess and is asked, 'Isn't that amazing?'\" says Kurzweil. \"And she replies, 'Yes, but its endgame isn't very good.'\" The endgame is likely to get better. And the world is changing. In ways we can't even begin to imagine. And whatever else it's doing, the Singularity University is looking at problems differently. Peter Diamandis never refers to overpopulation or limited resources. He talks about \"three billion new minds coming online\" in the next few years, Silicon Valley-speak for \"being born\". These minds are an opportunity, he insists, because \"the rate of innovation is a function of the number of people actually communicating and this is growing explosively with the internet\". At lunchtime, I talk to him as he dandles his twin babies on his knees, and is matter-of-fact, rather than techno-triumphalist, about what he's trying to do. He believes people can do extraordinary things. \"Because that's my experience: I've seen people do extraordinary things.\" And then he asks me a question: \"Haven't you? In these last two days?\" It's true. I have. There are reasons to be cheerful. Though when it comes to man versus machine, I'd have to say that my money's on the machines."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2008/aug/06/greenwatchmitdevelopswayto","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-08-06T10:21:36Z","webTitle":"Greenwatch: MIT develops way to bank solar energy at home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2008/aug/06/greenwatchmitdevelopswayto","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2008/aug/06/greenwatchmitdevelopswayto","fields":{"headline":"Greenwatch: MIT develops way to bank solar energy at home","bodyText":"MIT develops way to bank solar energy at home &gt;&gt;Source: Environmental news network A US scientist has developed a new way of powering fuel cells that could make it practical for home owners to store solar energy and produce electricity to run lights and appliances at night.

But being tasked with driving sustainable innovations at the world's biggest software firm – with unparalleled reach into homes, businesses, and governments – was never going involve much downtime. Bernard is on a \"flying visit\" to London offices before heading to a European conference. But he's keen to stress that this means train travel where possible, and apologises for the bottled water on the table. At a corporate level, Bernard has worked to make Microsoft more sustainable as a business. On the ground, his influence can be seen in everything from compostable cutlery and crockery to hybrid campus shuttles and free staff commuter buses at the 39,000-employee global headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The company now gets 25% of its annual energy from renewable sources, travels 30% less and boasts more energy-efficient buildings. \"We've expanded the things that we take into consideration, like waste stream ... and we changed the auto [car] policy to address both fleet average and put a cap on the level of carbon per kilometre of any vehicle Microsoft purchases. We don't have water goals yet but we're looking at measuring it,\" Bernard says. He oversaw the roll-out of Windows 7 in 2009, Microsoft's energy-saving operating system, and last year moved the company into home energy monitoring with Hohm, an online application that will later be used in conjunction with Ford to regulate the impact on the grid of mass electric vehicle charging. He's excellerated Microsoft software for climate research, and provided the platform that allows the Carbon Disclosure Project to produce its annual study of emissions from 3,000 major global corporations – and will soon report those of the world's biggest cities. Bernard has focused on making Microsoft's data centres more efficient. \"We're 50% more efficient than we were three years ago. I think we'll easily get to another 50% within another three years,\" he says. Bernard acknowledges the IT industry needs to get much more energy efficient, particularly given the potential scale of its growth. In 2008 a Smart 2020 report by the Climate Group on behalf of the Global eSustainability Initiative (GeSI) predicted ICT demand would quadruple alongside the rapid economic expansion of countries such as India and China. By 2020, it said, PC ownership will quadruple, mobile phone ownership will almost double and broadband uptake will treble. The sector's emissions are expected to increase from 0.53bn tonnes (Gt) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2002 to 1.43 GtCO2e in 2020 under a business as usual scenario – nearly 3% of global emissions. But the report also highlighted how the industry could become a key player in creating a low-carbon society. \"Specific ICT opportunities ... can lead to emission reductions five times the size of the sector's own footprint, or 15% of total business as usual emissions by 2020.\" One opportunity identified in the report was cloud computing, where \"clouds\" of giant data centres around the world store digital data – documents, email, music, video, photos – that can be accessed from any device, anywhere, through a browser. Last November, Microsoft commissioned a study which found that deploying its cloud computing solutions in large organisations could reduce energy use and carbon emissions by more than 30%, and more than 90% in smaller operations. Lower carbon emissions are driven by the efficiency of large-scale data centres, which manage capacity according to demand, serve millions of users simultaneously on the same server infrastructure, and are housed in more energy-efficient buildings, the report said. \"If you shift things from physical goods to electrons, data centre footprint grows, but societal [society's] footprint goes down,\" Bernard says. \"At Microsoft, our server capacity had to increase because we're doing more telephone conferencing and we're doing more video conferencing, but on a societal level, we've reduced travel.\" In this respect, cloud computing is not all good news. Humans are generating more data than ever and our digital footprint requires huge amounts of server space and energy. The Smart 2020 analysis forecasted that the global carbon footprint of the main components of cloud-based computing – data centres and the telecommunications network – would see their emissions grow, on average, 7% and 5% respectively each year between 2002-2020. During the same period, the number of data centre servers is expected to grow by an average of 9% each year. A Greenpeace International report released in March last year calculated that electricity consumed by cloud computing globally will increase from 632bn kilowatt hours in 2007 to 1,963bn kWh by 2020 and the associated CO2 equivalent emissions would reach 1,034 megatonnes. With such huge amounts of energy required to power the gigantic computing facilities that serve up the web mail, online storage and internet services we use every day, the Greenpeace report called for Apple, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and others to be responsible in their choice of power sources. \"Will the cloud run on coal or renewable energy? We are calling on IT industry giants to put their might behind government policies that give priority grid access for renewable sources like wind and solar energy,\" Greenpeace said. \"The great innovators of the digital age can and should be leaders in promoting an energy revolution.\" Facebook is currently at the centre of a storm over plans to build its first company-owned data centre in Prineville, Oregon, that would get power from a local utility which generates 60% of its electricity by burning coal. Microsoft too, has been criticised for announcing plans for a data centre in the coal-heavy state of Virginia. While its facility in Quincy, Washington uses 100% renewable hydropower from the Columbia river, Bernard maintains it's not always possible to make better energy choices but that supply is \"definitely a factor\" in the siting of data centres. \"It's very geospecific, because there are well over 30 factors that go into considering where to put a data centre. So in Washington state, there's lots of hydropower, and Quincy is literally three power poles away from the source. But you go to the east coast of the US, and it's still a highly coal-dependent infrastructure. So the question is how quickly can a country change its infrastructure? Or the regulatory regime?\" Microsoft has other large data centres in Chicago and San Antonio, Texas, and has tackled the carbon footprint with investment in more efficient heating and cooling systems. Its Dublin-based data centre, which opened in 2009, uses the local climate for a \"free air\" cooling system and all future centres must be designed according to LEED green building standards. Bernard is also keen to expand \"generation 4\" data centres housed in portable structures the size of shipping containers. \"What if you could make this literally standalone pods that don't need a building but just need physical security, and then you don't need to construct a massive building in concrete, with all the carbon implications and all the cost?\" Some NGOs have warned that Microsoft's shift to cloud computing will significantly increase its emissions profile, which has been traditionally low as it makes software, not hardware. Bernard and the CEO, Steve Ballmer, have also come under fire for adopting a carbon intensity – rather than an absolute – target. Bernard is sticking with the goal – to reduce carbon emissions per unit of revenue by at least 30% by 2012 (compared with 2007 levels) – and maintains it was created in line with contemporary thinking in the US surrounding GDP-based targets. \"Whether it's Greenpeace or the WWF, it's great that these guys are turning their attention to the ICT issue at scale. I respectfully see it very differently. If I look at the amount of support and activity we do and the breadth of it, we're focused on how we drive energy efficiency at scale both in IT and through the use of IT. If we can continue to drive radical energy efficiency gains in our industry, tripling the number of transactions per unit of electricity, that's a pretty good goal within a decade.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/sep/30/nuclear-power-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-09-30T15:25:42Z","webTitle":"The nuclear power plans that have survived Fukushima","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/30/nuclear-power-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/sep/30/nuclear-power-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"The nuclear power plans that have survived Fukushima","bodyText":"The quest for energy independence, rising power needs and a desire for political weight all mean that few developing countries with nuclear ambitions have abandoned them in the light of the Fukushima accident. Jordan's planned nuclear plant is part of a strategy to deal with acute water and energy shortages. The Jordan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC) wants Jordan to get 60 per cent of its energy from nuclear by 2035. Currently, obtaining energy from neighbouring Arab countries costs Jordan about a fifth of its gross domestic product. The country is also one of the world's most water-poor nations. Jordan plans to desalinate sea water from the Gulf of Aqaba to the south, then pump it to population centres in Amman, Irbid, and Zarqa, using its nuclear-derived energy. After the Fukushima disaster, Jordan started re-evaluating safety procedures for its nuclear reactor, scheduled to begin construction in 2013. The country also considered more safety procedures for construction and in ongoing geological and environmental investigations. \"The government would not reverse its decision to build nuclear reactors in Jordan because of the Fukushima disaster,\" says Abdel-Halim Wreikat, vice Chairman of the JAEC. \"Our plant type is a third-generation pressurised water reactor, and it is safer than the Fukushima boiling water reactor.\" Wreikat argues that \"the nuclear option for Jordan at the moment is better than renewable energy options such as solar and wind, as they are still of high cost.\" But some Jordanian researchers disagree. \"The cost of electricity generated from solar plants comes down each year by about five per cent, while the cost of producing electricity from nuclear power is rising year after year,\" says Ahmed Al-Salaymeh, director of the Energy Centre at the University of Jordan. He called for more economic feasibility studies of the nuclear option. And Ahmad Al-Malabeh, a professor in the Earth and Environmental Sciences department of Hashemite University, adds: \"Jordan is rich not only in solar and wind resources, but also in oil shale rock, from which we can extract oil that can cover Jordan's energy needs in the coming years, starting between 2016 and 2017 ... this could give us more time to have more economically feasible renewable energy.\" Finance, rather than Fukushima, may delay South Africa's nuclear plans, which were approved just five days after the Japanese disaster. South Africa remains resolute in its plans to build six new nuclear reactors by 2030. Katse Maphoto, the director of Nuclear Safety, Liabilities and Emergency Management at the Department of Energy, says that the government conducted a safety review of its two nuclear reactors in Cape Town, following the Fukushima event. But the government adopted its Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) for 2010-2030 five days after the Fukushima accident. Elliot Mulane, communications manager for the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation, (NECSA) a public company established under the 1999 Nuclear Energy Act that promotes nuclear research, said the timing of the decision indicated \"the confidence that the government has in nuclear technologies\". And Dipuo Peters, energy minister, reiterated the commitment in her budget announcement earlier this year (26 May), saying: \"We are still convinced that nuclear power is a necessary part of our strategy that seeks to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions through a diversified portfolio, comprising some fossil-based, renewable and energy efficiency technologies\". James Larkin, director of the Radiation and Health Physics Unit at the University of the Witwatersrand, believes South Africa is likely to go for the relatively cheap, South Korean generation three reactor. Larkin says nuclear energy is the only alternative to coal for generating adequate electricity. \"What other alternative do we have? Renewables are barely going to do anything,\" he said. He argues that nuclear is capable of supplying 85 per cent of the base load, or constantly needed, power supply, while solar energy can only produce between 17 and 25 per cent. But, despite government confidence, Larkin says that a shortage of money may delay the country's nuclear plans. \"The government has said yes but hasn't said how it will pay for it. This is going to end up delaying by 15 years any plans to build a nuclear station.\" Planned Ninh Thuan nuclear plant Vietnam hopes its first nuclear plant, Ninh Thuan, will be completed by 2020 Vietnam's nuclear energy targets remain ambitious despite scientists' warning of a tsunami risk. Vietnam's plan to power 10 per cent of its electricity grid with nuclear energy within 20 years is the most ambitious nuclear energy plan in South-East Asia. The country's first nuclear plant, Ninh Thuan, is to be built with support from a state-owned Russian energy company and completed by 2020. Le Huy Minh, director of the Earthquake and Tsunami Warning Centre at Vietnam's Institute of Geophysics, has warned that Vietnam's coast would be affected by tsunamis in the adjacent South China Sea. The Ninh Thuan nuclear plant would sit 80 to 100 kilometres from a fault line on the Vietnamese coast, potentially exposing it to tsunamis, according to state media. But Vuong Huu Tan, president of the state-owned Vietnam Atomic Energy Commission, told state media in March, however, that lessons from the Fukushima accident will help Vietnam develop safe technologies. And John Morris, an Australia-based energy consultant who has worked as a geologist in Vietnam, says the seismic risk for nuclear power plants in the country would not be \"a major issue\" as long as the plants were built properly. Japan's nuclear plants are \"a lot more earthquake prone\" than Vietnam's would be, he adds. Vietnam is unlikely to experience much in the way of anti-nuclear protests, unlike neighbouring Indonesia and the Philippines, where civil society groups have had more influence, says Kevin Punzalan, an energy expert at De La Salle University in the Philippines. Warnings from the Vietnamese scientific community may force the country's ruling communist party to choose alternative locations for nuclear reactors, or to modify reactor designs, but probably will not cause extreme shifts in the one-party state's nuclear energy strategy, Punzalan tells SciDev.Net. President Benigno Aquino III President Benigno Aquino III said the mothballed Bataan nuclear reactor will never be used for its original purpose. Will the Philippines' plans to rehabilitate a never-used nuclear power plant survive the Fukushima accident? The Philippines is under a 25-year moratorium on the use of nuclear energy which expires in 2022. The government says it remains open to harnessing nuclear energy as a long-term solution to growing electricity demand, and its Department of Science and Technology has been making public pronouncements in favour of pursuing nuclear energy since the Fukushima accident. Privately, however, DOST officials acknowledge that the accident has put back their job of winning the public over to nuclear by four or five years. In the meantime, the government is trying to build capacity. The country lacks, for example, the technical expertise. Carmencita Bariso, assistant director of the Department of Energy's planning bureau, says that, despite the Fukushima accident, her organisation has continued with a study on the viability, safety and social acceptability of nuclear energy. Bariso says the study would include a proposal for \"a way forward\" for the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, the first nuclear reactor in South East Asia at the time of its completion in 1985. The $2.3-billion Westinghouse light water reactor, about 60 miles north of the capital, Manila, was never used, though it has the potential to generate 621 megawatts of power. President Benigno Aquino III, whose mother, President Corazon Aquino, halted work on the facility in 1986 because of corruption and safety issues, has said it will never be used as a nuclear reactor but could be privatised and redeveloped as a conventional power plant. But Mark Cojuangco, former lawmaker, authored a bill in 2008 seeking to start commercial nuclear operations at the Bataan reactor. His bill was not passed before Congress adjourned last year and he acknowledges that the Fukushima accident has made his struggle more difficult. \"To go nuclear is still the right thing to do,\" he says. \"But this requires a societal decision. We are going to spark public debates with a vengeance as soon as the reports from Fukushima are out.\" Amended bills seeking both to restart the reactor, and to close the issue by allowing either conversion or permanent closure, are pending in both the House and the Senate. Greenpeace, which campaigns against nuclear power, believes the Fukushima accident has dimmed the chances of commissioning the Bataan plant because of \"increased awareness of what radioactivity can do to a place\". Many parts of the country are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters, which critics say makes it unsuitable both for the siting of nuclear power stations and the disposal of radioactive waste. Boy in Kenyan slum The demand for electricity is overwhelming in Kenya In Kenya, nuclear proponents argue for a geothermal – nuclear mix In the same month as the Fukushima accident, inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency approved Kenya's application for its first nuclear power station (31 March), a 35,000 megawatt facility to be built at a cost of Sh950 billion (US$9.8 billion) on a 200-acre plot on the Athi Plains, about 50km from Nairobi. The plant, with construction driven by Kenya's Nuclear Electricity Project Committee, should be commissioned in 2022. The government claims it could satisfy all of Kenya's energy needs until 2040. The demand for electricity is overwhelming in Kenya. Less than half of residents in the capital, Nairobi, have grid electricity, while the rural rate is two per cent. James Rege, Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Energy, Communication and Information, takes a broader view than the official government line, saying that geothermal energy, from the Rift Valley project is the most promising option. It has a high production cost but remains the country's \"best hope\". Nuclear should be included as \"backup\". \"We are viewing nuclear energy as an alternative source of power. The cost of fossil fuel keeps escalating and ordinary Kenyans can't afford it,\" Rege tells SciDev.Net. Hydropower is limited by rivers running dry, he says. And switching the country's arable land to biofuel production would threaten food supplies. David Otwoma, secretary to the Energy Ministry's Nuclear Electricity Development Project, agrees that Kenya will not be able to industrialise without diversifying its energy mix to include more geothermal, nuclear and coal. Otwoma believes the expense of generating nuclear energy could one day be met through shared regional projects but, until then, Kenya has to move forward on its own. According to Rege, much as the nuclear energy alternative is promising, it is extremely important to take into consideration the Fukushima accident. \"Data is available and it must be one step at a time without rushing things,\" he says. Otwoma says the new nuclear Kenya can develop a good nuclear safety culture from the outset, \"but to do this we need to be willing to learn all the lessons and embrace them, not forget them and assume that won't happen to us\". Oil barrels Nigeria: would nuclear bring more benefit than oil has? Undeterred by Fukushima, Nigeria is forging ahead with nuclear collaborations. There is no need to panic because of the Fukushima accident, says Shamsideen Elegba, chair of the Forum of Nuclear Regulatory Bodies in Africa. Nigeria has the necessary regulatory system to keep nuclear activities safe. \"The Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory Authority [NNRA] has established itself as a credible organisation for regulatory oversight on all uses of ionising radiation, nuclear materials and radioactive sources,\" says Elegba who was, until recently, the NNRA's director general. \"It is not only that we say so: an international audit came here in 2006 to assess our procedure and processes and confirmed the same. Elegba is firmly of the view that blame for the Fukushima accident should be allocated to nature rather than human error. \"Japan is one of the leaders not only in that industry, but in terms of regulatory oversight. They have a very rigorous system of licensing. We have to make a distinction between a natural event, or series of natural events and engineering infrastructure, regulatory infrastructure, and safety oversight.\" Erepamo Osaisai, Director General of the Nigeria Atomic Energy Commission (NAEC), has said there is \"no going back\" on Nigeria's nuclear energy project after Fukushima. Nigeria is likely to recruit the Russian State Corporation for Atomic Energy, ROSATOM, to build its first proposed nuclear plant. A delegation visited Nigeria (26- 28 July) and a bilateral document is to be finalised before December. Nikolay Spassy, director general of the corporation, said during the visit: \"The peaceful use of nuclear power is the bedrock of development, and achieving [Nigeria's] goal of being one of the twenty most developed countries by the year 2020 would depend heavily on developing nuclear power plants.\" ROSATOM points out that the International Atomic Energy Agency monitors and regulates power plant construction in previously non-nuclear countries. But Nnimmo Bassey, executive director of the Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN), said \"We cannot see the logic behind the government's support for a technology that former promoters in Europe, and other technologically advanced nations, are now applying brakes to. \"What Nigeria needs now is investment in safe alternatives that will not harm the environment and the people. We cannot accept the nuclear option.\" Cairo Egypt was the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to have a nuclear programme Thirsty for electricity, and desirous of political clout, Egypt is determined that neither Fukushima ― nor revolution ― will derail its nuclear plans. Egypt was the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to own a nuclear programme, launching a research reactor in 1961. In 2007 Egypt 'unfroze' a nuclear programme that had stalled in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. After the Egyptian uprising in early 2011, and the Fukushima accident, the government postponed an international tender for the construction of its first plant. Yassin Ibrahim, chairman of the Nuclear Power Plants Authority, told SciDev.Net: \"We put additional procedures in place to avoid any states of emergency but, because of the uprising, the tender will be postponed until we have political stability after the presidential and parliamentary election at the end of 2011\". Ibrahim denies the nuclear programme could be cancelled, saying: \"The design specifications for the Egyptian nuclear plant take into account resistance to earthquakes and tsunamis, including those greater in magnitude than any that have happened in the region for the last four thousand years. \"The reactor type is of the third generation of pressurised water reactors, which have not resulted in any adverse effects to the environment since they began operation in the early sixties.\" Ibrahim El-Osery, a consultant in nuclear affairs and energy at the country's Nuclear Power Plants Authority, points out that Egypt's limited resources of oil and natural gas will run out in 20 years. \"Then we will have to import electricity, and we can't rely on renewable energy as it is still not economic yet — Egypt in 2010 produced only two per cent of its needs through it.\" But there are other motives for going nuclear, says Nadia Sharara, professor of mineralogy at Assiut University. \"Owning nuclear plants is a political decision in the first place, especially in our region. And any state that has acquired nuclear technology has political weight in the international community,\" she says. \"Egypt has the potential to own this power as Egypt's Nuclear Materials Authority estimates there are 15,000 tons of untapped uranium in Egypt.\" And she points out it is about staying ahead with technology too. \"If Egypt freezes its programme now because of the Fukushima nuclear disaster it will fall behind in many science research fields for at least the next 50 years,\" she warned.

The 7% increase to 7.2m barrels a day is largely attributed by Christof Ruehl, the company's chief economist, to the ramping up of new fields in the Gulf of Mexico, although it also includes shale and other oil deposits. Ruehl declined to speculate on the future impact of the drilling moratorium imposed by Barack Obama in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, but noted that the International Energy Agency said 300,000 barrels could be shut in by 2015. The BP figures also showed that Russia overtook Saudi Arabia as the world's biggest oil producer, although that was largely because the Middle East nation deliberately held back output as part of a commitment to Opec to try to raise global oil prices. Meanwhile, Britain saw a 4.8% slump in its crude output as it produced 1.4m barrels a day in 2009 compared with over double this amount during the same period 10 years ago. Global oil consumption declined by 1.2m barrels a day, or 1.7%, the largest fall since 1982, with OECD use plunging by 2m barrels a day – a fourth consecutive annual decline, according to the BP statistics. The major locations for future demand increases will undoubtedly be China and India, but Ruehl said it was right to talk about \"peak demand\" rather than the \"peak supply\" analysis generally used by theorists worried about \"Peak Oil\" – the point after which demand starts to outstrip supply. The BP economist said new sources of oil were always available to be found – it was ultimately a matter of whether anyone was willing to pay the price of extraction. He put the latest falls in oil demand largely down to recession, noting that natural gas consumption also fell by 2.1%. Meanwhile production of natural gas fell by the same amount – the first decline on record – but carbon-intensive coal saw its share of world energy consumption increase to 29.4%, the highest level since 1970 and driven by strong use in China, India and Russia. Global nuclear output fell by 1.3%, a third consecutive decline just as Britain, America and China embark on ambitious plans to build a new generation of atomic plants. Solar energy led the charge for the renewable sector with a 47% increase in generating capacity while wind was up by 31%, but the wind sector as a whole remained a tiny share of the total energy mix. Ten years ago the developing world consumed 42% of all energy but now the figure is up to 52%, says BP. Ruehl added: \"In 1999, China's energy consumption per capita was just 20% of the UK's level; in 2009 it reached 50%.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/jul/01/emissions-recession","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-01T15:02:47Z","webTitle":"Global carbon emissions steady for first time since 1992","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jul/01/emissions-recession","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/jul/01/emissions-recession","fields":{"headline":"Global carbon emissions steady for first time since 1992","bodyText":"Greenhouse gas emissions from rich countries fell a record 7% in 2009 because of the recession, but the cut was entirely nullified by steep increases from fast-growing China and India, according to one of Europe's leading scientific research groups. Overall, this meant annual global climate emissions remained steady for the first time since 1992, says the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency which drew on energy-use data from the US government, the EU, BP energy data, the cement industry, and elsewhere. But the Dutch government-funded agency, which in 2007 was the first to correctly identify that China had overtaken the US as the world's greatest greenhouse gas polluter, warned that the figures did not mean that rich countries had cleaned up their act. \"A large part of production capacity has been suspended, but this could be re-employed as soon as the economy improves. It is likely that a recovering economy would cause emission levels in industrialised countries to go up. Nevertheless, the economic downturn has meant that these countries can meet their reduction obligations with more ease,\" said NEAA spokeswoman Anneke Oosterhuis. \"Another consequence of this downturn is that some industrialised countries may need to purchase fewer emission rights from reduction projects in developing countries, which, in turn, means that there will be less money available for emission reductions in those developing countries,\" said Oosterhuis. The figures will come as a relief to the world's rich countries which – the US aside – are legally committed to reducing emissions by a collective 5.2% on 1990 figures by 2012. As it stands, says the Dutch agency, they are now 10% below 1990 levels, well below the Kyoto target level. The research also shows that China and India's average CO2 emissions per inhabitant are still well below those in industrialised countries. In India the emissions are now 1.4 tonnes per person and in China 6 tonnes, compared with 10 tonnes per person in the Netherlands and 17 tonnes in the United States. China's 9% growth in emissions came despite its doubling of wind and solar energy capacity for the fifth year in a row. The report highlights the rapid growth in global emissions in the past 40 years. They are now 25% higher than in 2000, almost 40% more than in 1990, and double 1970's figure of 15.5bn tonnes. The big growth in Chinese and Indian emissions has been relatively recent. China has doubled its emissions in nine years, and India's have risen by 50% in that time. But the recession has not hit all industrial countries uniformly. Russia (-11%) and Japan (-9%) have contracted their energy use the most, but the US – which is by far the most profligate power user in the world – reduced its emissions by nearly 500m tonnes in 2009. Other developing countries changed little in 2009. Emissions rose in Iran, Indonesia and South Korea but fell in Brazil, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Taiwan. 2009 was a good year for renewable energy. Global wind power capacity grew by nearly one third, with nearly one third of all new installations in China. Total solar electricity installed in 2009 was 46% up on 2008. China now leads the world in large-scale hydropower with 19% of global production, well ahead of Brazil and the USA with a 12% share each. The new figures supplement those of the International energy agency (IEA) which predicted in November 2009 that global CO2 emissions would decrease by 2.6% in 2009. At that stage it was unclear how China and India would ride out the recession."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/jun/16/olympic-games-london-2012-green","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-15T23:05:37Z","webTitle":"Response: Even without a wind turbine, the Olympics can still be green","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/16/olympic-games-london-2012-green","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/16/olympic-games-london-2012-green","fields":{"headline":"Even without a wind turbine, the Olympics can still be green","bodyText":"You reported the Olympic Delivery Authority's announcement that it would no longer be building a wind turbine (London 2012 organisers scrap plans for Olympic Park wind turbine, 4 June). As you said, the turbine had originally been \"hailed as a green beacon\" and was said to be \"key to the ODA's commitment to deliver 20% of the park's legacy energy needs from renewable sources\". The bid for the 2012 games included the promise to make the Olympic park a blueprint for sustainable living, and the games' organisers have the ambition to make 2012 a \"truly sustainable games\". There is a commitment for the Olympic park to deliver a 50% reduction in carbon emissions and to supply 20% of its energy from renewable sources. As chair of the Commission for a Sustainable London 2012, my role is to hold the Olympic delivery bodies to account for these commitments. I have been reassured that the ODA remains committed to its energy targets. As you report, although wind is a very good way to deliver large-scale renewable energy, ODA chief executive David Higgins says this solution is \"no longer feasible\" because of new safety legislation and a challenging delivery timetable. We support this decision. There is no point in wasting money on a solution that looks iconic but does not work. As our carbon report states, all the buildings in the Olympic park are on track to achieve their energy conservation targets and we will continue to scrutinise the efforts of the ODA. Of the options available, until the introduction of feed-in tariffs, large-scale solar energy was not economically viable given the energy required to make and install the panels. We expect to see some solar power in the park but I will need to be convinced that it can make a worthwhile contribution. This leaves biomass CHP (combined heat and power) to deliver most of the renewable energy; this will mean some unattractive machines tucked away in an unglamorous plant room. This solution is certainly not \"eco-bling\" and the true sustainability credentials will need to be looked at in detail. The solution uses renewable wood-based fuel, but the fuel must be carefully sourced and energy is still needed to turn the crops into fuel. The elephant in the room, not included in any targets, is the energy associated with the construction of the facilities themselves. The carbon footprint of the build far outweighs the emissions associated with travel and flights – as demonstrated by this year's London 2012 carbon footprint study, which shows that 67% of the games' carbon footprint is in construction and some 70% of this is in metal. The performance of the ODA here has been variable: the velodrome is a superb sustainable building, with 100 tonnes of steel in the roof, natural ventilation and rainwater harvesting – an example of how to do it well. With its 3,000 tonne roof, the aquatics centre is not. To have a truly sustainable legacy, the Olympics needs more buildings like the velodrome and fewer like the aquatics centre."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2010/sep/03/solar-panels-ewaste","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-03T13:03:20Z","webTitle":"Are solar panels the next e-waste?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/03/solar-panels-ewaste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/sep/03/solar-panels-ewaste","fields":{"headline":"Are solar panels the next e-waste?","bodyText":"In recent years the electronics industry has gained notoriety for creating an endless stream of disposable products that make their way at life's end to developing countries, where poor people without safety gear cut and burn out valuable materials, spilling contaminants into their water, air, and lungs. Solar modules contain some of the same potentially dangerous materials as electronics, including silicon tetrachloride, cadmium, selenium, and sulfur hexafluoride, a potent greenhouse gas. So as solar moves from the fringe to the mainstream, insiders and watchdog groups are beginning to talk about producer responsibility and recycling in an attempt to sidestep the pitfalls of electronic waste and retain the industry's green credibility. Solar modules have an expected lifespan of at least 20 years so most have not yet reached the end of their useful lives. But now, before a significant number of dead panels pile up, is the perfect time to implement a responsible program, according to Sheila Davis, executive director of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition. The nonprofit environmental group has been a leader in recognizing the problems of e-waste, including hazardous disposal sites in the Bay Area left by the semiconductor industry. Now it is focused on the solar boom in Silicon Valley. Last year the group published a report calling for a \"just and sustainable\" solar industry, and this year it issued a scorecard of solar companies. The scorecard evaluates recycling and extended producer responsibility for the product's end of life, called takeback; supply chain and green jobs; chemical use and lifecycle analysis; and disclosure. Solar energy is the most widely available resource we have. Every hour, enough solar energy strikes Earth to meet human energy needs for more than a year, according to NASA. Now the solar industry is poised for huge growth in the United States, thanks to policy changes, incentives, technological improvements, and economies of scale. Solar photovoltaics have recently become less expensive than nuclear energy on a per-kilowatt-hour basis, according to a new report from Duke University. Also, solar is widely expected to reach cost parity with fossil fuels in most markets by 2013. In 2009, Greentech Media estimated that U.S. solar demand will continue to increase about 50 percent annually through 2012. The report said the US capacity installed during 2008 was about 320 megawatts, and it predicted that about 2,000 megawatts would be installed during 2012. Such growth would put US capacity ahead of solar leader Spain and potentially Germany as well. While most of the new modules will likely have a long, productive life, factory scrap, transport breakages, and field failures are ready for recycling now. Jennifer Woolwich is collecting these broken solar modules in a warehouse near Phoenix. She founded her company PV Recycling in February 2009 after estimating that she could harvest 500 panels a week from these sources. She is not yet collecting at that capacity, nor does she have enough panels to begin recycling them, but she is talking with solar manufacturers in an effort to win their recycling business. \"Of those we interviewed, 100 percent want recycling,\" she said. \"Eighty percent want an independent third-party doing the recycling.\" Woolwich said she has seen a quick evolution in solar manufacturers' attitudes toward recycling: \"Last year, there was kind of a 'wait and see, we're not sure how this is going to work' attitude. Over the past 12 months, I've seen a 180. I've seen companies who are hiring consultants to research their whole value chain to identify waste, including the end of life of modules. We've received calls from consumers asking us which companies have takeback programs in place.\" Solar companies tend to be secretive about their product recipes, making some manufacturers cautious about, yet conceptually open to, third-party recycling. \"We guarantee that intellectual property will not be put at risk,\" Woolwich said. \"We're not interested in reverse engineering or selling company secrets. We have certificates of destruction that we provide.\" For now, though, some companies are doing their own recycling. SolarWorld, which received an 88 out of 100 on the toxics coalition's scorecard, has been recycling its own panels since 2003 at its main factory in Freiberg, Germany. That factory now receives broken panels from its U.S. plants in Cabrillo, Calif., Hillsboro, Ore., and Vancouver, Wash. \"The fact is, there isn't much to recycle,\" said Ben Santarris, a spokesman for SolarWorld. \"In the future we might expand recycling to our U.S. plants or contract with a third-party recycler.\" First Solar earned a rating of 67 on the scorecard. Headquartered in Tempe, Ariz., it has recycling facilities at its manufacturing sites in Perrysburg, Ohio; Frankfurt (Oder), Germany; and Kulim, Malaysia. Lisa Krueger, vice president of sustainable development, said that so far the company is primarily recycling manufacturing scrap. \"It's our intention that there would be other recycling facilities worldwide as you get into those volumes,\" she said. Solar modules employ a variety of technologies, and even models within the same technology can have different ingredients. These materials may or may not be classified as toxic depending on who is regulating them. Dustin Mulvaney is a scientist who works on solar issues at the University of California, Berkeley, and serves as a consultant to the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition. He has analyzed solar modules currently on the market and has outlined for each its key ingredients, including potentially toxic elements and materials that would be valuable to recover in recycling. Used in SolarWorld modules, crystalline photovoltaic is the oldest and most widespread solar technology in the United States, holding 57 percent market share in 2009, according to Greentech Media. \"As far as hazardous materials go, you're primarily talking about lead,\" Mulvaney said. A thin film technology called cadmium telluride makes up about 21 percent of the U.S. market. First Solar panels use this technology. Cadmium may be carcinogenic. Exposure affects the lungs and kidneys and can be fatal. \"It's gene toxic and a mutagen, so it has the ability to affect DNA, meaning it could affect reproduction and future generations' DNA,\" Mulvaney said. Cadmium is technically banned by the European Union's Restriction on Hazardous Substances directive, although the policy currently allows an exemption for its use in solar modules. Still, there's not a lot of data about whether cadmium is toxic in the alloy form in which it's used in thin film. And cadmium isn't likely to go away anytime soon, as it is uniquely efficient at absorbing light. Another thin film material, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), also has a cadmium layer. Indium is a potentially hazardous substance, too, particularly in the form of indium tin oxide, Mulvaney said. Studies have linked it to pulmonary disease in flat-screen TV recycling facilities. And selenium has been documented to be a hazardous material. While CIGS currently has a market share of just 6 percent, amorphous silicon, which also has an indium tin oxide layer, holds 16 percent. California's Department of Toxic Substances Control has taken note of the European Union's concern about cadmium and is researching the chemical and physical makeup of various types of modules. \"We think some solar panels, probably the cadmium thin film type, might be hazardous waste when shredded or disposed of in a landfill,\" said Charles Corcoran, a hazardous substances scientist at the department. Only panels classified as hazardous would fall under the jurisdiction of the department. It is considering regulatory options to try to steer end users toward recycling rather than disposal. \"That gets a little complicated because California and U.S. regulations aren't necessarily in sync,\" Corcoran said. \"An option might be to transport it out of state where disposal is legal.\" Today California has no solar module recycling facilities. But recycling locally is an important tenet of an ethical, sustainable industry, said the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition's Davis. Recycling locally reduces the process' carbon footprint. \"It would also make people more conscious about what goes into the products,\" Davis said. \"And it would create local jobs.\" Extended producer responsibility, including module recycling, is currently an expense rather than a source of profit for companies, including Solar World and First Solar. \"As we get to scale, we hope those costs will come down,\" Krueger said. A dedicated recycler like Woolwich is counting on economies of scale. Her business plan also includes various revenue streams, including reclaiming and selling materials and providing a service of managing manufacturers' collection and recycling systems. Davis said recycling costs could be reduced if manufacturers would take the notion of extended producer responsibility to the next level: the design phase. \"If you don't look at the recycling when you're designing the product, then it's really, really difficult to recycle,\" Davis said. \"But if you know you're going to have to pay for the recycling at the end of life, you might make the necessary design changes in your product now to reduce that cost.\" Mulvaney said that if the government were to set a price on carbon emissions, that would also help make solar recycling more affordable. Because turning sand into crystals takes 70 to 80 percent of the energy used to make crystalline photovoltaics, he said recycling silicon would \"save so much energy in production, it could become a money saver.\" Still, most companies that are beginning recycling programs today are proceeding under the assumption that recycling will be a cost. They are preparing for that expense by creating a variety of funding mechanisms based on the principle of producer responsibility. Via her surveys, Woolwich has found that solar companies are using an annuity program, escrow, maturity bonds, annual fixed contracts, and pay as you go. Krueger said First Solar uses a trust: \"First Solar doesn't have access to those funds except for collection and recycling,\" she said. \"It's designed that way because of the long product life. If something happens to First Solar, the industry won't have to deal with orphan waste.\" Some materials in solar modules such as silicon and rare metals could be more valuable in the future, providing an additional incentive to recycle. Material price spikes have caused industry turmoil in recent years. For example, polysilicon shot to $400 per kilogram between 2006 and 2008. It is now down around $55. Krueger said First Solar currently harvests cadmium and tellurium from its recycling program to use in new modules, even though buying it from a supplier is currently less expensive. She said she expects harvesting costs to come down as recycling scales up. Mulvaney said that the industry would do well to plan now for the recovery of rare metals such as indium and tellurium. Of course, materials recovery has an environmental benefit as well. \"We'll be able to reduce impact from mining and other environmental hazards by collecting a lot of the metals and other valuable minerals that are being used in panels,\" Davis said. Being truly sustainable — and maintaining that green credibility — is a powerful motivator for renewable energy companies. Santarris said the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition's scorecard was an \"important step\" toward figuring out which manufacturers are the most environmentally benign. \"There's not a lot of sophistication in the marketplace to differentiate among products and manufacturers of varying environmental performance,\" Santarris said. \"Are solar modules all the same? They're not.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/oct/07/china-global-race-green-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-07T10:20:58Z","webTitle":"China winning global race for green jobs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/07/china-global-race-green-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/oct/07/china-global-race-green-jobs","fields":{"headline":"China winning race for green jobs","bodyText":"China is prevailing in the global race for green jobs in sectors from solar panels to advanced lighting, and appears to be on an unstoppable upward path, an annual report by cleantech research firm Clean Edge said on Wednesday. The Chinese government spent $34.6 billion last year to propel its low-carbon economy, more than any other nation and almost double what the U.S. invested. The country is now headquarters for six of the biggest renewable energy employers—up from three in 2008—according to Clean Tech Job Trends 2009. Ron Pernick, managing director of Clean Edge and a report author, called the economic giant's \"meteoric\" surge \"very striking.\" But, he said, it is \"not a fait accompli that China will dominate\" across the entire industry. There is \"serious competition on the global playing field,\" Pernick told SolveClimate News. The report said clean energy is spawning millions of high-paying green jobs worldwide, even as the global economy continues to sputter. Total jobs surpassed three million in 2009, recent data from global research group REN 21 finds. China accounted for 700,000 of that amount, due in large part to measures that promote solar heating. But Brazil, South Korea, Germany, Japan, the U.S. and other nations are still very much in the game, as clean-energy manufacturing grows and becomes more complex. Clean Edge identified more than two dozen top cleantech job sectors, including solar energy storage, green building materials and smart-grid devices. The authors said the findings should dispel naysayers' claims that green jobs merely displace employment in other sectors and add no new net jobs. \"Clean-tech jobs are not amorphous as these critics claim, and instead represent some of the most dynamic sectors in the technology landscape,\" the report said. \"There's no way that any country is going to dominate in every one of those,\" Pernick said, adding, \"The cleantech revolution is going to be a highly dispersed one, and highly distributed.\" \"Wake-Up Call\" for U.S. Still, Pernick called China's emerging dominance a \"wake-up call\" for U.S. lawmakers. \"Time is running out for us to take a more serious, concerted approach...at the national level,\" he said. The U.S. government devoted $50 billion of the $800 billion federal stimulus package to develop cleantech factory jobs. \"But results of this attempted manufacturing revival in the U.S. are decidedly mixed,\" the report said. Some 70 percent of the parts in renewable energy installations are manufactured overseas, according to estimates from the Apollo Alliance, a coalition of environmental groups, labor unions and politicians. Part of the reason is cheap labor costs in Asia. But Clean Edge also faults the lack of a federal renewable portfolio standard (RPS) that would require more use of solar, wind and other sources, and provide a long-term market signal to manufacturers. Around 30 countries have such policies in place, including China, which has targeted 15 percent of its energy from renewables by 2020. \"We believe that the lack of a strong and robust RPS puts countries like the U.S. at a significant disadvantage,\" the report said. Another policy absent in America is a national feed-in tariff program like the one that made Germany the world's largest market for solar power. The U.S. also needs significant regulatory and financial support, including \"billions in loan guarantees,\" the report said. \"There are no subsidy-free or regulatory-free energy sources on the planet—whether it's oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear, wind or solar,\" Pernick said. Silicon Valley Leads, Houston Surprises In the U.S., solar power continues to create the most green jobs, followed by biofuels, smart grid, energy efficiency, wind power and clean vehicles, the report said. California is the national leader, with four of its cities in the top 15 metro areas for cleantech jobs. San Francisco and Silicon Valley ranked first, with Los Angeles coming in second, San Diego seventh and Sacramento fifteenth. But the report warns of an \"uncertain future\" for the Golden State if Proposition 23 passes in November. The ballot measure would suspend the state's landmark Global Warming Solutions Act. If it passes, \"it would reduce the leadership of California and set up a roadblock on their ability to mandate emissions standards and a regulatory framework,\" Pernick said. However, he noted that it would not be \"the end of the world,\" especially given the state's new 33 percent renewable energy goal by 2020. New polling data by Reuters indicates the measure is headed for defeat by a margin of 49 percent to 37 percent. After California, Boston, New York and Denver are the next hottest spots for green jobs. Houston was the biggest surprise, the study said, leaping from 15th to eighth place in one year, driven by the city government's commitment to buy wind power and a local biofuels boom. Is Mexico the Next China? Even if the U.S. could shrink China's green jobs lead, it would still have to contend with a rising Mexico, the report suggested. \"With a combination of cheap labor and geographic proximity, the United States' third-largest trading partner is attracting attention from those looking for low-cost access to the North American clean-tech market,\" the authors said. So far, Japan-based Sanyo has established a factory in Mexico to churn out solar photovoltaic panels. BP Solar and Michigan-based thin-film maker Energy Conversion Devices recently revealed plans to do the same. In the wind sector, German equipment manufacturer Liebher has constructed a facility in Monterrey to make parts for the American market. Pernick predicts battery manufacturing plants could be next. \"It's not just low-cost manufacturing in China\" that the U.S. has to watch out for, Pernick said: \"It could be low-cost manufacturing south of the border.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2011/jan/09/lagacio-hotel-sustainable-eco-ski","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-09T00:05:11Z","webTitle":"Peak of perfection: the ultimate eco ski hotel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/jan/09/lagacio-hotel-sustainable-eco-ski","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2011/jan/09/lagacio-hotel-sustainable-eco-ski","fields":{"headline":"Peak of perfection: the ultimate eco ski hotel","bodyText":"There is something about taking a train journey across the European Alps that can melt the heart of even the most hardened traveller. My 7.30am start from a snow-packed Munich, where I live, is followed by a five-hour whiz through landmark stops: Rosenheim at the foot of the Bavarian Alps, Innsbruck in Austria, the Brenner Pass to Italy, before a change at Fortezza, in the heart of the Unesco World Heritage-listed Dolomites, followed by a further train trip to Brunico. My ultimate destination is Lagacio Mountain Residence, in the small mountain town of San Cassiano, Alta Badia, in the province of Bolzano-Bozen. A one-hour car journey from Brunico takes me through a mesmerising sequence of hairpin bends, inclines and tunnels. I reach San Cassiano as snow begins to swirl down. Gazing up, it is impossible to see the higher peaks because of cloud, but the landscape is dramatic. Mountains appear to be wrapped around this small town, and when combined with the cloud cover, the peaks bring to mind images of bygone centuries when inhabitants of the Alps lived in fear of dragons and other creatures. The principal challenge facing the contemporary Alps revolves around sustainability. When Lagacio opened in December 2009, it was certified by South Tyrol's Climate House Agency as CasaClima A, the second-highest award possible in a scheme that evaluates the energy efficiency of buildings in this autonomous region of Italy. Lagacio uses fewer than 30kWh per square metre for heating, compared with 120 to 220 for a typical building in South Tyrol. Not carbon neutral, but for the eco-conscious tourist, a better bet than most lodges and hotels in the Alps. \"We were not thinking about creating an eco hotel,\" explains Margareth Canins, owner (with husband Pio) and the beating heart of the hotel. \"The eco elements – the type of windows and solar energy, for example – sort of evolved; it was a process. Our architect wanted to use lots of different materials, such as Formica, and I refused. I wanted woods and slates,\" she says adamantly. \"The architect asked me if I really wanted to use all of this material just for guests. I told him: 'We are also doing it for us, the family.' If I come out of my apartment [which is above the hotel] I need to feel at home. Only then will guests also feel at home. Sustainability has always been very important to me, but most important was that everyone has to feel comfortable here.\" The 29-apartment Lagacio cost around €8m to build and took just eight months to complete. It quickly caught the imagination of German and Italian style magazines for its attractive mountain location, spacious rooms and minimalist design, not to mention the subterranean spa. Margareth insisted on using local materials throughout, such as pine, spruce and larch, loam and loden fabrics, though the slate for the stairs comes from Brazil, she tells me. Water, from a local spring, is \"revitalised\" using the Grander method: a process which claims to add \"energy\" to improve the \"structure\" of water via magnetic generators. Of the 18 staff at Lagacio, seven belong to the local Ladin population, which has inhabited parts of the Dolomites for centuries. South Tyrol is an area that until relatively recently belonged to that behemoth of European history, the Austro-Habsburg dynasty. It was only in the wake of Austria's defeat in the First World War that it was handed to Italy. The Italian-Austrian-German influences are a huge part of the appeal of this part of the world and manifest themselves in the food, architecture and language. I get a first-hand insight into the language complexities in conversations with Margareth. She insists on speaking English (she needs the practice, she says), but we are intermittently interrupted by her son Matteo, who occasionally appears to be speaking the wonderfully impenetrable South Tyrolean German dialect; at other times, I hazard a guess that he is speaking Ladin, a Rhaeto-Romance language spoken by around 40,000 people in the Alps. Indeed, \"Ladin is not a dialect, it's a language\" is a sentence I hear often. In addition to German and Ladin, away from the hotel, in shops and at school for example, Matteo might also speak the third regional language, Italian. Visitors with decent German or Italian will have no trouble, but English is strictly in fourth place here. As topics of conversation, only food comes near family as the most popular subject during my stay. Breakfast is the principal meal served at Lagació, taken in the Stube, the spacious and rustic L-shaped breakfast room characterised by old beams and cabinets. Within the Stube there is a smaller, more intimate and refined dining room. All the food is produced locally, which for breakfast means home-baked breads, cheeses, fruits, eggs, mueslis, cold meats, plus other local specialities and honey. As the buffet is available until 11am, guests are encouraged to take their time, relax, and enjoy the food and a chat. Lagacio's spacious apartments range from doubles to family rooms. My own U-shaped apartment, Bellerophon (all apartments are named after Dolomite fossils), has an intelligently designed walk-in wooden wardrobe near the entrance, perfect for discarding wet clothes and muddy boots, a huge bed and – best of all – patio doors that lead to a balcony from where the mountains seem to be within touching distance. As this is San Cassiano, however, the stylish fitted kitchen is unlikely to get much use during my short stay: with two Michelin-starred restaurants in San Cassiano itself (St Hubertus, led by executive chef Norbert Niederkofler, is just 300m away), and a handful of other more reasonably priced options, it is no surprise that the wider Alta Badia area has been labelled by the Ski Club of Great Britain as \"probably the best resort in the world for foodies\". Try regional specialities canederli (bread-based dumplings) and tutres (ricotta cheese, sauerkraut or spinach pancake-like dishes), while gnocchi and strudel are staples on most menus. With great food and plentiful snow, added to the spectacular background of the Dolomites, the economies of numerous small communities have inevitably come to rely on attracting winter-sports tourists during the winter months. Alta Badia is neither considered the most challenging ski area to be found in the Alps (90% of slopes are deemed \"easy\" and \"medium\"), nor is it renowned for après-ski excitement. While 95 slopes across 130km in a spectacular location is an obvious attraction, many visitors are enticed by its decidedly relaxed, more family-oriented atmosphere. The impact on the natural environment, however, of snow-making machines, countless lodges perched halfway up mountains and numerous ski lifts (450 in the Dolomiti Superski Skipass area alone) is obvious. The managing director of Lagacio, Christof Irsara, sensibly does not deny the contradiction, admitting that much work needs to be done for winter sports to become more sustainable. He points to a \"growing trend for walking activities in the snow, activities that do not need a ski lift, for example\". It is, however, difficult to imagine tens of thousands of passionate skiers and snowboarders converting to the less exhilarating sport of snow walking. But it is equally difficult to be overly critical. Lagacio could be described as a reluctant eco hotel pin-up. Sustainability has always been just one aspect of Margareth's wider vision of creating a hotel that is built and decorated almost exclusively with natural materials, that is family-focused and that relies entirely on locally produced food. The result should be warmly welcomed: Lagacio is ahead of much of the field not just in terms of style and hospitality, but also in terms of sustainability.

Only eight journalists, two men who admitted later they had gone to the wrong meeting, and a fan who cheered wildly at everything that m'lud said were in the audience to hear him lay into renewable energy. Monckton began badly by cross-examining his audience on whether they had read a box on p798 of a forgotten UN report, and went on to tell the objecting Guardian to \"be quiet or get out\". His thrust was that however much wind or solar energy was installed it would make next to zero difference to temperatures. But when asked if he was saying that the Chinese, Brazilian, Norwegian and every other government now pursuing renewable energy was quite wrong, he rowed back. \"This should be an age of reason and enlightenment. We are asking for a more rational and cautious approach [to electricity production]. Fossil fuels are the cheapest way to lift people out of poverty\". His fan cheered but sadly he was met by the international press mostly with wonder and bafflement. \"A mix of high intelligence and complete ignorance,\" offered one diplomat observer on the Viscount's performance. Governments dig deep The government doing the best business here in Bonn is Mexico, which has set up a stall offering visas, hotels, and good nights out in Cancún where the next giant \"conference of the parties\" will take place in November. Rich countries are pretty hopeless at coming up with the money they have promised poor countries to adapt to climate change, but, by heck, they are digging deep way in advance to make sure they get the best hotels. So far 2,000 rooms, at about $400 a head, have been booked and paid for. Delegates should note that the Cancún dates coincide with the expected end of the hurricane season. UN thrashes 'the world' As expected, the UNFCCC secretariat thrashed the Rest of the World at football last night. The scoreline of 6-3 was said to be generous, but a spokesman for the losers suggested that the absence of a referee was critical, and besides, they had no back line. \"Our two Mexicans played a blinder but it was no use. It's always the same with the UN ... We have to work together more.\" Applications to manage the world are now being accepted. 1.5 to stay alive Bust-up of the week came last night when small island nations and other vulnerable countries slipped in a late night request at an obscure technical committee for an official UN review of the latest climate science and scenarios to limit temperatures to a 1.5C rise. Some 112 countries now officially support the goal of a 1.5C target and reducing CO2 levels below 350ppm, but all references have been stripped from the text of the Copenhagen Accord (the lack-lustre deal signed at the UN climate talks last December) so there is no way to address it formally. It was looking good but the Saudis and their Opec friends in Kuwait, Qatar and Venezuela do not sleep and the four Opec countries ambushed the motion and objected. The little countries were not perturbed and have sworn to fight again tonight. \"1.5 to stay alive!\" is their battle cry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/video/2009/jul/09/manchester-report-stephen-salter","type":"video","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-12T22:05:00Z","webTitle":"Video: Manchester Report - Cloud-making ships","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2009/jul/09/manchester-report-stephen-salter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/video/2009/jul/09/manchester-report-stephen-salter","fields":{"headline":"Manchester Report: Cloud-making ships","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/mar/14/lucy-siegle-innovator-matthias-kauer-solar-cell","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-14T00:05:18Z","webTitle":"The innovator: Matthias Kauer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/14/lucy-siegle-innovator-matthias-kauer-solar-cell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/mar/14/lucy-siegle-innovator-matthias-kauer-solar-cell","fields":{"headline":"The innovator: Matthias Kauer","bodyText":"\"Small is beautiful\" is a longstanding eco mantra – and its latest example is a stamp-sized incarnation of the solar panel. Even with its minute proportions, the new solar cell generates three to four times the amount of power (10-12 watts) that a conventional cell could at the same size. \"But the real point,\" explains Matthias Kauer of the Sharp Solar Research &amp; Development Laboratory, \"is that once you add in a comparatively cheap bit of kit like a lens, this tiny cell can then generate 100 times more power than an ordinary cell.\" It's exactly the power surge solar photovoltaic panels need. PV panels use a thin layer of semi-conducting material, usually silicon, to generate an electric charge when exposed to sunlight. They are often derided, the assumption being that they don't generate a useful amount of energy, but Dr Kauer is quick to point out that even the average panel is 15 to 20 times more efficient at converting solar energy than plants.

You can borrow one of the rustic bikes free of charge for a cycle tour through the surrounding countryside – the garden is on a national cycle route – and walkers will find plenty of footpaths leading through gentle, rolling woodland and farmland. Owls can be heard most nights, and the current yurt is dedicated to them, with £1 donated per night to the Suffolk Wildlife Trust's barn owl project. The ethos here is firmly focused on community and conservation – the only lights are solar-powered fairy lights and lanterns, which should ensure dark skies for stargazing or evenings round the fire. Apr-Oct; badger cottage open all year, tents from £10 per tent pitch per night – see website or phone for other prices; 01728 664178 Original Huts Bodiam, East Sussex The accommodation here speaks volumes for the simple life. Quarry Farm's Mark and Anna Eastwood, inspired by the old local cabins built for itinerant farmhands and shepherds, decided to build their own, fashioned from reclaimed bits and pieces of recycled, local and sustainable materials. Two huts are currently available for up to four people each. A third hut serves as a washroom and two more are in production. The cabins are fully furnished with a double bed, a bunk bed, a wood-burning stove, a gas hob, cold-water basin and solar-powered lighting. A cool box, bed linen and a supply of fire wood is given to you at the beginning of your stay, and hampers of excellent local produce can be arranged at any time. Each hut comes with its own firepit for marshmallows, sausages and storytelling, or you can amble across the fields to the local pubs. One unique feature is that the Kent and Sussex Steam Railway runs through the farm – try its weekend round-trip supper service. Also there's nearby Bodiam Castle to explore, or you could take the Danny Lee ferry on a trip down the river Rother. Oh to be lost for ever in this little neck of the woods … Open all year; huts available from £75 per night (low season) to £295 (peak season) + £6 per person; 01580 831845 Tolcarne Surf Shacks Newquay, Cornwall These little pine bungalows right on the beach at Newquay are a great surf stop – the restless Atlantic ocean stares you square in the face the minute you lift your head from your bunk. You are right on the very beach that hosts one of Britain's most famous waves to ride, known as The Wedge. Hence there's surfing, boogie boarding, kite surfing, waterskiing and wakeboarding to be tried – or rock pools to poke around in and golden sand to walk along. A crescent of rugged green cliffs cradle the beach, making it a particularly sheltered spot that's ideal for sunbathing. Each cabin sleeps up to four, there's a communal washing and cooking area and you can charge your phone at the office. Apr–Sep; £60–£100 per night (sleeps 4); 01637 872489 Tepee Valley Markethill, Co Armagh Tepee Valley campsite is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland. There is a range of comfy options – a tipi, a festival tent, a red-and-white yurt, a Gypsy wagon called the Rosie Lee with wheels resembling giant daisies, and a round-log cabin straight out of Little House on the Prairie – each skilfully hidden from the other by a beautifully landscaped garden. Farmland stretches out on three sides, and a newly planted wood is just beginning to sprout. Kids will love it, with a 10-acre playing field, and hens, goats, cats and dogs for company. Beyond the Cusher valley lie the Mourne mountains, and Slieve Gullion to the south – a mountain swathed in legend and local folklore. Yet the site is within 10 minutes of various big shopping towns, and the medieval city of Armagh is a 15-minute drive away. Open all year round for log cabin and Gypsy wagon; yurt, tent and tipi open from spring to autumn; festival tent (sleeps 4-5) from £60; tipi £75 (sleeps 6); gypsy wagon £75 (sleeps 4); yurt/log cabin £85 (both sleep 4 – single nights only available midweek), peak season minimum 2 night stay; 02837 552092 Sites chosen by Garri Rayner at goglamping.net"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2010/jul/10/cognitive-surplus-connected-clay-shirky","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-09T23:04:01Z","webTitle":"Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age by Clay Shirky | Book review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/10/cognitive-surplus-connected-clay-shirky","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2010/jul/10/cognitive-surplus-connected-clay-shirky","fields":{"headline":"Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age by Clay Shirky","bodyText":"\"Ever wondered what those flames are burning from the top of oil rigs? Money.\" Thus began an article whose content I can't otherwise recall. The flames were fed by excess gas that couldn't then be harnessed; burning it was the only thing to do with it. Clay Shirky's suggestion is that the past decades we have spent watching sitcoms, films and other \"sit-there-and-consume-it\" mass media is the cognitive equivalent of those gas flares: brainpower being uselessly blown off because we couldn't do anything with it; all those brain cells lit up with nothing to do except burn out in front of the tube. But now, he argues, we have the opportunity – via the low-friction medium of the internet – to organise ourselves and do something in concert. What we end up doing might not be very useful; he cites the explosion of lolcats, whose canonical picture is a chubby cat with the caption \"I can has cheezburger?\" Pretty much anyone can write a lolcat caption, and sometimes it seems as if everyone has. Or there's Wikipedia, where anyone can edit pages; Shirky (with help from an IBM expert) calculates that creating Wikipedia's content has, since 2001, consumed 100m cumulative hours of human thought. But Americans spend about 100m hours watching TV adverts each weekend. To the exasperated cry of \"where do they find the time?\" that people wail over Wikipedians' documenting of each and every Pokémon (look it up), Shirky's rebuttal is, basically, \"why don't people find the time all the time?\" Once people do find the time, their self-organisation can be surprisingly useful: there's the social network of fans of the singer Josh Groban, who used their surplus energy to create a charity that gives 100% of its receipts to good causes. A global charity with no overheads? That's a real harnessing of the cognitive surplus. There has been criticism (on the internet, naturally) that Shirky has been in too much of a hurry to follow up his previous book, Here Comes Everybody, which was about how the internet has enabled people to self-organise more rapidly. Certainly a narrow reading of Cognitive Surplus might lead one to think that it's simply more of the same case studies. But Shirky has a different aim this time. He argues for the ability of social networks (and self-organising groups) to do private, public and even civic good, and argues that the internet lowers the barriers to participation so much further that the real surprise is that we don't do more. Have you created your lolcat caption today? The odd thing is that Shirky – who is definitely, almost defiantly, an optimist about the internet's possibilities, but without the trivial, technology-led analysis that most \"social media experts\" offer – often sounds like someone trying to roll back the years to a hazy but delight-filled 1950s; a time when the sitcom didn't rule, and everyone knew everyone through the (American) neighbourhood bowling leagues. I suspect, though, that the mass media companies are fighting back. Series such as The Wire, Heroes and particularly Lost are complex enough to suck up any cognitive surplus one might have. Indeed, time spent viewing TV has risen in the UK (though it has fallen in the US). However, if you keep an eye on internet traffic, many people are now viewing TV with an eye on their social network. For Shirky, one suspects that's not enough. He emphasises the public and civic benefits to be gained from organising – though he recognises that we tend not to do the things that one might hope we would. Fine, we didn't organise a charity in which we brought water to the homeless and solar energy piped in from the Sahara. At present, we're really only good at harnessing our cognitive, rather than our budgetary (if any) or labour (if any) surplus. But by putting the qualities of that surplus on to an easily examined order (from lolcats upwards), Shirky gives us a ruler by which to measure our contribution to the world. Watching TV will never be the same again – unless, of course, you're updating the Wikipedia guide to the episode at the same time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/gallery/2010/apr/08/solar-impulse-solar-powered-aeroplane","type":"gallery","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-08T09:48:00Z","webTitle":"Solar Impulse: The solar-powered aeroplane","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2010/apr/08/solar-impulse-solar-powered-aeroplane","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/gallery/2010/apr/08/solar-impulse-solar-powered-aeroplane","fields":{"headline":"Solar Impulse: The solar-powered aeroplane","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/jun/03/mergersandacquisitions.solarpower","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-06-02T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Solar energy shares soar as Bosch buys Ersol for €1.1bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/03/mergersandacquisitions.solarpower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/jun/03/mergersandacquisitions.solarpower","fields":{"headline":"Solar energy shares soar as Bosch buys Ersol for €1.1bn","bodyText":"The German engineering group Bosch is to buy a solar energy company for €1.1bn (£864m) in a move likely to lead to further consolidation in the world's biggest solar power market. Bosch said yesterday that it paid €101 a share, a premium of more than 60%, for a controlling stake in Ersol and would offer the same price to all other shareholders. It has already secured acceptances from investors holding another 3.3%. Shares in leading German solar companies rose substantially on expectations that other big players, including oil groups, are on the prowl in a market that grew to €6.6bn last year and is forecast to top €18bn by 2020. Germany is by far the world's biggest solar energy market thanks to its \"feed-in\" tariffs, which pay a government-guaranteed premium of up to €0.47 a kilowatt hour for power produced by photovoltaic panels. It is expected to continue to grow despite government plans to cut subsidies by 8% or 9% in 2009 and 2010. The German industry employs 57,600, according to its main trade group, which sees those numbers swelling to more than 200,000 by 2020, with exports worth €20bn by then. Bosch indicated last month that it planned to use its substantial cash reserves on acquisitions. Franz Fehrenbach, chief executive, said the credit crunch had significantly reduced prices. But some analysts said the price it was paying private equity firm Ventizz for the 50.45% stake in Ersol was extremely high. Fehrenbach said Bosch planned to expand its renewable energies business, with a sales target of €750m this year. The Stuttgart-based group said Ersol, based in Erfurt in eastern Germany, had global sales of €160m last year and expected to turn over €300m this year, after doubling sales in the first quarter to €52.4m with operating earnings of €7.7m."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/feb/25/kentucky-coal-clean-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-25T15:31:00Z","webTitle":"Kentucky split between coal past and clean energy future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/25/kentucky-coal-clean-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/feb/25/kentucky-coal-clean-energy","fields":{"headline":"Kentucky split between coal past and clean energy future","bodyText":"Kentucky is heading toward its energy future paddling in opposite directions. Some lawmakers want to boost the use of alternative energies, especially biomass, to diversify its fuel mix. But coal remains the backbone of its manufacturing-driven economy, and others are determined to keep it that way. The political dynamic playing out in Kentucky offers a local window into the larger national energy dilemma. The state is seeking the benefits of a clean economy, but coal is still the source of 92 percent of its electricity and brings in $3.5 billion in export revenue. Currently, state legislators are deliberating three bills to spur economic growth and rein in soaring electricity rates. One would foster clean energy development. The others would shelter the coal industry from Obama administration regulations on greenhouse gases that opponents say would kill industrial jobs. While it's true that Kentucky cheap coal has long attracted manufacturing industry — which currently employs 213,000 people in the automotive, steel and aluminum sectors — new figures suggest times are changing. Electricity rates have risen 41 percent on average over the last five years, delivering a blow to the state's big industries. Kentucky's cheap energy has become less of a competitive advantage. Manufacturing jobs have fallen 30 percent in the last decade, hitting the one-third of Kentuckians who live in low-income housing the hardest. At the same time, the state's smaller mines have become more expensive to operate, and newer machine-intensive technologies have cut back on manpower. As a result, coal mining jobs in Kentucky have fallen from 50,000 positions in 1979 to 18,000 today, according to the Mountain Association for Community Economic Development (MACED). Today, mining accounts for one percent of total non-farm employment in the state. \"The price of coal — to mine it, generate it and to try to manage the waste — is getting more expensive,\" said Elizabeth Crowe, director of the Kentucky Environmental Foundation. \"Meanwhile, the number of jobs created through clean renewable energy like wind, solar and hydro are really [rising] in some of our neighboring states\" but not in Kentucky. Government Overreach 'Costing Us Jobs' However, many legislators from both parties would disagree with the suggestion that coal can't power a jobs engine. In the Senate, the Natural Resources and Energy Committee approved a largely symbolic measure on Feb. 17 to make Kentucky a \"sanctuary state\" for the coal industry by exempting mines and power plants from \"the overreaching regulatory power\" of the EPA. Under the bill, the state's Energy and Environment Cabinet would go so far as to issue permits to coal mines previously denied by the EPA because of concerns over water pollution. \"As the overreaching EPA impact settles in on us, it's costing us jobs, it's putting us in a very perilous situation,\" said Chairman Sen. Brandon Smith, a Republican from the coal-mining town of Hazard, and the bill's sponsor. That same day, the committee's House counterpart approved a bill that would exempt Kentucky mines which produce coal for the state's use — not for export — from federal Clean Water Act requirements. The legislators contend they are protecting states' rights. But such pro-coal views are being met with growing citizen opposition. Earlier this month, Wendell Berry, the Kentucky author and poet, occupied the governor's office with 13 others for four days to protest government support of coal, while 1,000 protesters held a demonstration against mountaintop removal mining at the state Capitol. EPA Bashing 'Temporary Diversion' Len Peters, secretary of the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, told SolveClimate News that the pro-coal lawmakers introduced the bills as a way to show EPA their displeasure, and have even acknowledged that the state would lose substantial federal Clean Air Act funding if they're passed. Peters said the bills are merely a \"temporary diversion\" from Gov. Steven Beshear's long-term goals to diversify the state energy supply, which includes a seven-point strategy to get 25 percent of Kentucky's energy demand from energy efficiency, renewable energy and biofuels by 2025. The proposed Clean Energy Opportunity Act on the House floor, or H.B. 239, would take the Democratic governor's initiatives even further. Rep. Mary Lou Marzian, a Democrat from Louisville, introduced the bill earlier this month to establish a renewable and efficiency portfolio standard (REPS) for the state. Under the mandatory standard, renewable sources would account for 12.5 percent of utility retail sales by 2021, and utilities would achieve annual efficiency savings of up to 10.25 percent of retail sales in that period by reducing demand from manufacturers, businesses and homes. Jason Bailey, research and policy director for MACED, said that the House measure would take the first steps needed for a green energy transition. MACED is part of the Kentucky Sustainable Energy Alliance (KySEA), an organization of 30 businesses, nonprofit organizations and faith groups that drafted the bill. First Signs of Green Manufacturing \"We've built an economy around cheap electricity from coal-fired power that is coming to an end,\" Bailey told SolveClimate News. \"What we're really talking about for the next 10 years is that we need to take the first steps to position ourselves for the next phase, where by all indications, because of technology and policies, clean energy alternatives will take off [nationwide].\" Bailey said the REPS could help attract clean technology industries in an otherwise pro-coal state. \"You see a real correlation between states that are friendly to renewable energy and the location of renewable energy component and system manufacturing,\" he said. \"Manufacturers want a market for their products, and if Kentucky itself is not purchasing renewable energy systems, then it makes us less appealing. They want to go where the market is.\" Kentucky is starting to encourage green manufacturing ahead of its renewable energy market. Last August, the state received $53.4 million in federal stimulus funds from the U.S. Department of Energy to distribute clean energy tax credits and grants. Since then, the state finance authority has given Alternative Energies Kentucky Inc. preliminary approval for up to $390,000 in funding to build around 25,000 to 30,000 solar panels a year at its plant. ZF Steering Systems LLC also received a $28.6-million tax credit to make electric power steering gears for vehicles that consume 90 percent less energy than traditional hydraulic gears. General Electric in Louisville received $11.3 million of the same credit to make residential-scale heat pump clothes dryers, which use half the energy of standard dryers. Defining Renewables: Are Biomass, Coal Clean? Not surprisingly, state officials and green groups differ in defining how to develop actual renewable energy sources in Kentucky. The governor has assembled a biomass task force and expects the industry to account for more than half of renewable energy production by 2025. The task force estimates that biomass production could reach 25 million tons annually, or $3.4 billion in net output, and create about 14,000 jobs in rural communities. Earlier this year, the state finance authority awarded preliminary approval for up to $15 million in state tax credits to EcoPower LLC. A planned 58.5-megawatt biomass power generating facility is expected to operate in 2013. But whether burning tree parts for electricity should even qualify as clean renewable power remains up for debate in the United States. Conservationists say that biomass combustion produces more CO2 than burning fossil fuels, while the industry claims it's carbon neutral. For its part, the EPA is still considering both sides. Also disheartening to environmental groups is that coal would still make up more than 60 percent of the state's electricity portfolio under the governor's plan — though \"clean coal\" technologies would be implemented at 50 percent of coal-based facilities in the next 15 years to offset the harmful greenhouse gases emitted by the plants. An additional 15 percent of energy would come from nuclear power and natural gas, with biomass, hydropower and other renewables rounding off the top. Peters noted that carbon capture and storage (CCS) techniques are largely experimental for coal-fired plants and could take decades to carry out, while the biomass task force is still developing strategies for sustainable agricultural and forestry practices. Crowe of the Kentucky Environmental Foundation, which is also a KySEA member, told SolveClimate News that the state should instead bolster its utility-scale wind and solar energy industries, as those renewable sources don't require burning crops or proliferate coal practices that destroy the environment or pose health risks to Kentuckians. With No Wind, Negawatts are 'Paramount' Kentucky might not compare to California in terms of solar radiation, she continued, but it averages about as much solar radiation as New Jersey, a state with the second-most grid-connected solar capacity nationwide, at 127 megawatts. Kentucky has less than 0.1 megawatts in installed solar power. Wind energy, on the other hand, poses a real challenge to the Bluegrass State. Kentucky could potentially install about 61 megawatts in wind capacity, and only 0.01 percent of its land is considered a windy land area, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Neighboring states like Ohio have the potential to install 55,000 megawatts of wind power with 10.3 percent of land available for wind, while Indiana could install 148,000 megawatts and is one-third windy land area. Both groups agree that energy efficiency measures are paramount to picking away at Kentucky's dependency on coal-fired electricity. Industrial energy use in the state is nearly double the national average, and residents consume more energy per-capita than in almost any other state, according the energy cabinet. Peters said Kentucky had allotted $5 million in federal stimulus funds to hire energy managers in school districts statewide to retrofit and weatherize older buildings, install solar panels and minimize energy use so that savings can be poured into school curricula. According to the House clean energy bill, lower-income Kentuckians spend $1 of every $5 on home energy costs due to older housing and inefficient heating and cooling systems. Crowe said: \"Most people understand the problem it poses to society – it's less money for everything else that they need.\" • This article was changed on 25 February to reflect the wind capacity figures were potential installations, not actual installations"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/jul/22/first-molten-salt-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-22T10:32:36Z","webTitle":"The world's first molten salt concentrating solar power plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jul/22/first-molten-salt-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/jul/22/first-molten-salt-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"The world's first molten salt concentrating solar power plant","bodyText":"This month, the Italian utility Enel unveiled \"Archimede\", the first Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plant in the world to use molten salts for heat transfer and storage, and the first to be fully integrated to an existing combined-cycle gas power plant. Archimede is a 5 MW plant located in Priolo Gargallo (Sicily), within Europe's largest petrochemical district. The breakthrough project was co-developed by Enel, one of World's largest utilities, and ENEA, the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development. Several CSP plants already operate around the world, mainly in the US and Spain. They use synthetic oils to capture the Sun's energy in the form of heat, by using mirrors that beam sunlight onto a pipe where pressurised oil heats up to around 390°C. A heat exchanger is then used to boil water and run a conventional steam turbine cycle. Older CSP plants can only operate at daytime – when direct sunlight is available -, an issue that has been dealt with in recent years by introducing heat storage, in the form of molten salts. Newer CSP plants, as the many under construction in Spain, use molten salts storage to extend the plants' daily operating hours. Archimede is the first plant in the world to use molten salts not just to store heat but also to collect it from the sun in the first place. This is a competitive advantage, for a variety of reasons. Molten salts can operate at higher temperatures than oils (up to 550°C instead of 390°C), therefore increasing efficiency and power output of a plant. With the higher-temperature heat storage allowed by the direct use of salts, the plant can also extend its operating hours well further than an oil-operated CSP plant with molten salt storage, thus working 24 hours a day for several days in the absence of sun or during rainy days. This feature also enables a simplified plant design, as it avoids the need for oil-to-salts heat exchangers, and eliminates the safety and environmental concerns related to the use of oils (molten salts are cheap, non-toxic common fertilizers and do not catch fire, as opposed to synthetic oils currently used in CSP plants around the World). Last but not least, the higher temperatures reached by the molten salts enable the use of steam turbines at the standard pressure/temperature parameters as used in most common gas-cycle fossil power plants. This means that conventional power plants can be integrated – or, in perspective, replaced – with this technology without expensive retrofits to the existing assets. So why hasn't this technology come before? There are both political and technical issues behind this. Let's start with politics. The concept dates back to 2001, when Italian nuclear physicist and Nobel prize winner Carlo Rubbia, ENEA's President at the time, first started Research &amp; Development on molten salt technology in Italy. Rubbia has been a preminent CSP advocate for a long time, and was forced to leave ENEA in 2005 after strong disagreements with the Italian Government and its lack of convincing R&amp;D policies. He then moved to CIEMAT, the Spanish equivalent of ENEA. Under his guidance, Spain has now become world leader in the CSP industry. Luckily for the Italian industry, the Archimede project was not abandoned and ENEA continued its development till completion. There are also various technical reasons that have prevented an earlier development of this new technology. Salts tend to solidify at temperatures around 220°C, which is a serious issue for the continuous operation of a plant. ENEA and Archimede Solar Energy, a private company focusing on receiver pipes, developed several patents in order to improve the pipes' ability to absorbe heat, and the parabolic mirrors' reflectivity, therefore maximising the heat transfer to the fluid carrier. The result of these and several other technological improvements is a top-notch world's first power plant with a price tag of around 60 million euros. It's a hefty price for a 5 MW power plant, even compared to other CSP plants, but there is overwhelming scope for a massive roll-out of this new technology at utility scale in sunny regions like Northern Africa, the Middle East, Australia, the US. The Italian CSP association ANEST claims Italy could host 3-5,000 MW of CSP plants by 2020, with huge benefits also in terms of jobs creation and industrial know-how. A lot more can be achieved in the sun belt south of the Mediterranean Sea, and in the Middle East. If the roll out of solar photovoltaics in Italy is to offer any guidance (second largest market in the World in 2009), exciting times are ahead for Concentrating Solar Power. • Carlo Ombello blogs at opportunity:energy"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/aug/09/solar-photovoltaic-panels-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-09T13:43:28Z","webTitle":"Be wary of 'solar for free' offers, householders told","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/aug/09/solar-photovoltaic-panels-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/aug/09/solar-photovoltaic-panels-homes","fields":{"headline":"Be wary of 'solar for free' offers, householders told","bodyText":"Householders tempted by a rash of new \"solar for free\" offers could double their financial savings by paying for the panels themselves, experts have warned. The advice comes as installations of solar photovoltaic panels have exploded in the UK, with the number installed in four months in 2010 more than doubling on the whole of 2009 since a government financial incentive was launched in April. Spurred by the new feed-in tariff scheme that pays small scale generators of green electricity, a glut of companies are offering to fit thousands of homes with solar panels for free. Under the \"rent your roof\" model, the companies earn the tariff worth approximately £835 a year and the homeowner benefits from an annual saving of around £110 off their electricity bill. Homesun, ISIS Solar and A Shade Greener are three of the firms planning to do a deal with more than 120,000 homeowners by 2015, with Homesun promising to fit 2,000 homes in the next 12 months. But homeowners would almost certainly be better off paying for the solar panels themselves, even taking into account interest on a loan for the upfront cost of around £10,000 for a typical home. \"Looking at the figures, it [paying for panels yourself] looks like a better deal on paper,\" Liz Laine, energy expert at Consumer Focus, told the Guardian. She added that consumers should go into such deals \"with their eyes open\". Simon Osborn, policy advisor at Which?, said: \"If you have the means to pay for solar panels yourself, then you may well be better off arranging to have them installed yourself.\" Consumer Focus has also published a checklist of 24 questions people should ask before signing up, including who has liability if something goes wrong with the panels. Under the \"free solar\" model, a homeowner would save in the region of £2,750 on energy bills over 25 years, the length of the tariff offer. By paying for their own panels with a loan at 7.7% interest repaid over 10 years and earning income from the feed-in tariff, they could save around £6,506 over the same period. But the rise of such business models is exactly what the tariff was designed to do, say government and solar industry figures – drive innovation and solar take-up. Since the tariff started on 1 April, 12.12 megawatt peak (MWp) of solar panels have been installed at 4,822 homes, up from 3.8MWp in 2007, 4.42 MWp in 2008 and 5 MWp in 2009. Solar panel makers are responding to the demand, with Sharp announcing it will double annual production at its UK plant to 500 MW in December. The Wrexham plant, which currently employs 750 people, has seen the UK's share of its output rise from 1% to 10%. \"A large number of companies are setting up to do PV [solar photovoltaic panels],\" said Ray Noble, solar specialist at the Renewable Energy Association (REA). \"Things are moving from a cottage industry to building scale industry, and creating a high number of jobs too.\" One UK solar energy company, SolarCentury, has seen its direct employees and network of installers rise from 200 staff in January to 350 now and predicts it will employ more than 500 by 2011. The tariffs for solar and other renewable \"microgeneration\" are a key part of the UK's plan to cut carbon emissions and hit an EU target of generating a fifth of energy from renewable sources by 2020. The government forecasts installations driven by the tariff will account for 1.6% of the UK's electricity consumption in 10 years' time. However, the bill for the government and the taxpayer is unlimited. The government predicts the cost will be around £8 on every energy bill by 2020, though there is no cap and the scheme could potentially be a victim of its own success. Spain last week announced it was slashing its feed-in tariffs for solar PV panels by up to 45%, which some experts believe was a result of the tariff being set too high initially. The rate of the UK tariff, currently set at 41.3p per KWh for solar PV on existing properties, is fixed until 31 March 2012, when it will be reviewed before decreasing each year. There is disagreement between industry figures over whether the current solar gold rush could force an earlier review. \"I think the rate of uptake will be so fast the government will have to do an emergency review (of the rates) or possibly suspend them,\" Alistair Roberts, project manager at energy co-op Renew, recently told the ENDS Report. \"I don't think there's a risk of an emergency review in the next two years, as government needs as much help as possible to hit carbon targets,\" said Noble at the REA. Solar is currently the most expensive form of renewable electricity per unit of energy produced, though some in the UK solar industry believe rising energy prices and falling production costs will help it match fossil fuel prices by 2013. • This article was amended on 17 August 2010.

With him?\" I had, reluctantly, to confirm the news that, after two years of marriage, Toryboy and I had decided to try for and then successfully conceived a baby. \"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"But you had to know there was a chance this might happen.\" \"I know,\" she said sorrowfully. \"But I always hoped that your wrongness for each other would extend to your gametes. But, as they say in Jurassic Park, life finds a way. So…congratulations.\" And here I am, eight and a half months into pregnancy, an experience at once so profound and so mundane that you daily risk a dozen stress fractures across your psyche. My sister was nearly right, in fact, and it nearly didn't happen, not just because of the politics or because my husband and I largely regard each other as captive monkeys in a tiny domestic circus, capering and performing minor absurdities while the other looks on in bemused fascination, but because, as the Daily Mail daily warns, my aged generative organs had started packing up. We'd had a year of trying, failing, having scans and cystectomies, and of consulting doctors who took vials of blood, tested them and said, \"You really could try ovulating a bit now, you know?\" And I would nod my head obediently, go home and give it my best shot. But I've always been useless at multitasking. Then they started me on some drugs and before I knew where I was, I was staring at a urine-soaked stick that said I was three weeks up the duff. Whether we'll have cause to praise or curse the miracle of western medicine only the next 18 years or so will tell. Are we ready? This is the question that comes most frequently to gibber at me in the night. I have to break it down into smaller, more manageable sections to have any chance of answering satisfactorily enough to allow a return to sleep. Is the house ready? Major European land wars have been fought and won in less time than it has taken for this house to be rewired, repainted and its furniture rearranged to allow for a nursery, but the process is now complete. All has been done under duress. My nesting instinct has remained dormant throughout. The only part I have enjoyed is honing the emotional Dewey Decimal library system to which I subscribe and reshelving my 5,000 books accordingly. When the baby comes, he will go under \"First tier unread non-fiction – M\". He is a he, by the way. We saw it, unmistakably, at the first scan. I had wanted a girl, only because it seemed more of a comfortingly known quality within a rising tide of panicky unknowns. But when I see in my friends (all of whom are in the procreative, as in any other social, personal or professional endeavour, at least half a decade ahead of me) the agony that bringing up a girl entails, I am increasingly grateful that the gender lottery has awarded me a Y chromosome. The cliques girls form, the psychological acuity they manifest at such impossibly tender ages, their awful vulnerability to ideal diets (one friend already has a six-year-old who is turning down sweets and puddings because they'll make her fat) and all the other airbrushed images of perfect bodies with which they are bombarded, are painful to see. So although it's weird to be growing a penis inside me, I think it's ultimately for the best. Is the family ready? My dad was born ready for grandfatherhood. He has looked like a grandad for the past 30 years and has always possessed that interested, indulgent yet slightly remote air that characterises those one step removed from the messy business of childrearing. He is currently filling my and his freezers with homemade fish pies, shepherd's pies and chicken pies. With any luck, I won't have to cook until Toryboy minor is old enough to wield a box of fishfingers and a grill pan on his own. Result! My mother spent the first 30 weeks of the pregnancy regaling me with the probabilities of different kinds of disaster that could overtake me each week. How glad I was that I had taught her to Google. I myself have stayed off the internet and bought only one baby manual, and that in a weak moment – What To Expect When You're Expecting, which should be renamed What Not To Buy When You're Expecting Unless Schmaltzy Americanese Interspersed With A Few Salient Facts Is Your Thing – and still find I have somehow been furnished with more than enough information, misinformation, reassurance and fear-mongering about the whole process to see me safely through. At 37 weeks she relaxed, bought most of Mothercare and installed it in the nursery. Muslin squares, nappies, nappy disposal bin, muslin squares, wet wipes, more muslin squares, bum cream for everyone, a changing mat, some emergency muslin squares, a bottle steriliser, some bottles and some back-up emergency muslin squares. (I intend to have a crack at breastfeeding, feeling about lactation much as I do about windfarming or solar energy; it's foolish to look in the mouth a gift horse that, if harnessed properly, provides a cheap, convenient and deeply satisfying way of turning a natural resource into something fabulously valuable. Of course, if it ends up being roughly as painful as getting your nipples stuck in a turbine, I shall rethink.) Meanwhile, my lovely godmother has been knitting and sending me tiny matinee jackets that make me weep with delight as I pull them from their tissue paper and stack them reverently on the Too Good To Wear shelf, and my sister has been acquiring all the remaining stuff secondhand. I have a cot, a Moses basket, 1,800 long- and short-sleeved babygros, sleeping suits, bibs, a travel cot and a high chair. Is Toryboy ready? It has been a steep learning curve for a man who still cleaves to the Latin pronunciation of the word \"vagina\". (\"With a 'w'. And a hard 'g'. Wageena.\") But we have slowly moved on from the days when he blanched at the words \"amniotic fluid\", staggered at \"discharge\" used outside a military context and, when asked what he thought the placenta was, replied, \"A sort of edible mattress. The baby lies on it, nibbles at it and when it's all gone, decides it's time to be born.\" I can only hope there's nothing in heredity. But now he is, if not ready, then at least thicker-skinned, better informed and in possession of a hand-drawn map to the hospital which he claims to understand. He still asks perturbing questions from time to time. \"How long until he gets interesting?\" was the most recent one. \"How do you mean?\" I replied, putting down my book and reaching for my special tablets. \"How long before he can smile, crawl, talk to me about the Battle of Jutland, that sort of thing?\" \"Ah. Respectively, six weeks, nine months and, if he takes after you, a year, or after me, never.\" \"What do we do for the first six months, then?\" \"I look after him and you look after me.\" \"Right you are.\" Everything will work out eventually, I'm sure. I'm sure. Am I ready? Well, let's see. I'm ready to start walking normally again. I've had SPD for the past five months, which means my pelvis separated too fast, too far and too early, and rendered me incapable of walking, sitting or turning over in bed without much forethought, paracetamol and tears. And I'm ready to start eating sushi and soft cheese again, that's for damn sure. I haven't missed booze – I've never been much of a drinker – but it turns out that the body can crave raw fish and the risk of listeriosis just as passionately. Am I ready in any other way? No. Not at all. In no sense could I be said to be ready. It would be foolish even to suggest such a thing. In fact, it would be foolish to suggest that I am not actually crying in fear as I type this. Yes, of course we thought it through. We did doctors, drugs and general anaesthesia to make sure we got from there to here, but really – who is ever ready? The best that can be said is that in some ways I am prepared. I know I want an epidural. Actually, what I want is an elective caesarean (I planned to be wheeled out of the operating theatre shouting, \"And anyone who wants to judge me can kiss my untorn perineum!\") but you can't get one on the NHS without creating the kind of fuss I find myself, even in the most hormone-swamped state, constitutionally incapable of creating – so spinal blockading it will have to be. Toryboy is against the idea. I made the mistake of allowing him to come with me to NCT classes and he has fallen, to an unexpected degree, for what I am going to characterise briefly yet unfairly as their hippy bullshit. By some malevolent quirk of fate, it turns out that Tory individualism overlaps with the NCT's anti-medical authoritarianism stance and unites them in a way I find Not Helpful. \"But it's an injection into your spine!\" they cry as one. \"Yes – before something the size of a baby passes slowly through something that is most definitely not and is never supposed to be!\" I cry back. \"But it prolongs labour!\" is the next refrain. \"Painlessly!\" I shout back. These people are so strange. \"It can set off a cascade of interventions!\" \"I'm numb from the waist down! They can send up a miniaturised team of scientists in exploratory submarines à la Fantastic Voyage if they want! What do I care? \"But you might be paralysed for the rest of your days!\" \"Worth it,\" I reply, and I mean it from the bottom of my about-to-be-quite-traumatised-enough-thank-you bottom. They try to convince me by telling me about the naturally produced wonder that is oxytocin and showing me a fake pelvis to demonstrate that part of it is hinged to allow smooth passage for the baby. Yes, well, allow me to make two points. First, any naturally produced hormone at this point is the equivalent of frozen low-fat yoghurt compared with the Häagen-Dazs cookie dough ice-cream of an epidural. Give me the good stuff, and no one gets hurt, least of all me. Second, I can see the coccyx wiggling, yes. I understand that if I have to lie on my back because my legs don't work any more, I will be unable to use this pivoting advantage. But still… it's not a huge evolutionary leap, is it? It's more a gesture of goodwill by nature, I feel. To hear them go on about it, you'd think the birthing pelvis transformed into a catflap or something. I am more than willing to trade this minuscule benefit for the miracle of synthetic drugs pumped in industrial quantities into my grateful body. Case, and coccyx, rests. (For the avoidance of doubt – these are my feelings about myself. And I must laud the kindness and patience of my NCT teacher when presented with someone who basically wanted her pregnancy sponsored by ICI. If you had, are planning on having, or can contemplate with anything approaching equanimity the mere idea of one day in the far distant future experiencing a natural birth, well, I couldn't be happier for or more impressed with you. Good luck, you're amazing, truly, well done and hallelujah. Each, absolutely, to her own. And I will be drugged up to the eyeballs for as long as humanly possible. See you on the other side.) But am I ready for the long, hard, unremitting slog of being a parent, no matter how potentially joyous the journey may be? No, of course not. I hope I won't be entirely incompetent. I think I will be able to put a tiny, helpless bundle of needs and desires before my own. I think all the stuff I've bought him complies with European health and safety standards. I don't think I have a teetering stack of unrealistic hopes and expectations for him or for me lurking anywhere in my psyche that will threaten to bury us in the months and years to come. I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be. I mean, really – when you've got this many muslin squares to fall back on, how wrong can things go? • This article was amended on 11 May 2011.

I asked for a quote for my property and explained there might be planning permission problems because I live in a conservation area. The salesman said his company had carried out installations in similar areas with no problems, so I paid a deposit of £2,780 by cheque on the promise that it would be returned if planning permission was declined. A few months later, planning permission was turned down and a fight started to get my deposit back. I eventually received four postdated cheques for £695.

I must admit to being sceptical about the benefits of this deal as it would have taken some considerable time to recoup the proposed final price of over £8,000, even if the 70% energy saving claim was true. If you look at this article in this week's Money, you'll see that you should be able to buy solar panel systems for half that price. I spoke to David Mead, a director of the business, who blamed cash-flow problems but said: \"It was never our intention not to pay the deposit back.\" He promised he would arrange for the remainder of the refund to be sent. I thought this seemed a little too good to be true and, sure enough, you received a letter a few days later informing you that Sunmaster Solar was about to go into liquidation and actually signed four days before the date I spoke to Mead.

Happily, designers this week unveiled plans for a \"moving island\" that renders the conundrum redundant. Designs for the WHY 58x38 were unveiled at the Abu Dhabi yacht show this week. The vessel is the result of a collaboration between Monaco yacht brand Wally and Parisian fashion house Hermès. \"Everybody's dream is to live on an island, in complete freedom, without constraint, with the independence that only self sufficiency can provide,\" said Wally's president, Luca Bassani Antivari. \"A piece of land with a beautiful villa partly fulfils this aspiration because it is static. A yacht offers the freedom to move, but does not have the space of a property. WHY has it all.\" The motor yacht is, as the name suggests, 58 metres long and 38 metres wide, providing a total guest surface area of 3,400sq metres, and weighs in at 2,400 tonnes. It boasts a maximum speed of 14 knots, and a price tag, when built, of $160 million. Upon completion the yacht will be capable of catering for up to 12 guests, enjoying 280sq metres of space each – perfect for an intimate getaway. Its dozen passengers, attended by a crew of 20, will be able to congregate across three floors, consisting of the \"master space\", \"guest space\" and \"common space\". The 200sq metre master area covers the entire third floor, while the guest space, incorporating five bedrooms, spans the second tier. The common space, at the bottom of the ship, has a 25-metre swimming pool, cinema, music room, dining room, and what the designers call \"a perfect 30m beach\". Although work is yet to begin on the WHY its website does boast a snazzy promotional video – featuring a scale wooden model . \"I love the sea,\" said Antivari, \"and so I also love all of the different ways to enjoy the sea, whether by sail boat or by motorboat. \"Being an extremist, when I sail, I like to be both comfortable and sail at speed. If I'm on a motorboat then I want it to be the fastest. If I'm on a comfortable boat, then it has to be the most comfortable.\" In addition to comfort, the craft's creators are keen that their yacht is environmentally friendly, and anticipate the yacht generating 500kw of solar energy a day through 900sq metres of photovoltaic panels covering its roof and hull. According to the designers, the WHY should use far less energy than a yacht of the same size, saving up to 200 tonnes of diesel per year. Frugal fuel consumption will enable it to cross the Atlantic four times without refuelling, according to the designers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/jul/06/no-more-bps-deserts-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-06T07:30:45Z","webTitle":"No more BPs: we must turn our deserts into solar power | Ulrich Beck","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/jul/06/no-more-bps-deserts-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/jul/06/no-more-bps-deserts-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"No more BPs: we must turn our deserts into solar power","bodyText":"Why hasn't the Deepwater Horizon spill, one of the worst ecological disasters in US history, led to a storming of the Bastille of Big Oil? Why aren't the most urgent problems of our time – environmental crises and climate change – being confronted with the same energy, idealism and optimism as past tragedies of poverty, tyranny and war? The current state of the oil industry is reminiscent of the ancien regime on the eve of the revolution. The Gulf of Mexico disaster has many faces. BP's incompetence is one. But there is also the failure of legislative oversight. What until recently was praised as an economic stimulus policy is now being criticised as \"collusion with scoundrels\". The BP boss, Tony Hayward, dons sackcloth and ashes and speaks of an \"unprecedented series of mishaps\". At a hearing in the US House of Representatives, a Democrat congressman confronted him with the list of BP accidents and revealed another truth: there are still hundreds, indeed thousands of oil platforms in this region alone, but also throughout the world, for which the other oil majors are responsible. To beat up on BP alone is shabby. Deepwater Horizon is the symbol of the demise of a global experiment: a model of progress and development based on exploiting fossil fuels. No one can claim they didn't see it coming. For two centuries machines and engines have been driven by combustion and steam. Nonetheless, a generation has grown up knowing that the fossil fuel industry is burning up its own foundations. More than a century ago, Max Weber foresaw the end of oil-based capitalism when he spoke of a time when \"the last hundredweight of fossil fuel is burnt up\". Yet why should a world that every day receives many times its energy needs from the sun, a free and inexhaustible source of energy, look on impassively as clouds of oil spew into the deep sea? Right now, we need the celebrated innovative power of capital and the utopian enthusiasm of engineers. \"Swords into ploughshares\" was the motto of the peace movement. \"Deserts into solar power\" should be our slogan now. As the oil gushes forth, the truth is coming to light. \"We underestimated the complications involved in drilling for oil at a depth of 1,500 metres,\" confesses Hayward. Nobody possesses the necessary safety technology to prevent or respond to such a scenario. Engineers have bored to ever greater depths on the assumption that the risks could be controlled. The depressing truth is that the \"residual risk\" of deep-sea drilling rests on ignorance. BP estimated that, in the event the safety technology should fail, it would take two to four years for the oil to discharge completely into the sea. Faced with this long-term catastrophe, Barack Obama has declared \"war\" on the dark enemy from the deep. But military thinking is no help, because the greatest dangers do not come from enemy states, but from the side-effects of economic, scientific and political decisions. What is the commander-in-chief supposed to do? Send out his fleet of submarines to torpedo the oil leak? Launch a military strike against the management of BP and its sponsors? In the war against terror, George W Bush held Afghanistan and Iraq responsible for al-Qaida. Should Obama follow his example in this Gulf war by making Britain, as BP's assumed country of origin, responsible for the catastrophic attack on the American coast? Obama stresses the adjective \"British\" when speaking of the energy company, as though this were 1814 and British troops were again besieging Washington DC. BP itself has long since been engulfed by globalisation. British Petroleum is not British. In 1998 the company merged with US oil giant Amoco and took the opportunity to abandon the adjective \"British\" and replace it with \"Beyond\". BP, we were invited to think, was the beginning of the future without oil. And the globalised BP cannot be pinned down: it is jointly owned by Americans, its drilling rig was built by Koreans, and it pays corporation tax in Bern. Yet just as Chernobyl was dismissed as a failure of a \"communist\" reactor, Deepwater Horizon is now being blamed on the country with which the US used to enjoy a \"special relationship\". Obama needs, in his own words, \"an ass to kick\". Postwar prosperity in the west laid the foundation for environmental awareness. Now environmental awareness must provide the basis for prosperity in developing countries. These countries will adopt sustainable policies to the extent that the affluent countries invest in their development and adopt a new vision of prosperity and growth. China, India, Brazil and African countries will not agree to any approach that tries to limit their efforts to achieve economic parity – and rightly so. But does the future lie with a global environmental policy based on carbon trading, which amounts to the global sale of indulgences for CO2 sins? Or will we have the courage to invent and realise a new age of solar energy in which prosperity is not an environmental sin, and when everything from cows to electric toothbrushes is blamed for contributing to CO2 emissions? \"It is time to introduce clean forms of energy,\" Obama has said. If he can ring in an era that is truly Beyond Petroleum, Big Oil's Bastille will be doomed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2009/nov/28/copenhagen-solar-power-feedin-tariffs","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-28T00:06:45Z","webTitle":"Letters: Carbon fears and solar hopes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/28/copenhagen-solar-power-feedin-tariffs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/nov/28/copenhagen-solar-power-feedin-tariffs","fields":{"headline":"Carbon fears and solar hopes","bodyText":"How can the forthcoming assembly in Copenhagen (Comment, 27 November) possibly come to worthwhile agreements for slowing down climate change when any conceivable progress is bedevilled by blatant contradictions? Take cars: world production of motor vehicles, around 72 million annually in normal times, has apparently fallen to about 60 million in this recession. From the climate change point of view, that should be a reason for rejoicing. But of course the car and oil industries, as well as tax-losing governments, have done all they can to reverse this reduction. Furthermore, there appears to be no intention anywhere to diminish the virtually universal need for private cars for all of life's normal activities: getting to work, to shops, to schools, to relations and friends, and often for holidays. This almost total dependence on cars is in the nature of an addiction, foreseeable many years ago. So the recent discoveries of enormous additional oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere bring euphoria to the oil-and-motor complex but should increase anxiety for everybody else: has anyone calculated how much additional CO2 will be added to the atmosphere in the course of burning all this oil? How does the Copenhagen assembly propose to resolve this contradiction, which is just one of many? Without effective resolutions, the outlook is indeed very bad. Professor Gustav Born London • Government procrastination over the feed-in tariff levels is not only an environmental concern, but the UK economy will be denied a massive opportunity if the Department of Energy and Climate Change doesn't get this scheme right (Renewables policy hopes dashed by tariffs row, 23 November). Solar energy is one of the most viable small-scale energy generation methods. However, political backing is essential for small-scale renewables to become commonplace in the UK. The government must set robust feed-in tariff fee levels to create a market to prove that solar power can have a sustainable future in the UK. The solar energy sector has the potential be worth £27bn, create thousands of jobs, slash carbon emissions and help to address fuel poverty. The government needs to turn this vision into a reality. Paul Roche Director, SIG Sustainable Solutions • However desirable, wind turbines are contentious. They are obtrusive and have moving parts that are subject to wear and tear. They need expensive connections to the grid. Photovoltaic panels are less obtrusive and have no moving parts. They can last 20 years or more. The domestic versions can feed directly into the grid. In Germany, encouraged by feed-in tariffs of 10%, they have been extensively employed. Here, for those of us who have seen our return from banks shrink to near zero, they would constitute a welcome investment. We could congratulate ourselves on helping to widen the diversity of supply that we are told is a future essential. Yet in his recent report to parliament Ed Miliband made no mention of them. Worse, we are told that the miserly proposed feed-in tariffs for the UK of 4%-5% are being resisted not only by the Treasury but, remarkably, by the nuclear industry. Would it be too much to hope for a change of heart? Emeritus professor David Walker University of Sheffield • We installed a couple of solar hot-water panels this spring. They may not be truly \"economic\" yet, but they have filled us with enthusiasm. Just to turn off the gas boiler all summer and heat all our hot water by sunlight was most exciting. We would love to add a photovoltaic system, but without a realistic feed-in tariff and a reasonable return on investment, the decision is difficult. Utility companies could afford it, and if our enthusiasm to invest our savings in microgeneration is anything to go by, there is a huge opportunity for employment and GDP enhancement for the UK. Just look at Germany's 250,000 employees and new industry as a result of encouraging Joe Public to invest. We've done the grey water collection, the water meter and the insulation bit; now we need encouragement to spend – particularly when the current economic climate naturally leads people to hesitate.

David Kidney, an energy minister, will be questioned at a summit in London organised by Renewables UK, formerly the British Wind Energy Association, over its failure to pass a statutory instrument needed for the introduction of the tariff. The power companies told the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) that it should introduce the legislation before Christmas if they were to be ready to start the clean energy scheme by the agreed date of 1 April. The statutory instrument giving energy regulator Ofgem the power to introduce the tariff at the start of next month has still not been laid in front of parliament, despite needing a 21-day lead-in time for it to become active. \"The government has basically got a narrowing window of 10 days now,\" said one key industry figure, who asked not to be named. \"DECC officials are being given a hard time about the continuing delays.\" A spokeswoman for DECC denied there was any threat to the tariff's start date, saying it remained committed to 1 April, while Ofgem said it was doing all it could to ensure the tariff was introduced on time. An Ofgem spokesman said: \"We will ensure that all the core functions are in place for administering the scheme for when we go live on 1 April.\" Asked what would happen if the relevant law was not in place for the regulator to carry out its role, the spokesman replied: \"That is a question you must ask DECC.\" Utilities helped by the Business Council for Sustainable Development complain that they are not being able to plan properly because of the uncertainty. They want to be clear on exactly how they will need to handle power being sold on to them from wind turbines and solar panels on homes. The government is hoping to emulate the success of Germany, where a generous feed-in tariff has led to a massive solar energy sector developing. But the delays in the UK also come at a time of growing unease about the cost of subsidising micro-generation, compared with industrial-scale windfarms or alternatives such as nuclear. Until recently, critics have come from those traditionally opposed to wind or solar power, but they have been joined by the likes of George Monbiot, the green campaigner and Guardian columnist. He launched an attack on the government's feed-in tariff earlier this week, saying it would cost more than £8bn and only save 7m tonnes of carbon by 2020. \"The money will come from customers in the form of higher bills. It would make sense if we didn't know the technologies the scheme will reward are comically inefficient,\" wrote Monbiot, who believes the tariff is nothing more than a \"scam\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/jul/16/george-papandreou-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-16T19:06:32Z","webTitle":"Facing an Olympian task - interview with the Greek prime minister, George Papandreou","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/16/george-papandreou-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/jul/16/george-papandreou-interview","fields":{"headline":"Reinvigorating Greece is an Olympian task for prime minister Papandreou","bodyText":"When George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, swims, he cuts through the water with agility and speed.

As the politician who has led them through the country's worst financial crisis in decades, his nine months in office have also been marked with more high drama than most as the governing socialists have tried not only to keep bankruptcy at bay but cope with a state now universally acknowledged to have failed those it was meant to serve. \"It has been crisis management, day in, day out,\" he told the Guardian in his first major interview since Greece received €110bn (£92bn) of emergency international loans in May. \"We knew that we had high debt and a high deficit with high inequality, high unemployment and negative growth … but we had no idea about the depth and breadth of the problems or the lack of good, transparent, democratic governance. When we found the deficit as high as it was [13.6% of GDP], we wanted to be absolutely transparent.\" Transparency is another hallmark of the 58-year-old son and grandson of former prime ministers, but in Papandreou's case it has come at a cost – unprecedented austerity measures. It is a price that fellow progressive leaders, economists, academics and opinion makers, gathering in Poros to attend Papandreou's annual international talk-shop, the Symi symposium, readily agree could still plunge Greece into social turmoil, poverty and despair. For Papandreou there have been sleepless nights – even if he has displayed a rare coolness under pressure. As the head of Socialist International, a global leftist network, he is not immune to the charge that, because of his government's stringent public-sector cuts, the wrong people are now being made to pay for decades of profligacy, corruption, cronyism and tax evasion – chronic ills that have helped accrue a debt mountain in excess of €300bn, by far the EU's largest. In the last week, alone, the ruling Pasok party has passed legislation overhauling the pension system, shaking up labour laws and paring back benefits and allowances – rights that, unions say, have taken decades to win. On Wednesday, it was the turn of policemen, firefighters and coast guard officials to take to the streets and protest against \"barbarism\". \"Of course I feel very bad that we had to take these measures and that our financial sovereignty is under the tutelage of the so-called troika [the EU, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank]. It's not a happy state to be in,\" said Papandreou. \"And the most painful thing is to take measures against people who were not responsible for the crisis … But you have to make tough decisions in politics. You can theorise about the options you have but in reality they are very specific. The option was: \"Do we default or do we take these measures? Do we lose our pension system or do we save what we can? … it was a question of existence, of being able to pay civil servants their wages or losing that possibility\" Alone among Greek prime ministers, Papandreou has publicly declared that re-election is not his aim. If it means changing Greece \"and mind-sets\" for the better he will push through his modernising policies, whatever the political cost. Already, he says, it feels like \"a small revolution\" as he has forged ahead with reforms, including new tax laws and a radical decentralisation plan, that no other prime minister has dared to enact in modern times. \"My hope is that we will turn Greece into maybe the most transparent country in the world with everything on the web.\" Making the Greek economy more competitive by tackling corruption and bureaucracy are top priorities. So, too, is attracting badly needed foreign investment – and mobilising the younger generation to become a motor of change by setting up innovative start-ups and participating in grand schemes to \"green\" the economy by utilising Greece's untapped potential through wind and solar energy. The irony is not lost on Papandreou, or his aides, that much of this amounts to the dismantling of the state his father, Andreas, set up as Greece's first elected socialist leader in the early 80s. \"I have always said I will be in politics to serve as best as I can and it will take me wherever it will take me,\" says Papandreou. \"As long as I feel I am doing what I think is right and just for my country, for the Greek people, that is enough for me. Saving Greece from this crisis was the first thing on the agenda. We are now on a much more normalised road.\" But he also concedes that the path ahead is strewn with difficulties. After months of angry protests and bloody violence, culminating in the deaths of three bank employees in May, it is clear that the Greek people are not prepared to take austerity lying down. For many, the recent respite is the lull before the storm – with worsening recession, galloping unemployment and mounting dissent within Papandreou's own party looming on the horizon. He accepts that in a nation where almost a quarter of the population lives under the poverty line, communication could be better. In the months ahead, as measures really begin to bite, there will, he says, be greater urgency to \"get out more into the neighbourhoods and countryside\" to convey the message that Greeks must bite the bullet of austerity in return for seeing their country emerge reinvigorated out of the crisis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2009/apr/22/budget-energy-efficient-housing","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2009-04-22T14:44:09Z","webTitle":"Green homes cash 'will make little difference'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/apr/22/budget-energy-efficient-housing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2009/apr/22/budget-energy-efficient-housing","fields":{"headline":"Green homes cash 'will make little difference'","bodyText":"The chancellor, Alistair Darling, today announced an extra £100m for councils to build new energy-efficient homes. But the funding, part of a £500m package in the budget to kickstart housebuilding, was dismissed as \"a drop in the ocean\" by the National Housing Federation (NHF). A spokesman for the federation said: \"It's a little bit of a drop in the ocean when you look at the challenge to improve the energy efficiency of millions of homes.\" The Local Government Association (LGA) said only £50m of the package would be given directly to councils, the other half would be available to borrow. An LGA spokesman said: \"This is disappointing as it amounts to under 1% of the government's total planned investment in housing over the next two years. This is only enough money to build 1,000-2,000 new homes in the next two years. With five million people on social housing waiting lists that's not the sort of impact on the housing crisis that we'd like to see.\" Darling told MPs that the £500m package would \"kickstart building on housing projects, stalled because of the credit crunch, delivering thousands of new homes\". David Orr, the chief executive of the NHF, which represents England's housing associations, welcomed the money but warned it would not go far enough to tackle the housing shortage. He said: \"We now fear that because the government has failed to back a comprehensive housebuilding programme the number of homes delivered this financial year will slump to an 88-year low of 70,000, while the number of people on social housing waiting lists will simply soar to unparalleled levels.\" Many private developments have been mothballed or not even started as builders struggle in the credit crunch, which has also made it harder for people to raise the mortgage finance they need to buy a new home. Building companies have seen their share prices plummet amid concerns that they could breach their banking covenants, while they have also been forced to write down the value of their land banks and the sector has shed thousands of jobs. The problems in the housebuilding sector have cast into doubt the viability of government targets to have 240,000 new homes a year built by 2016, with just 105,000 new homes started in England during 2008. The chancellor also announced a £435m programme to improve the energy efficiency of social housing, businesses and public buildings. The chief executive of the Tenant Services Authority, Peter Marsh, said: \"Energy efficiency delivers real benefits for social housing tenants who are concerned about their energy bills and want to ensure their home makes a contribution to sustainable living.\" But Orr said the level of funding was insufficient. \"While we hope this announcement will kickstart a serious drive to green our nation's housing stock, ministers should simply have put more money into this scheme – as the scale of the challenge is just so great,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2010/feb/20/guardian-green-list-2010-places-worldwide","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-20T00:08:06Z","webTitle":"Guardian Green Travel List 2010 | Small places to stay: worldwide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/feb/20/guardian-green-list-2010-places-worldwide","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2010/feb/20/guardian-green-list-2010-places-worldwide","fields":{"headline":"Small places to stay: worldwide","bodyText":"Can Martí, Ibiza An organic farm in the quieter north-east of the island.

It hopes the new tariff will boost the growth of \"micro-generation\" by small-scale wind turbines, solar panels or hydro power. But there are fears in the renewable energy industry that the Department of Energy and Climate Change will make little or no upward adjustment to the tariff levels for clean electricity it proposed last year. The DECC has been heavily lobbied by the big energy firms, and tomorrow's announcement has been delayed several times. The Clean Energy Cashback, or feed-in tariff, will reward households, businesses or communities by paying above-market rates for the electricity they produce and feed into the grid. When the tariffs were unveiled last year, they were criticised for offering rates of return too low to encourage people to install micro-generation plants. Germany introduced feed-in tariffs a decade ago offering double-digit rates of return and sparked a green revolution. But Alan Simpson, special adviser to energy and climate change secretary Ed Miliband, fears the battle to get higher tariffs has been lost and believes the DECC will stick to its aim of getting just 2% of the UK's electricity from smaller scale renewables by 2020. He says three times that would be easily achievable at an additional cost per household energy bill of £1.20 a year. \"Germany needed starting rates that gave a 10% return on investment to kickstart their leap to the top of the renewables league. Britain needs to do the same,\" he wrote in a letter to Gordon Brown last week. \"At the moment, we don't have a renewables industry. We have survivors; firms that exist despite government policy rather than because of it. \"A coalition of groups – from farmers to the fuel-poor, environmental NGOs to eco-builders, ethical bankers to engineers and installers – has been lobbying DECC officials for all they are worth. But little seems to be working.\" Andrew Melchior, head of the EIC Partnership, which is setting up the Horizon energy co-operative in Manchester, said his business was only viable because of an EU grant. The feed-in tariff would not be enough, he warned. \"The Germans created an efficient industry that is able to provide solar installations at competitive prices. The UK does not have this industry, more a collection of enthusiasts experimenting with new technologies or proponents well versed in the pragmatics and dark arts of exploiting pots of grant funding. \"We must provide a decent incentive so that the public begin to accept the concept of economically viable solar energy in the UK.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2007/dec/29/solarpower.renewableenergy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2007-12-29T23:07:56Z","webTitle":"Solar energy 'revolution' brings green power closer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/dec/29/solarpower.renewableenergy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2007/dec/29/solarpower.renewableenergy","fields":{"headline":"Solar energy 'revolution' brings green power closer","bodyText":"The holy grail of renewable energy came a step closer yesterday as thousands of mass-produced wafer-thin solar cells printed on aluminium film rolled off a production line in California, heralding what British scientists called \"a revolution\" in generating electricity. The solar panels produced by a Silicon Valley start-up company, Nanosolar, are radically different from the kind that European consumers are increasingly buying to generate power from their own roofs. Printed like a newspaper directly on to aluminium foil, they are flexible, light and, if you believe the company, expected to make it as cheap to produce electricity from sunlight as from coal. Yesterday Nanosolar said its order books were full until mid-2009 and that a second factory would soon open in Germany where demand for solar power has rocketed. Britain was unlikely to benefit from the technology for some years because other countries paid better money for renewable electricity, it added. \"Our first solar panels will be used in a solar power station in Germany,\" said Erik Oldekop, Nanosolar's manager in Switzerland. \"We aim to produce the panels for 99 cents [50p] a watt, which is comparable to the price of electricity generated from coal. We cannot disclose our exact figures yet as we are a private company but we can bring it down to that level. That is the vision we are aiming at.\" He added that the first panels the company was producing were aimed for large- scale power plants rather than for homeowners, and that the cost benefits would be in the speed that the technology could be deployed. \"We are aiming to make solar power stations up to 10MW in size. They can be up and running in six to nine months compared to 10 years or more for coal-powered stations and 15 years for nuclear plants. Solar can be deployed very quickly,\" said Oldekop. Nanosolar is one of several companies in Japan, Europe, China and the US racing to develop different versions of \"thin film\" solar technology. It is owned by internet entrepreneur Martin Roscheisen who sold his company to Yahoo for $450m and, with the help of the founders of Google, the US government and other entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, has invested nearly $300m in commercialising the technology. At the moment solar electricity costs nearly three times as much as conventional electricity to generate, but Nanosolar's developments are thought to have halved the price of producing conventional solar cells at a stroke. \"This is the world's lowest-cost solar panel, which we believe will make us the first solar manufacturer capable of profitably selling solar panels at as little as 99 cents a watt,\" said Roscheisen yesterday. However, the company, which claims to lead the \"third wave\" of solar electricity, is notoriously secretive and has not answered questions about its panels' efficiency or their durability. It is quite open about wanting to restrict access to the technology to give it a market advantage. Jeremy Leggett, chief executive of Britain's leading solar energy company, Solar Century, said that it would be \"breathtaking\" if the technology proved as efficient as projected by the company. \"This is a revolution. But people are going to be amazed at other developments taking place in solar technologies. We will be thrilled if this technology is as efficient as the company says. It will not change the direction of solar power in itself. Spectacular improvements are also being made in other parts of the industry,\" he said. Figures released yesterday by the Earth Policy Institute in Washington showed that solar electricity generation was now the fastest-growing electricity source, doubling its output every two years. It is now attracting government and venture capital money on an unprecedented scale. The technology is particularly exciting because it can be used nearly everywhere. \"You are talking about printing rolls of the stuff, printing it on garages, anywhere you want it. It really is a big deal in terms of altering the way we think about solar,\" said Dan Kamman, director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley. \"The next industrial revolution will be based on these clean green technologies,\" said Tony Juniper, director of Friends of the Earth. \"If the UK wants to be part of it, as Gordon Brown says it does, then it needs to rethink its strategies. Ministers have so far shown a distinct lack of vision.\" Power from light Photovoltaic (PV) devices convert light into electrical energy. PV cells are made of semiconductor materials such as silicon. When light shines on a PV cell, the energy is transferred to electrons in the atoms of the PV cell. These electrons become part of the electrical flow, or current, in an electrical circuit. First wave photovoltaic cell used thick silicon-wafer cells but were cumbersome and costly. The second generation of photovoltaic materials were developed about 10 years ago and use very thin silicon layers. These brought the price down dramatically but still need expensive vacuum processes in their construction. The third wave of PV, now being developed by firms such as Nanosolar, can print directly on to other materials and does not use silicon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/102286","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-16T21:30:33Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: How India can help stabilise Afghanistan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/102286","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/102286","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: How India can help stabilise Afghanistan","bodyText":"Wednesday, 28 March 2007, 12:06 C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 NEW DELHI 001485 SIPDIS SIPDIS SCA FOR AMBASSADOR WILLIAM B.

HOWARD-KESHAP E-MAIL 09MAR07 NEW DELHI 00001485 001.2 OF 005 Classified By: PolCouns Ted Osius for Reasons 1.4 (B,D) 1. (C) SUMMARY: As requested, this cable contains specific, concrete ideas for opportunities for India to use soft power in helping Afghanistan's reconstruction, with the broader objective of seeking ways for the U.S. to synergize its efforts with Afghanistan's \"natural ally.\" Some of the ideas are new, many are not, but the intent is to develop a brief reference for the opportunities which are available. India has significant aid to offer, including affordable Indian professionals (versus more expensive Westerners), energy production, and training capabilities in areas such as law enforcement, election commission training, foreign service training, and administrative services, much of which can be relatively cheaply accomplished in India. 2. (C) Trilateral cooperation on infrastructure and capacity building projects among the U.S., Japan and India could also bring economies of scale and/or effective divisions of labor. Transit through Pakistan would greatly enhance India's ability to contribute to Afghan reconstruction. We would also have to overcome Pakistani objection to Indian force protection if India is to expand its role. The recommendations contained herein come with the caveat that Post has only an outsider's view of Afghanistan, and realizes that Embassy Kabul and Washington (not to mention the government of Afghanistan) are best placed to identify Afghanistan's needs. END SUMMARY. Background: A Natural Ally, Already Giving Generously ------ 3. (C) Indian experts on Afghanistan, such as XXXXXXXXXXXX believe India is well-regarded and liked in Afghanistan, and calls India a \"natural ally\" to the Afghan people. India and Afghanistan are considered to be close, and share good relations. There are no diplomatic issues between the two countries, nor is there any significant political or popular opposition in India to aid to Afghanistan. As Afghanistan transitions to a better future, diverse, democratic, multi-ethnic India can serve as a giant role model. India is already a major donor to Afghan reconstruction, with around $750 million pledged -- making it, we believe, the fifth largest donor country -- and is already involved in projects in a wide range of sectors, including electricity, road construction, and telecommunications, and has even in the past contributed as it could to agriculture and health. Indian aid to Afghanistan is tempered by what New Delhi perceives as Pakistani intransigence, which questions India's motives and does not allow for much cheaper overland transit of goods, personnel or equipment. NEW DELHI 00001485 002.2 OF 005 WHAT INDIA CAN OFFER ------ Affordable Professionals ------ 4. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX when asked to highlight India's contribution, immediately answered that the best bang for the buck comes from India's professionals, specifically engineers. India's relatively low-paid engineers are more cost-efficient employees than those from Western countries, XXXXXXXXXXXX maintains. Without having specific figures on hand, XXXXXXXXXXXX estimated that Afghanistan could hire many times the number of India engineers to live and work in the country for the same price as one European. Indian engineers are currently engaged in power construction, public works projects, telecommunications infrastructure, and road construction. Affordable Training ------ 5. (C) The GOI is already bringing Afghans to India for training in various fields much more cheaply than what most other countries can offer. From 2002-2006, more than 1300 Afghans were trained in various Indian institutions and universities, and since March 2006, India has offered short-term training courses for 500 Afghans annually. In addition, 500 Afghan students annually will be offered graduate and post-graduate education in India. XXXXXXXXXXXX believes that by bringing Afghans to India for training, Afghanistan is able to train five-to-six times as many people as would otherwise be possible. Training programs exist in law enforcement, diplomacy (at India's Foreign Service Institute), urban development, English, agriculture development, IT, civil administration parliamentary procedures and other capacity building areas. We believe India would welcome ideas for other areas that would match Afghanistan's needs. Given India's experience in running elections for a billion people, one new area to consider would be training, either in India or Afghanistan, for Afghanistan's central/local election commissions and election officials. Another new area where India would seem to match up well would be training for parliamentary procedures and support, political party organization, and local administration. If needed again, India could likely revive past training programs for Afghans in justice, journalism, civil aviation, or the small programs on marketing and enterprise development for women and in-service teacher training. Administrative Service ------ 6. (C) India is already in the process of sending some NEW DELHI 00001485 003.2 OF 005 thirty Indian Administrative Service officers to Afghanistan (ref a). As other ministries and government offices are identified as needing outside expertise, India could be asked to increase these numbers and administrative programs could be specifically targeted to receive specialized training. Affordable Energy ----- 7. (C) The India-led Pul-e-Khumri to Kabul power transmission line is running ahead of schedule and on budget, and should provide significant energy to Afghanistan. India is contributing to further energy production with the Salma Dam project in Herat province, and has some smaller projects ongoing, including in solar energy production. India has expertise in power generation through mountainous and difficult terrain, and could be called on for additional assistance in this area. Indian firms are also global leaders in wind power. The best incentive for full-scale Indian assistance, not to mention private sector investment, would be a political agreement which would allow power lines to transit Pakistan, connecting India all the way through to Central Asia. People-to-People ------ 8. (C) India was proud to provide food aid (in the form of high protein biscuits) during the 2002 \"Back to School\" campaign, as well as humanitarian assistance in earthquake relief in 2002. Should such a need arise again, India should be one of the first countries Afghanistan turns to. People-to-people exchanges are also popular in India with several NGOs promoting youth and cultural exchanges with counterparts in Pakistan and the U.S. If and when appropriate, India should be encouraged to develop exchange programs with symbolic significance, such as inviting the Afghan national women's soccer team, or kids from the Afghan Youth Sports Exchange (maximum exposure if they have anyone willing to come to play cricket). As is being done in another exchange program here, young Afghans could be invited to visit top Indian (or locally-based American?) corporations in the field of their interest to take on short internships. Numerous other possibilities exist, but one other area that seems ripe is Bollywood. We understand Bollywood movies are wildly popular in Afghanistan, so willing Indian celebrities could be asked to travel to Afghanistan to help bring attention to social issues there. Straight Donations ------ 9. (C) In addition to humanitarian and medical supplies provided in 2002, India has provided direct donations of materiel to Afghanistan, and could likely fill specific requests in the future. Our research indicates that India NEW DELHI 00001485 004.2 OF 005 has given buses, minibuses, utility vehicles, aircraft, education kits, books, school desks, laboratory equipment, musical instruments, computers and sports supplies. Multi-lateral Partnerships ------ 10. (C) The 21st Century Leadership Alliance can provide the basis for greater cooperation between the U.S., India and Japan in promoting democracy and good governance in Afghanistan. The recent inception of the joint U.S.-Japan-India project to develop the Public Administration program at Kabul University could serve as a model for similar cooperation in other fields, such as agriculture, veterinary science, English or other foreign language development, or even faculty development. In addition to three-way collaboration, XXXXXXXXXXXX pointed out that, even when the U.S., India and Japan are not working together, they could coordinate better on divisions of labor which could more effectively target donor money and efforts, and take advantage of each country's area of expertise. Additionally, we could explore ways to use the U.S.-Japan Strategic Development Alliance to approach India on other coordinated trilateral projects. IMPEDIMENTS TO INDIA'S CONTRIBUTION ------ Pakistan Withholds Transit Access ------ 11. (C) According to XXXXXXXXXXXX and other Embassy contacts, transit through Pakistan is imperative for the economic integration of the region, and would be mutually beneficial for Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. However, India's perception is that Pakistan is creating obstacles that prevent such a land route from becoming a reality, and Afghan Embassy officials have indicated that they are pessimistic that the Government of Pakistan (GOP) will budge on this issue (ref b). We should use every opportunity to continue to press the GOP to allow this essential transit route. This issue will be on the agenda at the upcoming South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) meeting April 3-4, and XXXXXXXXXXXX, who told PolCouns March 12 that obtaining a transit route from Afghanistan through Pakistan to India was the \"only benefit of Afghanistan's membership in SAARC,\" and that SAARC would be a disappointment if it didn't advance the transit issue. (COMMENT: Transit across Pakistan would also reduce India's reliance on Iran. END COMMENT.) The Security Issue ------ 12. (C) Security continues to be an issue of public concern in sending Indians to work in Afghanistan. Since 2003, two Indian engineers have been abducted, and three other workers NEW DELHI 00001485 005.2 OF 005 have been executed in Afghanistan. The Indian media says Indians who work specifically on road-building projects in Afghanistan are targeted due to Pakistani and Taliban fears that completion of a highway to Central Asia will increase India's influence in the region, thereby threatening Pakistan's interests in the region. Pakistan is also said to be opposed to India assuming a larger security role in Afghanistan. As Sudha Ramachandran said in a recent article, given Pakistan's sensitivities, India is not able to provide its own security for Indians working in Afghanistan. India will need to work out, with those suspicious of its motives, a way to protect its people on the ground, or it will not achieve its full potential in using soft power in Afghanistan. 13. (U) As an outsider looking in, Post realizes that Embassy Kabul and Washington (as well as the government of Afghanistan) are best placed to identify Afghanistan's needs.

The new name is changed just a little because the world looks like the familiar planet Earth, but is different in fundamental ways, McKibben told the Guardian. \"It's a conceit: the notion that we're living on a planet a lot like our own, the one we were born on, but different enough to need a new name,\" said McKibben, who thinks the new name should sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger would pronounce it in his deep Austrian-American drawl. McKibben describes how he played with the spelling of Earth, adding different letters, and chose his new name because he liked the look of it best: \"There's a slightly science fiction look to it; that's appropriate in the sense it's a little like a science fiction story: we wake up one day and the planet we have been used to for 10,000 years has 5% more moisture in the atmosphere, the sea is turning more acid. The only trouble is it's not fiction.\" McKibben knows better than most people that the planet has not changed overnight: the science of the greenhouse effect which creates global warming has been understood since the Industrial Revolution in the early 1800s, and the American author himself came to fame in 1989 with one of the first books for the general public warning about climate change, The End of Nature, which was translated into more than 20 languages. For generations humans have muttered that the world is changing; but this time the change is more physical, and measurably faster and stronger, says McKibben. \"For most human generations very little has changed. In the last century ... one of the things that made it possible to have absorbed tremendous social change was the fact that the planet was pretty [physically] stable. That physical stability is now at an end and this century we'll feel the physical planet changing as violently and tremendously as the social planet did in the last century.\" To back up the claims, Eaarth, which appears in the US this month and in the UK in May, quotes many and wide-ranging examples of physical change: 17 of the 20 warmest years on record were in the last two decades; tropical storms are stronger; droughts are more frequent; dengue fever in Texas is just one example of diseases spreading around the world; much of the planet's ice is melting; and sea levels are rising. But for McKibben the dramatic set-up is only that: \"Most of the book is devoted to the question: if we're on a new planet how are we going to live on it?\" he asks. \"It's a different planet: we'll have to have different habits in order to inhabit it successfully, and some of those will be pretty radical.\" McKibben is the founder of the campaign group 350.org, which on 24 October 2009 organised 5,200 demonstrations in 181 countries, an event he says was described by CNN as \"the most widespread day of political action in the planet's history\". However, the book argues that although they will \"keep battling\" for drastic emission reductions to lessen the impacts of climate change, they have \"lost the fight, insofar as our goal was to preserve the world we were born into.\" For that reason, McKibben offers some guidance for living on planet Eaarth: \"The thing it will require of us, above all, is to leave behind the idea infinite growth will solve all our problems and start thinking about scaling down, relocalising much of our economic life to make it more resilient and less vulnerable to the kind of disruptive change we're now seeing.\" Examples, says McKibben, include the Transition Towns network of communities trying to live without fossil fuels, which began in the UK. In the US, the number of farms has risen in the last five years, after a generation of decline, farmers' markets are growing, and solar energy is being installed even in the author's notoriously cold home state of Vermont, he said. The book urges people not to despair of the bad news: \"My only real fear is that the reality described in this book, and increasingly evident in the world around us, will be for some an excuse to give up,\" he writes. \"We need just the opposite - increased engagement.\" McKibben admitted though that he is not always confident. \"I wish I was more starry-eyed,\" he said. \"I don't know whether we'll see change in time or not.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2009/mar/25/zero-carbon-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-25T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Skills for going green: Do we have the people we need to make zero-carbon homes a reality?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/mar/25/zero-carbon-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2009/mar/25/zero-carbon-homes","fields":{"headline":"Lack of funding blights training initiatives","bodyText":"The government expects all new homes to be zero-carbon by 2016 and says all homes should be energy efficient by 2030. But do we have the right people in place with the right skills to meet these green homes targets? Already developers are warning that if they are to deliver on low-carbon technologies, a big skills gap has to be plugged. Some housing organisations have responded by setting up their own \"green teams\" in order to design and construct ecohomes. But many of those now working on the green agenda say that the most urgent skills requirement is for people who understand hi-tech products and how to fit and maintain them. \"Two years ago, if you'd asked some of the larger contractors to install solar panels, they would have thrown up their hands in horror. Now they just ask you what kind you want,\" says Richard Baines, director of sustainable development at the housing association and regeneration agency, Black Country Housing Group. \"Many construction companies have gained experience of super insulation, high-efficiency boilers and solar panels by having to do it. When you make something mandatory, it becomes commonplace. But there is still a lack of knowledge about the fitting and maintenance of new zero-carbon products and that is worrying.\" A report published last year by the built environment organisation, the Building Research Establishment, revealed a worrying shortage of people who knew how to specify and integrate sustainable technologies. The gap in knowledge applied particularly to the fitting and maintenance of systems such as solar panels and ground source heat pumps. Zero-carbon demo Black Country Housing Group is working in partnership with the University of Birmingham to demonstrate how a zero-carbon hydrogen fuel cell system can power electricity, water and central heating in a home. The housing group has teamed up with Andy Parker, a Midlands-based engineer who has electrical and plumbing qualifications as well as being an accredited gas fitter. \"We need many more people with his range of skills to install and maintain zero-carbon systems,\" says Baines. \"In the Midlands, there are very highly trained fitters who are being made redundant by the car manufacturing industry. They are the ideal people to re-train to install the systems we need in many more homes if we are to reach the zero-carbon targets.\" Courses to teach the new skills should be started in colleges throughout the country, argues Baines, and the gas and electricity accreditation bodies must work together to produce a combined alternative technologies certificate. But developers and contractors stress that the more general skills shortages cannot be addressed until there is a large-scale government-backed \"green homes\" programme in social housing - as well as incentives for home owners to go for low-carbon options when improving their properties. Alan Yates, director of regeneration at Accord Housing Group, who has championed \"green\" social housing for more than a decade, says the zero-carbon homes target is a \"fantastic opportunity\" to extend the manufacturing of energy-efficient products in the UK. Currently, this market is confined to small, specialist companies, making equipment expensive. This forces many developers to seek more affordable alternatives abroad. However, extending manufacturing in the UK will improve the knowledge and skills relating to the products, he says. Paul Davies, sustainable technologies manager at affordable housing contractor Wates Living Space, insists that if there is a market for low- and zero-carbon homes, the construction industry will respond by training people to do the work. \"There is knowledge in the industry that has been around for a long time, but it tends to be in pockets and has been concentrated on smaller, pilot schemes. One example is the Wates house, which we built for the Centre of Alternative Technology as far back as 1975,\" he says. Larger market \"Only if we get a long-term, broad investment in green homes will the right personnel be found and trained on the scale needed for a dramatic reduction in carbon emissions,\" adds Davies. \"There is no point in training people if there are no jobs to give them.\" Birmingham builder Josh Kaushall, who has worked with Black Country Housing Group, agrees that a larger green homes market needs to be created in order to persuade construction companies to invest in training. He says a subsidy to encourage homeowners to improve their properties would work: \"Politicians may be sceptical but, if the incentive is good, people will take it up because green homes mean lower fuel bills and that is something everyone is looking for.\" Weblinks Black Country Housing Group: bcha.co.uk Building Research Establishment: bre.co.uk Accord Housing: accordha.org.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/oct/05/environment-clean-energy-cashback","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-04T23:05:01Z","webTitle":"Green lobby calls for higher returns on investment in clean energy projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/05/environment-clean-energy-cashback","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/oct/05/environment-clean-energy-cashback","fields":{"headline":"Green lobby calls for higher returns on investment in clean energy projects","bodyText":"An alliance of construction companies, solar energy groups and politicians will tomorrow appeal to the government to increase support for renewable energy for households through its proposed Clean Energy Cashback scheme. As the government's consultation period on the plan draws to a close, supporters of solar panels are urging the government to increase the amount that home owners would be paid for every unit of green electricity they produce. Just adding 10p per kilowatt hour to the proposed 36p rate would create 30,000 jobs in the next five years, the industry says, by driving demand for 400,000 new installations by 2014. The scheme, usually called a feed-in tariff, has been successfully used to boost the roll-out of renewable energy technologies across Europe. In July, the government pledged to introduce a similar scheme in April next year. But its aim of producing returns on investment of 5-8%, depending on the technology, is too low. Germany, for example, typically offers around a 10% return which has seen renewables take off rapidly. The shadow energy minister, Charles Hendry, said: \"Feed-in tariffs are crucial if the kickstart in microgeneration is to happen, but it will undermine the point of introducing the Clean Energy Cashback if the rate is not sufficient to drive domestic and commercial uptake of the technologies.\" Brian Berry, of the Federation of Master Builders, said: \"The FMB would welcome any change to the proposed Clean Energy Cashback scheme that maximises solar jobs for our membersat a time when many of them are really suffering as a result of the recession.\" \"The construction and solar industry work in close partnership, with roofers up and down the country now being trained to install solar electric roof tiles. By increasing the clean energy cash back level by at least 10p, the government is kick starting economic recovery in the construction industry - allowing solar energy to play a significant role in the greening of our housing stock.\" Alan Simpson MP, special adviser on the scheme to energy and climate change secretary Ed Milliband, said Labour should not be so timid. \"Only real rates of return of between 8-10%...will drive forward the UK market for renewables from 2010. We have to deliver massive benefits for UK PLC and UK jobs during the next Parliament. This means an increase of at least 10p on the proposed solar PV payments for 2010. Without that, we are not even in the game as far as solar PV is concerned.\" Paul Donnelly, spokesman for storage group Big Yellow - the sort of company who could potentially roll out a lot of PV on its warehouses - said the current proposal was simply not interesting enough. \"Solar PV is the most practicable renewable technology for urban environments and is also the most reliable in meeting Planning Authority renewable energy targets. \"But the current return on investment for commercial generators suggested by the proposed PV tariff levels will do nothing to drive investment in this robust, effective technology,\" he said. Supermarket group Asda has also made it clear to Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) officials that the proposed tariff is too low for the company to bother investing in putting large arrays on its shop or warehouse roofs. Colin Challen MP, Labour chairman of the Commons All Party Climate Change Group, said the proposed tariff levels would not even deliver the 5-8% return DECC was claiming. \"The Government has literally a once in a lifetime opportunity to get the 2010 starting 'clean energy cashback' payment right for all renewable energy technologies so that the UK can begin to catch up with our European neighbours. But the proposed solar PV payments are simply set far too low to provide for a real kick-start for this technology in the UK and are way below the Government's stated aim of delivering a 5-8% rate of return from the scheme.\" For details on the consultation, visit www.wesupportsolar.net."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2010/aug/11/green-travel-initiatives","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-11T13:23:00Z","webTitle":"10 green start-ups for travellers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/aug/11/green-travel-initiatives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2010/aug/11/green-travel-initiatives","fields":{"headline":"10 green start-ups for travellers","bodyText":"With the news that planners have approved designs for the £35m Gloucester Gateway project, which aims to reinvent the motorway pitstop for the carbon-conscious generation, we take a look at other green initiatives launched this year that might appeal to tourists. 1.

The 100-kilowatt system would provide enough power to run most of the local village and save about 43 tonnes of CO2 a year. The problem was the £320,000 it would cost. Mr Eavis decided in January to apply to the then Department for Trade and Industry for a capital grant from its low-carbon buildings programme. But he was told he was not eligible because he already received farm support; awarding him both would amount to double state aid, which is illegal under European law. So his installer, Kerry Burns of Solar Sense, applied for the grant for Glastonbury Festivals Ltd, owned by Mr Eavis. The DTI offered him a grant worth £100,000 as long as Worthy Farm got no benefit. If he took the money, he would have to export all the power he produced to the grid and pay £40,000 for a transformer. If he refused it, he would be able to use most of the power on the farm - and claim back £3,000 a year of renewable obligation certificates. But even then, he would get only a 4% return on his investment. Mr Eavis, 72, though, thinks he will go ahead. \"It is pure common sense to use the immense power the sun contains.

Government officials are putting the finishing touches to plans to boost the take-up of renewable energy in Britain - which is the lowest in Europe - through a system known as the \"clean energy cashback\", or feed-in tariff. In July last year the government unveiled the scheme which has been used successfully for years in other European countries and pays above-market rates for green electricity produced by consumers. But the proposed tariff levels for power produced by small wind turbines, solar panels and micro hydro schemes were criticised by green campaigners as not being high enough to encourage businesses, households and communities to invest. A YouGov survey of more than 2,000 people carried out for Friends of the Earth (FoE), the Renewable Energy Association (REA) and the Cooperative Group shows two-thirds of people think that the government's plans are not ambitious enough, while 71% of homeowners said they would consider installing green energy systems if they were paid enough cash. The Department of Energy and Climate Change is expected to announce the tariff levels next week. Shadow climate change minister Greg Barker said: \"This poll confirms what we have been saying for some time, that Labour massively underestimate the appetite for decentralised energy among the public. \"Labour is failing to grasp the ambition that is out there in respect of this exciting technology.\" Alan Simpson MP, the government's special adviser on renewable energy, was critical of the current plans: \"If Britain wants to be part of a renewable energy future, we have to go into it at a run rather than a waddle. \"As things stand, the government could turn a brilliant idea into a pitiful failure.

It's as simple as that.\" FoE, the REA and the Co-op group say that the scheme as it currently stands, which has an overall ambition to supply just 2% of UK electricity from small-scale renewable energy sources (up to 5MW) by 2020. They argue it should offer higher payments than those proposed and aim to deliver far more clean electricity — up to one-third of the country's total needs. The poll also shows that 70% of respondents said that they would be prepared to pay an extra 10p on their electricity bills each month (£1.20 annually), on top of the already proposed annual increase of £1.17, until 2013 when the scheme is due to be reviewed. Andy Atkins, the executive director of the FoE, said: \"The public overwhelmingly wants the government to think big when it comes to small-scale renewable energy. \"Our homes, businesses and communities could become green power stations - but bigger government incentives are needed to make this a reality. This will help tackle climate change, create new jobs and businesses and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.\" Jeremy Leggett, the executive chairman of solar energy group Solarcentury, said that the new government scheme could yet deliver hundreds of thousands of jobs in solar photovoltaics and other small-scale renewables. \"It could also cut significantly our country's increasing dependence on imported fossil fuels,\" he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2010/jan/20/pachauri-personal-attacks","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-20T13:08:40Z","webTitle":"UN climate chief jabs back at allegations of financial impropriety - but fails to land a blow | Ian Wylie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/jan/20/pachauri-personal-attacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2010/jan/20/pachauri-personal-attacks","fields":{"headline":"UN climate chief jabs back at allegations of financial impropriety - but fails to land a blow","bodyText":"The chairman of the UN's panel of climate scientists, Dr Rajendra Pachauri, has been under an unwelcome spotlight this week. First, he announced a review into the panel's claim that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035. Then he had to defend himself from reports by the Sunday Telegraph that he's financially profiting from the influence of his UN role – a claim he trenchantly denies. Now, Pachauri has come out fighting, calling himself \"unsinkable\". Yesterday in Abu Dhabi, he described recent criticism from British newspapers as \"personal\". At the weekend, an investigation of the finances of The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri), a research body run by Pachauri, was published by The Sunday Telegraph, whose reporters alleged Pachauri had a \"lavish personal lifestyle\" and owned \"$1,000 suits\". Pachauri has previously issued statements saying he has not received \"a single penny\" from payments by companies to Teri for advice he has provided. \"They can't attack the science so they attack the chairman,\" Pachauri, who chairs the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) told me. \"But they won't sink me. I am the unsinkable Molly Brown. In fact, I will float much higher.\" Pachauri chairs another panel, the judges of the 2010 Zayed Future Energy prize, an illustrious jury that includes former BP chairman Lord Browne, architect Norman Foster and the president of Iceland. Yesterday in Abu Dhabi, Pachauri took to the stage at the seven-star Emirates Palace hotel to hand out a large cash prize – to one of the companies he has been advising. Last year the $1.5m award was given to Dipal Chandra Barua, an entrepreneur whose company, Grameen Shakti, trained women in rural Bangledesh to install solar energy systems. This year, Pachauri and his judges awarded the prize to car-making giant Toyota. Arguably Toyota neither needs the money nor the recognition for its work on hybrid technologies. It's worth noting that until less than a year ago, Pachauri was also a member of Toyota's International Advisory Board. I asked Pachauri why Toyota had won, when giving the money to a smaller-scale venture could have had more impact. \"We decided that if we rewarded Toyota's imagination it would not be lost on other car-makers,\" he said. Pachauri has been consistent in countering attacks that claim he has conflicts of interest. In a letter published in the the Sunday Telegraph this week in response to an earlier article by the paper, he wrote: I am proud of my association with various organisations, of which I am happy to provide a complete list, but such associations are limited to me providing them with advice essentially on clean technologies and sustainable practices. There is no question of them influencing the functioning of Teri, the IPCC or myself. There is no conflict between these roles and my position as chairman of the IPCC. I advise several organisations on sustainable energy and related subjects, and any remuneration that is due to me from these organisations is paid to Teri, not to me. However, in the science community skilled, engaging communicators like Pachauri – the author of 23 books, including one of English verse – are all too rare. We're looking to them to convey the gravity of climate change and need for action. Not give succour to sceptics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2008/nov/20/alternativeenergy-solarpower","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-11-20T15:53:40Z","webTitle":"Germany's 'Sun King' makes bid for Opel cars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/20/alternativeenergy-solarpower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2008/nov/20/alternativeenergy-solarpower","fields":{"headline":"Germany's 'Sun King' makes bid for Opel cars","bodyText":"Frank Asbeck knows how to attract publicity. There was the time Germany's self-styled \"Sun King\" offered all the country's atomic engineers a job in his solar-technology company if Germany turned its back on nuclear fuel. The colourful maverick, who within 10 years has turned his Bonn-based SolarWorld into a multimillion euro concern and one of the leading solar companies in the world, has now done it again with his offer to buy the German car-maker Opel. The 49-year-old son of a handyman who trained as an agricultural scientist offered €1bn (£850m), \"a serious offer\", he said, expressing his wish to turn Opel into Europe's \"first green automotive group\". Minutes into the start of the working day in the US, Opel's owners, General Motors, flatly refused Asbeck's offer yesterday, issuing the unambiguous statement \"Opel is not for sale\". Analysts have been keen to point out that such an offer from a company with an annual turnover of €700m to one with a turnover of €16bn, could have been little more than a PR stunt. Others remarked that Asbeck, who recently announced plans to build a large compound at one of his plants for a pride of Zimbabwean lions, is a complicated man full of contradictions. Asbeck's penchant for fast sports cars is well-documented. \"How can you trust a man who pushes for energy change yet drives around in a gas-guzzling Maserati?\" asked Tilman Steffen of the Netzeitung. The suspicion that Asbeck's offer was not quite what it seemed, deepened when a closer look at his proposal showed that he effectively wanted the company for nothing, demanding a payment of €40,000 for each of Opel's 26,000 workers — equivalent to the €1bn he is prepared to pay for it. But it could be his remarks had just the effect he wanted. They got him on to the front of many newspapers and ruffled the feathers of German industry, triggering a debate in a poignant week when Opel went to the German government cap in hand looking for a €1.8bn bailout as the car industry feels the squeeze. Asbeck said his aim is to transform Opel from a producer of high-emission cars to one of more energy-efficient vehicles, including solar-powered cars, or what he refers to as \"sunmotive concept\" vehicles. \"The challenges of climate protection and of the market require a transition from automotive to sunmotive concepts,\" he said. His remarks are a pointed critique of Germany's car industry which has been painfully slow to rise to the challenge of producing more environmentally efficient vehicles. Many ask, due to the mistakes it has made, why the car industry has any more right to a government handout than other firms. Asbeck says crisis means opportunity and solar-powered cars might be just the boost the economy needs. He insists he is in a position to make the transition where the car industry has failed. His stock-market registered company employs 2,250 photovoltaics experts and has been working on producing a solar-powered car (the \"sun mobil\") for years, amassing prizes for its efforts. Supporters of Asbeck said his ideas should not be dismissed. \"He's as stubborn as a mule,\" said Michael Vesper, former minister of North Rhine Westphalia where SolarWorld is based, and a fellow Green party member. \"When he wants something he sees it through,\" he said, pointing to his track record. In 1999 Asbeck used the proceeds from floating SolarWorld on the stock market to buy the chemical giant Bayer's solar branch in Freiburg. By 2004 the shares had risen by 500%, making them the most successful in the German market and two years ago Asbeck's influence spread across the Atlantic when he bought the solar energy section of Shell. In October he opened his first factory in the USA, in Oregon and made sure he was on hand to press the red button which started the controls."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/mar/26/energy-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-26T16:09:07Z","webTitle":"Earth Hour - climate change campaigners urge global switch-off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/mar/26/energy-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/mar/26/energy-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Earth Hour - climate change campaigners urge global switch-off","bodyText":"The biggest turn-off in human history will start at 8.30pm tomorrow in Chatham, a tiny South Pacific island with only 12 street lamps. Almost 25 hours later, but at 9.30pm the same day, it will finish on the other side of the international dateline in the Galapagos Islands, where scientists will share a candle-lit dinner with several hundred residents and environmental activists. In between, Earth Hour , the annual worldwide call for action against climate change, will spread darkness across all seven continents, drawing in 120 nations, 1,700 municipalities and hundreds of millions of people. In the UK, many hotels and restaurants will be offering special candle-lit dinners where guests will be able to see well-known sites plunge into blackness, including Big Ben, Edinburgh castle, the Millennium stadium in Cardiff, Belfast city hall, Durham cathedral, St Paul's cathedral and the London Eye. Now in its fourth year, the event organised by WWF, has spread an ever widening expanse of hour-long darkness. Two million people took part at the first switch-off in Sydney in 2007. Last year, hundreds of millions participated in 88 countries. This year, organisers expect the figure to be close to a billion. Beijing's Forbidden City and London's Houses of Parliament, the Eiffel Tower, the Hiroshima peace memorial, the Empire State Building, Rio de Janeiro's Christ the Redeemer statue, and the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa. will all plunge into darkness. Nations that have signed up for the first time this year include Saudi Arabia, long seen as resistant to climate change action, Mongolia, Nepal and the Czech Republic. Another debutant is a first group of participants from Antarctica: the Davis Research Station, which is home to several dozen scientists who presumably will not be also switching off their heaters in -10 degrees Celsius.James Leape, international director general of WWF, said the worldwide event was particularly important after the disappointment of the climate conference in Copenhagen last year. \"There was a sense after Copenhagen that we, as a world, had lost momentum,\" he said. \"One of the important things about this year is that it is a chance for people to say 'Hey, we are still concerned about climate change.' A lot of people are looking for an opportunity. If they speak out by themselves, it may not make much of an impact, but through this shared action of Earth Hour, they have a platform to speak.\" Leape is in Beijing to attend a darkening ceremony at the Forbidden City, the 600-year-old symbol of Chinese power. Last year, China's support for Earth Hour clashed, time-wise, with the anniversary of the Tibetan unrest in 2008, prompting some organisations, including Peking university, to warn students not to get involved. This year, with no such complications, participation is enthusiastic. Fifteen Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu and Dalian, have signed up. Pandas in Sichuan will be involved, along with cartoon characters in Hong Kong, and rock bands in Xiamen. Chinese organisers are using the event to kick-off a \"low-carbon lifestyle week\" aimed at persuading consumers in the world's most populous country not to follow the wasteful example of developed nations. The message is catching on at the grassroots. Among the events in the former Chinese capital of Xian, will be a free unplugged music concert. Across the world, people are expected to mark the event in ways that reflect the diversity, creativity and inequality of the human population. In cities like Tokyo, Seoul and New York, netizens are being asked to record landmark buildings' switch-off on their mobile phones and upload them online. In Zimbabwe, hundreds of children will join a candle-lit picnic at Victoria Falls. In Canada, an Earth Hour Blackberry application has proved a hit. Elsewhere, the world's highest paid supermodel, Gisele Bündchen, and World Cup-winning footballer Francesco Totti will act as spokespeople for the event, along with South Africa's archbishop Desmond Tutu. Not everywhere is going dark. Tanzania initially did not sign up because few would notice a switch off in Dar es Salaam and other cities where only 10% of people have electricity. Instead, WWF organised a \"switch on\" of solar energy for a local school last year. It will scale this up to 20 schools this year.In Madagascar, 99% of the country has no electricity and people are frightened to be on the streets after dark because of the instability that has followed the political crisis. But WWF says residents have asked to participate. \"There are only 12 street lights on the Chatham Islands and for safety reasons these will remain on,\" said Pickles. Organisers said locals would enjoy making the news, but the event would have to compete with a 21st birthday party at the one hotel in town. \"A lot of people will be there,\" said Lee Barry, Earth Hour Project Manager in New Zealand. \"Hopefully someone will remember to turn the lights off.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/jun/16/solar-power-europe-africa","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-06-16T17:16:35Z","webTitle":"German blue chip companies throw weight behind north African solar project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jun/16/solar-power-europe-africa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/jun/16/solar-power-europe-africa","fields":{"headline":"German blue chip firms throw weight behind north African solar project","bodyText":"Twenty blue chip German companies are pooling their resources with the aim of harnessing solar power in the deserts of north Africa and transporting the clean electricity to Europe. The businesses, which include some of the biggest names in European energy, finance and manufacturing, will form a consortium next month. If successful, the highly ambitious plan could see Europe fuelled by solar energy within a decade. The consortium behind what would be the biggest ever solar energy initiative will first raise awareness and interest among other investors for the project, known as Desertec, which is estimated to cost around €400bn (£338bn). Torsten Jeworrek, board member of Munich Re, the German reinsurer which is leading the project, said: \"We want to found an initiative which over the next two to three years will put concrete measures on the table.\" Like other reinsurers, Munich Re has said it is expecting to face mounting claims in the coming years for damage caused by climate change. The companies – including Siemens, Deutsche Bank, and the energy companies RWE and E.on – will meet on July 13 in Munich to draw up an agreement. German government ministries as well as the Club of Rome, a Zurich-based NGO of leading scientists, managers and politicians which advocates sustainable development, are also expected to be present. It is seen as particularly significant that the companies aim to start the expensive initiative in the midst of a financial crisis. But although none of the companies is keen to go into detail yet about their involvement, they stress that the project is a chance for them to drive forward the fight against climate change and in doing so to position themselves at the top of the green technology industry. Germany, despite its relative lack of sun, has become a leader in solar energy. The energy potential in the deserts south of the Mediterranean is enormous. According to the European Commission's Institute for Energy, if just 0.3% of the light falling on the Sahara and Middle Eastern deserts was captured, it could provide all of Europe's energy needs. The Desertec project aims to build solar power plants in several locations in north Africa. Jeworrek said the \"most important criteria\" was that the locations were \"situated in politically stable lands\". Morocco, as well as Libya and Algeria have been cited as potential sites, where land is also cheap. The technique called \"concentrating solar power\" or CSP, uses banks of mirrors to focus the sun's rays in a central column filled with water. The rays heat the water, vaporising the it into a steam which is then used to drive turbines which generate carbon-free electricity. The energy would then be fed via high-voltage direct current (DC) transmission lines over thousands of miles to Europe - traditional AC lines are far too inefficient. Hans Muller-Steinhagen of Germany's Aerospace Centre, said it was technically possible, albeit expensive, to transport the energy over thousands of miles. He said solar energy from the desert is already being harvested but only in isolated plants. CSP plants are operational in the American west, including in California and Nevada, while independent plants are currently being set up in Spain, Morocco, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates. But the projects have suffered from investors' nervousness due of the vast expense of the required grid infrastructure, as well as the cheapness of fossil fuels. German representatives of environmental groups yesterday widely welcomed the news that big businesses were prepared to give the project a backbone for the first time. \"Businesses have finally recognised that renewable energies belong to the future, and in times of economic crisis this also sends out an important signal for economic growth,\" said Andree Bohling of Greenpeace. WWF Germany's climate expert Regine Gunther said while the initiative was a \"step in the right direction\", it was important to ensure that Africa benefited from the project. \"They want to and indeed must profit from this solution as much as us,\" she said. Previous suggestions have included allowing host countries to retain a proportion of the electricity for free, in return for providing sites for the solar farms. The €400bn investment would be enough to cover 15% of Europe's electricity requirements, according to Jeworrek. He added \"in technical terms this project can be realised\" but stressed in order for it to be sustainable it would have to finance itself in the long-run and be competitive within 10 to 15 years. But German MP Hermann Scheer, president of Eurosolar, the European Association for Renewable Energy, called the Desertec project \"highly problematic\". He said costs would be vastly higher and deadlines would be missed due to logistical problems such as sand storms and dealing with many different countries. \"I would urge the investors to stay clear of it,\" he told The Guardian. Scheer was also critical of the fact that the project would \"duplicate the current system\" whereby energy distribution is concentrated in the hands of a few multinational companies. \"We should be looking instead at decentralising the system, and looking closer to home for our energy supplies, such as solar panels on homes or harnessing wind energy on the coasts, or inland,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2010/jun/03/robert-boyle-royal-society-wishlist","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-03T07:58:02Z","webTitle":"Robert Boyle: wishlist of a Restoration visionary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/jun/03/robert-boyle-royal-society-wishlist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2010/jun/03/robert-boyle-royal-society-wishlist","fields":{"headline":"Robert Boyle: wishlist of a Restoration visionary","bodyText":"As wishlists go, it was both visionary and practical, but more than anything it reveals the scope and almost limitless ambition of science in the 17th century. In 24 handwritten notes, Robert Boyle, co-founder of the Royal Society, set forth the most pressing problems for scientists to solve. The issues ranged from the secret of eternal youth and healing wounds from afar, to the construction of an unsinkable ship and the ability to harness the power of the hysterical. The list was drawn up in the 1660s, soon after the Royal Society was formed, and goes on public display for the first time next week as part of an exhibition at the scientific body's London premises to celebrate its 350th anniversary. Boyle's notes appear alongside rare and previously undisplayed manuscripts, instruments, portraits and books that chart the history of science from the society's earliest days. Among them are the first sketches of nebulae by Sir John Herschel, who visited South Africa with a telescope in the 1830s, and Newton's death mask. Boyle was an enduring and influential figure who brought great minds into the fold of the organisation. His wishlist for scientists begins, simply, with \"The Prolongation of Life\", a laudable goal considering life expectancy at birth at the time was less than 40 years old. Boyle also ponders the development of a means to recover youth, or at least some of its outward signs. Perhaps false teeth and hair colouring will one day be possible, he speculated. Many of the problems Boyle set out had clear practical applications, such as perfecting \"the art of flying\". It was nearly a century since Leonardo da Vinci had sketched out designs for ornithopters, but it would be another century yet before the Montgolfier brothers achieved the first hot air balloon flight. Boyle's hopes for a way to \"cure wounds at a distance, or at least by transplantation\" have become a reality, with the advent of organ transplants and robotic surgical tools that can be operated from thousands of miles away. \"As you go down Boyle's list, some of the things sound quite silly, but then you realise we've kind of done them,\" said Keith Moore, the society's librarian. Boyle also hoped scientists would find ways for people to work underwater and develop a ship that could sail in all winds and was impossible to sink. \"I'm not sure we've managed that yet,\" said Jonathan Ashmore, fellow of the Royal Society and a spokesman for the exhibition. \"But the way the list was put together is impressive, with very far-sighted and visionary ideas coupled with very down-to-earth, practical ones.\" The most radical items on Boyle's list touch on human physiology and the brain. In one note, he suggests scientists might devise ways to live on a minimal amount of sleep by studying the effects of tea and also \"mad-men\", who appeared to need very little. In another, he wonders if understanding hysterical people and those with epilepsy might help scientists recreate their \"great strength and agility\". Boyle, regarded by some as the father of chemistry, had great faith in the power of pharmaceuticals and encouraged his fellow chemists to develop potent mind-altering drugs, and pills to relieve pain and induce restful sleep and sweet dreams. A more curious route of inquiry was \"Attaining Gigantik Dimensions\", presumably a reference to the possibility of enlarging the human race. \"This document provides us with an amazing window into one of the most extraordinary minds of the 17th century,\" said Ashmore. \"Boyle's predictions on the future of science are quite remarkable. His hopes for the cure of diseases by transplantation and drugs to appease pain and aid sleep have both become inherent features of contemporary medicine and yet these were predictions he was making over 300 years ago. We have also seen numerous of his other predictions realised in various ways, including flight, modern healthcare prolonging life, Kevlar body armour, underwater exploration and GPS navigation.\" This year, the Royal Society is holding a series of meetings to thrash out the future priorities for modern science. Feeding the world and providing ample green energy will certainly feature, as will enduring questions on the nature of ageing and consciousness. \"What I'd really like scientists to do is find evidence for alien life. I've been waiting a long time ... they should pull their fingers out,\" said Moore. Several documents from the 20th century reveal the Royal Society's increasing role in advising government and addressing industrial or occupational issues. In the early 1900s, the society established a committee to investigate the unusually high rates of cataracts among glassblowers. The problem was traced to the intense glare of the molten glass, prompting the scientist, William Crookes, to design darkened safety spectacles. In doing so, he also invented sunglasses. Years later, the society's fellows drew up blueprints for ship mines, studied the possibility of extracting alcohol from horse chestnuts and drafted secret reports on the effects of atomic bombs. \"These guys were interested in everything and the emphasis on rationality when faced with the complexity of the world really comes through,\" said Ashmore. New goals – the next 30 years? Sources of clean, green energy Plenty of energy reaches the Earth in the form of sunlight, but major scientific advances are needed to harness solar energy efficiently. Attempts to master fusion power by creating a tiny star on Earth are under way. Feeding the world A perfect storm of climate change, growing human population and water shortages are predicted to put food production under extraordinary strain. Scientific advances in agriculture and desalination are much needed. Slowing and reversing ageing The ageing effects of our lifestyles and environment are becoming clear, but scientists know little about the genetics of ageing and how to affect it. Greater knowledge of consciousness Giant leaps in neuroscience have failed to explain the nature of consciousness and how it arises. Some scientists believe that consciousness is an emergent property that is inevitable when a critical number of brain cells are interconnected. Others suspect we are missing a fundamental ingredient that gives rise to the conscious mind. Extraterrestrials Decades of searching for signs of alien life have so far turned up a blank, yet the question of whether life on Earth is a one-off is among the most compelling in science. Many scientists believe that basic alien life, in the form of microbes, may be relatively common, with intelligent life much rarer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/sep/02/india-copenhagen-ed-miliband","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-02T17:31:38Z","webTitle":"India will be key player at Copenhagen conference, says Miliband","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/02/india-copenhagen-ed-miliband","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/sep/02/india-copenhagen-ed-miliband","fields":{"headline":"India will be key player at Copenhagen conference, says Miliband","bodyText":"Ed Miliband, Britain's climate change secretary, hailed India as a potential \"deal maker\" in the forthcoming talks in Copenhagen for an international treaty to tackle global warming, stating that the country would not face targets to cut its emissions in the near future because it \"took climate change seriously\". The UK's \"softly-softly\" approach has won plaudits in India, and contrasts with that of US secretary of state, Hilary Clinton, whose visit in July resulted in a spat with environment minister Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh. India has categorically ruled out greenhouse gas cuts, arguing that rich nations caused the problem and must not deny Indians the opportunity to grow out of poverty. In an interview with the Guardian, Miliband and development secretary Douglas Alexander said India would not have to reduce emissions by 2020 – the year when the European Union has offered to cut by a third its greenhouse gas output – given that Delhi was \"not doing things on a 'business as usual basis'\". \"India has very stretching targets on solar energy, on renewable energy … it has big ambitions on energy efficiency … I think India wants to be a deal maker not a deal breaker in Copenhagen,\" said Miliband. India already generates 8% of its power from renewables – more than the UK. It says it aims to have 20,000MW of solar energy in place by 2020 and make fuel efficiency standards mandatory for cars from 2011 as part of a package to reduce the nation's carbon footprint. After Clinton's visit, Delhi accused the United States of applying pressure on India to curb its greenhouse gas emissions. The United States wants big developing countries such as India and China, whose emissions are quickly rising as their economies grow, to agree to rein them in before Washington commits to any global deal. Today the Indian government released a series of studies showing the country's greenhouse gas emissions would continue to rise – citing a range between 2.8 and 5.0 tonnes of carbon dioxide per person in 2031. The government estimates India's current per-capita emissions at 1.2 tonnes – significantly below the current global average of 4 tonnes. \"Even two decades from now, India's per-capita greenhouse gas emissions will be below the global average of 25 years earlier,\" said the Indian minister. Although Miliband welcomed the report, the British minister said the negotiations in the run up to Copenhagen centred on when \"emissions in different countries peak past 2020\". Miliband highlighted July's L'Aquila agreement – where the world's richest nations reached a symbolic deal with India, China and other major polluters on the need to limit global warming to within 2 degrees centigrade to prevent catastrophic climate change. Despite this pledge Miliband stopped short of calling of emission reduction targets for big, emerging economies such as India after 2020. \"That is one of the questions we have got to resolve… we want to work with India\". Another key area of difference revolves around carbon capture and storage technologies that Britain has promoted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Indian officials have complained about the cost of such plants, which aim to capture carbon dioxide created by industry and pump them deep underground. However Miliband pointed to India's rising reliance on coal as a source of power as a reason why the Asian nation might embrace the technology. \"India seems to be most interested in solar technology. Let me be honest with you there is no solution to the problem of climate change that does not solve the problem of coal.\" Campaigners said British ministers' softly-softly approach showed the west had \"come a long way\". \"I think they are beginning to understand the ground realities in India. You have to talk to each other not at each other,\" said Sunita Narain of Delhi's Centre for Science and the Environment. However Narain said that there was still some way to go. She said industrial nations must curb their own pollution and provide funding and technology to help developing nations before the latter are asked to set limits that could crimp their economic expansion. Douglas Alexander, Britain's development secretary, pointed out that Gordon Brown had proposed $100bn (£62bn) a year for a global green fund that could \"unlock new sources of financing\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2009/may/26/china-invests-solar-power-renewable-energy-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-05-26T20:57:26Z","webTitle":"China puts its faith in solar power with huge renewable energy investment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/26/china-invests-solar-power-renewable-energy-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2009/may/26/china-invests-solar-power-renewable-energy-environment","fields":{"headline":"China puts its faith in solar power with huge renewable energy investment","bodyText":"China is to throw its economic might behind a national solar power plan that could result in it becoming one of the world's biggest harvesters of the sun's energy. The government body responsible for overseeing energy policy has finalised a proposal for billions of pounds of incentives for solar farms and rooftop panels, which will come from the government's £400bn economic stimulus fund. Once approved by the state council, it is expected to give a boost to the domestic solar power market, which has lagged behind China's wind, nuclear and hydroelectric power investments. \"This is extremely important. It's a milestone,\" said Chen Dongmei, director of climate change and energy at the WWF's China office. China is the world's leading manufacturer of photovoltaic (PV) panels, which turn sunlight into electricity. But 95% of these are exported. While solar thermal power, in which sunlight heats water, is in widespread use, the central government and the five major utilities have deemed PV power too expensive, particularly compared with coal, which generates electricity for between an eighth and a tenth of the cost. But the global economic crisis and increasing concerns about climate change and energy security have prompted a change in attitudes. Since last year, a glut in supply of PV panels has pushed prices down by more than 30%, cutting profits of domestic manufacturers such as Suntech. To support them and widen the country's energy base, the plan is expected to include the biggest ever boost for solar power, along with extra spending and policy support for nuclear, wind and biomass power. By 2020, the government is committed to raising the share of renewable energy (excluding hydroelectric power) in the energy mix to 6%, from the current 1.5%. Many local governments in \"sunshine regions\" such as Gansu, Qinghai and Inner Mongolia are already pushing ahead. According to Li Shimin of the Solar Energy Centre in Gansu, at least 10 solar farms are under construction or in the process of securing approval. The biggest of those approved so far is in Dunhuang, which will have a 10 MW capacity. Earlier this year, Jiangsu province – the home of Suntech – announced 1bn yuan (£92bn) of incentives aimed at building solar energy generation capacity to 260 MW megawatts by 2011. This is extremely ambitious given that the target for the entire country next year is 300 megawatts. Julian Wong, an energy analyst at the Center for American Progress in Washington DC, said 2009 was shaping up to be the year of solar power in China. \"The unique confluence of lower productions costs and decreased overseas demand means the cost of going solar is lower than ever and makes it an opportune time to make a policy push for domestic solar deployment,\" he noted in a recent report. Despite the infusion of cash and government support for renewable sources of energy, China is expected to remain dependent on coal for about 70% of its energy needs for at least the next two decades, meaning it will remain the world's biggest emitter of CO2, a major greenhouse gas. • Read more about China's solar energy plan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/248643","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-03T21:30:17Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: Saudi Arabia fears missed trick on Copenhagen climate accord","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/248643","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/248643","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: Saudi Arabia fears missed trick on Copenhagen climate accord","bodyText":"Friday, 12 February 2010, 14:16 S E C R E T RIYADH 000184 SIPDIS DEPARTMENT FOR NEA/ARP, EEB/ESC/IEC (MONOSSON), S/CIEA (GOLDWYN, SULLIVAN), S/SECC (STERN, PERSHING, ROCHBERG) DEPT PASS TO DOE FOR JONATHAN ELKIND, JAMES HART EO 12958 DECL: 02/09/2020 TAGS KGHG, SENV, EPET, ENRG, PREL, SA SUBJECT: TWO FACES OF SAUDI ARABIA'S CLIMATE NEGOTIATING POSITION REF: A. 09DHAHRAN 201 B. 09RIYADH 1302 C. 09RIYADH 1397 D. 09RIYADH 1492 E. 09RIYADH 1557 F. 09RIYADH 1642 G.

(S) Saudi Arabia is officially still studying the issue of whether to associate with the Copenhagen Accord on Climate Change. Behind the scenes, we understand serious discussions are taking place about which road will best serve the Kingdom's long term interests. On one hand, Saudi Arabia's lead climate change negotiator has criticized the Copenhagen process in private and in public, arguing that the UNFCCC process is the only acceptable legal framework. On the other hand, Saudi officials are very eager to obtain investment credits for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and other technology transfer projects that will only become available once an agreement has been reached. Saudi officials express concern about the impact a transition to a low-carbon energy mix will have on the country's revenue stream at a time when it faces enormous financing needs to transform its economy to create jobs for its young, growing population. It also fears imposed economic costs associated with \"demonizing\" oil. Part of the explanation for this schizophrenic position is that the Saudi Government has not yet thought through all the implications of a climate change agreement, in part because it may not fully understand the various demand scenarios. There appears to be a growing sense within the SAG that it may be in danger of becoming isolated on climate change, which may prompt a re-examination of its position. Saudi officials have suggested that they need to find a way to climb down gracefully from the country's tough negotiating position. More sustained engagement in coordination with other governments, particularly if pitched as an effort to develop partnership, may help them do so. End Summary. Saudi Arabia not yet Decided on Copenhagen Accord --------------------------------------------- ----- 2. (C) Saudi Arabia's lead climate change negotiator Dr. Mohammad Al-Sabban told Econoffs February 3 the United States should adopt a more inclusive, transparent approach to United Nations Forum for Climate Change Cooperation (UNFCCC) negotiations. Although he was encouraged by President Obama's attitude towards developing country partners in the negotiations, Al-Sabban said the parties needed to \"learn from the mistakes\" of Copenhagen in thinking about preparing for the next Conference of Parties (CoP) in Mexico. Al-Sabban said developing countries felt their Danish hosts forced them to decide on the Copenhagen Accord with practically no notice. Heads of state were also called into the negotiations too early and they applied too much pressure \"when the deal was not there,\" he said. In specific response to the U.S. request for support for the Copenhagen Accord (ref H), Al-Sabban said Saudi Arabia was still studying the accord to determine its position. The SAG cares about the environment, but it also must care for its citizens, he said. Addressing Saudi Economic Concerns Key to Progress --------------------------------------------- ----- 3. (C) Asked how to move forward on a global climate change commitment, Al-Sabban agreed negotiations need a \"speedy outcome,\" and said countries need to rebuild trust and confidence through more transparent negotiations. He reminisced fondly about the inclusive nature of the initial Kyoto Protocol negotiations, which he said should be replicated in Cancun. Al-Sabban said climate change negotiations should remain under the UNFCCC and not be pursued under alternative frameworks. 4. (C) Asked about tangible actions to reach national climate change goals, Al-Sabban said Saudi Arabia's nationally appropriate actions would include carbon capture and storage (CCS) credits. He emphasized Saudi Arabia's need for technology transfer and foreign direct investment to mitigate the adverse impact that emissions-reducing policies may have on the Kingdom. Al-Sabban said the SAG had closely studied climate change policies' potential negative impacts. The Kingdom will need time to diversify its economy away from petroleum, he said, noting that a U.S. commitment to help Saudi Arabia with its economic diversification efforts would \"take the pressure off climate change negotiations.\" 5. (C) Al-Sabban said the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies was key to addressing Saudi Arabia's domestic energy demand, and he acknowledged the need for increased energy efficiency awareness. The deployment of CCS technology, he said, was \"crucial\" for Saudi Arabia. He said the U.S. Administration's rhetoric to end dependence on foreign oil, reiterated by President Obama in Copenhagen, is antagonistic and causes genuine fear in Saudi Arabia. The SAG is concerned about the outlook for oil demand and global production, and fears it will not be able to diversify in time to reach its development goals. Shadow Negotiator Suggests Partnership -------------------------------------- 6. (C) Senior Advisor to the President of Meteorology and Environment (PME) Fawaz Al-Alamy told Econoffs January 27 the U.S. and Saudi Arabia share the same values on climate change, but have different negotiation tactics. Al-Alamy, who joined PME in late 2009 and led Saudi Arabia's World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, said Saudi Petroleum Minister Ali Al-Naimi wants to move forward in UNFCCC negotiations. (Note: PME sends three representatives with Al-Sabban to climate change negotiations. End note.) Al-Sabban's negative approach to negotiations \"disheartens\" him, as does the ongoing \"blame game\" on climate change. Saudi Arabia, like China and India, needs to behave like an emerging economy rather than a developing country, he said. Al-Alamy noted he had met the previous day with both the Chinese and the Indian Ambassadors to the Kingdom to discuss climate change. 7. (C) Al-Alamy recommended several steps for U.S. engagement with Saudi Arabia on climate change, including active outreach to all the key players including Al-Sabban, Petroleum Minister Al-Naimi, and PME President Prince Turki bin Nasser. Al-Alamy recommended the U.S. reach out to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Secretary General, who has the power to tone down the alarm in the rest of the Arab world, such as in Egypt. Al-Alamy recommended the U.S. continue to coordinate its approach with other Embassies, which he said has been very effective. Asked how to get beyond the Kyoto Protocol lens through which Al-Sabban views climate negotiations, Al-Alamy quickly replied \"he only has two more years to talk about Kyoto\" before it expires. 8. (C) Al-Alamy said that Minister of Petroleum Al-Naimi strongly supports solar energy as he believes it will displace oil currently used in the power sector and ultimately increase oil exports. Saudi Arabia currently uses 1.5 million barrels per day to produce electricity and water, he said. The Kingdom is considering beginning a civilian nuclear program, and top leadership including Minister of Foreign Affairs Saud Al-Faisal supports the increased use of renewable energy sources. Some, however, view Copenhagen as a serious threat to Saudi Arabia's economic stability. \"Ask any Saudi,\" Al-Alamy said, \"they all think Saudi Arabia will be asked to foot the bill for climate change.\" Al-Alamy outlined Saudi Arabia's top concerns, including its strong aversion to mixing trade and environmental priorities. If duties are placed on oil and gas, Saudi Arabia will not be able to move ahead with its economic diversification plans, and this creates a \"phobia\" of climate change talks, he said. The Saudis also resent the U.S. when it makes decisions \"without consulting its friends.\" Al-Alamy said Saudi Arabia, and Al-Sabban in particular, needs to feel like a partner of U.S. decision making. Is Al-Naimi the Problem? ------------------------ 9. (S) Minister Al-Naimi has consistently been rational and practical in talking with western delegations about climate change, noting that Saudi Arabia had to address its development concerns, but conceding that the world needs to work together to address climate change. These reassuring statements stand in sharp contrast to Al-Sabban's public comments, such as questioning the science behind climate change just before Copenhagen, and his often obstructionist behavior, as reported by a number of Embassies in Riyadh, during working-level negotiations. Senior Ministry of Petroleum officials have reassured us after each of Al-Sabban's public outbursts over the last six months that he has been \"tamed\" and brought back onto the reservation. The frequency and number of times that Al-Sabban steps out of line, and the apparent lack of any sanction, raises questions about the real Saudi position on climate change. 10. (S) A recent conversation with UK Embassy officers suggests that indeed Al-Naimi may have some questions about climate change. They report that Al-Naimi was sharply critical of the Copenhagen meetings and the climate change effort in general, in marked contrast to earlier meetings. He complained that heads of state were brought in to negotiate the final stages, which prevented Saudi Arabia from voicing its true opposition to several elements. He also questioned the legality of the Copenhagen process and its future direction. 11. (S) A senior Ministry of Petroleum official explained that, leaving Copenhagen, the Saudi delegation was convinced that the Copenhagen accord would not attract significant support, apparently largely based on Al-Sabban's analysis. The Minister's office was unpleasantly surprised by mid-January, when it was clear that a number of countries had already associated themselves with the accord. Assistant Petroleum Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told EconCouns that he had spent two days walking Minister Al-Naimi through each of the 90 plus submissions on the UNFCCC web site. Prince Abdulaziz told the Minister that Saudi Arabia had missed a real opportunity to submit \"something clever,\" like India or China, that was not legally binding but indicated some goodwill towards the process without compromising key economic interests. The Prince intimated to EconCouns that Al-Sabban would not long retain his position, and said the challenge for Saudi Arabia was to find a way to \"climb down\" from its negotiating position. Comment ------- 12. (C) All indications are that Saudi officials are intensely discussing what position the country should take. We believe that the message is getting through, that there is a broad consensus among countries that tangible action needs to be taken now to address climate change. We also think that Saudi leaders are beginning to understand that they are in increasing danger of being left behind. They do have significant, legitimate concerns about how this process will affect their long-term livelihood. Our conversations, however, with officials in Finance, Petroleum and the other economic ministries suggests that they have not done sufficient economic analysis of the various scenarios to understand what the real impact of a climate change agreement might be. Such a discussion might help provide the kind of dispassionate basis to address legitimate Saudi concerns, while also making a better case for the need to take action to mitigate increasing emissions. We take as an encouraging sign the fact that several Saudi officials have noted to us that the Kyoto agreement only runs for two more years, suggesting that some at least understand the need to chart a more assured future course. We take the suggestion seriously that we help the Saudis find a way to climb down from their current position, ideally by offering the hand of partnership, which may help persuade the rest of OPEC to follow suit. For now, we believe that success will require a sustained, broad engagement with Saudi leadership, as we think the problem is more than just a rogue negotiator, but some broadly shared fears about the future, and uncertainty about the way forward.

The leaked figures, which emerged ahead of the Copenhagen climate change summit next Monday, follow Beijing's announcement last week that China would move to cut carbon intensity - the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic growth - by more than 40% by 2020. The EU has already pledged a 20% cut in carbon emissions by 2020 - set to rise to 30% if other developed countries match the European target - while the US last month proposed cuts of 17%. Sources told the Indian media that the reduction in carbon intensity could go up to 37% by 2030, compared to 2005. India's environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, is expected to make a statement in parliament tomorrow to announce the targets, Reuters reported. To reduce emissions, India's national action plan on climate change sees increasing solar power generation, improving energy efficiency and enhancing carbon sinks as a route to \"greener growth\". In August, India laid out an ambitious plan to generate 20GW of solar power by 2020, which could equate to 75% of the world's solar energy. The country, which is the world's fourth-highest emitter of greenhouse gases, has been under pressure from developed nations to announce what it will do to control emissions. With an economy estimated to grow at 6.5% next year, many have pointed out that Delhi's contribution to global warming will increase substantially. India's \"voluntary reductions\" were first floated by Ramesh last week during talks with the Chinese prime minister. He told journalists then that India could not afford to be seen as lagging behind in other nations in offering to act. \"We have to look at it. I don't think we can sweep (aside) the fact that China, Indonesia, Brazil, South Africa and peer group countries have put down voluntary, unilateral, non-legally binding, quantitative targets,\" the minister said. Ramesh also said Delhi would shoot down the Danish proposal to set a \"peaking year\" after which global emissions will fall. A draft proposal suggested that global emissions peak by 2020. A senior government official who declined to be named told Reuters that India's final targets, likely to be presented at next week's global climate change talks in Copenhagen, could reflect a broad range rather than a specific figure. Talks for a new global climate treaty to succeed the 1997 Kyoto protocol beyond 2012 are deadlocked as rich and poor nations trade blows. The issues range from emission targets to the financial aid for developing countries to help them cope with the effects of climate change. Delhi has been a hardliner in the negotiations saying it won't accept legally binding emission caps and offered only to keep per-capita output of carbon lower than that of richer nations. The average Indian's carbon footprint is eight times smaller than the average person in Britain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/apr/06/tesco-england-world-cup-sponsor","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-06T19:27:08Z","webTitle":"Tesco takes a punt on World Cup sponsorship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/apr/06/tesco-england-world-cup-sponsor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/apr/06/tesco-england-world-cup-sponsor","fields":{"headline":"Tesco takes a punt on World Cup sponsorship","bodyText":"When the England football team heads to the airport to begin training for the World Cup, they will be driven in cars supplied by Fiat, dressed in suits supplied by Marks and Spencer, hop onto a Virgin Atlantic aircraft, wearing Nivea hair gel, and now tucking into food supplied by Britain's biggest supermarket. Tesco today became the latest official supplier to the England team for the duration of an event which many retailers and pubs across Britain hope will manage to haul the economy from the doldrums. The commercial terms of the latest deal are not public, but Tesco, which has supplanted Sainsbury's as the official England supermarket, intends to get the most for its money. At a launch in Wembley stadium, Tesco retail director David Potts outlined the military planning that the supermarket has put in place, from World Cup trading cards at every checkout, to additional staff at Tesco Express stores, in anticipation of fans dashing in for pizzas (including football-themed margaritas), beers and snacks ahead of the game, Clubcard promotions and a World Cup web portal. He said the company expects to sell 8m packs of trading cards, 300,000 television sets and 800,000 England flags. Party \"We will be past the election and the other side of the recession and people will be in a mood to party,\" he said. \"We are a different business since the last World Cup, we sell a lot more general merchandise than we did, and we will take advantage of people wanting to buy things like new TVs. We also have twice as many Express stores.\" Tesco will be going up against Asda, which will be selling official Fifa merchandise through a deal signed by its parent company Wal-Mart. The British Retail Consortium estimates that the 2006 World Cup generated £1.25bn in retail sales and anticipates similar for 2010. \"Despite the different economic conditions, we would be hoping for something similar,\" a spokesman said. \"There has been so much doom and gloom, consumers might see this as an antidote.\" Analysts reckon that the failure of any home nation sides to get into the Euro 2008 tournament, plus the fact that South Africa's time zone will allow peak viewing hours, will make this World Cup an especial boon for the economy. Consumer brands are ramping up their marketing budgets to take advantage. Another England sponsor, Carlsberg, is spending £18m on a marketing campaign around the event, 60% of its budget for 2010, including 2.6m packs offering drinkers the chance to meet England players. \"We have studied sales patterns over previous World Cups and it's like having two Christmases in a year,\" said David Scott, director of customer marketing. The British Beer and Pub Association suggests the tournament will generate £124m for pubs. JJB Sports, which reported a £35.5m increase in revenue from the sale of replica football kits during the 2006 campaign, has launched a promotion offering to refund customers the cost of their England shirt if the team wins the tournament, clearly a calculated gamble. Electrical retailer Comet says that TV sales rose by 60% ahead of the Germany event. Others likely to benefit are bookmakers and ITV, which is sharing broadcast rights with the BBC. Maureen Hinton, retail analyst at Verdict Research, also notes that while there will be winners from the World Cup, there will also be losers, including clothing, footwear and DIY retailers. \"The World Cup shifts demand from one area to another.\" Despite the recession, organisers do not appear to have had any trouble signing sponsors. At the top of the pile, Fifa has six \"partners\", which give four-year commitments, and are associated with all Fifa events; Adidas, Coca-Cola, Emirates, Hyundai, Sony and Visa. Below that, Fifa signs up further sponsors for the event, currently seven and including Budweiser, Continental, McDonald's and the first ever Chinese firm to get involved, Yingli Solar, a solar energy firm. For the 2007-2010 World Cup cycle, Fifa is estimated to have generated revenue of $3.2bn (£2.1bn), compared to $2.6bn in the 2003-2006 cycle. Teams also bring in their own sponsors, though strict rules mean they are not allowed to use the World Cup logo. A football association spokesman describes the England team sponsorship as \"very powerful currency\". But some firms still try to hijack the event without paying. Officially PepsiCo has no involvement. But the company still hopes to create an association with the event, with an accompanying rise in sales. Its Walkers crisps brand has launched a promotion using 15 new flavours, reflecting the nations in the tournament, including spaghetti bolognese, Brazilian salsa and Dutch Edam cheese. Impact Mars took the guerilla approach in 2006 and \"ambushed\" the event by changing the name of the chocolate bar to \"Believe\" during the tournament. The company claims the Believe campaign was behind a 7.4% increase in sales that year. For South Africa though, Mars has gone official. The company recently became one of the suppliers to the England team and for the duration of the tournament will be changing its packaging again, to a red-and-white wrapper inspired by the St George flag. But the size of the impact on particular brands and the economy as a whole will in large part depend on England's performance on the pitch. The FA and the companies that have invested millions of pounds in sponsorship shrug off concerns about England getting knocked out early in the tournament. But Hinton takes a more phlegmatic view. \"It does create a feelgood factor that permeates through the whole population, but it is also very important how well England does.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2009/jul/10/art-exhibitions-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-10T16:07:22Z","webTitle":"Exhibitionist: The best art shows to see this week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jul/10/art-exhibitions-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2009/jul/10/art-exhibitions-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Exhibitionist: The best art shows to see this week","bodyText":"Given our current obsession with ideas about the environment, energy and survival, now feels like a good time for a retrospective of Joseph Beuys, which is just as well: one has just opened at the beautiful De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill-on-Sea. Beuys was likewise obsessed, crafting natural materials such as fat and felt into esoteric and intriguing works – many of them driven by a traumatic experience he suffered in 1944, when the bomber he was flying in was shot down over the Crimea and he was (so he later claimed) kept alive by Russian villagers, who swaddled him in fat to keep him warm. Several important works, such as Fat Chair (1964-85), an ordinary wooden chair with melted fat on the seat, are included here, as well as the sculpture Scala Napoletana (1985), made a few months before the artist's death, which is being shown in the UK for the first time. In one sculpture, a yellow lightbulb is plugged directly into a lemon, bringing to mind the energy that streams direct from the sun. At Milton Keynes Gallery, meanwhile, a new generation of artists is taking an interest in humble materials. The title of Quiet Revolution, which is curated by Chris Fite-Wassilak, hints that altering the way we feel about humdrum household objects – fabric, buckets, brooms and boxes – might ultimately give us the power to change the world. Peer into Hreinn Friðfinnsson's Sanctuary (1992-2008) and you see an open cardboard box lined with blue paper that shines like the sky. David Beattie's Arc II (2007) features a section of rainbow-coloured hula hoop leaning against a mirror, creating a complete arc in reflection. In Nottingham, more everyday objects are examined for their mystical potential in Rachel Reupke's exhibition Swing Gang at Moot gallery. The artist presents for your consideration a neatly folded pile of towels: neutral, fluffy, comforting. Reupke's video work, which is based on stock footage, dwells on further connotations – health, sex, cleanliness. Are our dreams and desires similarly stockpiled, Reupke seems to ask. If you're in London this week you'll have two chances to see work by Eva Rothschild. In Pimlico, she's taken over Tate Britain's imposing neoclassical galleries with a zigzagging black metal sculpture, Cold Corners, as part of the annual Duveens Commission. At Fitzrovia's Stuart Shave/Modern Art, she reveals a softer, more sensuous side. Here her sculptures use colour, too, and feature materials such as polystyrene and mosaic tiling. Sponge-like pebble shapes wrapped in black glass beads form a chain that reaches from floor to ceiling, while a squiggle of foam in a grey-bottomed cloud hovers nearby. Across the river, at south London's Gasworks, you'll find evidence of Aurélien Froment's attempts to get into shipbuilding. The artist became fascinated with Werner Herzog's film Fitzcarraldo, in which a rubber baron attempts to have a steamship pulled through the Amazonian rainforest in order to access new territory. Struck by the image, Froment attempted to build a model himself. This exhibition sees the artist meeting Herzog to discuss what the image of a boat wedged at the top of a mountain means to them both (you can read the transcript of their conversation), but also considers Enlightenment educationalist Friedrich Fröbel's idea that learning is the art of making and doing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2009/dec/02/india-reveal-carbon-emission-target","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-02T21:29:51Z","webTitle":"India reveals carbon emission targets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/02/india-reveal-carbon-emission-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/dec/02/india-reveal-carbon-emission-target","fields":{"headline":"India reveals carbon emission targets","bodyText":"India became the last of the \"big four\" polluters to reveal its opening hand in the negotiations today, ahead of the crucial climate change talks in Copenhagen next week. Government sources revealed the country could curb the carbon emitted relative to the growth of its economy – its carbon intensity – by 24% by 2020. The target would mean emissions would continue to rise as the government aims to lift millions out of poverty, but by less than currently predicted. The leaked figure days after the announcement last week that China would cut its carbon intensity by more than 40% by 2020. The EU has already pledged a 20% cut in carbon emissions by 2020 – set to rise to 30% if other developed countries match the European target – while the US last month proposed cuts of 17%. These four are expected to emit almost two-thirds of the carbon between now and 2050. Comparing the targets is complicated. India and China's target are for carbon intensity, but they at least use the same base year, 2005. The EU uses 1990 as a base year, while the US uses 2005. But observers see all the targets as below what scientists say are needed to give an even chance of keeping temperature rise below the dangerous limit of 2C. \"If India offers an emissions target, even if it's relative to their economic growth, it's a very welcome step,\" said Bryony Worthington, founder of campaign group Sandbag. \"It's yet another sign that rapidly developing countries see the potential for green growth. Europe now needs to up its game and commit to targets which really get to grips with our apparently unshakeable addiction to carbon.\" Sources told the Indian media that the reduction in carbon intensity could go up to 37% by 2030, compared with 2005.

These have become so pervasive, that you might be persuaded that the large oil companies have seen the light on the climate crisis and are pouring a major proportion of their investments into developing renewable energy technologies. But is this the truth? Take for example Total Oil. It is the world's fifth largest oil and gas company with operations in more than 130 countries. It has been running newspaper adverts boasting about its solar energy investments. They are festooned with pictures of giraffes and large solar-panels. Here's the blurb: \"To meet growing energy demands and to prepare for the future, Total is contributing to the boom in new energies, which complement fossil fuels. One of our priorities is the development of solar energy. Present for over 25 years in the photovoltaic field, Total is involved in a large part of the industrial chain with our subsidiaries Tenesol (manufacturer of solar panels, system development) and Photovoltech (cell manufacture).\" The advert goes on to say that Total is investing 100 million euros this year in solar energy. The company's website also trumpets its green credentials. One of its four ambitions is: \"Preparing for future energies, ie innovating and pursuing our research efforts to support the development of new energies.\" To the casual reader this might sound impressive, but is it really a \"priority\" as the company's advert states? By Total's standards the sums involved are such small beer they would put a micro-brewery to shame. In 2009 their total investments will come to 14bn euros. Thus the 100 million euro solar investment amounts to less than 0.71%! Three quarters of their total investment is in exploration and development of oil and gas fields (so called \"upstream\" activities). The report from the annual shareholders' meeting and meeting of board of directors on May 15 describes this as \"the priority growth sector\". Total also appears to have gone cold on other renewable energy technologies. It operates a wind farm in Mardyk near Dunkirk in France. But in the company's 2008 registration document it wrote: \"Total has decided to dispose of certain of its wind farm projects.\" So rather than making renewable technology investment a \"priority\" as their advert campaigns says, they are still investing vastly more in hydrocarbons. This lack of genuine commitment is further illustrated by the fact that buried deep within their much trumpeted environmental report, the indicator about the amount of renewable energy used by the company, is accompanied by the statement \"Indicator Not Reported\" (see page 98). Scientists have recently calculated that the world can use less than half the known economically recoverable fossil fuel reserves by 2050, if we are to achieve the goal of avoiding dangerous temperature rises of over 2C this century. And last week, Kofi Annan's Global Humanitarian Forum announced a study which suggests that 300,000 people a year are already dying due to the climate crisis. The consequences of continuing the vast investments by the oil companies in finding ever more fossil fuels and all of us using them in ever growing quantities are simply homicidal. I decided to file a formal complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) about Total's campaign. This is really easy to do online, as they will even accept a scanned copy of the advert via email. I was disappointed however that they did not uphold the complaint. The judgment stated: \"We don't consider that the ad implies that this is the main area or focus of their business.\" It sadly failed to address the consequences of companies constantly telling the public about the tiny proportion of their investments which are positive, while ignoring the vast majority which are destroying our climate. Although I deplore the \"greenwash\", it would be a disaster if Total abandoned such investments. The world's population desperately needs these corporations' vast research and development resources to go into renewables. If you or your pension fund are shareholders in such companies, ask them to support such investments at future AGMs. Alternatively, if you want to help persuade the ASA that there is public support for putting an end to this greenwash by the oil industry, file a formal complaint online to the ASA the when you see an advert with overblown green claims.

The scheme - set up by an organisation backed by Sir David Attenborough, the former diplomat Sir Crispin Tickell and green figureheads such as Jonathon Porritt and James Lovelock - argues that family planning is the most effective way to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic global warming. Optimum Population Trust (Opt) stresses that birth control will be provided only to those who have no access to it, and only unwanted births would be avoided. Opt estimates that 80 million pregnancies each year are unwanted. The cost-benefit analysis commissioned by the trust claims that family planning is the cheapest way to reduce carbon emissions. Every £4 spent on contraception, it says, saves one tonne of CO2 being added to global warming, but a similar reduction in emissions would require an £8 investment in tree planting, £15 in wind power, £31 in solar energy and £56 in hybrid vehicle technology. Calculations based on the trust's figures show the 10 tonnes emitted by a return flight from London to Sydney would be offset by enabling the avoidance of one unwanted birth in a country such as Kenya. Such action not only cuts emissions but reduces the number of people who will fall victim to climate change, it says. \"The scheme, called PopOffsets, understands the connection [between population increase and climate change],\" says the trust director Roger Martin. \"It offers a practical and sensible response. For the first time ever individuals, companies and organisations will have the opportunity to offset their carbon voluntarily by supporting projects to provide family planning services where there is currently unmet demand.\" In papers released with the launch of the offset scheme, the trust claims that reducing CO 2 by 34 gigatonnes would cost about $220bn with family planning, but more than $1tn with low carbon technologies. The 34 gigatonnes is roughly what the world emits in a year, and would be achieved by cutting the projected global population in 2050 by 500 million. The world's population, presently 6.8 billion, is increasing by nearly 84 million a year. The growth is equivalent to a new country the size of Germany each year, or a city the size of Birmingham every week. It is expected by the UN to peak at about 9 billion people in 2050. By this time, UN scientists say global carbon emissions must have reduced by at least 80% to avoid dangerous rises in temperature, meaning the carbon footprint of each citizen in 2050 will have to be very low. \"The current level of human population growth is unsustainable and places acute pressure on global resources. Human activity is exacerbating global warming, and higher population levels inevitably mean higher emissions and more climate change victims,\" said Martin. The giant carbon footprints of developed countries mean prevented births will save far more carbon than those in developing nations. However, some development groups opposed the plan. \"We are keen that any money raised [from offsets] help the poorest who are most vulnerable to climate change. [But] it would be misleading if it was spent in this way. It should go to [immediate] things like disaster risk reduction, food security and water,\" said Paul Cook, advocacy director of Tearfund, a faith-based development group. Population control is highly contentious in rich and poor countries alike Some, such as Jonathon Porritt, the former Sustainable Development Commission chair, have said promotion of reproductive health is one of the most progressive forms of intervention. \"Had there been no 'one child family' policy in China there would now have been 400 million additional Chinese citizens,\" he has said. But other thinkers, such as the Guardian columnist George Monbiot, say global population increase pales into insignificance when compared with the effect of increased consumption and economic growth."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"/Public/budgets-green-projects-public-sector","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-23T11:18:55Z","webTitle":"Going green to get out of the red","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com//Public/budgets-green-projects-public-sector","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com//Public/budgets-green-projects-public-sector","fields":{"headline":"Going green to get out of the red","bodyText":"Back in November, children's secretary Ed Balls ordered schools to turn lights off and heating down. Part of the government's commitment to reduce harmful CO2 emissions by 40% by 2030? Perhaps of more immediate concern was the expected £750m such measures would save. The schools drive highlights the truth of the environmentalists' refrain: sustainability is common sense, and easier on both planet and wallet. The government has its targets – central office estates carbon neutral by 2012, water consumption reduced by 25% and 75% of waste recycled by 2020, and is working towards these aims – but sustainability's case is likely to be made even more forcefully with future budget cuts. Why aren't more public sector bodies recognising the wisdom of going green to get out of the red? For many, it's a case of short-termism: green initiatives inch further down the to-do list as outlays increase. Martin Hunt of environmental thinktank Forum for the Future (FFF) says they need to spend to save, investing in \"whole-life payback\". \"Focusing on capital spend alone is a false economy: budgets may be shrinking, but maintaining the value of assets for the longer term creates savings in the future, especially with buildings that will be here for decades. Factoring in the public spend deficit and coming cuts, we have to get a lot smarter about how we see the financing of our built environment.\" With 100 new hospitals to be built in 2010, future-proofing will result in long-term savings. Energy bills can be slashed even before the application of technology: a holistic view of sustainability would see buildings positioned to maximise sunlight and heat, with green spaces providing cooling shade. In New Jersey, US, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital is making big savings on its annual $20m utilities spend by renting out its roof for solar panels. From April, UK public sector buildings that generate their own wind or solar energy through wind turbines or solar panels will be able to sell excess electricity back to the national grid through feed-in tariffs. Fit for the future FFF's 2003 report Fit for the Future details how different climate change scenarios would impact on health service provision going into 2030. Despite the economic and environmental case – the NHS consumes 45m gigajoule of energy and 40m square metres of water a year – and significant policy-drivers, Hunt says uptake of the sustainability agenda among trusts has been \"patchy\". There is help out there, however: organisations such as SHINE (the Sustainable Heathcare Network) advise on delivering healthcare sustainability through buildings and procured services, while The Carbon Trust funds not-for-profit social enterprise Salix, providing public sector bodies with loans and grants for environmental and sustainability projects. It calculates it has made savings of £85m from 4,300 projects since its inception, one of which is Frimley Park Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, in Surrey. \"We lower energy expenditure through efficiency schemes in order to divert money into patient care,\" says business and performance manager Kwan Cheng. \"We have a programme to fit double-glazed windows, low-energy radiators and lighting, and a rolling programme to replace the roof and improve insulation.\" An investment of £100,000, half from Salix, will result in annual savings of £25,000 (251 tonnes of CO2); bigger projects, such as Great Ormond Street's new Children's Medical Centre, complete with green roof, can expect to offset 20,000 tonnes of CO2 annually and cut energy costs still further. An added proven benefit is that greener buildings can impact positively on, for example, patient recovery rates and teacher satisfaction. As Martin Hunt says, \"Sustainability doesn't just mean carbon or cost savings – there are other criteria by which the efficiency of trusts or education authorities can be measured.\" Energy consumption across government IT systems will be carbon neutral by 2012; the Greening Government IT strategy report reveals savings of almost £7m and 12,000 tonnes of CO2, by simple expedients such as delaying how often printers are replaced. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is reducing the number of its servers from 100 to eight, to cut power consumption by two-thirds and waste heat emissions by three-quarters – saving \"a significant amount of money in ongoing costs,\" according to a spokesperson. As budgets bite further, we can expect sustainability to become a lot more appealing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/feb/13/algae-solve-pentagon-fuel-problem","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-13T16:04:10Z","webTitle":"Algae to solve the Pentagon's jet fuel problem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/13/algae-solve-pentagon-fuel-problem","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/feb/13/algae-solve-pentagon-fuel-problem","fields":{"headline":"Algae to solve the Pentagon's jet fuel problem","bodyText":"The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday 21 February 2010 This item contained incorrect information supplied by the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). We repeated its assertion that jet fuel production from refined algae would begin next year. Darpa now says that it should have told us that testing will begin next year with production not planned until 2013. The brains trust of the Pentagon says it is just months away from producing a jet fuel from algae for the same cost as its fossil-fuel equivalent. The claim, which comes from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) that helped to develop the internet and satellite navigation systems, has taken industry insiders by surprise. A cheap, low-carbon fuel would not only help the US military, the nation's single largest consumer of energy, to wean itself off its oil addiction, but would also hold the promise of low-carbon driving and flying for all. Darpa's research projects have already extracted oil from algal ponds at a cost of $2 per gallon. It is now on track to begin large-scale refining of that oil into jet fuel, at a cost of less than $3 a gallon, according to Barbara McQuiston, special assistant for energy at Darpa. That could turn a promising technology into a market-ready one. Researchers have cracked the problem of turning pond scum and seaweed into fuel, but finding a cost-effective method of mass production could be a game-changer. \"Everyone is well aware that a lot of things were started in the military,\" McQuiston said. The work is part of a broader Pentagon effort to reduce the military's thirst for oil, which runs at between 60 and 75 million barrels of oil a year. Much of that is used to keep the US Air Force in flight. Commercial airlines – such as Continental and Virgin Atlantic – have also been looking at the viability of an algae-based jet fuel, as has the Chinese government. \"Darpa has achieved the base goal to date,\" she said. \"Oil from algae is projected at $2 per gallon, headed towards $1 per gallon.\" McQuiston said a larger-scale refining operation, producing 50 million gallons a year, would come on line in 2011 and she was hopeful the costs would drop still further – ensuring that the algae-based fuel would be competitive with fossil fuels. She said the projects, run by private firms SAIC and General Atomics, expected to yield 1,000 gallons of oil per acre from the algal farm. McQuiston's projections took several industry insiders by surprise. \"It's a little farther out in time,\" said Mary Rosenthal, director of the Algal Biomass Association. \"I am not saying it is going to happen in the next three months, but it could happen in the next two years.\" But the possibilities have set off a scramble to discover the cheapest way of mass-producing an algae-based fuel. Even Exxon – which once notoriously dismissed biofuels as moonshine – invested $600m in research last July. Unlike corn-based ethanol, algal farms do not threaten food supplies. Some strains are being grown on household waste and in brackish water. Algae draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere when growing; when the derived fuel is burned, the same CO2 is released, making the fuel theoretically zero-carbon, although processing and transporting the fuel requires some energy. The industry received a further boost earlier this month, when the Environmental Protection Agency declared that algae-based diesel reduced greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50% compared with conventional diesel. The Obama administration had earlier awarded $80m in research grants to a new generation of algae and biomass fuels. For Darpa, the support for algae is part of a broader mission for the US military to obtain half of its fuel from renewable energy sources by 2016. That time line meant that the Pentagon needed to develop technologies to make its hardware \"fuel agnostic\", capable that is of running on any energy source including methane and propane. The US Air Force wants its entire fleet of jet fighters and transport aircraft to test-fly a 50-50 blend of petroleum-based fuel and other sources – including algae – by next year. The switch is partly driven by cost, but military commanders in Afghanistan and Iraq are also anxious to create a lighter, more fuel-efficient force that is less dependent on supply convoys, which are vulnerable to attack from insurgents. Give the military the capability of creating jet fuel in the field, and you would eliminate that danger, McQuiston said. \"In Afghanistan, if you could be able to create jet fuel from indigenous sources and rely on that, you'd not only be able to source energy for the military, but you'd also be able to leave an infrastructure that would be more sustainable.\" McQuiston said the agency was also looking at how to make dramatic improvements in the photo-voltaic cells that collect solar energy. She said making PV 50% more efficient would create a future when even the smallest devices, such as mobile phones, would be powered by their own solar cells."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2010/aug/14/free-solar-panels","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-13T23:01:39Z","webTitle":"Free solar panels sound good, but buying them yourself is better","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/aug/14/free-solar-panels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2010/aug/14/free-solar-panels","fields":{"headline":"Free solar panels sound good, but buying them yourself is better","bodyText":"It is an offer that sounds almost too good to refuse. A company will install £15,000-worth of solar panels on your roof absolutely free; in return you get £150-£230 worth of free electricity for the next 25 years. The last few weeks have seen the launch of a clutch of companies vying to install a complete electricity-generating system on your home either free, or for a £500 payment. Isis Solar, HomeSun and A Shade Greener, are hoping to grab the owners of the most suitable roofs, and you can expect more firms to come into the market. So far, they have enjoyed a blaze of positive publicity and say they are planning to install solar panels on more than 120,000 roofs by 2015. But why should a private company be so happy throwing money at you? What they're after is the super-lucrative \"feed-in-tariffs\" (Fits) worth £900 to £1,450 a year they will be paid for covering your roof in photovoltaic cells. Ever since the Labour government announced the introduction of Fits in February, City investors and at least one hedge fund have been looking at ways to cash-in on the deals that have transformed solar take-up in other parts of Europe. This is now happening in Britain. So what is the 'free' deal? If you can't raise the cash to install solar panels yourself, and you have a suitable roof (see below) it is, on the face of it, a great offer. You don't have to do a thing, apart from put up with a few days' disruption and make the odd cup of tea for the installers. In return for signing a 25-year agreement to house the panels, you will get the electricity generated by the system during the day, assuming you're in the house to use it. Bill Sneyd of HomeSun says most users will save about 30% of their bill, though by changing behaviour (running washing machines etc during the day) you can increase this substantially. As electricity prices rise, the savings will grow. \"Mothers at home with small children, the retired, and home-workers will clearly benefit most,\" he says. The installers will monitor and maintain the panels (these systems need very little maintenance) and insure them against theft or vandalism. The householder has to agree to keep them for the full term, and if the house is sold, the panels are passed on to the new owner. However, at the end of the 25-year period, the owner will keep the panels. They won't get any Fits, but will probably still generate electricity, and produce some income for any power exported back to the grid. What type of roof works? The companies are looking for the most productive roofs, and if yours doesn't fit the bill, you will be turned down. You need to have a roof with up to 30 square metres of usable space. It will have to be almost exactly south-facing and entirely unshaded – no trees/ telegraph poles etc – and, ideally, at a pitch of around 40 degrees. Telegraph wire shading may be acceptable. HomeSun is only looking for houses as far north inland as Nottingham, and up to Hull and Liverpool on each coast. You need a strong roof; the installers are unlikely to pay for any strengthening required, though this is rarely needed. Houses in conservation areas or that are listed and face planning constraints, will similarly be overlooked. If you have a roof that has good potential, but is not the best, HomeSun will install a smaller system for £500, plus a £5/month charge. What's the downside? If you're rarely at home during day, the savings will not be as big as claimed. Also you may have difficulty selling your home, despite the promise of lower bills. Bizarre as it might seem, some people have reported having to remove solar panels to get a buyer to complete. (These systems are quite big, and will radically change the look of your property.) Consumer Focus has produced a guide on its website which includes all the questions you should ask before signing on the dotted line. It says if you in any doubt get a solicitor to check the contract. A key question is whether you can buy out the system, and gain the Fits, after it has been installed. What do the companies make? In return for their investment, likely to be £11,000-£16,000 depending on the size of the system, they pocket the lucrative Fits for every unit of electricity generated –currently 41.3p per KWh irrespective of whether you consume the power at the time or not. Once you add in the export tariffs (for power not used), the total payments are worth about £900-£1,450 a year. These are guaranteed for 25 years, are payable via the utility company, and will rise in line with inflation. By any stretch of the imagination, the companies are making a great return from your roof. If I install the panels myself can I take this money? Yes – and if you have a suitable roof, plus the ability to raise £15,000, this is what you should do. Current remortgaging rates are no more than around 5%-6%, and often lower, but even if you end up paying 12% interest you will still make a huge profit. Most calculations suggest buyers will be able to pay off the costs after nine to 10 years, depending on how much they pay for finance. Most households will make a risk-free profit of £20,000 over the 25 years while enjoying lower electricity bills. What do the experts say? Cathy Debenham, who runs a website devoted to helping people thinking of installing this, and other similar technology, yougen.co.uk, says the introduction of the \"free\" installers is an \"interesting development\". \"The main problem with Fits was that it was limited to those who could afford the big up-front costs, and anything that opens it up to a wider audience has to be a good thing. That said, I recently installed a 2kW system and worked out that it would have covered its costs after nine years. I prefer to keep control of the payments.\" Solar energy expert, Richard Drinkwater, a director with of Mipower, based in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, is more robust. He warns that homeowners will lose out on tens of thousands of pounds if they take out these superficially generous deals. \"Effectively, customers using a company offering a 'free' solar photovoltaic system may be getting around £230 free electricity per year, but may not appreciate they are giving away a cash income of more than £35,000 over 25 years from a system that would cost around £15,000.\" \"Fits will typically pay back the cost of a big 4kW system within 10 years. A recent customer had a 2.6kW system fitted at a cost of just over £11,000. He paid a small deposit and borrowed more than £9,000 from his building society. He got a five-year deal which costs him just over £170 a month and knows that after five years the system is his.\" Simon Osborn, policy adviser at Which?, agrees that if you have the means to pay for solar panels yourself, then you may well be better off. What does Money think? If you have a suitable roof and a half decent credit history, you should have the panels installed yourself. This is one investment worth going into debt for – and you can buy a system from the \"free\" installers, allowing you to take the lucrative Fits yourself. If you don't think you will ever be able to raise the cash, it still might be worth waiting. The government's green loans programme, or the power firms, may yet offer loans to those wanting to install solar panels. If that happens, it will offer cheap loans to anyone with a suitable roof, regardless of credit history, as repayments will be deducted from the Fits. Alternatively, other firms may yet enter the market and offer a better deal, including a share of the Fits. That said, there is a suggestion that the Fits will not be around forever. There is a risk that the scheme will be scaled back or axed, but it's likely this would only affect those installing systems after that date. In other words, if you install now, you'll pick up the Fits for its life, but someone installing in a few years' time may not be so lucky. Case study: electricity bills drop £10 a week\" One woman who is very pleased she signed up for \"free\" solar panels is Karen Ward. The 45-year-old, who lives with her husband and four other members of her extended family, says her weekly electricity bills have fallen by around £10 a week since the panels were installed. The family, who live in Borehamwood, Herts, rent from a housing association and were promised \"free\" electricity in return for letting Eaga install the panels on their roof, as part of its clean energy programme which is designed to provide free solar to social housing tenants. \"Our neighbour had it done first and I noticed she was spending much less than I was on electricity, so I thought why not,\" Karen says. She says that the installation took about a week and she now has two small meters next to the prepay meter. There is also new box (inverter) in the roof. \"It was all very painless and the savings have been good. We pay for our electricity using a keycard which we load at the local shop. I used to be putting £15-£20 a week on it, now it's closer to £5. With six of us, the washing machine is always on. I'm at home during the day looking after my grandson, which means we get the most benefit, although it has probably helped that it has been a sunny summer,\" Karen says. She is now planning to turn off the central heating in winter, and to try and use an electric heater to take advantage of the free electricity. \"If someone offers you this, go for it. There's no downside that we've come across.\" • This article was amended on 17 August 2010. The original referred to the Fits for every unit of electricity generated as currently being 43.1p per KWh.

Good one, I thought: they're imagining carbon offsetting at its most ludicrous extreme. But then I read further: \"The scheme, called PopOffsets, understands the connection [between population increase and climate change],\" says the Optimum Population Trust's director Roger Martin. \"It offers a practical and sensible response. For the first time ever individuals, companies and organisations will have the opportunity to offset their carbon voluntarily by supporting projects to provide family planning services where there is currently unmet demand.\" I believe \"WTF\" is the acronym now favoured when faced with such statements. But before we delve into the rights and wrongs of such a notion, let's at least hear the logic behind it … Every £4 spent on contraception, it says, saves one tonne of CO2 being added to global warming, but a similar reduction in emissions would require an £8 investment in tree planting, £15 in wind power, £31 in solar energy and £56 in hybrid vehicle technology. The Optimum Population Trust (OPT), which is supported by environmental grandees such as Sir David Attenborough and James Lovelock, is arguing that, instead of planting tress and the like, it makes much better sense for people in developed nations to offset their emissions by paying for condoms to be handed out in developing nations where birth rates are much higher. To facilitate this, a website has now been set up where you can calculate your emissions for, say, your \"summer holiday 2009\" and then make a donation which helps pay for contraceptives to be distributed in countries such as India and Kenya. The very first project which will receive OPT funding is Blue Ventures in Madagascar, which, according to the OPT, \"has one of the world's fastest growing populations, with an average fertility rate of over five births per woman and nearly half of its population currently under 15 years of age\". I've never really been a fan of offsetting. Ultimately, it just smacks of convenience and displaced guilt. Even some of the travel companies who enthusiastically leapt on the offsetting bandwagon are now abandoning it, saying it's little more than an illusionary sop. But I do think this latest offsetting hybrid sends out the wrong message altogether and will be largely ridiculed. That's not to undermine the genuine concerns of the OPT – even as a father myself, I do think population growth is a subject that is all too often ignored, not just by environmentalists, but the wider world – but I think it might have misjudged this one badly. \"Population offsetting\" – even the name gives me the shivers – smells of warped imperialism, bordering on Brave New World. Yes, cold hard logic might lead you to conclude that it makes sense, but if anyone needs a parachute full of condoms and contraceptive pills, it's the developed world where per capita emissions are much, much higher than in places such as Madagascar. If anything, it should be the other way round: the Malagasy should be insisting the condoms are left on our doorsteps, not their own. (To be fair, OPT does make a good stab at answering such criticisms on its \"Your Questions Answered\" page, but it doesn't remove the fact that, as a headline solution, this will make it a laughing stock and, ultimately, damage its cause.) Curbing population growth is a near-impossible subject to discuss at the best of times. It is even harder to pick out any workable solutions that don't ultimately lead you down the road towards totalitarianism. People who even dare to raise it as a problem – as the OPT well know – are called all manner of unmentionable things. Quite rightly, a fair response is to ask the doubters: \"So, what would you do then?\" A deafening silence usually follows, and I readily admit that I also can't see how you could ever significantly reduce the world's population – and thereby reach a sustainable \"carrying capacity\" – without resorting to tactics that would rightly offend virtually every constituent on the planet. So, let's applaud them for at least trying to get this subject into the national debate, but surely it's time to return to the drawing board when you are forced to resort to notions such as population offsetting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2009/jul/13/manchester-report-marine-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-12T23:10:01Z","webTitle":"Manchester Report: Marine energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/13/manchester-report-marine-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/jul/13/manchester-report-marine-energy","fields":{"headline":"Marine energy","bodyText":"A huge amount of energy is stored in, on and above the oceans. Strong sea winds can be exploited with offshore windfarms, while waves can be converted into electricity using articulated snake-like generators. Scientists and engineers are also exploring how to create electricity from the salinity difference between rivers and oceans and the temperature difference between the sea surface and the colder waters below. One of the most promising marine energy technologies is the tidal turbine, which was advocated in Manchester by Peter Fraenkel of Marine Current Turbines (MCT). These devices act like underwater windmills, with blades that rotate as the tide flows through them. Tidal turbines create large amounts of power in those countries with very fast-flowing tidal streams – such as the UK and Canada – and in the future similar devices could be used to extract energy from deep ocean currents such as the Kuroshio in north-west Pacific. Compared to wind and solar energy, tidal generation has the advantage of predictability. Being driven by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun, as opposed to the weather, their timing and strength is known in advance to a high level of certainty. A further advantage is the high energy density of the tides. With as much as a thousand tonnes of water passing through a turbine's blades in a single second, a relatively small device can create a relatively large amount of electricity. Producing devices robust enough to withstand these forces is a formidable engineering challenge, but MCT's flagship device – the SeaGen – has already been proven to work on a commercial scale. Positioned in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland, the first SeaGen turbine has generated more than 100 megawatt hours of electricity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/aug/11/artificial-leaf-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-08-11T16:10:49Z","webTitle":"Scientists explore how the humble leaf could power the planet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/aug/11/artificial-leaf-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/aug/11/artificial-leaf-energy","fields":{"headline":"Scientists explore how the humble leaf could power the planet","bodyText":"It is one of evolution's crowning achievements - a mini green power station and organic factory combined and the source of almost all of the energy that fuels every living thing on the planet. Now scientists developing the next generation of clean power sources are working out how to copy, and ultimately improve upon, the humble leaf. The intricate chemistry involved in photosynthesis, the process where plants use sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugar, is the most effective solar energy conversion process on Earth. And researchers believe that mimicking parts of it could be the ticket to a limitless supply of clean power. The untapped potential for using the sun's rays is huge. All human activity for a whole year could be powered by the energy contained in the sunlight hitting the Earth in just one hour. Harnessing even a small amount of this to make electricity or useful fuels could satisfy the world's increasing need for energy, predicted to double by 2050, without further endangering the climate. Most solar power systems use silicon wafers to generate electricity directly. But although costs are coming down, these are still too expensive in many cases when compared with fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. Scientists are keen to develop more efficient and cheaper alternatives sources of energy. At Imperial College London, researchers have embarked on a £1m project to study, and eventually mimic, photosynthesis. Part of a project called the \"artificial leaf\", involves working out exactly how leaves use sunlight to make useful molecules. The team then plans to build artificial systems that can do the same to generate clean fuels such as hydrogen and methanol. These would then be used in fuel cells to make electricity or directly to power super-clean vehicles. Similar projects are gathering pace around the world: the US is poised to approve a federal research budget of around $35m a year for ideas that could create fuels from sunlight and the Dutch government has allocated €40m for similar research. According to James Barber, a biologist at Imperial College London and leader of the artificial leaf project, if artificial photosynthesis systems could use around 10% of the sunlight falling on them, they would only need to cover 0.16% of the Earth's surface to satisfy a global energy consumption rate of 20 terawatts, the amount it is predicted that the world will need in 2030. And unlike a biological leaf, the artificial equivalent could be placed in the arid desert areas of the world, where it would not compete for space agricultural land. Ultimately, Barber hopes to improve on nature's own solar cell. \"If the leaf can do it, we can do it but even better,\" he said. \"[But] it doesn't mean that you try to build exactly what the leaf has. Leonardo da Vinci tried to design flying machines with feathers that flapped up and down. But in the end we built 747s and Airbus 380s, completely different to a bird and, in fact, even better than a bird.\" Photosynthesis starts with a chemical reaction where sunlight is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere while the hydrogen is used to create sugars and other organic molecules for the plant. The aim of Barber's artificial leaf project is to find an efficient way of mimicking that water-splitting reaction to create a clean and limitless source hydrogen. Unlike normal leaves, the new devices would not suck CO2 out of the atmosphere. Hydrogen is a clean, energy-rich fuel that could be used in fuel cells to make electricity or else combined with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (or from the exhaust of fossil-fuel power stations) to make methanol, a fuel that could be dropped into vehicles without the need for any engine modifications. \"The challenge is to get hydrogen out of water using a ready supply of energy,\" said Barber. For domestic purposes, Dan Nocera, a chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has calculated that using artificial leaf to split a few litres of water a day into hydrogen and oxygen would be enough to supply all a home's energy needs. Scientists can already produce hydrogen by splitting water but current techniques are expensive, use harsh chemicals and need carefully controlled environments in which to operate. The critical part of the artificial leaf project is developing catalysts made from cheap materials that can be used to split water in everyday conditions. John Loughhead, executive director of the UK Energy Research Centre, described the artificial leaf idea as very promising because \"we know that plants have already evolved to do it and we know that, fundamentally, it's a workable process on a large scale.\" He added: \"Ultimately, the only sustainable form of energy we've got is the sun. From a strategic viewpoint, you have to think this looks really interesting because we know we're starting from a base of feasibility.\" Barber's colleagues at Imperial, led by chemist James Durrant, have recently developed a catalyst from rust that carried out part of the water-splitting reaction. So far the process is not very efficient, so Durrant's team is looking at improving this by engineering the surface of the rust. \"We're looking at adding small catalytic amounts of cobalt onto the surface of the iron oxide to make it more efficient.\" Nocera is also working on a catalyst made from cobalt and phosphorus that can split water at room temperature. Speaking last year, when he published his preliminary results in the journal Science, he said efficient water-splitting technology would be useful as a way of storing solar energy,which is a major problem for anyone who wants to use large amounts of solar power. During the day, an artificial leaf could use sunlight to split water and, at night, the stored hydrogen would be used to make electricity as it was needed. Chemical fuels such as hydrogen can store far more energy per unit mass than even the most advanced batteries. Both Durrant's and Nocera's catalysts are many years from becoming commercial products."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2009/jun/27/heating-system-contract","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2009-06-26T23:01:40Z","webTitle":"Heating system repair offer is a load of hot air","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/jun/27/heating-system-contract","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2009/jun/27/heating-system-contract","fields":{"headline":"Heating system repair offer is a load of hot air","bodyText":"The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday 17 October 2009 In the article below we said that a solar energy company, Hotbeams, asked prospective customers to pay £25 to register in case they needed its services in future.

Take solar: the economies of solar mean that putting a panel on one's roof is a huge upfront investment, only at the moment recoupable in about 40 years. No wonder solar, an energy source with limitless potential, has not yet realised its ambitions. Which is why I was really interested to learn about the $200m sale, the other day, of the startup solar company – SunEdison. SunEdison's business model tackled the problem of financing head-on. Instead of selling panels to companies such as Wal-Mart, Walgreens and Staples, it leased the panels to them – under 20-year contracts – and armed with blue chip lease agreements as sureties it was able to secure financing. The company had effectively created corporate green bonds for its clients and in the process cracked the solar financing conundrum, at least for its select group of \"tenants\". Applying the sales leaseback model, a model more commonly seen in real estate than solar energy is the kind of out-of-the-box thinking that is desperately needed if we are to solve the essential question of how the transition to a low-carbon economy will be funded. From solar to electric cars, from geothermal to reconfiguring the grid, the scale of investment needed in green technologies in order to meet whatever agreements on emissions reductions are finally agreed will be immense. Emissions trading, the saving of rainforests, the development of energy monitoring household devices – though of course part of the answer – will in no way deliver on their own the 80% drop from 1990 carbon emissions levels needed within the next 40 years if we are to avert an Armageddon scenario. And nor will our own commitment as individuals to fly less, turn our lights out more often or eat less meat or dairy, however good our individual intentions. Nothing short of a green industrial revolution will deliver what is actually needed, and at the moment there is no clear strategy and insufficient thinking on how we will fund that. The technology is there, but an ability to realise it at full scale is still absent. Bankers, financiers and finance professors need to set their minds to how to address this challenge. This means working out how to correctly assess risk. At present, financiers are overestimating the riskiness of clean tech, not only because of political uncertainty but also because of an information lag between technological advances and financial knowhow, a lag that is responsible for what now amounts to a structural barrier to growth. The long payback period we are typically talking about when it comes to renewables poses potential contractual problems as well as incentive issues, both of which need to be addressed and overcome. Governments too need to think radically about how they can best support the industrial transition, so that whatever they pledge at Copenhagen can actually be manifest. That means thinking of their roles not only as setters of the rules of the game – necessary for ensuring that the price of carbon grows predictably higher – but also as procurement agents, as bridge financiers, and as entities capable of changing the incentive profile for investing in renewables and green technologies. (China at the moment is head and shoulders above the rest of the world when it comes to all this. By using the engine of the state to finance clean energy it is leapfrogging over the rest of us.) Pledges to reduce emissions, whether made at Copenhagen or in the new year, can only be judged according to our ability to make good on them. Without industry, finance and government consciously and collaboratively ensuring that capital flows to where it is needed in order to ensure the scaling up of climate change solutions, whatever deal is agreed risks never being realised. Given how probable it is that such an outcome would result in nothing less than global catastrophe, it is imperative that as soon as these talks are over we shift focus from the realpolitik of global negotiators to the real world problem of how to ensure that we translate whatever their words are into meaningful and lasting outcomes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/214217","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-10T21:30:08Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: Vatican 'helped secure release' of British sailors captured by Iran","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/214217","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/214217","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: Vatican 'helped secure release' of British sailors captured by Iran","bodyText":"Friday, 26 June 2009, 16:37 C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 VATICAN 000078 SIPDIS FOR THE PRESIDENT FROM THE CHARGE D'AFFAIRES EO 12958 DECL: 6/26/2019 TAGS PREL, PGOV, VT SUBJECT: HOLY SEE: SCENESETTER FOR THE PRESIDENT'S JULY 10 VISIT REF: A. A) VATICAN 72 B. B) VATICAN 63 C. C) VATICAN 59 D. D) VATICAN 52 E. E) VATICAN 38 VATICAN 00000078 001.2 OF 005 CLASSIFIED BY: Julieta Valls Noyes, CDA, EXEC, State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) Mr. President, it's an honor to welcome you and your family to the Vatican, the world's smallest sovereign state, and one with global clout. Summary ------- 1. (C/NF) Holy See officials also are pleased you are visiting. Your meeting with Pope Benedict XVI will be an opportunity to discuss our shared commitments to overarching goals such as peace, justice, development, human dignity, and inter-faith understanding. From the Vatican's perspective, it will also provide a forum to discuss sensitive bioethical issues in a mutually respectful way. In your meeting with him, or possibly with other Vatican officials on the margins, you may cover other topics of special interest, such as the Middle East, Iraq, immigration, and the environment. Your discussions at the Holy See will help deepen our mutual collaboration on issues around the world. End Summary. Context for Your Visit ---------------------- 2. (C/NF) The Vatican is second only to the United States in the number of countries with which it enjoys diplomatic relations (188 and 177 respectively), and there are Catholic priests, nuns and lay people in every country on the planet. As a result, the Holy See is interested and well informed about developments all over the globe. This year marks the 25th anniversary of formal relations between the U.S. and Holy See. The Holy See is the global government of the Catholic Church, which it operates from Vatican City State, a sovereign territory of a quarter of a square mile. 3. (C/NF) The Holy See in many ways welcomed your election, as demonstrated by the Pope's immediate letter of congratulation. Vatican officials have been impressed by many of your initiatives, especially on foreign policy. The Vatican newspaper, the \"Osservatore Romano,\" has welcomed your positions on the Israeli-Palestinian situation, outreach to Muslims, disarmament, Cuba and the environment. The Holy See has appreciated your multilateralism and focus on human rights, including your decisions to run for the Human Rights Council and close the Guantanamo detainee facility. Nevertheless, although it does not generally express them publicly, the Vatican also has profound concerns about your Administration's positions on abortion and embryonic stem cell research. The Vatican has allowed the American Catholic Church to take the lead in enunciating these concerns. This is a tactical decision, and should not be interpreted as a divergence of views between Rome and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). The Vatican trusts the USCCB, is proud of the work that Catholic organizations do in the U.S., and relies on the generosity of American Catholics to support the Vatican and Catholic causes worldwide. On balance, the Vatican regards your Presidency favorably and will seek to focus more on the areas of policy convergence between us than on the issues that divide us. Pope Benedict XVI ----------------- 4. (C/NF) The Pope has had a rocky year, having confronted controversies about Catholic-Jewish relations and his views on AIDS prevention, and breakdowns in internal Vatican communications related to the controversies. At the same time, he also took crucial, successful trips to the Middle East and Africa. He is looking forward to meeting you. The Pope genuinely likes Americans and the United States, and enjoyed his visit there last year. He admires the U.S. model of secularism, where the church and state are separate but which he says \"allows for professing belief in God and respects the public role of religion and churches.\" The Pope has made promotion of international religious freedom a central objective of his papacy, and appreciates U.S. support for this goal. As the spiritual leader of 1.3 billion Catholics worldwide and enjoying VATICAN 00000078 002.2 OF 005 respect as well from non-Catholics, the Pope wields an unparalleled moral megaphone. He uses it carefully, speaking publicly in generic, neutral terms about the need for peace and social justice rather than criticizing individual states. Behind closed doors, he sometimes takes on specific issues more directly. In that context, a Vatican official had told us that the Pope probably will raise abortion, embryonic stem cell research, and social justice issues -- especially immigration -- with you. Bioethical Issues ----------------- 5. (C/NF) The Catholic Church teaches that abortion is wrong. Vatican officials grudgingly accept that abortion is legal in the U.S., but oppose making it more widely available. Internationally, the Vatican would forcefully oppose USG advocacy of legalizing abortion elsewhere, financing foreign abortions, or making abortion an international \"reproductive right.\" The Vatican would welcome an honest, respectful dialogue with the United States on abortion. Vatican officials followed your Notre Dame speech closely. While clearly not agreeing with everything you said, they were very pleased by your calls to reduce the number of women seeking abortions, make adoption more available, and provide support for pregnant women. They appreciated your commitment to \"honor the conscience of those who disagree with abortion,\" and especially welcomed the call for a sensible conscience clause for health care workers. 6. (C/NF) The Vatican opposes embryonic stem cell research on the grounds that it leads to the destruction of human embryos. It has no objection to non-embryonic stem cell research. As new techniques now allow research with adult stem cells, the Vatican says the use of embryonic stem cells is not justified scientifically either. Financial Crisis, the Poor, and Immigration ------------------------------------------- 7. (C/NF) The Vatican has been very vocal about protecting the world's most vulnerable people from harm caused by the global financial crisis. In a letter to UK PM Gordon Brown, for example, the Pope wrote, \"Development aid, including the commercial and financial conditions favorable to less developed countries and the cancellation of the external debt of the poorest and most indebted countries, has not been the cause of the crisis and out of fundamental justice must not be its victim.\" The Vatican criticizes \"consumerist\" societies, strongly supports the UN Millennium Development Goals, and hopes all countries will redouble efforts to meet their MDG pledges. The Vatican has long supported freer migration between nations to permit the poor to begin new lives. The USCCB has made immigration reform a priority in the U.S., and the Pope will likely mention this in his discussions with you. The Pope is expected to issue the second \"encyclical\" (letter addressed to the whole world about pressing moral issues) of his papacy sometime during the week before your meeting. It will cover social justice concerns, and the Pope will likely mention it to you. (Embassy will forward a copy to the White House as soon as it is available.) Food Security ------------- 8. (C/NF) Similarly, the Vatican is very worried about declining nutrition in the poorest countries. The Vatican has not taken a formal position on genetically modified (GM) crops -- some Church leaders oppose them because GM technology is mostly in the hands of multinational corporations, while others support their use as an element in a larger strategy to address world hunger. In his World Food Day message in October 2008, the Pope noted that the world can produce enough food to meet increasing needs, but said factors like speculation in foodstuffs, corrupt public officials, and growing investments in weapons prevented food from reaching the hungry. He called on world leaders to conclude negotiations to ensure food security, and to pursue relations \"based on the reciprocal exchange of knowledge, values, rapid assistance and respect.\" Environmental Issues VATICAN 00000078 003.2 OF 005 -------------------- 9. (C/NF) The Pope speaks frequently about the importance of caring for God's creation. Vatican City is the world's first carbon-neutral state, offsetting its emissions through use of renewable energy and a reforestation project. It has not, however, taken a position on carbon emissions trade. The Vatican is now using solar energy to power some facilities and is reducing its energy consumption overall, planning to be 20% energy self-sufficient by 2020. The Holy See is an active observer at the UN Environment Program, Food and Agriculture Organization and other international fora, and will participate in the December Copenhagen Conference also as an observer. The Pope has even joined with other religious leaders like Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to issue moral appeals to their faithful on humanity's responsibility to be good stewards of nature. The Vatican's environmental message is consistent: nature is a gift from God, so human beings have a responsibility to care for and not to abuse it. Arms Reduction -------------- 10. (C/NF) The Vatican welcomed your call to eliminate nuclear weapons, and has long advocated arms reductions and non-proliferation. The Holy See was one of the initial signatories to the Convention on Cluster Munitions in December 2008 - and ratified it the same day. (The Vatican of course has no such weapons itself and becomes party to such agreements to serve as a moral example.) The Pope has advocated the elimination of land mines, and the Holy See is a party to the Mine Ban Treaty. Speaking at the UN in May, the Vatican envoy reaffirmed the Vatican's support for nuclear non-proliferation and outlined five steps for nations to take to eliminate the nuclear weapons threat: adherence to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, opening negotiations for a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty, ending reliance on nuclear arms as part of military policy among nuclear states, giving the International Atomic Energy Association oversight over peaceful use of nuclear energy and expanding it role to include non-proliferation, and developing a new international agreement on nuclear fuel. Inter-faith Understanding ------------------------- 11. (C/NF) The Vatican praised your Cairo speech, especially the sections on religious freedom and diversity, the Israeli-Palestinian situation, and Iran. The Vatican itself has worked for decades on improving understanding with the Islamic world, including through a pontifical institute for the study of Arabic and Islam. It stepped up inter-faith discussions after the September 11 attacks, and then again following the negative Muslim reaction to a 2006 speech by the Pope that some argued demeaned Islam. Key dialogues are with: the \"group of 138\" - moderate Muslim scholars and clerics - supported by Jordan; Iranian clerics; Al-Azar University in Cairo, which co-hosted your speech; and Saudi authorities. The Vatican's primary objective for these talks is to promote religious freedom. The Holy See does not believe theological agreements with Islam are possible, but is convinced that better mutual knowledge will allay suspicions and facilitate peaceful co-existence, which they consider an even higher goal than simple \"tolerance.\" Another Vatican goal is supporting pragmatic inter-faith cooperation on social welfare programs. The Vatican believes governments should ensure religious freedom, but not be directly involved in interreligious dialogue (which by its nature should be between religious leaders). Middle East Peace Process ------------------------- 12. (C/NF) Peace in the \"Holy Land\" is one of the Vatican's top priorities, and was one of the central themes of the Pope's May visit to Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian territories. Despite criticism from some media and extremists, the trip was substantively successful. The Pope avoided any major mis-steps (always a difficult prospect for a Pontiff in visiting this area) and delivered the message that a two-state solution is the key to peace. He emphasized that the use of violence to achieve political objectives is morally unacceptable. He called for VATICAN 00000078 004.2 OF 005 inter-faith dialogue and protection of Christian minorities. His messages largely mirror the U.S. approach to the region. This provides opportunities for further engagement with the U.S. in advancing peace initiatives there. Iraq and Christians ------------------- 13. (C/NF) The Holy See publicly opposed U.S. intervention in Iraq. Once fighting began, however, the Vatican focus shifted to securing peace and justice, rebuilding the Iraqi economy, and protecting minority Christian communities. Holy See officials welcome your proposals for responsible withdrawal of U.S. troops, provided this does not create a security vacuum, particularly in Christian areas. The Vatican appreciates U.S. resettlement of the most vulnerable Iraqi victims of persecution -- including many Christians-- but seeks to avoid large-scale exodus of Christians from that country. (Regional bishops estimate as many as half of the region's 300-400,000 Chaldean Christians have left, and believe they will not return.) The Vatican was deeply concerned last fall that quotas set for Iraq's provincial elections system might reduce Christian representation in local governments, fueling further emigration. It took the unusual step of formally asking the USG to press the Iraqis to increase the quotas for Christians. Despite a boycott threat, Christians ultimately participated in the provincial elections. The future of the Christian communities in Iraq will remain high on the Vatican agenda before and after the U.S. military drawdown. Africa ------ 14. (C/NF) The Pope travelled to Africa in March. He grabbed headlines with an interview he gave en route saying that the use of condoms contributed to the spread of AIDS. The Vatican later clarified the Pope's comments, saying that condoms are not always 100% effective and noting studies that show condom distribution increases promiscuity. Benedict XVI has called on world leaders to pay special attention to the needs of the Continent - where one in four people suffer from chronic hunger -- this year. In a letter to the German President, Pope Benedict wrote that the \"support of the international community is needed...precisely because the current financial and economic crisis is particularly affecting Africa.\" The Pontiff has pledged the Church's continued assistance to the weakest sectors of Africa's population. (The UN estimates that Catholic charities provide 17% of health care in sub-Saharan Africa; the Church also runs schools, homes for the aged, re-integration centers for child soldiers and other programs there.) Bishops from Africa will gather in Rome in October for a month to discuss needs on the continent. Cuba ---- 15. (C/NF) The Church is the only major institution in Cuba that is independent from the government. The Vatican hopes for a transition to democracy in Cuba, but is not at the forefront of that battle because it is more concerned about protecting its small space for operations in Cuba. The Vatican opposes the U.S. embargo, which it believes hurts poor Cubans disproportionately. It welcomed your decision to remove limits on family visitation and remittances. Vatican officials believe that exchanging the five Cuban spies imprisoned in the U.S. for political prisoners in Cuba is worth discussing, and have urged the U.S. to grant visas to the wives of the spies to allow them to visit. Turkey EU Accession ------------------- 16. (C/NF) As Cardinal Ratzinger, the Pope had expressed uneasiness about the notion Turkish accession to the EU. The Holy See's position now is that as a non-EU member the Vatican has no role in promoting or vetoing Turkey's membership. The Vatican might prefer to see Turkey develop a special relationship short of membership with the EU, but Vatican Secretary of State (Prime Minister-equivalent) Bertone has stated that Turkey should become a member if it meets all the EU VATICAN 00000078 005.2 OF 005 criteria - including full protection of human rights and religious freedoms. Iran ---- 17. (C/NF) The Holy See is deeply concerned about the recent violence and ongoing human rights violations in Iran. It has been publicly silent to date on the current crisis, in part to preserve its ability to act as an intermediary if an international crisis emerges. (The Vatican helped secure the release of British sailors detained in Iranian waters in April 2007.) It is unclear how much clout the Vatican really has with Iran, however.

But the campaigning organisation he now heads, 350.org, is deliberately organised in such a way that most people campaign and organise as close to home as they can, using computers and telephones to talk to each other. When I suggest there are some things that can't be done so easily or so well electronically (a newspaper interview arguably being one of them), he laughs: \"Well, we'd better start figuring out what we can do.\" By not flying 6,500 miles to Vermont and back to meet him, I have ducked responsibility for 1.5 tonnes of CO2. Twenty-one years ago Bill McKibben wrote one of the first books about climate change. The End of Nature set out in detail the facts, as they then were, about the rapidly increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and passionately entreated its readers to pay attention. \"It is astonishing if you think about it that we knew 30 years ago what we needed to do, and we had much of the technology to do it,\" he says. \"And we just walked away from it. On the list of bad mistakes human beings have made, that's right up there.\" Not everyone made the same mistake. With a half-smothered chuckle, he describes how, on a visit to the headquarters of the Chinese solar energy giant Himin Solar earlier this year, he was shown one of the solar panels that Jimmy Carter installed on the White House roof in 1979, and which Ronald Reagan removed soon afterwards. A few weeks ago McKibben drove to Washington DC in a biodiesel-powered van with another of Carter's solar panels, salvaged from its retirement on the roof of a college cafeteria in Maine, to lobby President Obama to bring solar power back to the White House. \"They weren't all that keen to see us really. I think they were worried that these solar panels were somehow associated with Jimmy Carter, that they would catch some sort of electoral disease from touching them,\" he says. \"But we kept saying 'no, don't worry, even people who don't know about global warming really like solar panels!' And they called us up three days before this big global work party [the 10/10/10 climate demonstrations], and said 'OK, we're putting them on in the spring'.\" For the first 25 years of his career, McKibben was a writer. The son of journalists, and president while at university of the Harvard Crimson newspaper, he carved out a niche as a classy environmental reporter, publishing a book every few years. The Age of Missing Information contrasted the knowledge gleaned from cable TV over 24 hours with a day spent on a mountain. Maybe One tackled the controversial subject of human population – McKibben and his wife, the writer Sue Halpern, have one 17-year-old daughter, Sophie, who is founder-editor of a children's magazine. He wrote about hiking, skiing and genetic engineering, and an anti-consumerist essay about how to spend less than $100 on Christmas. Full of clearly presented information, McKibben's books were also filled with description and feeling. He left New York, where his first job was writing for the New Yorker's Talk of the Town column, and moved first to the Adirondack mountains in upstate New York, and then to Vermont. He became a nature writer, devoted to finding meaning in landscape: \"On the mountain, of course, death surrounds you always. Dead trees, the insects and the birds excavating their guts; dead leaves under your feet beginning to disintegrate with a year of rain and snow; dead bones in the woods.\" He looked back at the work of earlier explorers, marvelled at the joy of the American outdoors, \"not the dark and forbidding wilderness of European fairytales but a blooming, humming, fertile paradise\". The British academic and author Robert Macfarlane recalls the impact of The End of Nature's \"astonishing central idea, that the entire globe is post-natural, whether that be a sunset or the Arctic, everything bears our traces. Encountering that idea for the first time was incredibly powerful.\" Environmental activism was always something that interested McKibben: his first book included a discussion of the radical ideas and direct action campaigns of Earth First! and other conservationists in the western US. But he was a writer: he and Halpern built their home on land once owned by the poet Robert Frost, whose own summer cabin is nearby, \"so there's some good writing karma, and lots of trees\". \"I think my assumption when I was 27 was that explaining rationally all the trouble we're in would be sufficient, and that politicians and whoever would act. I'm older now and I think I've come to understand a little more clearly that we're going to need to build some power if we're going to mount a serious challenge,\" he says. So in 1997, as well as publishing two books, McKibben launched Step It Up, with the help of students at Middlebury College where he is scholar in residence, and organised rallies urging Congress to cut carbon emissions. Step It Up morphed into 350.org, named to fix in people's minds the 350 parts of CO2 per million in the atmosphere that scientists believe is safe. Currently there are 388ppm, and some previous forecasts suggested 450ppm might be OK. But in 2007 the Nasa climate scientist James Hansen revised this figure down to 350, and 350.org set about trying to persuade the world to believe him. It is this work that currently takes up most of McKibben's time. Now he is off to Cancún in Mexico for the current round of UN climate talks, though he is not expecting a breakthrough. Reviewing McKibben's latest book Eaarth: Making a Life on a Tough New Planet (out this year but yet to find a publisher in the UK), the climate economist Nicholas Stern argued that it was too pessimistic, that science and technology offer more solutions to these man-made problems than McKibben and his ilk will allow and that we must, above all for the sake of the developing world, hold on to the possibility of a new form of economic growth that does not rely on carbon. McKibben says he has \"stopped trying to figure out whether I'm optimistic or pessimistic – I get up in the morning and do my work as hard as I can\". Tim Flannery calls him \"the most effective environmental activist of our age\", and Mark Lynas, who last month on Channel 4 attacked environmentalists for being too negative about nuclear energy and genetic engineering, describes himself as a \"huge fan\". McKibben had a happy childhood in suburban Massachusetts, with his parents and a younger brother who is now a primary school teacher. His father's roots were in the mountainous Pacific north-west, and the family spent \"treasured times\" holidaying each year in a rustic cabin without electricity on Mount Rainier. \"Many environmentalists had some sort of experience in the outdoors when they were young, and the most important thing about it is the feeling of being small in relation to the large, beautiful world around you – it's the opposite message from the consumer society which tells you constantly that you're very big and very important.\" He laughs. \"It's a more consoling idea to be a small part of something very large.\" But it was not until his 20s, when he wrote an article about where everything in his apartment came from – \"olives, gas lines, water lines\" – and began reading the Kentucky farmer-essayist Wendell Berry, followed by the first scientific reports on climate change, that he became interested in environmental politics. He recalls the day his father, a reporter who prided himself on his objectivity, was arrested. The family lived in Lexington, where the battle for American independence had begun, \"and because it was such a symbolic, historic place, the Vietnam Veterans Against the War wanted to camp out on Lexington Green. The police told them they couldn't and so hundreds of townspeople joined them and were arrested, and my father was among them. It wasn't a huge deal in some ways, but I've never forgotten it, this reminder that there are times when you need to act outside your comfort zone to make things happen.\" These days McKibben is outside his comfort zone most of the time. \"Writers,\" he says, \"almost by definition are people who aren't so good at communicating in other ways. What I would like to do is spend my time in this small study, writing.\" Instead, he spends most of his life travelling, although Eaarth looks forward to a time when this will no longer be necessary. If and when we finally get the message that we must stop jetting about and instead settle down in one place, get to know our neighbours and grow more of our own food, McKibben suggests the internet will save us from parochialism, insularity and boredom. Does he get depressed about climate change, thinking about these terrifying scenarios in which much of the earth becomes virtually uninhabitable in just a couple of decades, when he is reaching retirement age and his only daughter will be in her 30s? In the past he has admitted wondering where he could store a year's supply of food, or whether he should buy a gun. \"I do my best to avoid . . .\" he says, tailing off into silence. \"Look, I have one advantage,\" he picks up. \"I've been thinking about this stuff for 21 years now, so in a sense I got a lot of my angst out of the way early on, and like anything else if you work with something long enough, at some level you come to deal with it. When I wrote The End of Nature, before I was an activist of any kind, that was a very dark moment . . . But when I get discouraged, I have one good resource I can turn to, which is the Flickr account for 350.org. We have about 30,000 photographs now from these rallies around the world, and simply going and seeing how many people are deeply engaged in this fight and how creatively, that always cheers me up.\" Some of his earlier work was deeply personal, as when he wrote of the decision not to have more children and about his father's last illness, but in Eaarth McKibben announces his determination to be \"relentlessly practical\". Where previous books bubbled over with revulsion at the prospect of a world made over in man's image by genetic engineering, today McKibben is determined to keep the focus on carbon. He believes a huge investment in renewable energy is the only way out of our predicament: he is convinced nuclear energy is too expensive. \"We're losing at the moment in this climate fight. The reason we're losing is that by and large we've failed to build a movement, and it's going to take a movement to counter the raw power of the fossil fuel industry. At least in America the fact that it's the most profitable industry we have has been enough to give it outsize political influence. They're winning and winning easily.\" Since Obama's climate legislation failed to get through a Democrat-controlled Congress, the election of a few climate change-denying Tea Party candidates last month does not feel like the end of the world. \"We're in trouble, it's going to be a difficult century,\" McKibben says. \"The question is whether it's going to be an impossible one. In 25 years we'll know whether we took the steps to keep things from getting absolutely out of control.\" How quickly the ice will melt remains the great unknown, but McKibben believes flooding caused by changes in hydrological cycles is the most immediate danger. But if the literary and philosophical investigations of McKibben's previous self have to some extent been left behind with his reincarnation as a political organiser, the imaginative aspect of climate change still preoccupies him. From the outset he perceived that part of the difficulty with global warming is that human beings, brought up with the idea that the planet is billions of years old, do not really accept that it can be quickly and easily spoiled. His first book began with a discussion of time, and argued that the mounting evidence that humans had altered the weather was of profound existential significance. His most recent project, a collaboration with artists and activists around the world, tried to reflect something of this alienation from reality: in the run-up to the Cancún talks, thousands of people gathered in locations around the world and formed themselves into designs – an elephant in India, a bird in LA, King Canute on Brighton beach, overseen by Radiohead's Thom Yorke – and were photographed from above. As well as reaching out to the artistic community, which he feels has not been sufficiently engaged by environmentalism, he hopes these \"beautiful and fun\" images will help us to see the world differently, \"to remind ourselves of where we are, of how gradual and delicate and beautiful this all is\". When he is not travelling around the world and networking via social media – he says most of 350.org's work would not have been possible even a few years ago, so much do they rely on new technology – McKibben is a Methodist Sunday school teacher. He met his wife, whom he married in 1988, while running a homeless shelter in the basement of his church in New York, and he wrote a book about the environmental message of the Book of Job. He sees faith communities around the world as essential allies in this new \"crusade\", and while to secular people his way of thinking about the stewardship of God's creation may seem quaint, his deep sense of responsibility lends an urgency that is, if you accept the basic facts of global warming, hard to resist. The fight against climate change is \"as morally compulsory as the battles for civil rights or against totalitarianism\", he wrote in a recent edition of The End of Nature. The book goes on to quote one of Martin Luther King's favourite hymns: \"Once to Every Man and Nation, comes the moment to decide, / In the strife of truth with falsehood, for the good or evil side. / Some great cause, God's new messiah, offering each the bloom or blight, / And the choice goes by forever, 'twixt the darkness and the light.\" • This is a preview from tomorrow's Guardian Review.

It's an argument that off-gridders and anti-capitalist campaigners will be familiar with. It's not really what you expect to hear from an adviser to the government. Yet that is the belief of MP Alan Simpson, who occupies a place close to the heart of political power in Britain as energy adviser to the minister at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, Ed Miliband. Simpson made his eye-opening claims at an event organised this week by UK solar company Solar Century to lobby for an increase in the proposed \"feed-in tariff\" – the amount paid for electricity sold to the grid by households generating green energy through solar panels or wind turbines. Next April, the government plans to introduce feed-in tariffs of 5p per unit (kilowatt-hour), plus a subsidy of 36.5p per unit generated off-grid in small solar and wind-powered installations. Simpson argued that these levels provide only a 5%-7% return on investment in solar panels, which is not high enough to kick-start the UK solar energy industry. He called for the feed-in tariff to be set at a minimum of 10p, which would provide closer to a 10% return. He also said we don't need to look to the Middle East to see the link between energy and politics, because it's here in our own back yards. Calling for a decentralised power generation system in which individual homes and local areas generate much of the UK's power, he said: Current energy policy in the UK is dominated by the vested interests of \"Big Power\" [the six utility companies that dominate UK electricity generation]. The national grid is monumentally inefficient as an energy system. It was a half-decent idea for the middle of the last century, but 70%-80% of energy put into the grid disappears before you or I even switch the light on. We need not an energy, but a power revolution that takes control from the centre and literally puts power back into the hands of the people. The UK generated just 6 megawatt peak (MWp) from solar sources last year, compared to Germany's 1,500 MWp and Spain's 2,511 MWp. The reasons for the UK's poor performance, Simpson declared, relate to civil servants' desire to retain central control, allied with the commercial interests of \"Big Power\". He said civil servants have been trying to water down feed-in tariffs designed to boost the deployment of renewable energy in the UK. He accused them of \"delaying\" and \"frustrating\" their introduction. The feed-in tariffs will be available for installations of up to 5Mw, but Simpson revealed that initially the big power companies wanted the tariff to be available only for systems that generated less than 50kw. Cynics say the reason Simpson can be so outspoken is that as a Labour MP he expects to be voted out of power within a few months. However, the record shows that he has consistently criticised government energy policy. He is certainly one of very few British MPs to put his money where his principles are. Four years ago, he spent £100,000 on a derelict building in Nottingham's Lace Market area, and another £200,000 to make it into an eco-home for him and his wife, the novelist Pascale Quiviger. He refurbished the south-facing roof with solar panels that now provide his home with around 75% of its power. Inside is a micro-combined heat and power (CHP) generator, producing electricity at the same time as it heats the house. The internals walls are made from compressed recycled straw and insulated with recycled cardboard tubes. Simpson's politics provide a glimpse of the sort of progressive thinking the Labour party could have adopted when it abandoned its traditional socialist approach for Tony Blair's New Labour in the early 1990s. \"I'm a leftover hippy from the 60s,\" he told the assembled people in suits. \"Here we have an opportunity to influence huge change.\" Let's grasp it. • Alex Benady is acting editor of Off-Grid.net"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/jun/11/prince-charles-ashden-awards","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-06-11T18:00:01Z","webTitle":"Prince Charles presents Ashden Awards for innovative environmental projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jun/11/prince-charles-ashden-awards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/jun/11/prince-charles-ashden-awards","fields":{"headline":"Prince Charles presents Ashden Awards for innovative environmental projects","bodyText":"A network of 28 demonstration green \"superhomes\" and a low-tech greenhouse for growing vegetables in a remote Himalayan region were today presented awards by Prince Charles in an environment competition. Other winners in the prestigious Ashden Awards for sustainable energy included a solar electricity project in Ethiopia, an innovative Ugandan scheme selling biomass briquettes to prevent deforestation, and a Surrey school that halved its electricity consumption. The organisers of the awards estimated the 15 prize-winners, who were recognised for UK and international renewable energy and efficiency projects, have globally saved thousands of tonnes of carbon emisisons. Business, schools and charities were among the winners sharing a total prize money pot of £320,000. Coventry-based Geothermal International won a business award for its work on ground source heat pumps, which extract low carbon heating from pipes buried underground. Kirklees Council in West Yorkshire landed a local authority award for offering free insulation to all households in the region. In the international categories, a Nicaraguan company won the energy enterprise award for installing more than 400 kilowatt peak (kWp) of solar photovoltaic energy, often in rural areas without a national grid connection. A US-Chinese collaboration to create cheap and efficient wood stoves won the energy champion award. International development minister Gareth Thomas said: \"Projects like these bring real benefits to local communities and clearly demonstrate how clean, renewable energy can help grow local economies, improve people's health and reduce poverty – as well as contributing towards the fight against climate change.\" Sarah Butler-Sloss, founder and chair of the Ashden Awards, added: \"Our winners are showing that it is not only possible to continue implementing sustainable energy measures in a tough economic climate – it actually makes financial as well as environmental sense.\" Prince Charles, who is currently backing an environmental film and book project called Harmony, as well as campaigns to protect rainforests from deforestation, presented the awards. Previous Ashden Award guests have included former US vice-president Al Gore, IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri and naturalist Sir David Attenborough, who last week won a lifetime achievement prize in the Observer Ethical Awards. The full list of 2009 winners: Business Awards First Prize: Geothermal International – bringing sustainable heating and cooling into the commercial mainstream Second prize: Architype – designing energy- and carbon-saving buildings Charity Awards First Prize: The Sustainable Energy Academy – giving high profile to the enormous carbon savings that can be made from existing buildings and inspiring others to follow Second Prize: Marches Energy Agency – motivating communities to adopt low-carbon lifestyles Local Authority Awards Joint First Prize: Kirklees Council – insulation scheme blankets borough and creates jobs at no cost to homeowners Joint First Prize: Devon County Council – wind of change harnessed for green gain Schools Awards Joint First Prize: Ashley CofE Primary School – primary school energy plan inspired by penguins in a pickle Joint First Prize: Currie Community High School – young people take giant strides to reduce energy use The Ashden International Award for Avoided Deforestation Uganda: Kampala Jellitone Suppliers Ltd - for producing non-char biomass briquettes made from agricultural waste. 130 tonnes of briquettes sold every month reduce deforestation and save about 6.1 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of briquettes used.

A man in a nondescript dark suit standing at a podium in one of the smaller meeting rooms on the 13th floor of the National Press Club. But then suddenly it wasn't. \"There is only one way to do business and that is to pass a climate bill quickly so this December President Obama can go to Copenhagen and negotiate with a strong position,\" said the speaker – who said he represented the US Chamber of Commerce. The statement represented a complete repudiation of the Chamber's earlier opposition to climate change legislation. The hard line had triggered walk-outs from Apple and a handful of other high-profile companies in the past few weeks. The companies are trying to press the business organisation to support the bill by the senators John Kerry and Barbara Boxer that is to be debated by the Senate next week. Or maybe not. Barely 20 minutes into the Q&amp;A section of the press conference, an agitated spokesman for the Chamber burst into the room, screaming that the event was a hoax. Score one for the Yes Men, who claimed responsibility for the prank. A number of news organisations and environmental groups were taken in. Several green organisations tweeted or blogged on the about-face. Reuters news agency put out a straight news story about the Chamber's apparent U-turn, and the Washington Post and New York Times put the story on their news sites (both later removed the stories from their websites). CNBC actually sought – and got – comment from analysts. It also broke its programming to have a reporter read out the fake press release. The spoof got under way with a press release inviting journalists to a morning news conference. Most reporters overlooked the misspelling of the Chamber president's name. The phony spokesman said the Chamber was not happy with the bill before the Senate and would push for a carbon tax – not the greenest of positions. But he added: \"If cap and trade is all we can get we have to take it so at least we can have something to put in President Obama's hands when he goes to Copenhagen.\" He went out even further on a limb when he called clean coal \"a hoax\", saying the money would be better spent on solar energy research. \"Clean technology has not only not been proven. It basically doesn't exist,\" he said. It was about that time, the real Chamber spokesman burst into the room – and had a mild shoving match at the podium. \"What happened today was a fraud and I believe illegal,\" Eric Wohlschlegel said. The spokesman said he learned of the hoax when a reporter came to the Chamber office looking for the press conference. Wohlschlegel said he immediately leaped into a taxi. The spoof appears to be a joint production of the Yes Men, a group of activists who get their point across by impersonating greedy executives. Last month, the Yes Men took on global warming, producing fake copies of the New York Post with a banner headline declaring: \"We're screwed\". Two other activist groups also claimed credit. In a statement today, the Yes Men said the stunt was intended to show how climate policy was being held hostage to corporate greed. \"The Chamber's position against climate legislation is completely troglodytic,\" said Andy Bichlbaum, who impersonated the Chamber spokesman. \"The rest of the world sees the need for urgent action on the climate. The rest of the world's rich countries have pledged large emissions reductions. With scientists saying if we don't reduce carbon emissions, then sooner or later we're doomed, the Chamber represents corporate America at its most backwards.\" The statement went on to flag up a Yes Men rally tomorrow morning and the release of their new documentary later this week. And while a number of reporters still pressed Wohlschlegel for signs of a shift in the Chamber's position, he soon set them straight. The Chamber was as opposed to climate change legislation as ever."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2009/sep/05/climate-change-fund1","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-04T23:08:14Z","webTitle":"How to invest in tackling climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/sep/05/climate-change-fund1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2009/sep/05/climate-change-fund1","fields":{"headline":"How to invest in tackling climate change","bodyText":"Isas and investment trusts All the funds below tend to have minimum lump sum investments of around £1,000, but check with each provider for details.

I really want to have PV [photovoltaic] panels; it's so frustrating that it is so difficult. We have had solar water heating panels on a south-facing roof since September 2002, bought from, and installed by, Smart Energy. We live in a road with no gas, and we inherited oil-fired central heating and hot water. I am chasing our council (Conwy) and the Welsh Assembly over their policy. It is so annoying to see \"executive-style\" four-bedroom houses being built just down the road with perfect south-facing roofs and no solar water heating installed. It's so much cheaper than adding it later, and of much more benefit to families who use lots of hot water, their bills and the planet. Kate Gibbs, via email We have a solar thermal panel but have decided that PV is too expensive, and a wind turbine - after measuring wind over three months on my roof with an anemometer - too ineffective. However, I have consoled myself by getting 100% renewable electricity from Good Energy. Richard Hudson, Bristol Ashley Seager must have managed to get the same grant scheme as I did: 50% about three years ago. My costs were much the same: £18,000 installation with a 50% grant. My system was built into the roof using solar slates/shingles but doesn't seem to have the generating capacity of his. I've also fitted solar thermal - yes, £3,500 is spot-on, and it's good to see prices quoted as it undermines the cowboys. Mine was £4,000 for six square meters plus an oversized water tank, less £400 grant. What you don't mention is the risk that your house might be revalued up a council tax band. In our case it would be financially better to rip out all our solar panels! Next, is wind turbines. We are on the top of the North Downs. We know we have wind, as most of the trees grow sideways! Also lots of insulation and an overall target of being carbon neutral - our house was built in 1780. Thankfully, it is not listed! Simon Mallett, via email Very impressive performance! But I'll not be considering it until they bring the grants back! Tim Collyer, Guildford We have a Victorian house on which we installed solar hot water panels, plus all-round insulation and wall radiant heating (large surface, low water temperature). We reduced our CO2 emissions for heating by 72% (while increasing the living space by a third). Sigrid Stagl, Brighton Do the estimates of carbon production efficiency take into account the amount of carbon that is released into the atmosphere in order to create one of those solar panels? I am a big fan of green technology, but I am also a pragmatist. A friend, who is now a mechanical engineer, has lectured me time and time again about the carbon cost involved in production. For example, if I buy a hybrid car, instead of a regular car, and that reduces my output by 100 units of carbon a year for the 10 years I use it, that's 1,000 units saved. If, however, the extra carbon cost of building the hybrid, instead of the regular car, is 1,200 units, I'm actually running at a net carbon increase. (I realise this is almost certainly not true with hybrid cars, it was just to demonstrate the point.) After reading about all the new appliances, installations and equipment Mr Seager put into making the solar-sufficient house work, I have to wonder what the net effect will be for the environment. But I applaud the effort he is making. If more people cared about these issues as much as he does, the world would be a better place. Michael Peirce, via email Mr Seager talks about people being \"fixated\" with the payback time for his solar \"investment\". From the figures he provided, it will be around 17 years before he sees any return on his initial investment. Contrast that with investing his initial £8,500 at 4% interest per annum - in 17 years, this would be £16,557. The house will only attract a higher sale value if prospective buyers value this feature. I'm sorry, but for me, solar power just doesn't add up. Darran Clarke, via email While the figures quoted may prove beneficial to him, I am left wondering whether this might be at the expense of the rest of us? He gets paid 12p per kilowatt hour for the electricity he exports to his power company, but my supplier is now charging me 7.27p per kWh, including VAT. How can it afford to pay 12p, unless I, and other users, are subsidising Mr Seager's electricity generation? Then I read that there was a grant of £8,500 towards the 3kW system. That works out at £2,833 per kW generating capacity. Furthermore, the 3kW is a peak value, and the actual amount generated over the year averages 10.4% of this, so the capital contribution from us taxpayers is £27,240 per available kW. Now I am reliably informed that the cost of electricity generation, taking running and capital costs into account, is in the region of 3.6p per kWh (for gas-fuelled power stations) to 6.8p per kWh (for offshore wind farms). Since power-generation in bulk would seem to be much more cost-effective than a DIY approach, perhaps we should be forming cooperatives and building local shared power generating facilities? Graham Oliver, Woodbridge, Suffolk Law of diminishing returns ... An annoying \"side-effect\" of being overcharged by shops (Your shout, April 5 and 19) is that when you come to reclaim your rightful refund they generally require you to supply your address and sign a receipt. I strongly object to having to give the company my personal information as a result of their mistake, and have taken to giving a fictitious address and signing for my money as \"An Unhappy Customer\"! David Adams, Derby I live on the Quantocks and the nearest shop is the Co-op four miles away. They never give a receipt unless you ask for it, which I always do as I have been overcharged many times but never undercharged. There is usually one long queue snaking back through the shop while I stand and check my bill. On finding a mistake, the assistant rolls her eyes, the rest of the queue gives an audible sigh, and I have to fill in a form giving my name and address before they will rectify their mistake! This drives me crazy. I tried complaining to head office by letter but was ignored. So now I continue to check all receipts. Surely we should all be given one without having to ask? During a visit to Wilkinson's in Taunton I was overcharged on a bottle of cleaning fluid priced at £1.99. I took a deep breath and quietly pointed this out, the assistant was very apologetic, called over the supervisor who voided the mistake instantly, and insisted I only pay 10p for that item to make up for their error. I stood there with my mouth open like a guppy in shock at such splendid service. I don't know who owns Wilkinson, but it has certainly got its act together, and I am now a devoted fan. Jacqueline Penny, Somerset How we could insure a better deal I always enjoy reading your articles; as an intelligent, but a not very savvy, consumer, I have learned a lot. Following your article about Royal Bank of Scotland's climbdown over their refusal to cover passengers involved in the Terminal 5 debacle, I have long wondered why I should be the one to take out insurance against losses caused by the \"mistakes\" of airlines? Surely one benefit of insurance is that it encourages good behaviour. (I drive more carefully, install a fire alarm, have regular health checks etc, to make sure I keep premiums down.) So if airlines had to pay me directly for any losses they cause me, and they paid insurance premiums to cover those losses, they would be more likely to try to avoid the losses in the first place. Which would suit me, the customer. And it would raise the brand of the airlines, so we would all win. Currently no one does. Is the airline industry the only one where the customer takes all the responsibility, but has no control over the risk?

Luxury, history and romance on the Zambezi","bodyText":"Some places stand like chapter headings in one's life story. The days rush by like a torrent of words, but every now and then comes an island that redefines the journey. For me, in Africa, there will always be Sindabezi Island in Zambia, a place I'm likely to remember on my deathbed. It wasn't because, when I got there with my girlfriend we were shown to an open-fronted thatched cottage on the edge of the Zambezi river. No wall, no window, just a muslin drape between us and crocodiles and hippos below if we wanted it. We didn't. Nor was it because of the dawn light of sunrise flooding the cottage and animating all of life. Birds twittered, insects hummed and hippos snortled in a nasal baritone in the hot and humid air. One small bird flew into our roofless bathroom and danced on the mirror frame. Nor, indeed, was it the sense of ostentatious luxury although, well, it didn't do any harm. A personal valet ran us a hot bubble bath in the glow of hurricane lamps and starlight. We drank wine, sand under foot, around an open fire, and ate a three-course dinner listening to the music of the bush at night. There are just five cottages on Sindabezi Island, a bush camp that has won accolades as one of the best remote places to stay in the world. There's no electricity but the lights are powered by solar energy. The sense of seclusion is absolute; this is nature's territory, not ours, as if all of human history never happened. I wouldn't have been surprised to see a dinosaur bigfooting past. All this I will remember, and the getting there too. We were taken on a motorboat from Tongabezi Lodge, which runs the island and has holiday chalets of its own overlooking the upper Zambezi. We skimmed over the surface of the river, some parts of it as smooth as glass, others ebbing and flowing like rapids. We came to a stop at an island even smaller than Sindabezi. \"This is no man's land,\" said a valet as he prepared a picnic lunch. Before us was the shoreline of Zimbabwe, the reeds and grassbanks almost within touching distance. Above us, masked weaver birds with yellow mantles hung upside down in a tree, singing as they built nests high in its branches to escape future floods. At sunset, the sky became a vast canvas of crimson, orange and pink that glinted off the waters. Our boat pilot stopped the engine and allowed us to drift in the magnificent tranquillity. We then sped up river and could glimpse the ears of hippos peeping above the water. Sometimes, their eyes too, and occasionally an entire head thrown back to give a mighty yawn. At one point an entire group wallowed in the shallows, prompting me to look up the collective noun: apparently it's a bloat. Next day, we headed to the Mosi Oa Tunya national park, where a lone zebra watched us from under a tree. Giraffes, gnus, impalas, monkeys and warthogs basked in the sunlight, impervious to our stares. A baboon sat with its back against a tree, looking irresistibly like a human on a lazy Sunday afternoon. We moved on to Victoria Falls, where the cascade over the jagged rockface has never been better described than by British explorer and missionary David Livingstone in 1855. \"The whole scene was extremely beautiful; the banks and islands dotted over the river are adorned with sylvan vegetation of great variety of colour and form,\" he wrote. \"No one can imagine the beauty of the view from any thing witnessed in England. European eyes had never seen it before; but angels in their flight must have gazed upon scenes so lovely.\" It was, he said, \"the most wonderful sight I had witnessed in Africa\". His story is told in the nearby Livingstone Museum in the town that bears his name. It's one of those quaint museums that nevertheless has some real treasures, including dozens of Livingstone's handwritten letters carefully preserved in sliding glass drawers. Objects on display include his medicine box, pen knife and umbrella, and some wood carved from the tree beneath which Welsh-born New York Herald journalist Henry Morton Stanley asked him, \"Dr Livingstone, I presume?\" We're told that Livingstone started work in a Glasgow cotton mill at the age of 10. He spoke out against the slave trade, but on one particularly torrid expedition was forced to turn to Arab slave traders to stay alive. There's an illuminating gallery on Zambian history and another on indigenous cultures. Traditional examples of Don'ts during pregnancy include: Do not peep, Do not finish food on the plate, Do not stand with arms akimbo, Do not walk backwards, Do not tie knots and Do not shed tears anyhow. We went back to Tongabezi Lodge, which was about to celebrate its 20th anniversary. It was set up by two Britons, Ben Parker and the late Will Ruck-Keene, as the first river lodge on the Zambian side of the Falls. Among the birthday party guests, we were told, was Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's founding president. Yes, I can still see it all, but when the fog of memory closes in there's only one place likely to linger. Sindabezi Island, \"full of noises, sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight\". It was there, under a three-quarter moon and the Belt of Orion, by the still waters of the Zambezi, that I sank to one knee and asked my girlfriend to be my wife."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/aug/13/us-marines-afghanistan-fuel-efficiency","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-08-13T17:07:31Z","webTitle":"US marines in Afghanistan launch first energy efficiency audit in war zone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/aug/13/us-marines-afghanistan-fuel-efficiency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/aug/13/us-marines-afghanistan-fuel-efficiency","fields":{"headline":"US marines in Afghanistan launch first energy efficiency audit in war zone","bodyText":"The US Marines Corps ordered the first ever energy audit in a war zone todayto try to reduce the enormous fuel costs of keeping troops on the ground in Afghanistan. General James T Conway, the Marines Corps Commandant, said he wanted a team of energy experts in place in Afghanistan by the end of the month to find ways to cut back on the fuel bills for the 10,000 strong marine contingent. US marines in Afghanistan run through some 800,000 gallons of fuel a day. That's a higher burn rate than during an initial invasion, and reflects the logistical challenges of running counter-insurgency and other operations in the extreme weather conditions of Afghanistan. \"We need to understand where the fuel goes,\" Conway told a Marines Corps energy summit today. \"The largest growing demand on the battlefield today is for electricity and how we create that.\" He added: \"We are going to more efficient. We have got to be.\" Conway's announcement — and the summit itself, which is the first of its kind — were seen yesterday as a dramatic shift in the US military's approach to energy consumption and climate change. The Pentagon began to acknowledge America's reliance on fossil fuels and climate change as a national security concern in 2002. A report from the Pentagon's military advisory board last May called on military bases to work to lower their carbon footprint. A number of bases inside the US have begun to tap into renewable fuel sources including wind and solar energy. But the Marine Corps are the first service to try to put those policies into action on the battlefield. Conway, who led the marine invasion of Iraq in 2003, said he was motivated by the high costs — as well as the risks to troops – of getting oil and water to combat zones. For land-locked Afghanistan, the nearest port at Karachi in Pakistan is more than 400 miles away from marine bases, and maintaining those long supply lines has become an increasingly dangerous proposition. Some 80% of US military casualties in Afghanistan are due to improvised explosive devices (IEDS), and many of those placed in the path of supply convoys. The costs of shipping water and fuel to the troops is also becoming unsustainable. The price of a gallon of petrol in a war zone can cost up to $100. \"It is a shocking figure to compute what it costs by the time you pour that gallon of gas into a Humvee or an aircraft in the place you are operating,\" Conway said. He said he was looking to his energy auditors to find ways of cutting back energy consumption at operating bases, and also to pare down the equipment carried by each individual marine. An average marine carries about 9lbs of disposable batteries in their kit to power equipment such as night vision goggles and radios. One immediate target of the auditors is likely to be climate control. Some 448,000 gallons alone are used to keep tents cool in the Afghan summer, where temperatures reach well over 40C, and warm in the winter, said Michael Boyd, an energy adviser to the Marine Corps. The marines have been exploring ways to reduce that consumption by spraying tents with a foam coating. \"That's a huge saving and you are no longer putting trucks on those roads, and tanker drivers in harm's way and everyone else involved on the way,\" Boyd said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2010/jan/05/quietest-building-chemists-physicists-engineers","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-05T00:05:01Z","webTitle":"Delicate science","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/jan/05/quietest-building-chemists-physicists-engineers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2010/jan/05/quietest-building-chemists-physicists-engineers","fields":{"headline":"Delicate science","bodyText":"Two thick steel doors shut softly behind me. I'm not locked into this boxy, cell-like \"quiet lab\" deep in the bowels of Bristol University's new Centre for Nanoscience and Quantum Information, but it feels like I might as well be. A journalist could disappear here: no sound penetrates, and no one would hear my screams … A constant stream of traffic drives past the centre, but the springs and dampers upon which this new building has been constructed ensure that very little noise, and virtually no vibration whatsoever, impinges on the finely tuned experiments on nanoparticles taking place in a series of quiet labs all along the basement corridor. This small lab, however, is the stillest of them all: having been given the tour of the basement, I'm now standing in the quietest room in the quietest building in the world, and I can almost hear my heart beat. Losing all auditory references does funny things to your balance, and I lurch slightly as the double doors open to let me out. It's a relief to hear the faint underlying buzz that indicates life as we know it. I've come to meet Dr Neil Fox who's going to tell me how sunlight shining on diamonds can generate electricity. It's theoretically possible, but doing it cheaply and consistently is the tricky bit. The heat contained in the sun's rays, clearly, comes for free, but the problem with solar power to date, explains Fox, has been the cost and logistics involved in generating usable electricity on a large scale. Storing the sun's power tends to be done by using its rays to heat oil or a special salt mixture to a high temperature. This provides a store of heat that is used to drive steam turbine generators just like any conventional power station. Although the principle is sound, the construction and operating costs of utility-scale plants are not cheap, making this kind of electrical power more expensive than nuclear, coal or gas. Nanodiamonds, Fox explains, are one of the few materials that can absorb heat, and, while barely red-hot, emit thermionic electrons. By arranging for this thermionic current to be harvested, electrical power can be generated directly. Job done, it might seem. Well, not quite. \"They're not very efficient,\" he explains, kindly sketching a vastly simplified picture to illustrate for me the problems currently taxing his team. \"Normally, when electrons move to the surface of a diamond particle, it's as if they arrive at a brick wall. But if we fix certain impurities in the diamond surface it's no longer a brick wall to all of them, more like a cliff they can fall off. Then, because they're heated, it's more like they're kicked off. That's great, and you've got electricity, but we want more of them to do that.\" Various elements of what is clearly a difficult and multifaceted experiment are being worked on at any one time. Chemists, physicists and engineers in the departments nearby are currently trying to concoct a nanodiamond material that's stable enough to act predictably. The potential for generating clean power cheaply and easily would be an amazing breakthrough, and it's the central reason why Fox and his research assistant, Dr Kane O'Donnell, spend much of their lives closeted in a quiet lab in the basement getting up close and personal with a shiny silver scanning probe microscope that cost their sponsor, E.ON, around half a million euros. It looks rather like an old-fashioned diver's helmet. Curious, I peer through a little window into its innards. I don't know what I'm expecting – given that a nanoparticle of diamond is unimaginably tiny, I'm hardly likely to see anything sparkly, much less an emitted electron dancing around. Images from the microscope are sent to O'Donnell's computer: auditory and vibrational quiet is essential, he explains, to the accuracy of their results. \"There's a similar microscope at UCL, but their lab is next to a tube line, so things can sometimes go wrong,\" he says with a small grin. \"What we're doing is probing at the atomic scale. It's like trying to position a needle above a particle at a distance of about an atom.\" The most infinitesimal shake can make the tiny diamond particles under scrutiny appear to jump the nano-equivalent of a continent's width to the left or right, up or down. To prevent this, the section of the room where the microscope sits is a solid block of concrete several metres thick, which can be suspended on jets of air to isolate it from any noise or vibration. There are no phones in these labs, special non-buzzing lighting has been installed, and the only copper wiring permitted is that required to power the computers. \"We need to be confident that if we take a measure, it's accurate,\" says O'Donnell. \"If it's a controversial point, our careers are on the line. And misleading results hold up the research.\" Without this facility, adds Fox, it wouldn't have been worth spending half a million euros on such a super-specified instrument. But the laboratory environment here allows his team to achieve a precision available nowhere else. It's rare, explains O'Donnell, for researchers in the physical sciences to be doing fundamental science and applied science in the same project, but the results of combining their brainpower could potentially make solar energy viable on a major scale. If nanodiamonds can be manipulated to make the cost per kilowatt cheaper, conventional energy companies would be far more willing to invest in solar power. \"E.ON may well be interested because of energy-scavenging technology,\" says Fox. This is waste heat created by an industrial plant, which could be used just like the infrared heat from sunlight to make nanodiamonds emit electrons. \"An energy company might never have a solar plant, but they would dearly love to have 5% extra capacity that they could set alongside their conventional generation model.\" But couldn't you just build a massive diamond electricity-generating solar array that works solely off the sun's clean energy? \"Yes, you could, but the benefit of bolting it on to other forms of solar thermal energy generation is that you can use surplus or waste heat to increase the overall efficiency of the plant, making it commercially more competitive,\" says Fox. \"And if any piece of equipment is going to answer the questions to make that a possibility, it's this microscope, in this building.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/sep/16/china-two-degree-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-09-16T14:13:03Z","webTitle":"Chinese government adviser warns that 2C global warming target is unrealistic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/16/china-two-degree-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/sep/16/china-two-degree-rise","fields":{"headline":"Chinese government adviser warns that 2C global warming target is unrealistic","bodyText":"Don't expect China to keep global warming below 2C, a senior government adviser warned in Beijing today at the launch of an influential report on the nation's prospects for low-carbon growth. Even in a best-case scenario with massive investment in solar energy and carbon capture technology, Dai Yande, deputy chief of the Energy Research Institute, said China's emissions were unlikely to fall low enough to remain below the temperature goal recommended by the G8 and European Union. His prediction will alarm those governments and scientists who warn that a rise more than 2C risks disastrous consequences in terms of food security, migration, sea-level rises and extreme weather events. \"You should not target China to fulfill the two degree target. That is just a vision. Reality has deviated from that vision,\" said Dai. \"We do not think that target provides room for developing countries.\" China argues that its priority must be economic growth to relieve poverty among its vast population. Dai – whose think tank works under the government's powerful National Development and Reform Commission – blamed rich nations for excessive consumption and for failing to reach the targets set at Kyoto. \"Twenty percent of the world's population takes 80% of wealth and emits 70% of greenhouse gases,\" he said. \"I think two degrees is a vision that is difficult to fulfill because few countries have reached Kyoto protocol targets, except the UK and some others in the EU.\" Dai stressed that his comments are not official government policy, but they are consistent with a hardening of positions ahead of the Copenhagen climate change summit in December. Dai was speaking at the launch of the most influential study ever carried out in China on the possibility of the country moving toward a low carbon path of development. The detailed study, which was conducted by 10 institutions including universities and the World Wildlife Fund, was built on a preparatory study published last month. Under its most ambitious scenario, China's overall emissions would peak between 2030 and 2035, assuming generous financial assistance from rich nations, technological transfer, changed consumer habits, enormous investment in renewable energies and large-scale economic restructuring. Dai said he thought it was unlikely that the two most optimistic scenarios could be achieved because of the huge cost of expanding solar and wind power and capturing carbon. Even under the least ambitious scenario China would have to invest 89.9 trillion yuan by 2050. Professor He Jiankun, a co-author and the former executive vice president of Tsinghua University, said China faced huge obstacles in moving to a low carbon path because it was still in the midst of development. \"There are a huge number of cities to be built. They will consume a large amount of steel and cement. This means that emissions will not be reduced for some time.\" He said the report was not national policy, but it was a blue-print for change. The WWF signed the recommendations and Yang Fuqiang, director of global climate solutions at the China office of WWF, said developing nations were making a \"heroic\" effort to reduce carbon. He added that governments in richer countries used the excuse of democracy to claim it was \"politically impossible\" to make bigger cuts. He said China would suffer more than any other country as a result of climate change, but it was unlikely to shift direction on emissions any time soon. \"China emits most carbon in the world. We don't want this hat, but we may have to wear it for many more years,\" he said. The Chinese state council is currently debating a major new plan for renewable energy and there is speculation that it will also announce a carbon intensity target in its economic plan for the first time, but they have yet to show their hand ahead of Copenhagen. President Hu Jintao is expected to outline some measures at a major United Nations summit on climate change next week. Until now, Beijing has focused its efforts on technological development. Dai said this was a hope, though it was a wild card. \"Technological innovation is hard to measure,\" he said. \"Nobody could imagine in the 1960s that everyone would have a cellphone and internet access.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/jul/16/renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-16T14:13:25Z","webTitle":"Q&A: Renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/16/renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/jul/16/renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Q&A: Renewable energy","bodyText":"What is renewable energy? Anything that can be used to make heat or electricity without unsustainable fuels and which does not make a net contribution of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This includes wind power, waves and the tides, solar energy, geothermal energy and biomass. Nuclear power, although it is low-carbon, cannot be counted as a renewable source of energy because its fuel, uranium, is finite. What are the UK's commitments on renewables? The UK is committed to producing 15% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 — this is equivalent to around 35% of its electricity. What are the leading technologies? The UK has huge resources in wind and wave power and, in the first of these, has done relatively well to ramp up development and installation. By 2007, there were 2GW of turbines installed. The British Wind Energy Association (BWEA) says 9GW of offshore wind will be in place by 2015, overtaking installed nuclear power. This month, Centrica and RWE npower came close to approving two offshore wind farms costing an estimated £3bn. According to the Centre for Alternative Technology, wave power could supply 10% of the UK's energy needs but this technology is at a much earlier stage. Although there are scores of British designs for wave energy converters, none are anywhere near commercial scale. The biggest tidal project on the cards is at the mouth of the Severn river. This has the second highest tidal range in the world, and the government is consulting on a range of projects that could harness the energy. The plans preferred by the government, which include a large 10-mile barrage across the river, have dismayed many environmentalists. Bristol-based group Stop the Barrage Now say that the largest barrage would add to local flooding, reduce fish stocks, damage bird life and destroy the Severn bore, the tidal wave that flows up the river. They also argue the development will ruin mudflats across an area of more than 77 square miles. Many green groups favour tidal lagoons, which have lower impact but are unproven technologies. These artificial lagoons flood as the tides rise and then trap water as the tide falls. The water then passes through a hydropower turbine to generate electricity. Solar technologies include photovoltaics or PV, where sunlight is used to create electricity directly and solar thermal, which can be used in small set-ups to heat water for homes. Concentrating solar power plants focus sunlight from hundreds of mirrors onto a central tower, where water is superheated into steam that can turn turbines and make electricity. Geothermal energy involves tapping the heat stored underground - traditional methods harnesses naturally occurring pockets of steam or hot water that rise from deep underground, bringing with them the energy stored by the rocks there. Enhanced methods allow those traditional techniques to be applied almost anywhere by drilling deep into the Earth and pumping water into the hole, the underground hot rocks fracture, allowing the water to circulate and be heated. What is the progress globally? The UK still only gets 1.8% of its energy from renewables, according to government figures. EU figures for 2005 show that, in Sweden, the renewable share was upwards of 40% and Finland's was around 30%. Denmark got more than 20% of its electricity-generating capacity from wind power thanks to consistent support ion the technology from the government. Germany gets 5.9% of its energy from renewables, largely thanks to a feed-in tariff for solar energy, which pays consumers a premium rate for any electricity they feed into the national grid. According to the Renewable Energy Policy Network (REPN), global power capacity from new renewable energy sources (excluding large hydro) reached 280,000 MW in 2008 – a 16% rise from the 240,000MW in 2007. Green energy investment overtook fossil fuels in attracting investment for first time last year, according to the United Nations. Wind, solar and other clean technologies attracted $140bn (£85bn) compared with $110bn for gas and coal for electrical power generation, with more than a third of the money destined for Britain and the rest of Europe. The biggest growth was in China, India and other developing countries. What is the UK's problem? Some people blame the market, others argue that the government has not been bold enough in tangible, long-term support for renewables industries. Since the 1980s, the government has been keen not to pick winners in technology terms and has created non-specific incentives such as the renewable obligations certificates (ROCs) to encourage renewable technologies. The problem is that this has only encouraged low-risk renewables such as onshore wind. What plans are there for the future? The REPN says that, as of 2009, at least 73 countries have renewable energy policy targets and, in response to the financial crisis, many governments are spending their economic stimulus funding towards new green jobs the renewable energy sector can provide. In the US, part of the economic stimulus package will invest $150bn over 10 years in renewable energy. South Korea has ear-marked 81% of its stimulus package worth £23bn to green measures. China is planning a big increase in its use of wind and solar power in the next decade — officials there believe it could match Europe by 2020, producing a fifth of its energy needs from renewable sources. In the current development plan, the goal for wind energy is 30GW but the government is thinking about increasing this goal to 100GW by 2020. In the US, the Waxman-Markey bill recently proposed a tentative agreement to create a renewable power target of 15% by 2020. The UN believes $750bn needs to be spent worldwide between 2009 and 2011 although the current year has started with a 53% slump in first quarter renewables investment to $13.3bn. What are the commercial opportunities? The government reckons that the low-carbon environmental goods and services sector was worth £3,046bn in 2007/8. Asia accounted for 38% of this total, Europe 27%, and the Americas 30%. In the UK, this sector was valued at £106.5bn, making it the world's sixth largest low-carbon and environmental economy, with 3.5% of global market share. The report went on to forecast up to an additional 400,000 jobs over the next eight years, many of these in the renewable energy and new low-carbon industries. Just taking these sectors alone, the market value of low-carbon technology and services could be £127bn in 2014/15, employing 1.04 million people. According to the Carbon Trust, the UK could benefit from 250,000 jobs and up to £70bn in revenue from offshore wind and wave technologies by 2050. But this potential will only be realised if the government gives clear signals to industry, so that investors know where to put their money, rather than leaving new technologies to face the market alone. It would need investment of up to £600m into research, the removal of regulatory barriers and incentives to increase the deployment of the turbines. In the UK this means installing around 29GW of wind by 2020 and upwards of 40GW by 2050. A large part of the economic benefit would come from exporting technology developed here. For wave, the outlook is more modest. Around a quarter of the world's wave technologies are being developed in the UK and the Carbon Trust said Britain should be the \"natural owner\" of the global market in this area. It could generate revenues worth £2bn a year by 2050 and up to 16,000 direct jobs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2010/apr/04/brian-cox-observer-profile","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-03T23:05:32Z","webTitle":"Brian Cox: The man with the stars in his eyes | Casper Llewellyn Smith","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/apr/04/brian-cox-observer-profile","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2010/apr/04/brian-cox-observer-profile","fields":{"headline":"Brian Cox: The man with the stars in his eyes","bodyText":"In an increasingly fragmented culture, it's hard to tell when someone qualifies as a fully fledged celebrity, but Brian Cox passed two markers recently , first when the Daily Mail hailed him as \"something of a sex symbol\" and then when he topped 50,000 followers on Twitter. This is good going for a 42-year-old research-active physicist, even for one frequently if a little erroneously described as a former pop star. But then in popularising science so effectively, it's little wonder that Cox should have become a household name. It is not simply that he is, according to the swooning Mail, \"a vision of gleaming skin, artfully floppy hair and extremely good teeth\"; for those whose tastes don't run to Boyzone, he talks the talk, too, rubbishing astrology on his five-part series for BBC2, for instance, and saying that \"anyone who thinks the Large Hadron Collider will destroy the world is a twat\". This Sunday, Wonders of the Solar System reaches its climax – perfect viewing for Easter, even if Cox is avowedly an atheist, who'd probably find an act of resurrection of less interest than the performance of the LHC at Cern in Geneva. The series, which sees Cox explaining what we know of life for our immediate neighbours in space, hasn't simply been critically received. It has reached viewing figures of 5 million, against the norm for science programmes on the BBC of 1.5 million. The inspiration for the series, for its presenter at least, was Carl Sagan's Cosmos: A Personal Journey, which the BBC screened in 1981. Cox's hope that he will inspire a new generation to marvel at our place in the universe, knowledge of which has advanced considerably in the last 30 years, would seem to have been granted. While the programmes rely heavily on imagery of sights such as Jupiter's moon Io with its stunning flows of lava, it is this Royal Society research fellow's personality that shines through. One of more endearing moments of the series came when he visited Death Valley in 45 degree heat to repeat an experiment first carried out by British physicist John Herschel in 1838. Using no more than a thermometer, a can full of water, an umbrella and his noggin, Cox calculated how much solar energy falls on the Earth and, seemingly mindless of his scenic backdrop, announced: \"And that's why I love physics.\" It is a love that he attributes to growing up in Oldham in the era of the space race – according to his father, he watched the moon landings as a baby. But while a self-professed \"very, very nerdy\" child, who went plane- and even bus-spotting, he went \"completely the other way\" at the age of 15 when he discovered Duran Duran and then a wider world of music and ended up with a grade D in his maths A-level. By then, Cox was the keyboard player with a local rock band, Dare, formed by former Thin Lizzy member Darren Wharton. The group achieved no little success, flying to Los Angeles to make their first album, Out of the Silence, which was released in 1988 on A&amp;M Records. But there was less of an appetite for a second collection of their melodic rock, and despite supporting the likes of Jimmy Page at the Hammersmith Odeon, the band soon split, following a fight in a Berlin bar. It was at this point, at the age of 23, that Cox applied to Manchester University to study physics, but he ended up joining a second group \"by accident\". This was D:Ream, who would support Take That on tour and have six top 20 hits, including a No 1 with a dance remix of Things Can Only Get Better in January 1994. Most people, however, remember the song from 1997 when the Labour party adopted it for its election campaign. The morning after playing Top of the Pops, the group put in a repeat performance at the South Bank at Labour's victory party, but realising that things probably wouldn't get better, at least in his guise as a member of a band, Cox then quit the group. The last physicist to become a household name was Stephen Hawking, thanks to his popularising book, A Brief History of Time. But whereas Hawking is a most eminent theoretical physicist – the Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge University for 30 years and the author of the idea of Hawking Radiation – Brian Cox toils in more humble fields. Returning to Manchester, he completed his PhD, which was based on his thesis drawn from work he did for the H1 experiment at the particle accelerator Hera at the Desy laboratory in Hamburg. His day job now, which involves an area of physics called diffraction, is one that even he struggles to make sound sexy. (\"It's interesting for lots of technical reasons,\" is the best he can muster.) His most commonly cited paper is called \"WW scattering in the absence of a light Higgs boson\". None the less, he is involved in work at the frontier of science at Cern, where, last week, the LHC, the biggest particle accelerator of them all, produced its first high-energy collisions. Cox works on the Atlas experiment and is involved in a project to develop additional, smaller detectors. Then there is his role in the public sphere. While he didn't take centre stage with D:Ream and claims that he took to public speaking painfully, he is a regular contributor to Radio 4 and 6 Music, arguing the case for science, and often tours schools on speaking engagements. He was the scientific adviser on Danny Boyle's film Sunshine, and before filming started on Wonders of the Solar System, he cropped up frequently on the BBC's Horizon. It is as a champion of science as much as in his role as an erstwhile pop star that Cox's recent announcement that he won't vote Labour in the impending election caused headlines of its own. He says that Tony Blair always struck him as being all right and \"he still does\", but the proposed funding cuts of about £1bn to higher education announced by Lord Mandelson in December are \"a disaster and absolutely silly, unless there's an astonishing way that he's found of making our universities better by giving them less money\". Overall, he claims, Labour's record on science funding is \"not as good as it should have been\", especially so given that, as he points out, \"there are figures like 6.4% of GDP comes from physics, 30% comes from science\". For Cox, Dr Evan Harris, the Lib Dem spokesman on science, has \"made the most commitment to science\" and he intends now to vote for that party at the election. He continues to be outspoken in other areas, too, recently belittling people such as Sarah Palin who believe that God created Earth 6,000 years ago, for instance. (\"Young Earth creationism: bollocks\".) Such an approach is even more refreshing considering that the toxic subject of climate change has recently seen other scientists attempt to hide their light under a bushel. \"I don't know whether it's because I'm from Oldham,\" Cox told me recently, \"but I believe in a straight-talking version of science.\" It might well irk colleagues that he is the public face of Cern when his role there is relatively junior or that he spends so much time crisscrossing the globe for the BBC, from Alaska to Ethiopia. (One criticism of Wonders of the Solar System is that as staggering as the images of the solar system are, the number of places that he travelled to on Earth in the course of the six months it took to make the series is jaw-dropping for slightly different reasons.) But he somehow succeeds in pursuing his proper work, too, both at Cern and at Manchester University (where is he now a professor). Otherwise, he can be found in cyberspace (a prolific tweeter, he recently used the service to denounce a BBC story on problems with the LHC as \"a pile of merde\") or at home where he lives in London. He is married to TV presenter and self-confessed \"science groupie and professional dork\" Gia Milinovich, with whom he has a 10-month–old son, George. They met on 11 September 2001 and were married four years later in a low-key ceremony at her mother's house in Duluth, Minnesota. \"I'm a northern man, I don't like any fuss,\" Cox commented. Of his reputation as a sex symbol, he told the Daily Mail: \"People say things like, 'Ooh, he's quite good looking… for a scientist.' But it's a very low bar. There's basically me and Patrick Moore.\" A sequel to Wonders of the Solar System has already been discussed, which should see him become a mainstream TV star. But in low-key fashion, he says that the greatest achievement would lie in getting approval for his project for a new set of detectors at Cern."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/aug/04/india-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-08-04T17:01:47Z","webTitle":"India sets out ambitious solar power plan to be paid for by rich nations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/aug/04/india-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/aug/04/india-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"India sets out ambitious solar power plan to be paid for by rich nations","bodyText":"India has decided to push ahead with a vastly ambitious plan to tap the power of the sun to generate clean electricity, and after a meeting chaired by the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, it wants rich nations to pay the bill. Although India has virtually no solar power now, the plan envisages the country generating 20GW from sunlight by 2020. Global solar capacity is predicted to be 27GW by then, according to the International Energy Agency, meaning India expects to be producing 75% of this within just 10 years. Four-hundred million Indians have no electricity and the solar power would help spark the country's development and end the power cuts that plague the nation. It would also, say some analysts, assuage international criticism that India is not doing enough to confront its carbon emissions. It is currently heavily reliant on highly polluting coal for power. The plan provoked prolonged discussion at a meeting of the national climate change council in New Dehli yesterday, which resulted in major changes from early drafts. The draft document had envisaged a government subsidy of around $20bn (£11bn), and falling production costs, in order to achieve a long-term 2040 target of 200GW of solar power. But experts pointed out that a large government subsidy contradicted the Indian government's stated position in the negotiations to agree a treaty to fight global warming. India, along with China and others, has demanded that the costs of clean technologies should be carried by developed nations, which have grown rich through their heavy use of fossil fuels. Under the revised plan, India's solar mission will seek to achieve its targets by demanding technological and financial support from the developed nations. \"In order to achieve its renewable energy targets, the Indian government expects international financing as well as technology at an affordable cost,\" said Leena Srivastava of the TERI energy research institute. The move suggests New Delhi could use its solar energy plan as a bargaining chip at the forthcoming climate change summit in Copenhagen. The government reaffirmed its hardline position last month when the environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, told the visiting US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton: \"There is simply no case for the pressure that we, who have been among the lowest emitters per capita, [have] to actually reduce emissions.\" If rich nations do fund the solar plan, the aim of both sides – economic growth for developing countries but with low-carbon emissions – will have been met. Nonetheless, the plan's optimistic cost projections were debunked at the meeting, leaving it unclear how much money the 2020 target would need. \"In terms of vision, it's a very good plan,\" said Kushal Singh Yadav of the Centre for Science and Environment. \"But the nuts and bolts will remain uncertain until we get a fix on how much money is needed, and where it will come from.\" Yadav pointed out that India has taken significant strides in wind energy production thanks to a shift in government policy. Spain, for instance, added 3GW of solar power capacity in just one year in 2008. In another significant policy shift following the meeting, solar thermal power (which heats water) will be given as much importance as photovoltaic (which generates electricity). The Tamil Nadu government has already asked for New Delhi's assistance for setting up a 100MW solar thermal plant in the southern state."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"globalcleantech100/cleantech-100-2010-list","type":"article","sectionId":"globalcleantech100","sectionName":"Global Cleantech 100","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-12T20:37:00Z","webTitle":"Global Cleantech 100 | Global Cleantech 100","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/globalcleantech100/cleantech-100-2010-list","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/globalcleantech100/cleantech-100-2010-list","fields":{"headline":"Building a better tomorrow","bodyText":"This is the second year of the Cleantech 100, first published in 2009 as a joint venture between the Guardian and the Cleantech Group as a true representation of global innovation and private company creation. This year, we asked: which 100 of today's private cleantech companies are the most likely to make the most significant market impact over the next 5-10 years? Hundreds of worldwide cleantech experts – including companies themselves – nominated the list, which also included so-called \"passive\" nominations and validations derived from analysing market data, taking votes of confidence in a company's ability to achieve high growth and high-market impact from market transactions such as investment rounds, and major customer and partnership announcements. To be on the list, companies must be independent, for-profit, cleantech companies that are not listed on any major stock exchange. In 2010, 4,616 nominations were received from 3,260 unique sources, resulting in a longlist of 3,138 companies. A weighting and filter system was then applied to collate the results, score each company, and reduce the candidates to a shortlist of 218 companies to present to an expert advisory panel in a second stage of the process. Here members of the expert panel combine their votes with scores carried through from the first stage. Ultimately firms are scored on three key criteria: their innovation, their market's size and growth, and the company's ability and resources to execute its technology. The result is this authoritative guide to the best 100 companies in cleantech. Clearly, there are many, fine companies who are not on the 2010 list. They may be waiting to be discovered, they may be out of favour this year for whatever reason or they may simply have just missed the cut. Only so many companies can be on the list. Neasa MacErlean Energy Generation Biofuels Agri.capital Münster, Germany Product description: biogas Employees: N/A Year founded 2004 agri-capital.de Agri.capital operates about 40 biogas energy plants on farmland sites in northern and east Germany.

BrightSource Energy California, USA Product description: solar heating Employees: 240 Year founded 2004 brightsourceenergy.com Solar energy firm BrightSource believes it is breaking records for the temperatures it reaches in the solar heating tower technology that it is testing. Temperatures reach 550C when the sun is reflected from thousands of mirrors on to a water boiler which is located on top of a tower. The higher the temperature the more efficient the system, which pipes the resulting superheated steam into a turbine, which finally converts the energy into electricity. Solarcentury Energy generation London, UK Product description: solar systems Employees 110 Date founded 1998 solarcentury.co.uk The solar panel market has been transformed in the past twelve months, and Solarcentury is one of the UK's largest solar suppliers and fitters to have taken advantage. The introduction of feed-in tariffs has been the driving force behind the change, through which utility companies are required to pay residential and other small-scale generators for the renewable energy they produce. Solarcentury estimates that the capital investment of between £10,000 to £12,000 to install panels pays for itself in around eight years. Calisolar California, USA Product description: cells and modules Employees: 300 Year founded 2006 calisolar.com The main specialist material used for manufacturing solar cells is currently silicon. Calisolar has developed a way of using non-pure silicon in the process, which is both cheaper and avoids supply problems. It is selling the product already and says it has kept its cost down by the takeover of a specialist silicon company, 6N Silicon. It claims to have achieved energy efficiencies in its solar modules which are 16% above the industry average. Enecsys Cambridge, UK Product description: solar systems Employees: Not available Year founded 2003 enecsys.com Many homeowners consider investing in solar panels but reject the idea due to the costs. Enecsys cannot reduce the capital outlay but says that a specialist component it makes, its micro-inverter, \"typically results in an improved energy harvest of approximately 15% to 25%\". This device replaces the standard inverter used by most manufacturers and which is, according to Enecys, \"the single most common cause of failure in solar PV systems\". Enphase Energy California, USA Product description: solar systems Employees: 120 Year founded 2006 enphaseenergy.com This company provides solar energy management systems to homes and business users, helping them to monitor their systems 24-hours a day and to receive performance information on each panel or module. Like Enecsys in the UK, Enphase produces a \"microinverter\" device which, it believes, can improve performance by up to 25%. It also claims that its inverter product \"provides greater production in low-light conditions\". eSolar California, USA Product description: solar thermal Employees: 135 Year founded 2006 esolar.com eSolar is working on technology using towers and mirrors to generate concentrated solar energy. Its California neighbour and fellow cleantech company, BrightSource Energy, is testing similar technology. As eSolar explains, \"small, flat mirrors … track the sun with high precision and reflect the sun's heat on to a tower-mounted receiver, which boils water to create steam. This steam powers a traditional turbine and generator to produce energy.\" Clients include California's largest electricity utility company, Southern California Edison. Heliatek Dresden, Germany Product description: solar cells Employees: 40 Year founded 2006 heliatek.com With the cost of solar photovoltaics (PVs) still putting off many potential ordinary investors, Heliatek is developing a low-cost, organic, lightweight type of solar cell. The company believes it is the world leader in one of the two main ways of producing organic PVs (using vacuum-deposited small molecules to absorb light and covert it to direct current). It aims to become the first company to mass produce them and says that achieving high sales volumes will lead to \"very low production costs\". MiaSolé California, USA Product description: solar/thin films Employees: 315 Year founded 2001 miasole.com There is a race on to bring the costs down on solar photovoltaic panels. Santa Clara-based MiaSolé hopes to get to the finish within two years through high-volume manufacture of its Cigs (copper indium gallium diselenide) thin-film semiconductor panels. Thin-film cells can be produced using only 1% of the (expensive) semiconductor material of traditional crystalline silicon-based cells.

It seems so. And Barack Obama's plans to rejoin international climate negotiations, green American energy policy, and build an electricity super-grid to bring renewable energy out of the West could be a planet-saver. Europe's leadership on fighting climate change seemed unassailable until just a few months ago. It had grabbed that position more than a decade ago, when Germany's then environment minister, a former East German chemist named Angela Merkel, negotiated the groundwork for the Kyoto Protocol in Berlin in 1995. Two years later, Europe basically pushed Bill Clinton to send Al Gore to Kyoto to sign up to the first emissions targets — which were never ratified by the U.S. Senate and subsequently repudiated by George W Bush. Early last month, Merkel — now German Chancellor — signaled Europe's retreat. She successfully lobbied on behalf of her coal-burning and car-making industries to water down European Union plans for carbon emissions trading in a new EU energy package. It is now unclear whether EU promises to cut emissions by 20 percent by 2020 — and 30 percent if other developed nations will go along — can be met. This is not to say that Europe's climate policies are bust. But its leadership role certainly is. At international climate talks in Poznan, Poland last month, environmentalists took to calling the once-revered German leader \"Darth Merkel.\" The inauguration of Barack Obama now looks like the world's best chance to break free of the climate trap. The incoming U.S. president says meeting the challenge of climate change and ensuring America a secure energy supply are top priorities that can both be achieved by weaning the country off its dependence on imports of foreign fossil fuels. Among the climate cognoscenti, the sense that a really important shift may be about to happen was accentuated when Obama announced in December that he had chosen Steven Chu as his energy secretary. The Nobel prize-winning head of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has helped pioneer research on energy efficiency, solar energy, and cellulosic \"second generation\" biofuels. Last year he announced a $500 million deal with BP to fund a new Energy Biosciences Institute at Berkeley. \"We are seeking industry partnerships,\" he said then. \"We seek solutions. We don't seek, dare I say, science papers anymore.\" Chu is also an advocate of a national high-voltage electricity super-grid to distribute renewable energy across the United States. In 2005, he went to Washington to pitch the idea — none too successfully, it seems — to Bush's energy secretary Samuel Bodman. And now it fits right in with Obama's campaign promise to establish \"a new digital grid... to make effective use of renewable energy.\" It also fits in as part of the new, green, job-creating, economy-reviving, American infrastructure that Obama promises — his 21st century version of the New Deal's Grand Coulee and Hoover dams. In September I visited California, where they are already test-driving some of Obama's plans under the unlikely gaze of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The state legislature has passed a key law to enact emissions reductions programs through regulation and carbon trading. The laws are intended as a model for federal action. Even more striking are the green energy entrepreneurs tooling up in California. \"If Barack Obama wins,\" David Mills, the bicycling-mad boss of solar energy pioneers Ausra in Palo Alto, told me, \"then it's going to be boom time here.\" He was cheering even louder with the news of Chu's appointment. Mills and Ausra are in the vanguard of what many believe will become the critical renewable technology for America — solar thermal energy. Unlike photovoltaics, which convert solar heat directly into electricity, solar thermal concentrates solar energy using mirrors to heat water, which is then used to drive conventional steam turbines. One of the advantages of solar thermal is that it allows the energy to be stored for when it is needed, in the form of hot water. Mills, a Canadian, developed his system in Australia. But a couple of years ago, frustrated by government indifference there, he shipped out to California. \"It has a state plan for renewables; it has the technologists to deliver; and it has the venture capital,\" he told me. Backers in Silicon Valley have pumped hundreds of millions of dollars already into start-up green tech companies like Ausra. In the fall, Mills opened a robot-run factory outside Las Vegas ready to cover the deserts of the American West with glass mirrors that catch the sun's energy. \"This is not mad scientists any more,\" Mills said. \"In the next decades, clean energy is going to be ten times bigger than the internet and IT combined. The energy business is the largest business in the world, and with climate change, it all has to be replaced. We are just waiting to deliver to the boom.\" Industry analysts say up to $50 billion in capital is waiting to be invested in solar projects in the Nevada desert. On his arrival at the Oval Office, Obama will find in his in-box applications for permits to put solar panels and reflectors across 400,000 hectares of the West — enough for 40,000 megawatts of electricity generating capacity. And utilities are willing to buy. All they need is the green light from Washington: a few tax breaks, permission to erect mirrors on federal desert land, a cap-and-trade system that puts a price on carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels, and a transmission system to get the new green power to market. Mills has published peer-reviewed papers showing how the United States could get 90 per cent of its energy from covering just 10 per cent of the Nevada desert with mirrors. Could it happen? Renewables like solar and wind have two problems. First, they are intermittent. Some days there is no wind; every night there is no sun. Second, unlike coal or oil, the fuels are not transportable. And most of the U.S.'s renewable potential is west of the Mississippi, whereas most of the demand is east of the Mississippi. The United States currently has no national grid capable of moving the power east. Industry advocates say that a new high-voltage direct-current grid, using superconducting materials to minimize transmission losses, could transform the potential of U.S. renewables. And by connecting wind and solar energy (not to mention some nuclear and fossil fuel, too), it would minimize the risk of an outage of any one source of power due to the weather crashing the system. This is not just about the United States. The technology that drives America usually ends up driving the world. If Obama goes for a smart super-grid, you can almost guarantee that Merkel and her fellow Europeans will suddenly get more enthusiastic about a super-grid scheme quietly being promoted there to hook up to solar energy from the Sahara desert. A grander version would also tap geothermal energy from Iceland, hydropower from Scandinavia, and wind power from the North Sea. And China? Whisper it quietly, but China is already the world's largest manufacturer of wind turbines. Any industrialist sitting in China and watching the U.S. government open its wallet to rebuild the country's energy infrastructure will be thinking contracts, contracts, contracts. China will want to manufacture the wind turbines and solar panels and superconducting cables. The U.S. market is so big it could have huge implications for R&amp;D and energy manufacturing around the world. And if green tech is good enough for Americans, then everyone will want not just to make it but to use it as well. Climate scientists believe we have to cut global greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50 percent by 2050, with cuts of 80-90 percent in industrialized countries. If so, then the decarbonization of our economies has to be completed within the lifetime of power plants being designed and financed now. In Germany, once the darling of the greens, they are talking right now about building a new generation of coal-fired power stations. In America, the talk is different. The talk is about delivering energy security AND climate security. But talk is just talk. Let's hope Obama delivers on what he says. • This article was shared by our content partner Yale Environment 360, part of the Guardian Environment Network"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/jul/16/green-energy-plans-criticised","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-16T19:33:10Z","webTitle":"National Energy Action criticises government's green energy plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/16/green-energy-plans-criticised","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/jul/16/green-energy-plans-criticised","fields":{"headline":"Green energy plans will not help fuel poverty, claims charity","bodyText":"The charity National Energy Action (NEA) criticised the government for watering down its promise to introduce \"social\" energy tariffs in its low carbon white paper, saying only a fraction of poor people would benefit. The NEA, which campaigns on fuel poverty issues, said it was also concerned that funding for the existing Warm Front scheme to help poorer households would be halved next year. Its chief, Jenny Saunders, said: \"NEA has been pressing hard for a social mandate on energy tariffs and we are pleased that the government has included this in its low carbon transition plan. But we are concerned at … the potential narrowing of assistance to pensioner households when millions of low income families are also in fuel poverty and need access to lower tariffs and protection from rising prices. \"And while the white paper recognises the importance of Warm Front in assisting vulnerable households, NEA is concerned the reduction of funding for the next year has not been addressed, which will lead to 50% fewer households being assisted.\" There are an estimated 5 million people in Britain living in so-called \"fuel poverty\" – defined as people who spend more than 10% of their income on fuel and light. The Tories said ministers had not been honest about the social costs of their low carbon transition, though the party broadly supports the policies. \"[Energy secretary] Ed Miliband has deliberately disguised this and has not been honest that it could cost some people more than others,\" the shadow energy and climate change secretary, Greg Clark, said. He also said that because of Labour's almost total inaction in the area of renewable energy over the past decade, the costs of a dash to sustainable energy would now be higher than they had to be, and it would probably mainly benefit foreign firms, who would rush in to fill the void as the domestic renewable energy industry struggled to catch up with demand. The Department of Energy and Climate Change rejected the claims. \"The government is providing immediate help for households to make energy savings and reduce bills, and since 2000 has spent £20bn on helping people in fuel poverty\", a spokesman said. \"We're determined to minimise the impacts on the poorest in society – which is why we're reforming the system of social tariffs to allow the most vulnerable to receive compulsory support from the energy companies and increasing the amount spent.\" A key part of the government's plans is the so-called \"clean energy cashback\" which is a more user friendly name than the \"feed-in tariff\" label used in most the national grid. They have been used to great success in other countries and are the model the British government wants to follow. But renewables companies, which have been considering the numbers since the proposed tariff levels were published on Wednesday, were disappointed. The government claims its tariffs are designed to give investment returns of between 5% and 8%, lower than those offered by many other countries' tariffs. But Solar Century, one of Britain's leading solar energy groups, claims the return is more like 4% on photovoltaics – leaving a long payback time and hardly providing an incentive for households or businesses to invest. Executive chairman Jeremy Leggett said: \"The government has accepted solar PV can make a significant contribution to our future energy needs. It's unfortunate that the consultation numbers, if confirmed later this year, will do little to boost demand for non-domestic solar PV.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2009/jun/15/starwatch-sunspots","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2009-06-14T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Starwatch: Alan Pickup on sunspots and reduced solar activity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jun/15/starwatch-sunspots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2009/jun/15/starwatch-sunspots","fields":{"headline":"Starwatch","bodyText":"The Sun reaches one peak next Sunday morning when it stands at its furthest north at the summer solstice. In another regard, though, solar activity is plumbing depths not seen in a lifetime. If the Sun's 11-year cycle of activity ran like clockwork, then the number of sunspots seen at present should be on a par with those observed in 1998. Back then, sunspot numbers had climbed halfway from their so-called sunspot minimum in 1996 to a strong maximum in 2000/2001. Our image of a spotless Sun, though, was taken by the SOHO space observatory as recently as last Wednesday and is typical of the Sun's pristine appearance on four out of five days this year, and over much of last year too. Indeed, with more than 637 spotless days since 2004, this is the most protracted spell of solar inactivity since the minimum of 1913. Sunspots are not the only indicator of the Sun's activity but they are the easiest to observe, with detailed records stretching back over 23 cycles since the mid-18th century. Others include the strength of radio emission from the Sun and the density and speed of the solar wind, the stream of charged subatomic particles rushing outwards through the solar system. Another is the solar irradiance, the amount of solar energy received at the Earth; perhaps surprisingly, this increases when sunspots are common. The effect appears to be tiny, but it may be no coincidence that the climate over Europe and North America was unusually cold when sunspots were virtually absent in the late 17th century, the so-called Maunder minimum. At this point, I must stress again the need for extreme caution in observing the Sun. Never view the Sun directly through a telescope or binoculars. To do so invites serious eye damage. Instead, I suggest you use a small telescope or binoculars to focus the Sun's image on to a white card held away from the eyepiece. Individual spots and spot groups last for a few days to several weeks, drifting westwards across the disc from day to day as the Sun turns on its axis. Akin to magnetic storms, their origins are linked to a dynamo process within the Sun. Spots erupt where lines of magnetic flux pierce the surface, initially at higher solar latitudes but migrating towards the equator as the cycle progresses. The first high-latitude spot of the new 24th cycle was sighted 18 months ago but its successors have been slow to appear. Things may be perking up, though, with more signs of higher latitude magnetic activity, and three minor spot groups, during the past month. We have seen false dawns before, though, and the current official prediction that the next maximum may be a relatively low one in 2013 is uncertain at best."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2009/aug/26/bt-red-telephone-kiosks","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2009-08-26T17:45:01Z","webTitle":"The red phone box still has a future | Victor Keegan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/aug/26/bt-red-telephone-kiosks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2009/aug/26/bt-red-telephone-kiosks","fields":{"headline":"The red phone box still has a future","bodyText":"Some people have fairies at the end of their garden. We have a red telephone kiosk, one of the most beautiful examples of street architecture ever devised. Sadly, it is hardly ever used now – killed by the unstoppable march of the mobile phone. It is for this reason that thousands are being disposed of by BT. It is offering local communities the chance to take them over for £1 if they will maintain them or £300 a year plus VAT if they keep them as a working payphone. This provides a rare opportunity to either keep the kiosks as they are or turn them into a new form of public art. Or both. Designed by the architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott in 1924, the red kiosks were first introduced two years later in London and other parts of the country. Since then, they have become a part of Britain's heritage, along with cream teas, warm beer and the Tower of London. But now they are in danger of becoming a mausoleum for the analogue age unless something creative is done. Many kiosks have already been converted to alternative uses and there is no shortage of ideas, as I found when I asked around, including putting out an appeal on Twitter. Here are a few: a shower cubicle, a coffin, an emergency shelter for unpredictable weather, a Doctor Who artefact (though it would have to be bigger on the inside … ), a mini greenhouse, a sales point for newspapers or deliveries from the internet, a kennel for tall dogs, a PhoneBoo (suggested, would you believe it, by the founder of audioboo.fm), a coffee dispenser, an ATM cash machine (but it would be a magnet for robbers), an \"island of tranquillity\" piping soft music for stressed out people, a local tourist information point, or as one expat American said, just leave them as they are as \"the most recognisable symbol to all foreign tourists\". One wag suggested that as they were too often used by drunks urinating maybe they should be turned into chemical toilets. Another man has made a business out of restoring booths. Keep the ideas rolling. One obvious use would be to have solar energy stored during the day to illuminate the kiosks at night as a sculpture or as a beacon for passers by. However, the people at the Centre for Alternative Technology in Machynlleth tell me their renewable energy powered telephone box was deemed uneconomic by BT. Last month, what is claimed to be the smallest art gallery in the world opened in a phone box in Settle, north Yorkshire. One tweeter, Lisa Devaney, suggested making some of them into a tribute to phones by filling them with discarded mobiles. Or the phones could be made into a sculpture of a person making a call as an ironic comment on the demise of a traditional communication. Or indeed made into any other sculpture. This month BT has started a competition for alternative uses with a first prize of £5,000 and others of £1,000. It says there are 12,500 kiosks nationwide of which more than 6,700 are \"potentially suitable for adoption\", which sounds much nicer than saying they are in danger of closure. A great suggestion came from Phil Slade. He urged that they should be turned into Skype stations or Fon points (or for that matter Truphone or any of the burgeoning internet telephony companies). This is a brilliant idea because it does several things at once. Technologically, it provides a magic bridge for the red kiosks to use their existing copper wires to move from the analogue into the digital age and, socially, it would provide free internet telephone calls for anyone, including the poor (as long as the person at the other end is hooked up to a web telephone). It could also be a base enabling the kiosk to expand into other digital areas – not least to become a base station to get broadband to remote parts of the country. Great idea. But it won't win a competition organised by BT, will it? victorkeegan.com"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/jun/27/barack-obama-climate-change-bill","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-06-27T00:37:49Z","webTitle":"Barack Obama's US climate change bill passes key Congress vote","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jun/27/barack-obama-climate-change-bill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/jun/27/barack-obama-climate-change-bill","fields":{"headline":"Barack Obama's US climate change bill passes key Congress vote","bodyText":"America has taken historic action against climate change, with the US Congress voting to reduce the carbon emissions that cause global warming. The house of representatives has voted 219 to 212 to bind the US to cutting carbon emissions by 17% from 2005 levels in 2020 and 83% in 2050. It will also set up a national cap and trade system. Democrats claimed the bill – the first such measure ever to win a vote in Congress – as an important victory. \"The house has passed the most important energy and environment bill in our nation's history,\" said Ed Markey, one of the bill's authors. \"Scientists say global warming is a dangerous man-made problem. Today we are saying clean energy will be the American-made solution.\" Even the bill's most implacable opponents acknowledged its importance in transforming US energy use. \"This could be the defining bill of this Congress,\" said Republican house leader John Boehner. The bill must still clear the Senate – where it faces even more daunting odds – before it can be signed into law. But the vote was indisputably an important victory for Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress. For Obama, it was a first step towards redemption of one of his signature campaign promises, within six months of coming to the White House. The vote also delivers an important boost to the prospects of reaching an agreement for international action on climate change at Copenhagen this year. \"I think it will have a very positive impact on the Copenhagen process because the international negotiations have largely been stymied by countries waiting to see what the US will do,\" said Jennifer Haverkamp, the director of international climate policy for the Environmental Defence Fund. \"Passage of the house bill is just one step in that process, but it is such a crucial step and a high hurdle.\" In addition to establishing a cap and trade system that is the heart of the 1,200-page bill, the measures approved by the house would require power companies to produce 15% of their electricity from wind and solar energy. But the bill's passage was hard-won. By the time of the vote, the Democratic leadership had made several major concessions to win support from party refuseniks, weakening the bill. Several environmental organisations admitted they were disappointed. Greenpeace went so far as to call on Congress to reject it. Even after giving ground on the bill, the White House and Democrats were forced to go to extraordinary lengths to muster enough support for passage. Obama put his personal prestige on the line – making three appeals in the space of 48 hours this week for Congress to deliver the bill. The White House also oversaw a furious public relations effort to sell the sweeping package of energy reforms as a jobs creation programme. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker, and her lieutenants lobbied till the last minute to round up final stragglers, but heroic measures were needed. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, who checked in to a rehab clinic two weeks ago, returned to Congress; so did John Lewis of Georgia despite having surgery only days ago.Forty-four Democrats – mostly from conservative and rural areas – voted against the measure. However, eight Republicans voted for the bill, breaking their party's blanket opposition to action on climate change, and allowing Obama to claim a share of bipartisan support for his energy reforms. • This article was amended on 20 July 2009.

The German company's acquisition of Clear Standards, which only started selling its software a few months ago, comes as regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are pushing for companies to monitor their environmental impact more closely. SAP, which counts some of the biggest names in business among users of its enterprise software, reckons its 86,000 global customers are responsible for about five gigatonnes – or 5m tonnes – of the estimated global human greenhouse gas footprint of 30Gt a year. \"Our customers, combined, have a carbon footprint that is about one-sixth of the world's total man-made carbon emissions,\" explained Peter Graf, SAP's chief sustainability officer and executive vice president of sustainability solutions. \"That shows you what an incredible lever SAP holds. Even if we can only improve the emissions of our customers by a percentage or two... we can have a huge impact.\" Privately-owned Clear Standards, which only employs 30 people, has developed software that allows companies to measure their environmental impact, including greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption and waste. Some of its customers – such as Coca-Cola, solar energy group Sunpower and Starwood Hotels – are concerned about their brand image and use the software to improve their environmental record, while others are increasingly having to measure their impact because of tightening regulation. Many businesses in Europe, such as those involved in heavy industry or power generation, already have to track their impact because they fall under the EU's emissions trading rules. In the US, meanwhile, companies in the utility, oil and gas and some manufacturing sectors will be mandated to measure and report their carbon footprint from January next year. \"We have been amazed by the activity of major corporations who are very eager to have a product that works and allows them to measure their energy,\" said Clear Standards' chairman and chief executive Betsy Atkins. \"We have an enormous amount of expertise in how you measure all of your energy, how that computes to a carbon footprint, and how you can be more efficient and save money by finding energy wastage as well as use more sustainable types of energy such as solar.\" As well as improving SAP's green image, the acquisition of Clear Standards gives it a foothold in a potentially highly lucrative market. Independent IT expert AMR Research estimates that the US market for measurement and reporting of carbon footprints is worth about $3.6bn and growing at 30% a year.

But, now that the event is going ahead, there is one topic that I hope to see come up during the event — the environment. It will be fascinating to see how Griffin deals with this topic, given that last April his party published its environmental manifesto with the somewhat bold claim that the BNP is \"this nation's only true Green party which has policies that will actually save the environment\". You're forgiven if you didn't catch this particular dispatch, so here's a little recap: Unlike the fake \"Greens\" who are merely a front for the far left of the Labour regime, the BNP is the only party to recognise that overpopulation – whose primary driver is immigration, as revealed by the government's own figures – is the cause of the destruction of our environment. Furthermore, the BNP's manifesto states that a BNP government will make it a priority to stop building on green land. New housing should wherever possible be built on derelict \"brown land.\" Don't you just love the way they describe it as \"brown land\" rather than the more conventional \"brownfield land\". Freudian slip, or intentionally offensive phraseology? But wait, there's more. Here's a handy cut-out-and-keep list of the BNP's headline environmental policies: • The removal of unsightly overhead power lines from beauty spots and their burial underground. • The creation of a bulk transport tax regime that pushes supermarkets to supply more local and seasonal produce. • The encouragement of an extensive and rapid switchover to organic and low fossil fuel farming techniques. • The banning of the ritual slaughter of animals without pre-stunning, and the sale of such meat. • The elimination of the unhealthy, energy intensive and cruel factory farming of livestock. • The abolition of all \"stealth taxes\" and other charges on household rubbish collections. • Develop alternative transport fuels such as bio-diesel and hydrogen. • Develop renewable energy sources such as off-shore wind farms, wave, tidal and solar energy. • Investigate the feasibility of cutting-edge, intrinsically-safe, fast-breeder nuclear stations. • Invest in a high-speed, magnetic levitation, inter-city rail network. On the surface, there are a few sensible and, what are now seen as, rather mainstream green polices in there. (Note the compassion afforded to the wellbeing of farm animals. Pity there isn't any left over to afford to the British citizens who the BNP deem as not being \"ethnically white\".) But you don't have to dig too far to see what forms much of the BNP's environmental thinking: Britain is one of the most densely populated countries in the world and our population is increasing — due entirely to immigration — which necessitates the building of ever more homes, which in turn places a strain on our infrastructure such as transport and water supplies. Independent environmental organisations believe that Britain's population needs to be significantly reduced. Our immigration policies will achieve this. Together with independent environmental organisations the BNP recognises that Britain's environmentally sustainable carrying capacity is substantially lower than its present population. Oh, yes. How could we possibly have forgotten about the role of immigration on the UK's environment, as opposed to, say, the excessive consumerism and rampant exploitation of natural resources that underpins the western lifestyle. On the issues of resource depletion and climate change, though, the BNP steers a more intriguing course: Oil and gas are finite resources, rapidly being depleted. Prices are going to continue to rise significantly and this will place a heavy burden on both industry and private consumers. Furthermore, as we are becoming increasingly dependent on energy from unstable and potentially unfriendly foreign powers we are becoming ever more vulnerable to economic blackmail or even harm. 'Peak Oil' is a clear and imminent danger to our economy and society, so Britain needs to invest in new technologies and be broadly self-sufficient in terms of energy. Finally, the BNP accepts that climate change, of whatever origin, is a threat to Britain. Current evidence suggests that some of it may be man-made; even if this is not the case, then the principle of 'better safe than sorry' applies and we should try to minimise the emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. Notice the careful dance around whether climate change can be pinned on the actions of mankind or not. It's a long way from the words of Nick Griffin back in June when he told Radio 5 Live's Nicky Campbell that \"global warming is a hoax...being exploited by the liberal elite as a means of taxing and controlling us and the real crisis is peak oil\". And yet Griffin hasn't changed his spots on climate change entirely, judging from this speech he gave in the EU parliament on Tuesday: The growing majority of ordinary people view climate change as an elite scam, an excuse to tax and control us and impose internationalist dogma and global government at the expense of the nation state. As Labour MEP Linda McAvan points out, the majority of the UK and European public actually view climate change as a \"fairly\" or \"very\" serious issue. Interestingly, his language on global government could have come straight from the mouth of climate change sceptic Christopher Monckton who last week said this December's climate talks in Copenhagen were the prelude to a \"communist world government.\" At least Griffin is being consistent with his views on peak oil. But pick apart the loaded use of the terms \"unfriendly foreign powers\" and \"self sufficient\" and you soon get the impression that the BNP's concern about peak oil is fuelled by little more than their desire to create Drawbridge Britain. If I was in that Question Time audience today and had the chance to put a question to the panel, I might be tempted to form a question around the subject of the environment. For example, who's to blame for our environmental crisis: \"us\" or \"them\"?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2009/apr/10/iran-nuclearpower1","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-04-11T16:00:00Z","webTitle":"David Lowry: With a few more olive branches and a bit less hypocrisy, there's a chance for progress on Iran's nuclear ambitions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/10/iran-nuclearpower1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/10/iran-nuclearpower1","fields":{"headline":"One big nuclear family","bodyText":"President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad celebrated \"National nuclear day\", as 9 April was dubbed by Iran's rulers, with a visit to Isfahan, where he announced that Iran's atomic scientists had mastered the manufacture of uranium fuel pellets for nuclear fuel. This comes at a propitoius time for Iran 's relations with the rest of the world. Barack Obama's conciliatory approach to Iran during his inauguration speech in January was followed by a further olive branch proferred last month. This followed so closely after Gordon Brown offered Iran an atomic bargain in his major speech on international nuclear co-operation at a conference organised by the foreign office in the middle of last month, some might think it was co-ordinated. The deal: aid with nuclear energy development in exchange for good non-proliferation behaviour. This atomic aid would go ahead notwithstanding the reality that Iran floats on a sea of oil and natural gas and has vast areas of desert in the south bathed in sunshine 365 days a year, making it blessed with massive solar energy potential. But France, which shares Brown's atomic ambition to spread nuclear power worldwide, got in first in nuclear collaboration with Iran. The official Iranian Atomic Energy Organisation (IAEO) is a 40% shareholder – with French state-owned nuclear conglomerate, Areva – in Sofidif, a uranium enrichment joint-venture company, the very technology that has made Iran such a pariah state in the global nuclear community. The arrangement dates back to 23 February 1974, and remains in place. Sofidif still retains a 25% share in Eurodif, the international uranium enrichment consortium that runs France's huge plant in Pierrelatte in the south of France. The IAEO drew a net income from dividends of some €7m in 2005, according to a report, The Permanent Nth Country Experiment: Nuclear Weapons Proliferation in a Rapidly Changing World (pdf), prepared by Paris-based researcher Mycle Schneider, for the Green Group in the European parliament in March 2007. France and the UK are both part of the so-called European Troika, along with Germany, negotiating with Iran over its nuclear programme. So with olive branch offers from Obama and Brown, and Sarkozy's national nuclear industry already in a corporate interlock with the Iranians with the very sensitive atomic technology that has raised so many diplomatic hackles, there now seems real opportunity for progress. If only there could be a little less hypocrisy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"help/2009/mar/16/how-to-use-guardian-observer-digital-editions","type":"article","sectionId":"help","sectionName":"Help","webPublicationDate":"2009-03-16T15:15:00Z","webTitle":"How to use the new Guardian and Observer digital editions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/help/2009/mar/16/how-to-use-guardian-observer-digital-editions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/help/2009/mar/16/how-to-use-guardian-observer-digital-editions","fields":{"headline":"How to use our new digital editions","bodyText":"Our digital editions are now powered by NewspaperDirect, but will continue to work broadly as before - you can browse through sections of the newspaper page by page, enlarge or print individual articles, and use search to locate pieces in the two-week archive.

His company, Synthetic Genomics Incorporated (SGI), will develop fuels that can be used by cars or aeroplanes without the need for any modification of their engines. Exxon Mobil will provide $600m over five years with half going to SGI. \"Meeting the world's growing energy demands will require a multitude of technologies and energy sources,\" said Emil Jacobs, vice president of research and development at ExxonMobil. \"We believe that biofuel produced by algae could be a meaningful part of the solution in the future if our efforts result in an economically viable, low-net carbon emission transportation fuel.\" Transport accounts for one-quarter of the UK's carbon emissions and is the fastest growing sector. Finding carbon-neutral fuels will be crucial to the government meeting its target to reduce overall emissions by 80% by 2050. Algae are an attractive way to harvest solar energy because they reproduce themselves, they can live in areas not useful for producing food and they do not need clean or even fresh water. In addition, they use far less space to grow than traditional biofuel crops such as corn or palm oil. \"Algae consumes carbon dioxide and sunlight in the presence of water, to make a kind of oil that has similar molecular structures to petroleum products we produce today,\" said Jacobs. \"That means it could be possible to convert it into gasoline and diesel in existing refineries, transport it through existing pipelines, and sell it to consumers from existing service stations.\" The Carbon Trust, a government-backed agency that promotes low-carbon technologies, has forecast that algae-based biofuels could replace more than 70bn litres of fossil fuels used every year around the world in road transport and aviation by 2030, equivalent to 12% of annual global jet fuel consumption or 6% of road transport diesel. In carbon terms, this equates to an annual saving of more than 160m tonnes of CO2 globally with a market value of more than £15bn. Ben Graziano, research and development manager at the Carbon Trust, said that alge-based biofuels offered the potential for \"major carbon savings\". \"Exxon Mobil is estimating that algae could yield just over 20,000 litres of fuel per hectare each year, which is in line with our own forecasts. However, producing biofuel from algae on such a massive commercial scale is a major challenge, which will require many years of research and development.\" Venter, who is best known for his role in sequencing the human genome, said the new partnership was the largest single investment in trying to produce biofuels from algae but said the challenge to creating a viable next-generation fuel was the ability to produce it in large volumes. \"This would not happen without the oil industry stepping up and taking part,\" he said. \"The challenges are not minor for any of us but we have the combined teams and scientific and engineering talents to give this the best chance of success.\" The research programme will begin with the construction of a new test facility in San Diego, where Venter says different techniques to grow and optimise algae will be tested. These will include open ponds as well as bioreactors, where the algae are grown in sealed tubes. \"We will be trying out these different approaches … using newly-discovered natural algae to test the best approaches we can come up with to go into a scale-up mode.\" Venter has spent several years trawling the world's oceans in search of environmentally-friendly microbes that could be used, in one way or another, to bring down the world's carbon emissions. The organisms he has found include those that can turn CO2 into methane, which could be used to make fuels from the exhaust gases of power stations, and another that turns coal into natural gas, speeding up a natural process and reducing both the energy needed to extract the fossil fuel and the amount of pollution caused when it is burned."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/apr/28/bp-solar-profits-slump","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-04-28T16:12:35Z","webTitle":"BP solar profits slump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/28/bp-solar-profits-slump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/apr/28/bp-solar-profits-slump","fields":{"headline":"BP solar profits slump","bodyText":"BP has reported a slump in sales of solar panels and falling profits at its alternative energy division. Overall, BP group profits fell by almost two-thirds in the first three months of the year compared with the same period last year. The company mainly blamed lower oil prices and higher taxes at its Russian subsidiary TNK-BP. Earlier this month the oil group said it was axing 620 jobs at its solar energy division in the US and Spain because of an oversupply of solar equipment in the market and the recession. The job cuts are equivalent to more than a quarter of the workforce. BP said today its solar sales during the quarter would generate 15MW of power, down from 34MW in the same period in 2008. BP said this reflected \"ongoing weak demand in the market\". Losses from the unit, which covers its alternative energy operations – also including wind farms and biofuels – totalled $800m (£547m). That compares with $193m of losses in the same period last year, although the unit now includes more overhead costs than it did before. Overall, BP reported profits today of $2.39bn (£1.64bn) in the first three months of this year, down from $6.23bn a year ago. It blamed the fall in the price of oil, which fluctuated between $35 and $50 a barrel during the quarter; a year ago a barrel cost more than $100. With profits also lower than in the last three months of 2008, when BP made $2.59bn, the company is now planning to spend less on finding and developing new oil and gas reserves. It warned it would spare less than $20bn for capital expenditure this year, down from an earlier target of $20bn-$22bn. The cut in spending could have long-term consequences for BP's growth. It is not clear which projects will be affected by the cutbacks, but environmentalists are likely to welcome them, given the controversy over projects such as BP's recent investment in oil sands in Canada. Shareholders will receive a dividend of 14 cents a share, the same as in the last quarter and nearly half a cent more than a year ago. Earlier this year, Shell angered environmentalists when it said it was scrapping investment in solar and wind power to focus on developing biofuels and carbon capture and storage. The former chief executive Lord Browne rebranded BP as \"Beyond Petroleum\" signalling that the group would seek to expand beyond fossil fuels. But the current chief executive Tony Hayward is thought not to share his predecessor's enthusiasm for renewables. BP's total wind capacity stands at 678MW, almost four times the amount it had built this time last year. A spokesman declined to comment on plans to build any more wind farms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/may/31/economics-eastern-germany-leipzig","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-05-30T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Ashley Seager looks for glimmers of hope amid exodus in eastern Germany","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/may/31/economics-eastern-germany-leipzig","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/may/31/economics-eastern-germany-leipzig","fields":{"headline":"Looking for glimmers of hope amid exodus","bodyText":"Erik Schmidt sighs as he serves up a huge portion of the traditional German dish known as Eisbein, or pig's knuckle, in a small village outside Leipzig, in eastern Germany. \"There used to be work for everyone round here, although the place was very dirty,\" he says. \"Now it's nice and clean since they shut the brown-coal mines, but there's no work any more and many people have moved away.\" Schmidt's view is typical of many people in the former East Germany ahead of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of the two countries this autumn, an event referred to as die Wende (the change) by most Germans. Ever since the then German chancellor, Helmut Kohl, insisted that East German marks be exchanged one-for-one for their west German equivalent, the former German Democratic Republic's industry was rendered uncompetitive and wilted instantly, rather than delivering the \"blossoming landscapes\" Kohl promised. In the following two decades, the process of shrinkage has continued despite massive fiscal transfers of more than €1 trillion from west to east. Well over a million people have now left east Germany and moved west, or abroad, in search of a job and a better life. Unemployment in the east remains stubbornly high, at around 15%, and each year another 50,000 people leave out of a population of less than 15 million. The region has an empty feel, with abandoned houses everywhere. Whole villages have ceased to exist. Even once great cities such as Dresden and Leipzig are struggling to regain their former composure, despite the fact that government funding has restored their centres. Leipzig is said to have 20,000 empty apartments and property prices, as well as rents, are incredibly low. Berlin has improved dramatically since the wall that divided it after 1961 was torn down in 1989. But even the residents of the former West Berlin are not always positive. \"Some things are better since the change and some are worse,\" says taxi driver Hans Gehmlich. \"The years immediately afterwards were the best economically, but the economy has not been great for many years and has got worse now. And the people are more stressed than they used to be, and ruder,\" he adds. But there are some pockets of hope for the former east of the country. Around Leipzig and Berlin are clusters of solar energy companies which have been among Germany's most successful new firms - at least until the present economic crisis hit. Firms such as Q-Cells - the world's largest maker of silicon-based photovoltaic cells - is expanding a new factory at Wolfen, just outside Leipzig, which was home to German film-making before the second world war. The likes of SolarWorld, Solon and Sulfurcell have sprung up around Berlin. German solar group Juwi recently announced it was building the country's largest photovoltaic plant on a former Soviet army base at Cottbus in the east. Meanwhile, all across the open plains of eastern Germany are thousands of wind turbines, providing up to 40% of the electricity of some of the eastern federal states. Cheap, empty, flat land is turning out to be ideal for covering in renewable energy farms. So the region has become the centre of Germany's rapidly growing green energy industry, and the authorities hope that in the future that will provide more job opportunities in a region starved of them. But there remains a long way to go before the exodus of people from states like Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is reversed - if it ever can be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2008/nov/27/1","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-11-27T11:21:41Z","webTitle":"Greenwatch: Vatican switches on to solar power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2008/nov/27/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2008/nov/27/1","fields":{"headline":"Greenwatch: Vatican switches on to solar power","bodyText":"Vatican unveils ambitious solar energy plans Source: Reuters The Vatican yesterday activated a new solar energy system and announced an ambitious plan that could one day make it an alternative energy exporter.

The event, dubbed the \"toughest footrace in the world\" is notable not only for its searing temperatures but for its location in one of Earth's most unhospitable environments. There could have been no more dramatic introduction to the vast potential of solar power. It was neither the incredible heat, nor the desolate expanses of scorched earth that had left the greatest impression. Rather, it was the fact that, in the middle of nowhere and without seeing a plug socket for days, a tiny solar panel was all it took to charge my MP3 player. I had been a keen environmentalist for some time, starting up a sustainable-living blog in 2004. Now though, I turned my attention to solar energy. Investigations led me to the first solar-powered rickshaws operating in India. Always keen to seek out original challenges, I meandered onto the idea of taking one on a long distance journey. To my dismay, the rickshaw was not suitable for covering such distance. But the idea of undertaking an adventure to demonstrate solar around the world had taken root. If I couldn't do it on a rickshaw I would do it in another environmentally-friendly way: by bicycle. I began to read about new flexible nanosolar panels, which would be ideal to power my technology in places far from a plug. In my research, I eventually found G24 Innovations, a Cardiff-based company specialising in dye-sensitised flexible thin-film solar technology. I gave them a call. \"Of course we can make solar panniers. We can attach the panels to almost any fabric.\" Really? Could I have a solar dress too? Sadly, the dress was deemed impractical but I convinced my friends Iain and Jamie to accompany me on this solar-powered journey. Today, starting in London on EU Solar Day, we set off for a 12,000-mile tour of solar power around the world. We are taking a satellite tracking device which, along with other communications equipment, will be powered using solar panels on our bike panniers. The independence of the solar kit will help us document the entire route - from Libyan sandstorms to ancient Iranian cities, 4000-metre passes in Kyrgyzstan to the lowest point of Death Valley - precisely and second by second. Our route has been chosen to take us through North Africa and the Middle East in order to visit a concentrated solar plant and profile the work of the Trans-Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation (TREC), a project to supply huge amounts of green energy from the Sahara. We'll go past the Quidam basin, where the world's biggest PV solar power station is being built, across the pacific by cargo ship (we are hoping to be carried by Nippon who have just launched the first solar-assisted freighter) and on to America's solar heartland, the Nevada desert. I hope the trip will demonstrate the potential of solar power in the run up to the Copenhagen climate summit this December.

During Ramadan, it is customary for most Arabic TV channels to show high-budget historical dramas focusing on some revered warrior such as Khaled ibn-al-Walid (known as the Sword of God) or medieval soap operas outlining the shenanigans of those cheeky Muslim caliphs and their concubines during the Abbasid caliphate in Baghdad or the Umayyad period in Andalucia. While rich in culture, history and characterisation, these works went over familiar ground and fostered an identity fixated on a charismatic past. It is understandable that in the absence of an Arab equivalent of a Neil Armstrong or Yuri Gagarin we must look for inspiring figures from the past, but this is part of a general malaise in a culture that harks back to the Golden Age when Arabs and Muslims were in the ascendancy, commanding an empire that stretched from India to Spain. The focus is on recapturing that, and not looking forward to a new modern incarnation. Add to this a sense of fatalism and helplessness inculcated by years of social and political stagnation and you have a recipe for suspended imagination; so little has changed in the Arab world over the past few decades that one could be forgiven for thinking that nothing ever will. Isaac Asimov once said that \"true science fiction could not really exist until people understood the rationalism of science and began to use it with respect in their stories\". As Khaled Diab highlighted recently in an article for Cif, there is a discernible suspicion of science in the region, particularly when it sits uncomfortably with faith. In terms of science fiction, the genre could be viewed as an extension of a \"foreign\" heritage with its roots in Darwinism – one at odds with a monotheist world view. Those that have managed to reconcile the two have attempted to, according to Islam Online, use science fiction as a da'wah (proselytising) tool. In one particular book the mathematical structure of the Quran and obscure religious scriptures help avert the disaster of a swelling sun, reinforcing that Islam is the \"ultimate revelation\". But this deprives science fiction of its inherently subversive potential; if there is a sense of despair and censorship, what better way to counter the former and circumvent the latter than engage in flights of fancy and imagination? To vicariously revolutionise and hope via a medium of fantasy? With Arab literature so focused on classical themes, an Orwellian allegory, for instance, would tackle the present and envision a future in a more clandestine fashion than a straightforward political attack. Sultana's Dream is an example of such critique. Written in 1905 by a Muslim feminist writer and social reformer who lived in British India, it is one of the earliest examples of feminist science fiction, and is a sort of gender-based Planet of the Apes where the roles are reversed and the men are locked away in a technologically advanced future. An indictment of the purdah system, it was much more than simplistic utopian thinking but a philosophically mature vision of a world where, following defeat in a crushing war, men succumbed to isolation in exhaustion and disillusionment with a world dominated by brute male force. It was also an extension of the author's frustration with the limitations imposed upon her by her own society. Another such vision is long overdue. So let's start with some forward-thinking paradigm-busting ourselves. I'll get the ball rolling: It is the year 2084 and an impoverished Saudi Arabia has run out of oil. After a period of reversion to decentralised Bedouin tribalism, a group of women has unlocked the secret to harnessing solar power and is winning back areas of the country by negotiating for land in exchange for solar energy, running their state in hippy-like communes. The US government attempts to strike a deal with the burgeoning female authority by offering protection and security, asking only for a pipeline of cheap energy in payment. When rejected, the US identifies embittered descendants of the Saudi ex-royal family and with their help, gives its support for a male counter-revolution in order to gain control of the new-found technology.

What he helpfully calls Giddens's Paradox runs thus: however massive the dangers posed by climate change, their lack of immediate visibility in daily life means many people will do nothing concrete to tackle it; by the time they are prompted to action it will, by definition, be too late. Other issues are semi-invisible to the naked eye but huge in their consequences. It has been apparent for years that our energy infrastructure needs renewal and yet, as we report today, business leaders warn that ministers are still not doing enough to ensure the UK does not run out of power. Today's energy strategy from the Confederation of British Industry is not averse to a plea for a subsidy here and a sop there. Ministers should approve new coal plants, it says, even without carbon capture and storage. One cannot blame business lobby groups for lobbying. Where the CBI certainly is right is in pointing out that renewing our energy infrastructure offers an important route to move the economy to a lower-carbon footing. After all, nearly 40% of Britain's carbon emissions come from electricity generation. Yet the credit crunch is having a particularly disastrous impact on the renewables industry, which is struggling to raise finance. Even big players are pulling in their horns. Last week BP announced that it is to cut 620 jobs from its solar energy business. The company's \"Beyond Petroleum\" slogan should be revised - \"Back to Petroleum\" would now be more appropriate. Markets do not ever do the long term especially well, but they get particularly myopic during a crisis. This poses a particular problem for Labour, which has long favoured a private led approach to both energy provision and to adapting to climate change. Worryingly, there was little sign of this altering at last week's G20 summit. True, there were the necessary warm words in the communique. But a summit that was supposed to define the terms on which the world economy is to be rebuilt has ducked the toughest challenge - how to reconcile prosperity with environmental security. The same is true of the fiscal stimulus being launched by so many countries. Much of the money is being burned trying to reheat the old, carbon-intensive economy. For every South Korea, which claims 81% of its stimulus is green, there is a Britain, at just 7%. That pathetic figure is half the world average. Amid a market crisis, the UK government is still failing to assume a leadership role. This must change - and soon. Taken to its logical conclusion, Giddens's Paradox does not point to a happy ending."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2009/apr/23/bosch-loss-warning","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-04-23T12:36:34Z","webTitle":"Bosch warns of losses despite cuts and closures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/23/bosch-loss-warning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/apr/23/bosch-loss-warning","fields":{"headline":"Bosch warns of losses despite cuts and closures","bodyText":"Bosch, the German engineering group, admitted today it could plunge into losses this year for the first time since 1945 as it issued a severe weather warning on sales and jobs. The maker of fridges, washing-machines and lawnmowers said it had made an operating loss in the first quarter as sales, primarily hit by the savage downturn in the global auto industry, fell by a quarter. Franz Fehrenbach, the chief executive, said annual sales could decline by 10-15% this year – and even more if the economy did not pick up or stabilise in the second half of 2009. \"We will probably incur losses throughout the year within a range of zero to minus 3%,\" he told reporters at the company's annual press conference. Last year the world's biggest car-component supplier saw pre-tax profits plummet from €3.8bn (£3.4bn) in 2007 to €940m, with sales, hurt by the strong euro, down 2.1% at €45.1bn. Operating earnings halved to €1.5bn as the recession gathered pace in the second half of 2008, especially the last three months. Bosch's profit warning came as eurozone industrial orders fell by a further 0.6% in March – bringing the annual decline to what Howard Archer of Global Insight called a \"staggering\" 34.5%. But the contraction, indicating that the area's economy shrank by more in the first quarter of 2009 than in the final quarter of 2008, was smaller than in previous months. Archer said the rate of contraction could be slowing, with the first signs that the downturn had finally reached the bottom. Fehrenbach said Bosch, majority-owned by a charitable trust, had \"grounded hope\" that the bottom had indeed been reached and the economy could level off in the second half of this year. He took issue with yesterday's forecasts from the IMF and the country's leading research institutes that the German economy would contract by as much as 5.6% this year, saying these were \"extremely negative\" and driven by unwarranted expectations that exports would fall by a quarter throughout the year. \"Our expectation is that world trade will revive and Germany, as an exporting nation, will of course benefit from this more than most,\" he added. Bosch, which employs 282,000 globally, has cut the working week for 26,000 German staff and applied to do the same for a further 32,000, with 35,000 also on short-time working outside its homeland. More than 3,000 have been made redundant overseas, including in Britain. Executives led by Fehrenbach indicated that, if the overall outlook deteriorates, there would be more job cuts, plant closures and even disposals of loss-making businesses. The group, which spent €3.2bn on acquisitions last year, including on a solar energy business, is slashing its M&amp;A budget this year to a bare minimum but Fehrenbach said it could still buy up companies, especially in the \"green technology\" fields. The group is counting on leading the way in what its chief executive calls \"ecological globalisation\" as the economy adjusts to a more sustainable growth path, with, for instance, organic solar cells used to coat a car's body to harvest power from the sun."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/may/01/government-failing-emissions-targets","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-05-01T10:36:56Z","webTitle":"UK government missing own carbon cut targets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/01/government-failing-emissions-targets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/may/01/government-failing-emissions-targets","fields":{"headline":"UK government missing own carbon cut targets","bodyText":"The government is not on track to meet targets to cut carbon emissions from its own departments, its sustainability watchdog warned today. A report from the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC) said departments had taken significant steps towards cutting emissions from road travel and reducing waste and water consumption. But the SDC said the government had reported a 6.3% decrease in carbon emissions from its offices since the year 1999-2000, an insufficient reduction for it to hit a target of 12.5% reductions by 2011-12. And it was not nearly enough to contribute to the legally binding national goal to cut emissions by 80% by 2050, the commission said. The annual Sustainable Development in Government report also said future targets for environmental performance by departments, to replace those that will shortly expire, must be \"set high\" to reflect the scale of the challenge ahead. A failure to cut carbon will force departments to buy carbon credits to cover their emissions, under new rules coming in next year to promote energy and carbon savings, the SDC said. But a £4bn investment in wind and solar energy generation on the government estate could slash emissions from offices by 68%, save on energy bills and boost the green technology and construction sectors. Last year, a new law requiring public buildings to display their energy use revealed that the head office of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) recorded an E-rating on a scale where A is best and G is worst. The newly created Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) was also shamed this year when it was revealed to be one of the least energy-efficient buildings in London. While the government remains on track to meet targets for levels of recycling and electricity from renewables, both fell last year, the report showed. And the amount of electricity used was on the rise, largely due to increased use of IT and the need for more air conditioning of server rooms. The SDC welcomed commitments in the budget to support the shift to low-carbon vehicles, but said the government's current travel arrangements allowed staff to claim mileage at rates above fuel costs, providing \"perverse\" incentives for car use. Instead they should be given incentives to use more sustainable forms of travel or travel less, it urged. The commission also said controls should be put on officials flying domestically and to European destinations where rail travel was an option. And there needed to be greater understanding of the full environmental impacts of government operations, for example developing \"water footprints\" and investigating the carbon footprint of supply chains of goods bought by departments. Rebecca Willis, the vice-chairwoman of the SDC, said: \"The government has taken some really significant steps making its own operations more sustainable. But it is still not on track to meet crucial targets, including reducing carbon emissions from offices.\" William Jordan, central government's chief sustainability officer, said: \"Significant progress has been made by the government in delivering on its commitment to deliver sustainable operations on the government's own estate.\" He said he looked forward to working with the SDC to address the issues raised in the report and said the government would be revising targets and commitments on sustainability this year to ensure they reflected \"leading practice\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
