The report, which contains data from 795 cities in 67 countries between 2008 and 2013, shows Indian cities have some of the highest concentrations of particulate pollution, which can cause fatal damage to the heart and lungs. According to the WHO, air pollution is currently the greatest environmental risk to public health and causes about 3 million premature deaths globally every year. Six Indian cities – Gwalior, Allahabad, Patna, Raipur, Ludhiana, and Delhi – rank among the most polluted cities in the world. The report suggests millions of people in India are at risk of serious cardiac and respiratory infections and diseases because of high pollution levels. Indian environmental activists condemned Narendra Modi’s government for inaction over pollution. Sunil Dahiya, a campaigner from Greenpeace India, said air pollution levels had spiked in recent years. “The government has to give up the fossil fuel-based energy and look for cleaner forms of energy, such as renewables,” he said. “Pollution levels have increased since the last WHO report in 2014, and the government must take it seriously. Right now, no one is really accountable for air pollution in the government. “They need to make a systematic, comprehensive, and time-bound plan on a national and regional level.” Anumita Roychowdhury of the Centre of Science and Environment, based in New Delhi, also believes environmental policy needs a thorough overhaul. “So far in India the air pollution action has been confined to driving,” she said, referring to a driving scheme implemented in Delhi that aims to reduce road traffic by alternating days on which vehicles with odd and even number plates could be on the roads. However, she argued that the report’s findings looked only at particulate pollution and neglected to mention ozone and nitrogen oxide pollution, indicators that would implicate richer countries. “It is not a holistic picture of pollution trends,” she said. Modi, the prime minister, has made some commitments to protecting the environment, such as announcing a $30m solar energy plan at the Paris climate summit and agreeing to meet Euro VI emission standards by 2020. However the pro-business, development-focused government’s commitment to green causes has been questioned. Activists from environmental organisations such as Greenpeace have been investigated by the government and have had their funds frozen; corporations have been given land and resources cheaply and, earlier this year, Modi himself attended the Hindu ascetic Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s Art of Living festival, which was heavily criticised for causing damage to the Yamuna river’s floodplains. Subhas Datta, an environmental activist, said Modi’s government was not alone and that successive Indian governments had failed to deliver on air pollution standards. “Our political leaders don’t know about the environment or realise the impact. They have a callous attitude to it,” he said. “Development should not have to mean destruction. It should be done in a sustainable way. Environmental activists have failed too, to bring this issue to light, and that’s why we’re facing this now. I have failed.” The Guardian contacted India’s environment ministry for a response to the latest report, but a press officer said he was unable to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2015/oct/12/indias-climate-smart-villages-use-technology-improve-farming","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-12T10:19:31Z","webTitle":"India's climate tech revolution is starting in its villages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/oct/12/indias-climate-smart-villages-use-technology-improve-farming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/oct/12/indias-climate-smart-villages-use-technology-improve-farming","fields":{"headline":"India's climate tech revolution is starting in its villages","bodyText":"Camels pulling wooden carts loaded with coconuts plod down the main road amid speeding motorcycles, buses, rickshaws and cars. Farmers sit atop slow-moving oxcarts loaded with grasses and other cattle feed. In this region of central Gujarat, India, it appears that rural life has not changed for decades. But drive down a dirt road outside the village of Thamna, about an hour north of Anand, and the 21st century comes into view. Solar panels drive a water pump that irrigates the fields of farmer Raman Bhai Parmar, 65, who grows bananas, rice and wheat on seven acres of land. Parmar’s solar energy pump is one of the technologies being promoted by a new project designed to help rural Indians adapt to climate change. The project, run by the international NGO, the Consultative Group for International Agriculture Research programme on climate change, agriculture and food security (CCAFS), aims to create 1,000 so-called climate smart villages across six Indian states including Haryana, Punjab and Gujarat. Haryana and Punjab are known as the grain basket states of India, producing the majority of the country’s staple wheat and basmati rice for export to the Middle East and European markets. The pumping of groundwater for irrigation over the past thirty years has led to a spike in productivity and increased food security. However, the region faces increases in temperature up to 5C by 2080 and wheat is particularly vulnerable to heat stress. A recent study by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute indicates that climate change may reduce wheat yields in India between 6% and 23% by 2050. Environmental problems such as depleting groundwater and variable rains – delayed monsoons and intense rainfall – limit yields. Indian farmers also typically use almost twice the amount of fertiliser needed, damaging soil, contaminating groundwater and adding to greenhouse gas emissions. For rural communities in Haryana and Punjab the issue now is how to meet these new challenges, introduce more sustainable practices of farming and still increase yields and profits. The pilot solar energy pump being used by Parmar is just one of the solutions promoted by the climate-smart villages project. In addition to energy, it provides a financial incentive for farmers to conserve water because they can sell energy back to the grid, thus helping to relieve stress on depleted aquifers. Last quarter Parmar, whose annual income from crops is roughly 65,000 rupees (£652), received a cheque for 7,500 rupees (£75) for producing solar energy. “When you connect the solar pump to the grid and let the farmer use the energy they need for the pumping, and you give them the chance to sell the surplus solar power to the grid at an attractive price, then they will opt to do it,” says Tushaar Shah, senior fellow at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) in Anand, which is working with CCAFS on the project. Shah says government subsidises had given farmers’ little incentive to limit their use of diesel-powered irrigation pumps. “The solar energy will give the farmers a crop that is worth up to 90,000 rupees (£900) a year. We think this will reverse the current incentive structure that has led to over-pumping. There are very few crops farmers grow that will give you that income,” he adds. Crucially, the climate-smart technologies, like the solar pump, are now beginning to gain acceptance among village communities. When Vikas Chaudhary, 34, of Taraori, Haryana, learned farming from his father, rains came predictably during the monsoon and agriculture was a safe bet. Groundwater was plentiful. Soils were rich. Now that’s all a gamble for Chaudhary, who farms 35 acres and grows rice and a small plot of maize in summer and wheat in winter to support his extended family of seven. Chaudhary has adopted climate-smart interventions including laser-guided land leveling of his fields, which he says has conserved 20% of water resources in his fields and has increased his yields by 15% through greater precision in seeding, tillage and measuring the moisture of soils. Chaudhary uses a handheld crop sensor called a Green Seeker to assess crop health, a mobile phone app helps him calculate how much fertiliser to apply throughout the growing season. He also avoids tilling his fields, which helps the soil retain moisture and leads to fewer costs and fewer greenhouse gas emissions. However, the cost of the machinery needed to plant the rotational crop amid stubble from the previous season is a barrier for small farmers, he says. Most prefer to plant on bare soil. While climate unpredictability has made farming more difficult in the past decade, Chaudhary’s greatest challenge was to change the thinking of his father, who lives on the farm and remains involved in the decisions. “He is now fully impressed by climate-smart practices, and my vision is to change thinking of every farmer, especially young farmers, and how we can make agriculture more profitable,” said Chaudhary.

On Tuesday, citizens will not exactly cast their ballots for the first female nominee of a major party or a real estate developer turned reality TV star, but for generally unknown candidates who are members of the electoral college: the people who will cast votes for president sometime in December. But when it comes to the really important issues – life, death, marijuana and condoms – direct democracy rules the day. There are more than 150 statewide measures on the ballot on 8 November, and scores more city- and countywide initiatives for voters to decide on. Here are some of the key issues that voters will address on election day. Marijuana We talk a lot about red states and blue states, but come Tuesday, the entire west coast could go green. California, Arizona and Nevada will vote on whether to join Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Alaska in legalizing recreational marijuana use. Maine and Massachusetts are also voting on recreational marijuana measures. Four other states will vote on whether to join the 25 states that have legalized medical marijuana. California, the world’s sixth-largest economy, is the real prize here. Analysts already put the size of the state’s legal marijuana market at $2.7bn and project it could grow to $6.4bn by 2020. Solar power and carbon tax Two key climate-related ballot measures with wildly different objectives will take place on the east and west coasts of the US on Tuesday. In Florida, a proposition called Amendment 1 would change the state’s constitution to restrict the ability of homeowners to sell electricity they create through rooftop solar panels to the grid. The measure, backed by Florida’s large utilities, has been attacked as “fundamentally dishonest” by green groups because it appears to be superficially pro-solar. Energy experts have predicted a severe downturn in Florida’s already struggling solar industry, should the measure pass. The idea of a national price on carbon was shot down early in Barack Obama’s presidency, but the state of Washington may follow a different path. A measure called I-732 calls for the establishment of the first carbon tax in the US, which would cost emitters $25 for each ton of carbon dioxide from 2018, rising gradually over the course of 40 years to $100 a ton. The revenue-neutral idea has, however, split the environmental movement, with some activists unhappy that it does not funnel money to clean energy projects. Slavery The 13th amendment of the US constitution abolished slavery – for the most part. As Ava DuVernay showed in her new documentary 13th, the ban on involuntary servitude does not apply to convicts. Colorado’s state constitution includes a ban on slavery that mirrors the federal language: “There shall never be in this state either slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.” Amendment T would remove that key exception. It’s a timely, if symbolic, measure that comes in a year that saw a prison strike spread across 22 states. Progressive experiments Bernie Sanders may have lost the Democratic nomination, but the spirit of his political revolution lives on – to an extent. In Colorado, proponents of a single-payer healthcare system gathered 100,000 signatures to place Amendment 69, dubbed “ColoradoCare”, on the ballot. The measure would create a $36bn health system to insure every resident of the state, paid for by a new 10% payroll tax. ColoradoCare would be designed to replace private health insurance. Opponents, including private medical providers such as Anthem and Kaiser, have spent more than $4m trying to defeat it. As with Sanders’ campaign, the liberal reforms have faced considerable opposition from mainstream Democratic politicians, in addition to the big business interests they challenge. Death penalty A quarter of United States’ death row prisoners are in California. On election day, voters will choose between executing them more quickly – or mandating that they die of other causes in prison. Two competing ballot measures will address the fate of the state’s 741 death row inmates. Proposition 62 would abolish the death penalty in the state and make life in prison without possibility of parole the maximum punishment for murder – a sentence that would be applied retroactively to current death row inmates. Proposition 66 would keep the death penalty, and speed up the notoriously slow appeals process. Going against the tide of the rest of the western world, Nebraska will vote on whether to reinstate the death penalty, which was repealed by the state legislature in 2015. Oklahoma is also voting on the death penalty – to reaffirm the state’s commitment to it. In 2015, the state’s attorney general suspended executions following a botched attempt at a lethal injection. State Question 776 would enshrine the state legislature’s power to carry out executions by any method “not prohibited by the United States constitution”. Minimum wage The series of work stoppages and protests known as the Fight for $15 movement set off a wave of minimum wage increases around the country – either through legislatures or ballot initiatives. The movement faces decisions on election day, when Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Washington will vote on whether to increase minimum wages above the $7.25 federal rate. An outlier is South Dakota, where voters will hold a referendum on whether to lower the minimum wage for workers under age 18. In November 2014, South Dakotans voted to increase the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.50, with an annual cost-of-living increase. State legislators then decided to pass a law taking away the wage increase for youth under 18. Opponents of the two-tiered system gathered signatures to place it on the ballot, and now voters will have another shot at addressing the question. Of course, everyone who votes on the minimum wage is eligible for the higher one. South Dakotans under the age of 18 will not have a say on the matter. Homelessness Homelessness is crisis in many west coast cities, and some are taking to the ballot to try to make a difference. Los Angeles is hoping to make a $1.2bn investment over 10 years in support of housing units and programs through the issuance of bonds. The measure will require a two-thirds super-majority to pass and is being supported by Mayor Eric Garcetti, who has called homelessness “the greatest moral crisis we face”. Meanwhile, San Francisco, a city that has long prided itself on being the progressive counterpart to LA’s Hollywood superficiality, has a ballot measure that would outlaw the tents that many homeless people sleep in. A group of tech billionaires and millionaires – venture capitalist Michael Moritz, angel investor Ron Conway, and hedge fund manager William Oberndorf – have each donated $49,999 to the anti-tent campaign. Though its backers refer to the proposition as “Housing not Tents”, the measure does not include any additional funding for housing or services. Miscellany California’s Proposition 60 would require pornography performers to wear condoms during film shoots. The proposal is broadly opposed by the performers themselves, who argue that industry testing protocols keep them safe and that a government mandate would push production underground – or into Nevada. Then there’s the movement to enshrine a constitutional right to hunt and fish. Since 1996, 18 states have amended their constitutions to elevate hunting and fishing to the level of life and liberty, as far as inalienable rights go. Indiana and Kansas hope to join their ranks this November, though many local editorial boards have advised otherwise. “No sentient human being can believe that the state of Indiana would actually ban hunting and fishing,” wrote the editorial board of the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette. The measures appear politically popular. Indiana’s right to hunt and fish amendment was endorsed by governor and vice-presidential candidate Mike Pence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/aug/09/dme-the-answer-to-australias-unquenchable-appetite-for-diesel","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-08T23:21:36Z","webTitle":"DME: the answer to Australia's unquenchable appetite for diesel?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/09/dme-the-answer-to-australias-unquenchable-appetite-for-diesel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/09/dme-the-answer-to-australias-unquenchable-appetite-for-diesel","fields":{"headline":"DME: the answer to Australia's unquenchable appetite for diesel?","bodyText":"As one of the world’s largest consumers of diesel per capita, Australia could soon benefit from the onshore production of a cleaner-burning alternative. Dimethyl ether (DME) is a colourless gas used as an aerosol propellant for things such as hairspray, but engine manufacturers and other companies have been exploring its potential as an alternative transport fuel. This is because DME is compatible with compression ignition engines, requiring only minor modifications. It mirrors the performance of diesel and, under the right conditions, has a much cleaner emissions profile, producing virtually no particulate matter or soot. Michael van Baarle, the managing director of Australian DME Fuels, which was established in 2015, says: “Any replacement of diesel oil by DME, particularly in heavy-duty vehicles, will result in a significant improvement in air quality.” The Brisbane-based company has plans to build Australia’s first commercial-scale production plant by 2020, generating a diesel-replacement fuel for use in trucks, heavy machinery, and remote off-grid power stations. The DME can also be blended with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for use in passenger vehicles. “If you make the methanol feedstock for DME renewably, then you essentially have an almost zero-emission fuel from a greenhouse gas perspective,” says van Baarle. There are other upsides: DME has similar storage and handling properties to LPG. This means it can be stored safely in gas bottles and distributed using existing LPG infrastructure. It also has a longer shelf-life than diesel, and poses no environmental contamination risks from spillage. Van Baarle hopes the onshore production of DME will help Australia end its reliance on diesel, particularly for transportation and off-grid power generation. In 2014/2015, Australia used more than 23.5bn litres of diesel, or just shy of 1,000 litres per person, according to information from the US Energy Information Administration. This places Australia among the world’s largest consumers of diesel per capita, he says. While compression ignition engines are efficient, burnt diesel produces greenhouse gases, noxious emissions, and particulate matter. These hazardous pollutants reduce air quality and can trigger respiratory problems. Even with sophisticated emissions control systems, many diesel engines are still emitting noxious pollutants above legal limits, and some cities are considering banning diesel vehicles altogether. Australian DME Fuels wants to produce DME from renewably generated methanol, which is considerably more expensive than using fossil fuel feedstocks. This means they need access to waste CO2 from industrial processes, and an ability to make hydrogen from the electrolysis of water – a power-intensive process that would require them to purchase wind or solar energy. This specific process for generating methanol has been demonstrated on a relatively small scale. A facility in Iceland has generated about 4,000 tonnes a year, says van Baarle. Australian DME Fuels plans to produce 12 times that amount. “We believe that the next scale-up of this technology to commercial quantities of 50,000 tonnes per annum can be achieved in Australia,” he says. This translates to about 48.5m litres of DME, which is roughly equivalent to 26m litres of diesel from an energy output standpoint. With on-site hydrogen production capabilities, he estimates the plant will cost between $200m and $300m to build. The company is exploring funding strategies, including support from bodiessuch as the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. Van Baarle says the company is also developing a “network of strategic partners” including engine manufacturers, LPG distributors, methanol producers, and renewable power generators. “We have some of those people already in place,” he says. But cost is still a red flag. Renewable DME could be upwards of three times more expensive per gigajoule than diesel (currently $15/gigajoule), or DME produced with non-renewable methanol ($17/gigajoule). Van Baarle says his company could offset that cost by selling bulk, renewably produced methanol. He’s also hopeful that downward trends in the cost of solar power will make it more affordable. One of the key challenges to establishing a domestic market for DME is co-ordinating the deployment of modified compression ignition, or diesel engines. Jim Patel is a research scientist at the CSIRO who has been leading an Australia-India Strategic Research Fund project investigating the small scale production of DME. “DME is often referred to as a chicken-and-egg problem,” he says. “There is little incentive to develop applications for DME when it isn’t widely available and while there are no applications, there is little incentive to supply,” he says. Patel says the main challenge for producing renewable DME from CO2 will be the economics of buying renewable power to make hydrogen and sourcing enough CO2 feedstock. He suggests it might be more affordable to initially produce a proportion of DME from renewable sources and gradually increase this. Patel says there are positive signs DME could be gaining traction internationally. Volvo has begun developing DME-powered engines for heavy trucks in North America and its subsidiary, Mack, is running a demonstration with municipal sanitation trucks in New York City. Last year Ford Motor Company began working with the German government to develop and test the world’s first production passenger car to run on DME. “Due to its potential for reduced particulate emissions, DME should be amongst the alternative fuels under consideration for use in Australia,” says Patel."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"society/2016/mar/29/local-currency-schemes-and-community-energy-not-just-for-middle-classes","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-29T13:00:38Z","webTitle":"Local currency schemes and community energy aren’t just for the middle classes | David Boyle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/29/local-currency-schemes-and-community-energy-not-just-for-middle-classes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2016/mar/29/local-currency-schemes-and-community-energy-not-just-for-middle-classes","fields":{"headline":"Local currency schemes and community energy aren’t just for the middle classes","bodyText":"There appears to be a new division emerging in UK cities as they take their first steps towards devolution, with Manchester’s devo agreement coming into effect this week. The traditional right, left and centre politicians are still there, but there may be a more fundamental disagreement between those who want to wait, patiently or impatiently, before they clutch the reins of government and launch a regeneration programme to kickstart the economies of our cities, and those who want to get on and do something themselves. The trouble is that policymakers don’t see this entrepreneurial upsurge because they don’t value it or measure it. They also don’t tell stories about it, and stories are the tools of the political trade – it is how politicians think, take decisions and communicate.That’s why the Barrow Cadbury Trust funded Prosperity Parade, a book about successful local entrepreneurs who have devised schemes from local currencies to food markets or invested in solar energy to cut costs. But isn’t there a problem with these small-scale, well-meaning schemes – that they are only ever available to the middle classes? What about everyone else? The answer is that this economic revolution is in its earliest stages, and particularly those bits which require public services to be more entrepreneurial. Preston council, for example, is one of the few local authorities to investigate where the money it spends goes, and to see if it can go further by supporting the local economy and increasing choice. The Right Care, Right Here partnership between the NHS and local councils in Birmingham and Sandwell is designing a hospital that spreads economic health by training and recruiting locally, and setting up small suppliers, as part of the business of treating ill-health. There is a lesson here about using local procurement to revitalise local economies: not the big technical items or the small bulk items, but those in between. And a large group of local employers is beginning to work together and use one another’s services, as organised by the Digbeth Social Enterprise Quarter in Birmingham. Digging out the stories for Prosperity Parade has taught me that enterprise is going to be increasingly important. But it will need the institutions that provide support or finance for schemes to expand – such as Wessex Community Assets, helping new low-cost housing in the west country, or Mongoose Energy, which began in Bath and now supports community energy all over the country, or Bristol council, which allows the city residents to pay council tax in Bristol pounds. Experiments in local enterprise have only just begun in order to fill the gap in the devolution agreements about how to devolve economic power. What happens if one city began doing them all together? Might they begin to claw back some control over their own prosperity? Or do they really have to wait patiently for the Chinese investors or the government programmes that never arrive?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2014/nov/11/solar-panel-recycling-silicon-valley-toxics-ranking","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-11T13:00:02Z","webTitle":"Drawing back the panel: what a solar energy ranking system looks like","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/11/solar-panel-recycling-silicon-valley-toxics-ranking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/11/solar-panel-recycling-silicon-valley-toxics-ranking","fields":{"headline":"Drawing back the panel: which solar companies are most (and least) sustainable?","bodyText":"As more solar electricity lights up homes and businesses across the country, it also spotlights a growing, thorny issue: how do you recycle discarded solar panels safely? And should solar companies follow a set of sustainable practices similar to those in the electronics industry? That debate could grow louder with the release of the latest Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) “solar scorecard” Tuesday. The scorecard, based on survey responses and publicly available information, ranks 37 solar manufacturers’ actions and commitments to practices such as reporting emissions, using water and energy efficiently, avoiding the use of conflict materials and promoting workers’ health and safety. For companies that also develop and build solar power plants, the coalition looks at how they incorporate wildlife conservation into their projects. “When the cleantech movement started, the solar industry had a lot of the similar environmental impacts as the microelectronics industry that the SVTC had looked into,” said Sheila Davis, executive director of the coalition. “We wanted to ensure that the solar industry is clean.” The No 1 spot goes to Trina Solar, a Chinese company that received 92 out of 100 points. SunPower, based in Silicon Valley, grabbed the second spot with 88 points, followed by Yingli Green Energy (81), also a Chinese company. Germany-based SolarWorld (73) and REC (71), from Norway, complete the top five listings. Eight companies, which include Suniva, Andalay Solar, Jinko Solar and Hyandai, scored below 10. The 2014 scorecard is the fifth by the coalition, a nonprofit that works with investors who see sustainability as a criterion for deciding which companies to put their money in. The solar industry has grown quickly. The US market is expected to install 6.5 gigawatts of solar panels in 2014, which would be 6.5 times the installations in 2000, according to GTM Research. Globally, the solar market is set to build 50 gigawatts of solar panels, according to SolarBuzz. The 19.5 gigawatts that will likely be added in the fourth quarter alone would exceed what was installed in all of 2010. “The scorecard is helpful for giving investors an independent view of the industry,” said Steven Heim, managing director and the director of environmental social governance research at Boston Common Asset Management. “We can then see if it raises questions or highlights companies that we might consider.” Boston Common helps the coalition by sending out a letter – accompanying the survey – to urge company participation. It’s also the public face of the more than 25 institutional investors in North America and Europe that signed the letter. The investors collectively manage $1.6tn worth of assets, Heim said. A solar panel is made up of solar cells and electronics for transporting the electricity produced. The most common material for solar cells is silicon, the same ingredient that’s in the chips that run computers and cell phones. The processes of turning silicon into cells involve the use of many gases, chemicals and metals and leave behind toxic wastes that pose health hazards for workers and the environment. The coalition began to take interest in the solar industry’s environmental management after seeing the emergence of many silicon processing plants in late 2000s to meet the fast-growing demand. Many of these plants rose up in China, which also was home to manufacturers who went on to become the top solar cell and panel makers in the world and held initial public offerings on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. One of the high-profiled incidents of environmental mismanagement involved Jinko Solar and its discharge of toxic waste from its facility in China’s Zhejiang province into a river. The 2011 incident sparked a three-day protest from the villagers upset over the large number of dead fish in the river, brought out riot police and prompted the company to suspend its operation there. Jinko said it unintentionally discharged “a small amount of solid waste” into the river and attributed heavy rains for causing a spill from waste containers outside of its warehouse. The 37 companies on the 2014 scorecard represent about 75% of the manufacturing sector, the coalition said. Only seven manufacturers, which account for 25% of the sector, filled out the survey. The coalition then gathered more data from public records, such as company websites, regulatory filings and news stories. The survey response rate dropped from 34.6% in 2012 and 51.1% in 2012, reflecting in part of the high number of manufacturers that shrank significantly or went out of business in the past few years because supply exceeded demand. Some low-scoring companies didn’t want to talk about the scorecard. A few explained why they didn’t respond to surveys. Hanwha SolarOne said in a statement that the company didn’t have time to respond to the survey and the score, 10 out of 100, “in no way an accurate measure of the sustainability of HSOL’s business”. Andalay Solar, a penny stock, has been outsourcing the manufacturing work and struggling to survive, and that explains why it didn’t reply to the survey, said Wei-Tai Kwok, chief operating officer at Silicon Valley-based Andalay. The company is changing its business model to move away from selling solar panels and will focus on licensing its mounting system that props up solar panels instead. Canadian Solar, which has a score of 14, said in a statement that the coalition was demanding too many details about the company’s business practices. The company said it refused to respond to the survey and contended that the score is inaccurate because the coalition “penalizes companies that did not participate in the SVTC survey”. “To conclude, if the SVTC does not change their communication and ranking practices, we may seek legal action,” said the statement from Canadian Solar. Davis said Canadian Solar’s statement is “unusual” and the information sought by the coalition is something that that would usually be included in a corporate social responsibility report. “We’ve aggressively outreached to companies because we want solar companies to do well and for the solar industry to be an environmental leader,” Davis said. The scoring weighted issues such as solar panel recycling, worker safety and emissions reporting. Recycling is a critical issue, according to the coalition, which would like to see the US solar industry fund a program that collects used panels for proper recycling. The coalition is hoping that the Solar Energy Industries Association will take the lead in developing the recycling program and pressing its members to plan for and report their sustainable practices. The association seems slow in tackling the issue of recycling, let alone setting up a program, Davis said. “We were told that they were going to release a report last year and [were] looking into the issue,” Davis said. “Up to this point we haven’t seen any action from them.” The trade group said it is working on figuring out “the best next step for the industry on recycling.” said John Smirnow, vice presient of trade and competitiveness at the association. The association is looking at ways to provide incentives for building and running recycling centers and is keeping a close watch on California, which will likely be the first in the country with solar-specific recycling regulation, Smirnow said. Smirnow said the trade group understands the need for its members to take sustainability issues seriously and launched the “Solar Industry Commitment and Environmental and Social Responsibility” in 2013. The document includes some broad sustainability issues that its signatories promise to address, such as reducing energy use, creating safe working environment and disposing of hazardous materials and other wastes properly. Over two dozen companies have signed the document, including big-name manufacturers, such as Trina, Yingli and SunPower, Smirnow said. After five years of ranking top global solar companies, the coalition now plans to create a sustainability standard – as well as a registry aimed at influencing the purchase decisions of solar energy equipment buyers, from installers to power plant developers – and convince solar companies to follow it. The coalition is working with the Green Electronics Council to create the standard and registry, and is hoping to enlist solar companies as well. The Green Electronics Council runs a registry on electronics manufacturing. “We have been encouraged by some of the companies that want to show that they are doing above and beyond what the regulations say,” said Dustin Mulvaney, the coalition’s science advisor and an assistant professor of environmental studies at San Jose State University. “I have a lot of faith in the solar industry.” The technology and innovation hub is funded by BT.

It was intended to be a zero-carbon, zero-waste city, with smart technology embedded across all the city’s functions. A decade on and ambitions have cooled. The completion date has moved from 2016 to 2030 and city authorities have said it won’t achieve the original aim of being a net zero-emissions city. In South Korea, the purpose-built city of Songdo was built on land reclaimed from the Yellow Sea. It is an “aerotropolis”– where an airport, in this case Incheon, is the anchor for a city rather than vice versa. Planned as “the world’s smartest city”, it has sensors embedded into everything from waste management systems to roads, tracking citizens by measuring consumption, emissions and other activities. Yet the tech-driven city remains under-populated and unfinished. While these cities may not have lived up to their original promise, new, smaller scale projects, spearheaded by private companies are aiming to act as laboratories for smart city planning. The American aerotropolis In a 400-acre space just outside Denver International Airport, Japanese tech giant Panasonic has taken a lead role in the development of a US aerotropolis, Peña Station NEXT. The commercial and residential project is influenced by a Japanese smart city that Panasonic teams have spent the better part of the past decade creating. Fujisawa Sustainable Smart Town is a 45-acre community of 1,600 homes, around 30 miles outside Tokyo, which opened its doors in 2014. “We’re taking the genesis of Fujisawa and adapting that to Peña Station in an American way,” says George Karayannis, vice-president of Panasonic’s CityNow. The American way means less emphasis on security through video surveillance and facial-recognition technology, for instance. And while Fujisawa is residential, Peña Station is a commercial hub, connected to Denver mayor Michael Hancock’s vision of the city’s airport as an aerotropolis, and Panasonic is starting with the commercial and travel aspects of the future community. As the last pre-airport stop on the new 22-mile light-rail line that connects central Denver with the airport, the company beckons travellers with an 800-spot parking garage that also hosts a 1.3-megawatt solar array. Panasonic is also at work on its own office building in Peña Station, which should open in September with space for 300 employees. Next in line is the development of a 219-unit apartment building, a hotel and several restaurants. Peña Station is built on the smart infrastructure technologies that figure into smart city projects the world over – fast internet, a microgrid with battery storage for all that solar energy, kiosks and smart displays, smart street lighting, smart parking, autonomous electric shuttles and more. The community run on solar Nearly 2,000 miles south-east of Denver in south-west Florida, Babcock Ranch, perched on the edge of a nature preserve, is being billed as America’s first solar community. It eventually aims to be a city of roughly 50,000 people living in an area the size of Manhattan. Built on a former cattle ranch and current wildlife corridor, and spearheaded by private developer Kitson &amp; Partners, it hopes to be a model of how to build a hi-tech, low-carbon development. A coalition of government, environmentalists and Kitson purchased the property in 2006, designating 74,000 acres of land for conservation and another 17,000 acres for development. Construction started on phase one of the planned 25-year project late last year and the first residents are scheduled to move in from January 2017. Since 2010, Kitson has partnered with IBM to design and develop the technology aspects of the city, which include gigabit-speed internet connectivity and a shared fleet of autonomous electric vehicles. The city will host microgrids throughout the community, and – perhaps the most high-profile aspect – a huge 75-megawatt solar farm being installed by Florida Power &amp; Light. That array will be enough to meet the town’s entire needs during the day, although the city will be powered by an existing, natural gas-fired power plant at night. Kitson, and the developers who will build the homes in each neighbourhood, will also offer home solar facilities as an option for every buyer. As energy storage technology continues to improve, it is hoped that demand on the power plant will dwindle as Babcock Ranch grows. There is no shortage of challenges to planning and developing a tech-reliant city along a 25-year timeline, especially as the landscape of available technologies is changing on a near-daily basis. “The cornerstone of a successful development is the ability to be flexible,” Kitson says. “You have to be able to change to meet people’s [changing] demands.” Limitations to smart cities While smart city projects - such as Songdo and Masdar - have in the past over-promised and been over-hyped, it may be that smaller projects such as Babcock Ranch and Peña Station – built from the ground up with future residents in mind – represent the future of smart city development. “We’re not trying to create a utopia,” Kitson says. “It’s the opposite of that. We’re trying to offer people the ability to live their lives the way they want to.” But one lesson from the world of urban planning remains true, says Jennifer Henaghan, manager of the Green Communities Center at the American Planning Association – collaboration and consensus are what makes a new city development able to stand the test of time. “You’re seeing with these communities that they’re developing partnerships with tech companies, utilities and the state so that there are other stakeholders who’ll be there, involved long after groundbreaking to support and maintain those relationships and that development,” she says."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2016/may/05/greens-want-12m-households-to-install-renewable-energy-storage","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-04T20:04:49Z","webTitle":"Greens' want 1.2m households to install renewable energy storage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/05/greens-want-12m-households-to-install-renewable-energy-storage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/may/05/greens-want-12m-households-to-install-renewable-energy-storage","fields":{"headline":"Greens' want 1.2m households to install renewable energy storage","bodyText":"The Greens want millions of households to install renewable energy storage units, saying battery storage could “revolutionise” Australia’s energy system. They have announced a five-year support package for 1.2m homes and 30,000 businesses, to encourage the take-up of solar storage across Australia. The Greens say the program - estimated to cost $2.9b - could be funded by scrapping concessions to fossil fuel-intensive industries, and are promising to make the policy central to their post-budget and post-election negotiations with the Coalition and Labor. “We’ll be opposing most of this budget, which grows inequality and does nothing for clean energy, but if the government comes to us to talk about some of their less-offensive measures, we’ll want to talk to them about programs like this one,” the Greens energy spokesman, Adam Bandt, told Guardian Australia. “Now is the time to jumpstart the battery industry, encourage the take up of storage and help make Australia a renewable energy leader.” The Greens’ battery storage program - announced two days after the Turnbull government’s first budget - would run for five years, starting from 2016-17. It is part of their plan to shift Australia to 90% renewables by 2030. It includes a 50% refundable tax credit for individuals to help them install solar energy storage systems. Individuals would get up to half the cost of their storage system covered, up to a maximum of $5,000 in the first year of the program. The credit would then taper off to $1,500 by 2021, reflecting the projected decline in battery storage costs over five years. A separate grant scheme would also be available for people on low incomes. It would be available in addition to the refundable tax credit, for households with taxable income of less than $80,000. The low income grants would be capped at $5,000, and would decline to $1,000 by 2021. The number of grants would be capped at 20,000 each year. They say the household policy is estimated by the Parliamentary Budget Office to cost $2.8b over four years, supporting 1.2m homes with an average storage capacity of 10 KWh. For businesses, the Greens want to allow battery storage installations to be depreciated for tax purposes over three years - rather than the current 15 years - to drive the take-up of renewable energy storage. They say 30,000 units could be installed by businesses for $38m, over four years. The household and business programs could be funded by scrapping accelerated asset depreciation for aircraft and the oil and gas industry, they say. According to the PBO, the removal of accelerated depreciation would save $2.75bn over four years. The Greens say their program would only be necessary for five years, since the costs of battery storage are predicted to decrease rapidly over the next decade. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, on Wednesday criticised the Turnbull government’s budget for doing nothing to help Australia become a renewable energy powerhouse. “There are small businesses right around Australia who will be so disappointed that the prime minister has ignored the transition to the clean-energy economy,” Di Natale said. “We’re talking about solar installers, mums and dads who have set up small businesses to engage in the installation of solar panels around the country. “They don’t get a benefit because the prime minister refuses to accept that this is a part of the economy that needs to grow, that can grow, that can create jobs and investment.” The Turnbull government has confirmed it will retain the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, with plans to refocus part of their activities towards the government’s innovation agenda. The budget papers show $1b of the CEFC’s existing funding will be used to establish a clean energy innovation fund, to provide debt and equity financing to help emerging clean energy technologies “make the leap from demonstration to commercial deployment”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2016/jan/31/aberdeen-should-go-green-not-back-to-black-oil","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-31T11:18:56Z","webTitle":"Aberdeen should go green, not back to black","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/31/aberdeen-should-go-green-not-back-to-black-oil","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/jan/31/aberdeen-should-go-green-not-back-to-black-oil","fields":{"headline":"Aberdeen should go green, not back to black","bodyText":"That the government should step in with £250m to help ailing Aberdeen, the centre of Britain’s oil and gas industry, seems right given the billions in tax revenues ministers have extracted from the North Sea over several decades. And though it might seem counterintuitive to come to the rescue of a city built on fossil fuels – given the threat of global warming – it also makes sense for Britain to keep producing its own oil and gas until it can find ways of doing without them. But the reality is that the £250m “city deal” from David Cameron, topped up with £254m from the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon – will do little to stem the crisis that has left oil workers in the city using food banks. Around 70,000 redundancies have already been made across the British oil and gas industry, and more will follow, given that the price of oil has fallen from $115 a barrel to $30 in a little more than 18 months. North Sea exploration and development drilling has dropped to a trickle, leaving rigs and other equipment laid up or moved elsewhere. The danger is that the North Sea becomes the Dead Sea, with business not returning even though there is plenty of oil and gas still under the waves. Some of the government cash will be used to find ways to extract small reserves profitably, before platforms and pipelines are abandoned. The oil price collapse has thrown Aberdeen into turmoil, but its decline has long been in sight. Ministers should have made the North Sea’s twilight years productive but transitional. A lot will depend on tax rates, which are already being cut. International companies make up the bulk of the North Sea operators, and they will stick around only if it is worth their while. This inevitably sticks in the craw of environmentalists, who see ministers rushing to the aid of Big Oil while slashing support for wind and solar energy, as well as ending carbon capture and storage projects. Ultimately the future of Britain’s energy should be green, not black. We need to find a new Aberdeen where low-carbon technologies are celebrated – and financed properly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2017/jul/30/al-gore-interview-our-crumbling-planet-the-rich-have-subverted-all-reason-al-gore","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-29T23:05:03Z","webTitle":"Al Gore: 'The rich have subverted all reason'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/30/al-gore-interview-our-crumbling-planet-the-rich-have-subverted-all-reason-al-gore","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2017/jul/30/al-gore-interview-our-crumbling-planet-the-rich-have-subverted-all-reason-al-gore","fields":{"headline":"Al Gore: 'The rich have subverted all reason'","bodyText":"In the ballroom of a conference centre in Denver, Colorado, 972 people from 42 countries have come together to talk about climate change. It is March 2017, six weeks since Trump’s inauguration; eight weeks before Trump will announce to the world that he is withdrawing America from the Paris Climate Agreement. These are the early dark days of the new America and yet, in the conference centre, the crowd is upbeat. They’ve all paid out of their own pockets to travel to Denver. They have taken time off work. And they are here, in the presence of their master, Al Gore. Because Al Gore is to climate change… well, what Donald Trump is to climate change denial. It’s 10 years since the reason for this, the documentary An Inconvenient Truth, was released into cinemas. It was an improbable project on almost every level: a film about what was then practically a non-subject, starring the man best known for not winning the 2000 US election, its beating heart and the engine of its narrative drive a PowerPoint presentation. When the filmmakers approached him, he explains to the room, “I thought they were nuts. A movie of a slideshow, delivered by Al Gore, what doesn’t scream blockbuster about it?” Except it was a blockbuster. In documentary terms, anyway. The careful accretion of facts and figures genuinely shocked people. And it’s a measure of the impact it had, and still continues to have, that Gore delivers this vignette to a rapt crowd who, over the course of three days, are learning how to be “Climate Reality Leaders”. It’s the reason why we are all here – his foundation, the Climate Reality Project, an initiative that grew out of the film, provides intensive training in talking about climate change, combating climate change denial – and the tone might be described as “activist upbeat”. This is a crisis that is solvable, we’re told. Trump is just another hitch, another hurdle to overcome. And it will be overcome. Only occasionally does a sliver of despair leak around the edges. You have to stay positive, a man called David Ellenberger tells the audience. Though sometimes, he admits: “There’s not enough Prozac to get through the day.” It’s almost a relief to hear someone acknowledge this. Because before there was “FAKE NEWS!!!” and the “FAILING New York Times!” Trump was tweeting about “GLOBAL WARMING hoaxsters!” and “GLOBAL WARMING bullshit!” The war on the mainstream media may capture the headlines currently, but the war on climate change science has been in play for years. And it’s this that is one of the most fascinating aspects of Gore’s new film, An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power. Because if the US had a subtitle at the moment, it might be that, too, and the struggle to overcome fake facts and false narratives funded by corporate interests and politically motivated billionaires is one that Gore has been at the frontline of for more than a decade. The film runs through a host of facts – that 14 of the 15 hottest years on record have occurred since 2001 is just one. And the accompanying footage is biblical, terrifying: tornadoes, floods, “rain bombs”, exploding glaciers. We see roads falling into rivers and fish swimming through the streets of Miami. The nightly news, Gore says, has become “a nature hike through the Book of Revelations”. But what his work has shown and continues to show is that evidence is not enough. The film opens with clips from Fox News ridiculing global warming. In recent weeks, the New York Times has started describing the Trump administration as waging a “war on science”, a full-on assault against evidence-based science that runs in parallel with his attacks on evidence-based reporting. And Gore is in something of a unique position to understand this. What becomes clear over the course of several conversations is how entwined he believes it all is – climate change denial, the interests of big capital, “dark money”, billionaire political funders, the ascendancy of Trump and what he calls (he’s written a book on it) “the assault against reason”. They are all pieces of the same puzzle; a puzzle that Gore has been tracking for years, because it turns out that climate change denial was the canary in the coal mine. “In order to fix the climate crisis, we need to first fix the government crisis,” he says. “Big money has so much influence now.” And he says a phrase that is as dramatic as it is multilayered: “Our democracy has been hacked.” It’s something I hear him repeat – to the audience in the ballroom, in a room backstage, a few weeks later in London, and finally on the phone earlier this month. What do you mean by it exactly? “I mean that those with access to large amounts of money and raw power,” says Gore, “have been able to subvert all reason and fact in collective decision making. The Koch brothers are the largest funders of climate change denial. And ExxonMobil claims it has stopped, but it really hasn’t. It has given a quarter of a billion dollars in donations to climate denial groups. It’s clear they are trying to cripple our ability to respond to this existential threat.” One of Trump’s first acts after his inauguration was to remove all mentions of climate change from federal websites. More overlooked is that one of Theresa May’s first actions on becoming prime minister – within 24 hours of taking office – was to close the Department for Energy and Climate Change; subsequently donations from oil and gas companies to the Conservative party continued to roll in. And what is increasingly apparent is that the same think tanks that operate in the States are also at work in Britain, and climate change denial operates as a bridgehead: uniting the right and providing an entry route for other tenets of Alt-Right belief. And, it’s this network of power that Gore has had to try to understand, in order to find a way to combat it. “In Tennessee we have an expression: ‘If you see a turtle on top of a fence post, you can be pretty sure it didn’t get there by itself.’ And if you see these levels of climate denial, you can be pretty sure it didn’t just spread itself. The large carbon polluters have spent between $1bn and $2bn spreading false doubt. Do you know the book, Merchants of Doubt? It documents how the tobacco industry discredited the consensus on cigarette smoking and cancer by creating doubt, and shows how it’s linked to the climate denial movement. They hired many of the same PR firms and some of the same think tanks. And, in fact, some of those who work on climate change denial actually still dispute the links between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.” The big change between our first conversation in Denver and our last, on the phone this month, is the news that Gore had been desperately hoping wouldn’t happen: Trump’s announcement on 1 June that he was pulling America out of the Paris Agreement. The negotiations in Paris are right at the heart of the new film, its emotional centre, and when I watch it in March, the ending still sees Gore expressing guarded optimism. So, what happened? “I was wrong,” he says on the phone from Australia, where he’s been promoting the film. “Based on what he told me, I definitely thought there was a better than even chance he might choose to stay in. But I was wrong. I was fearful that other countries for whom it was a close call would follow his lead, but I’m thrilled the reaction has been exactly the opposite. The other 19 members of the G20 have reiterated that Paris is irreversible. And governors and mayors all over the country have been saying we are all still in and, in fact, it’s just going to make us redouble our commitments.” The film had to be recut, the ending changed, the gloves are now off. What changed Trump’s mind? “I think Steve Bannon and his crowd put a big push on Trump and convinced him that he needed to give this to his base supporters. He had blood in his eyes.” It’s instructive because Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, is also the ideologue behind Trump’s assault on the media. And Bannon’s understanding of the news and information space, and efforts to manipulate it via Breitbart News and Cambridge Analytica, both funded by another key climate change denier, Robert Mercer, are at the heart of the Trump agenda. And what becomes clear if you Google “climate change” is how effective the right has been in owning the subject. YouTube’s results are dominated by nothing but climate change denial videos. This isn’t news for Gore. He has multiple high-level links to Silicon Valley. He’s on the board of Apple and used to be an adviser for Google. “We are fully aware of the problem,” he says with what sounds like resigned understatement. Gore has had more than a decade fighting climate change denial, and in some respects, the problem has simply worsened and deepened. “On the other hand, two-thirds of the American people are convinced that it’s an extremely serious crisis and we have to take it on,” he says. “And there is a law of physics that every action produces an equal and opposite reaction. And I do think there is a reaction to the Trump/Brexit/Alt-Right populist authoritarianism around the world. People who took liberal democracy more or less for granted are now awakening to a sense that it can only be defended by the people themselves.” And it’s in this, his belief in social progress against all odds, that he takes his lead from the civil rights movement. The cut of the film I see compares the climate change movement to the other great social movements that eventually won out: the abolition of slavery, women’s suffrage, civil rights. Something profound and disturbing is happening right now, though, he admits. “The information system is in such a chaotic transition and people are deluged with so much noise that it gives an opening for Trump and his forces to wage war against facts and reason.” Is it, as some people describe, an information war? “Absolutely,” he says. “There’s no question about it.” What there isn’t much of, in the film, is Al Gore, the man. In 2010, he split from Tipper, his wife of 40 years and the mother of his two grown-up daughters, and what becomes clear is just how much of his life the fight takes up. When I catch up with him next, he’s in London for a board meeting of his green-focused investment firm, Generation Investment Management, and I ask him to tell me about his recent travels. “Two weeks ago, I had three red-eyes in five days. I’ve been in Sweden, the Netherlands, Sharjah, then let’s see, San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles. Where else?” he asks his assistant. “Vegas,” she says. “We did CinemaCon.” “Vegas, we did that. And then, let’s see, Nashville, on my farm.” I assume this amount of travel is connected to the release of the film, but no. “I’ve been at this level for the past 10 years and longer.” He hesitates to use the word “mission”, he says, and then uses it. “When you feel a sense of purpose that seems to justify pouring everything you can into it, it makes it easier to get up in the morning.” He does tell me a bit about his parents though. He describes his father, Al Gore Sr, who grew up poor then became a lawyer and a politician, as “a hero to me”. And it was at the family farm in Carthage, Tennessee, that he held the first Climate Reality training, an informal get-together of 50 people that has morphed into the event I witnessed in Denver. There’s no “type” or demographic, I shared a table with a disparate group – including a consultant for the aerospace industry, a French lawyer and an American chef. And they seemed to have almost nothing in common aside from their passion to do something about climate change. “I’m a gardener so I’m seeing what’s happening with my own eyes,” the chef, Susan Kutner, told me. “You can’t ignore it.” In light of Trump’s fixation with fake news, it’s fascinating to see. Gore has been fighting disinformation for more than a decade. And, he’s developed his training programme counter to the prevailing ideology. The answer is not online. Social media will not save us. We will not click climate change away. The answer he’s come up with is low-tech, old-fashioned, human. He takes the time to talk to people directly, one to one, in the hope they will speak to other people – who will speak to other people. The course is run by Gore. He is on stage almost the entire time over three intensive days. And the heart of it is still the slideshow. One of his aides tells me how he was up until 2am the night before. “He’s obsessed with his slides, he has 30,000 of them and he switches them around all the time.” In the film, you see him perpetually hustling, calling world leaders, rounding up solar energy entrepreneurs, training activists. Hearing information from “people you know” is at the heart of his strategy. “You need people who will look you in the eye and say: ‘Look, this is what I’ve learned, this is what you need to know.’ It works. I’ve seen it work. It is working. And it’s just getting started. We’ve got 12,000 trained leaders now.” How many people do you think it’s impacted? “Millions. Honestly, millions. And a non- trivial percentage of them have gone on to become ministers in their countries’ governments or take leadership roles in international organisations. They’ve had an outsized impact. Christiana Figueres [the UN climate chief], who ran the Paris meeting, she was in the second training session I did in Tennessee. And, right now, people are getting really fired up.” Al Gore shared the Nobel Prize in 2007 for his efforts in combating climate change, but in some ways it feels like he’s just getting started. The rest of the world is only now cottoning on to the enlightenment struggle that’s at the heart of it – a battle royal to defend facts and reason against people and forces for whom it’s a truth too inconvenient to allow. For Gore, the US oil companies are the ultimate culprits, but it’s only just becoming apparent that Russia has also played a role, amplifying messages around climate change as it did around the other issues at the heart of Trump’s agenda, and we segue into his visits to Russia in the early 90s, during one of which he met Putin for the first time. What did you make of him? “I would not have thought of him as the future president of Russia. I once did a televised town hall event to the whole of Russia and Putin was the one who was in charge of making sure all the cables were connected and whatnot.” What does he make of the investigations into Russian interference? “I think the investigation of the Trump campaign’s collusions with the Russians and the existence of financial levers of Putin over Trump is proceeding with its own rhythm beneath the news cycle, and may well strike pay dirt.” It’s also worth pointing out that when someone passed his campaign stolen information about George W Bush’s debate research, he handed it to the FBI. And then he amazes me by pulling out a reference to an interview I conducted with Arron Banks, the Bristol businessman who funded Nigel Farage’s Leave campaign. He’s been reading up about the links between Brexit and Trump, and Banks’s and Farage’s support of Putin and Russia. “He told you: ‘Russia needs a strong man,’ didn’t he? And you hear that in the US, and I don’t think it’s fair to the Russians. I am a true believer in the superiority of representative democracy where there is a healthy ecosystem characterised by free speech and an informed citizenry. I really resist the slur against any nation that they’re incapable of governing themselves.” Brexit, Trump, climate change, oil producers, dark money, Russian influence, a full- frontal assault on facts, evidence, journalism, science, it’s all connected.

South African-born Elon Musk is a billionaire green evangelist, a bete noire of the fossil fuels industry who talks about colonising Mars and believes it may be possible that we’re living in a computer simulation. But having been feted by the Obama administration, he now faces an extraordinary barrage of attacks from rightwing thinktanks, lobbyists, websites and commentators. The character of the assault says much about which way the political wind is blowing in Washington – something that will have consequences that stretch far beyond the US. One of Musk’s most trenchant critics has been the journalist Shepard Stewart, who writes for a clutch of conservative online news sites. In several articles in September, not long after a SpaceX rocket exploded, Stewart attacked Musk for receiving billions in government subsidies “to make rockets that immediately self destruct” and branded him “a national disgrace”. As Musk fought back on Twitter, it became apparent that Stewart was an invention. Even his photo byline had been doctored from a LinkedIn profile of a tech entrepreneur. “Definitely a fake,” Gavin Wax, editor-in-chief of the Liberty Conservative, one of the websites that published Stewart, admitted to Bloomberg. The revelation triggered several theories: that Stewart was created by speculators shorting shares in Musk’s companies, or that he was invented by rival rocket companies keen to bring SpaceX down to earth. But Musk may be reassured to learn that Stewart’s attacks on him weren’t that personal. Rather, they appear to be part of a wider agenda against big government, the environmental lobby and liberals in general – an agenda reinvigorated by the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency. In recent months, Stewart has twice attacked Oregon’s former governor, John Kitzhaber, a supporter of ObamaCare and solar energy who was forced to resign from office, saying his appearance at a healthcare conference was like “having Bernie Madoff heading an upcoming conference on retirement savings”. He has also taken aim at Louisiana senator Bill Cassidy for introducing an act that compels online contact lens sellers to seek approval from optometrists before selling their products. And he has lambasted the Obama administration for “banning payday loans despite the fact that there is an overwhelming need and positive reception for them”. Stewart’s protean efforts have been erased from the internet. But the online attacks on Musk continue. A website, stopelonfromfailingagain.com, regularly publishes negative stories about him. The site is similar to another anti-Musk site, whoiselonmusk.com, created by an organisation called The Center for Business and Responsible Government (CBRG), which describes itself as a “non-partisan organisation dedicated to highlighting cronyism and its effect on American taxpayers and policy” and seems not to exist anywhere but cyberspace. Both sites were set up around the same time this summer and are registered to a domain-name allocation company in Arizona. Whoiselonmusk carries stories from the Daily Signal, the news arm of the Heritage Foundation, a powerful rightwing thinktank whose mission statement is to promote “free enterprise” and “limited government”. It also republishes items from the Washington Examiner and the Daily Caller – online titles that have both published articles by Stewart. Closer inspection of stopelonfromfailingagain.com reveals that it was established by Citizens for the Republic, a political action committee (Pac) set up in the 70s by Ronald Reagan. Dormant for years, CFTR resurfaced in 2008 under Craig Shirley, a biographer of Reagan, whose lobbying firm, Shirley &amp; Banister, claims to have played a key role helping the “Tea Party Patriots in its rise to prominence as the premiere grassroots group in the country”. Announcing its campaign against Musk, CFTR’s’ executive director, Diana Banister, the other half of Shirley &amp; Banister, said they would mobilise “public opinion, advertising, grassroots advocacy, testimony and legislation” in their attack on federal solar subsidies, of which Musk has been a major beneficiary. But how and why did CFTR spring back to life? Reports at the time suggested it was revived due to widespread dissatisfaction with the direction of the Republican party. One stated: “The revitalized Citizens for the Republic has already secured $17m in solid financial commitments, according to an official involved in raising money for the organisation.” Whether CFTR really secured this sort of money cannot be verified. But documents filed with the US Internal Revenue Service reveal that two linked organisations – the Wellspring Committee and the Annual Fund – donated the best part of $1m between 2010 and 2011. Few people in the UK will have heard of these two organisations, but they are part of a powerful conservative political network whose influence has global consequences. An investigation by the Center for Responsive Politics found that Wellspring was one of many organisations that in the past was used as a “dark money conduit” by the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers, David and Charles, to channel money to their favoured causes, which have included climate change denial scientists, Tea Party activists and a host of other rightwing groups, including the Heritage Foundation. While Wellspring has reportedly distanced itself from the Kochs, it continues to draw donations from the brothers’ network of like-minded supporters. One of the Kochs’ latest campaigns emerged in February when it was announced that James Mahoney, a vice-president at Koch Industries, had teamed up with a former lobbyist for American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers to launch a group promoting petroleum. The group is spending $10m a year talking up petrol while attacking government subsidies for electric vehicles, according to sources who spoke to the Huffington Post. The announcement followed a pledge made last December by the Koch brothers that they and their supporters intended to spend nearly $900m this year helping favoured conservative candidates get elected to Congress, the presidency, and state legislatures. This was double what they spent in the last election cycle and almost as much as was expended by the two presidential campaigns. Koch Industries did not respond to requests for comment. The Observer attempted to talk to Craig Shirley about CFTR’s relationship with the Wellspring Committee and its campaign against Musk. A spokesman for Shirley &amp; Banister declined to comment on specific questions but said: “The Observer may not be familiar with our laws, and therefore we feel a duty to inform you that conservative philosophy is perfectly legal in the United States. While our hearts go out to the liberal groups who may be ‘upset’, Citizens for the Republic will continue to fight back against cronyism and corruption at all levels of government. If liberals can’t understand that, then that is further proof they have learned nothing from this election.” Ironically, given the money they spent, the Kochs’ preferred presidential candidate – Scott Walker, the Republican governor of Wisconsin and a darling of many in the Tea Party movement – crashed and burned. Walker’s links to the Kochs may actually have hindered his chances, as they gave plenty of ammunition to his rivals. Hillary Clinton joked that Walker received “his marching orders from the Koch brothers and just goes down the list”. Trump derided Republicans who took Koch money as “puppets”. Walker’s failure to secure the nomination was a blow for Shirley &amp; Banister, which ran the communications operation for his super-Pac, The Unintimidated Pac, positioning their candidate as an opponent of the Washington elite “unintimidated by powerful political forces”. And yet, despite the ostensible setback, Christmas has come early for the Kochs. The incoming vice-president, Mike Pence, has acknowledged the support of David Koch. Myron Ebell, the chair of the Koch-backed Cooler Heads Coalition, which questions “global warming alarmism”, will lead Trump’s transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency. Another Trump appointment to that team, David Schnare, is a former member of the Heartland Institute, which denies the scientific evidence for man-made climate change and is a member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), another organisation funded by the Kochs. Meanwhile Thomas Pyle, of the Koch-backed American Energy Alliance, is off to the energy department, while Doug Domenech of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, which has received millions in Koch funds, is joining the Department of the Interior. As the campaigning website kochvsclean.com put it: Are The Koch Brothers Controlling Trump Through Appointees? If the answer is yes, then Musk and other evangelists for the green economy will soon have a lot more to worry about than fake news. It’s the real news they should fear now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2015/dec/18/game-changing-perovskite-solar-tech-could-be-cheaper-and-more-efficient","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-17T21:57:37Z","webTitle":"'Game-changing' perovskite solar tech could be cheaper and more efficient","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/18/game-changing-perovskite-solar-tech-could-be-cheaper-and-more-efficient","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/18/game-changing-perovskite-solar-tech-could-be-cheaper-and-more-efficient","fields":{"headline":"'Game-changing' perovskite solar tech could be cheaper and more efficient","bodyText":"With over 200 mostly sunny days a year, Australia’s nickname of the sunburnt country is well–earned. It’s therefore unsurprising that we lead the world in household solar, with 1.4m photovoltaic (PV) systems running in 2015. By contrast however, Australia has relatively few large-scale solar farms, which the Clean Energy Council attributes to the “relatively high cost of the technology compared to more established forms of renewable energy”, such as wind power. However, a new solar technology is being developed that could help to overcome this cost barrier, and bring about cheaper, and – potentially – less architecturally-intrusive solar energy. It’s called perovskite solar. The technology essentially uses equal proportions of two other solar types (dye-sensitised solar cells and organic PV), and – even though it is still in development stage – has been of such interest to scientists, that Science magazine touted it as one of the top scientific breakthroughs of 2013. To further the technology, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) announced earlier this month that it would provide up to $892,000 to support the CSIRO in developing and applying guidelines for assessing the performance of perovskite solar cells, which could be quite high. According to America’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory, these types of cells have increased their efficiency at converting sunlight to electricity from 3.8% in 2009 to over 20% today, and could potentially reach levels of 66% in the future. To put that into context, traditional PV cells – which account for about 95% of the global market – have a benchmark of about 25%. Damion Milliken, chief technical officer at Dyesol, a solar energy company developing perovskite solar in Australia with the help of $449,000 in Arena funding, says the increase in efficiencies is “astronomically quick in terms of PV”. “Most things in this area take decades to go through this evolution”, he says. “Perovskite has the steepest inclination in efficiencies charted.” Although perovskite solar works in the same way as traditional solar (capturing light and turning it into electricity), what makes it interesting is that it’s hundreds of times thinner than traditional PVs. Milliken says: “A classic silicon device has a fairly thick layer in order to effectively capture light; around 150 microns [for context, a human hair is about 75 microns thick]. Perovskites are exceptionally strong light absorbers and can absorb the same amount of light with a layer of around 0.3 microns.” “When you start to do the bill of materials analysis, you start to work out that the contacts are just a couple of dollars per square metre in terms of active material costs, which is spectacularly low. So, the panel costs half or less compared to traditional panels.” Perovskites can also be chemically fine–tuned to change colour and transparency, and they can also be manufactured directly onto other structures, making them attractive for those wanting to integrate solar PV into buildings. For example, solar panels could be placed directly onto glass facades and roller-coated materials, like roofing steel, at the point of manufacture. This could potentially mean greater uptake in solar on large commercial structures, like warehouses. They could also be potentially integrated into energy harvesting and storage systems for household generators. “Most [solar panels] have to be fitted onto buildings after the fact, which incur extra costs in materials and labour”, Milliken says. “Perovskites therefore have an extra arrow in the quiver for future expansion opportunities and for achieving things like zero net energy buildings, which will require something like this technology to be integrated into building envelopes.” Tests on the durability and degradation of perovskite PVs are still underway across the globe, but results to date have been promising. In fact, Dyesol and UK company Oxford PV have been so impressed with the technology, that they are now racing to be the first to take perovskites to commercialisation by 2017. Milliken says: “Around the world as a whole, solar still supplies less than 1% of global energy. So there’s not much uptake when you start to look at it holistically. To change that, it’s going to take a major upheaval unless new technology like perovskites are able to come in and save the day. “If everything lines up, I think we could see a very disruptive and rapid advancement in the potential deployment of PV technology – from something that is a little bit of a byword in the global energy provision chain to something that is a real steamroller. “It’s certainly going to be a game-changer for the solar market.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"business/2016/may/15/shell-creates-green-energy-division-to-invest-in-wind-power","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-15T15:08:58Z","webTitle":"Shell creates green energy division to invest in wind power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/15/shell-creates-green-energy-division-to-invest-in-wind-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2016/may/15/shell-creates-green-energy-division-to-invest-in-wind-power","fields":{"headline":"Shell creates green energy division to invest in wind power","bodyText":"Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, has established a separate division, New Energies, to invest in renewable and low-carbon power. The move emerged days after experts at Chatham House warned international oil companies they must transform their business or face a “short, brutal” end within 10 years. Shell’s new division brings together its existing hydrogen, biofuels and electrical activities but will also be used as a base for a new drive into wind power, according to an internal announcement to company staff. With $1.7bn of capital investment currently attached to it and annual capital expenditure of $200m, New Energies will be run alongside the Integrated Gas division under executive board member Maarten Wetselaar. Insiders said the group chief executive, Ben van Beurden, wants to ensure Shell is at the forefront of oil company innovation. “He does not want to get out so far in front where he dilutes investor returns but he does want to make sure Shell is at the leading edge of transition [to lower-carbon economies].” The Anglo-Dutch group may already be trailing Total of France, which already has its own New Energies division and boasts of being the world’s second-ranked solar energy operator through its affiliate SunPower, bought for £800m in 2011. Shell has made no formal announcement so far about New Energies but the new business is expected to be revealed at a public strategy briefing in London on 7 June. Company insiders claimed Shell wants to play down the importance of New Energies for fear it will be written off as a “greenwash” exercise by environmentalists, but said the company believes the new business could become very big – although not for a decade or more. It is unlikely Greenpeace and others will be impressed by New Energies, given that the division’s annual spending level is less than 1% of the total $30bn Shell pumps into oil and gas. Van Beurden has not yet signalled a slowdown in the high-cost oil and gas investment that has made Shell a target of anti-fossil fuel campaigners, who believe such investments will only result in so-called stranded assets – carbon made unburnable by international commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Shell has pulled back from high-risk Arctic drilling but is still engaged in deepwater projects and in the high-CO2 Canadian tar sands – although it is trying to cut emissions by developing a carbon, capture and storage facility. The Shell boss told investors at a company meeting in London last week he did expect oil and gas demand to continue strongly but the company also took its responsibilities to tackle global warming seriously. “The big challenge, both for society and for a company like Shell is how to provide much more energy, while at the same time significantly reducing carbon dioxide emissions,” he said. The following day Shell announced it was bidding in a partnership to build two windfarms off the Dutch coast that will be big enough to power 825,000 households. Shell already holds interests in nine other wind projects in North America and Europe, although spending on wind, solar and hydrogen projects was suspended by former chief executive Jeroen van der Veer in 2009. A substantial solar operation had been largely sold off three years before that. Rival BP also promised to go “beyond petroleum” and established an Alternative Energy business with its own London headquarters and chief executive, only to gradually wind it down. Paul Stevens, a fellow at the Chatham House thinktank, said in a research paper that the oil majors were no longer fit for purpose – hit by low crude prices, tightening climate change regulations and wrongheaded strategies. In the report, Stevens argued the only way forward for the companies lay in diversifying into green energy, drastically reducing their operations or consolidating through mega-mergers. “The prognosis for the IOCs [international oil companies] was already grim before governments became serious about climate change and the oil price collapsed … their old business model is dying,” said Stevens, a visiting professor at University College London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/jan/27/natural-gas-not-as-good-as-solar-despite-the-gas-industrys-best-efforts","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-27T00:21:30Z","webTitle":"'Natural' gas not as good as solar – despite the gas industry's best efforts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jan/27/natural-gas-not-as-good-as-solar-despite-the-gas-industrys-best-efforts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/jan/27/natural-gas-not-as-good-as-solar-despite-the-gas-industrys-best-efforts","fields":{"headline":"'Natural' gas not as good as solar – despite the gas industry's best efforts","bodyText":"Now that the Paris climate agreement has made it clear that the world must take serious action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the fossil fuel industry is starting to get worried. Coal consumption is declining, and the gas sector is flat. And just as the coal industry is claiming coal is good for humanity, the gas industry is claiming that combining gas appliances with solar PV is the most practical and cost-effective way to achieve the lowest carbon emissions. The shift away from gas, along with the high number of Australians putting solar on their roofs must make joining the solar revolution appear to be the ideal option for the gas industry. The future for gas doesn’t look good. The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has outlined that new technologies and changing consumer behaviour are behind the flat forecasts for residential and commercial gas consumption over the next five years. Matt Zema, the CEO of AEMO, said: “Due to forecast improved energy efficiency of buildings and appliances, and switching from gas to electric appliances, we don’t anticipate much change in this sector in the short term, despite a forecast population growth of approximately 8%.” Let’s not forget here that so-called ‘natural’ gas is a fossil fuel, and is primarily composed of methane, a greenhouse gas that is more than 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide, or that domestic gas is increasingly derived from coal seam gas through fracking that affects groundwater and agricultural production, or that the price of gas is steadily increasing. Yet the gas industry claims that gas is as good as solar: “For households that have adopted solar energy to reduce their emissions, gas also plays an important role when the sun is not shining.” But a variety of analysis tells a different story, and shows that gas is not needed for houses with rooftop solar. High efficiency electrical appliances, such as induction cookstoves and reverse-cycle air conditioners for heating and cooling, mean that there is no longer any need to use gas for cooking or for heating. When a home is powered by solar, these cooking and heating appliances are powered by 100% renewable energy. These are real alternatives to gas, are much more efficient, cheaper to run, and mean that the householder has control over their energy bills. Also look at the average hot water system. A heat pump hot water system, using ambient heat from the air around your home, which is essentially another form of solar energy, is highly efficient and is another form of renewable energy. The latest heat pump hot water systems are much more energy efficient (pdf) and cheaper to run than either instantaneous gas systems or off-peak electric hot water systems. Electrical appliances deliver more useful energy than gas appliances. Compare a typical ducted gas heating system to a reverse-cycle air conditioner. Research has shown that to deliver 10MJ (mega joules) of useful heat in a home, the ducted gas system will waste almost 25MJ of energy, while the air conditioner will waste just over 2MJ. The efficiency of a heat pump reverse-cycle air conditioner can exceed 400% as it captures free renewable ambient heat from the air around your home, compared to a ducted gas heating system where efficiency can be as low as 29%. Analysis shows that a heat pump reverse-cycle air conditioner can save a large Melbourne home over $658 (£322) per year in heating costs. Heat pump hot water and space conditioning systems are can revolutionise household renewable energy technology, using ambient heat from the air, day or night, rain or shine. The gas industry also claims that gas will support energy security. While a diverse range of energy sources will guarantee energy security in Australia, renewable energy is the only one to provide long term energy security in a world that is rapidly decarbonising. Despite the gas industry’s claims, renewable energy technologies work when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing. Large-scale concentrated solar thermal systems store energy overnight using molten salt technology and pumped storage off-river hydro systems store energy in dams, releasing energy 24 hours a day. The industry’s claims that gas can “supply power for electric vehicles at a fraction of the emissions levels of grid-sourced electricity” [pdf]is yet another attempt to market gas as clean and green, and also assumes that grid electricity will be based on coal forever. It’s well-known that the penetration of rooftop solar in Australia is the highest in the world and is increasing rapidly, and that electric vehicles supplied with power from gas are not based on renewable energy. Electric vehicles charged with power coming from renewable energy sources are the only zero emissions vehicles. An electricity grid based on renewable energy will power electric light vehicles as well as other zero emissions forms of transport such as high speed rail. As for the gas industry’s claims that gas is required for the production of fertilisers and the manufacture of bricks, steel and glass, zero emissions agriculture is the new paradigm with no tillage farming and nutrient recycling, reducing the need for fertilisers. High temperature solar thermal is also showing potential to be used in multiple industrial processes. Renewables will always beat coal and gas, and new solar and wind are cheaper than new coal and new gas. The world has reached a turning point, and is now adding more power capacity from renewables every year than from coal, natural gas and oil combined. Over 1000 mayors from around the world have seen the writing on the wall, all committing to 100% renewable energy in Paris. And high efficiency electrical cooking and heating appliances powered by rooftop solar are widely available. Energy freedom is ready and waiting for every Australian household.

To Xi’s right, on the road leading to what is reputedly the biggest solar farm on earth, a billboard greets visitors with the slogan: “Promote green development! Develop clean energy!” Behind him, a sea of nearly 4m deep blue panels flows towards a spectacular horizon of snow-capped mountains – mile after mile of silicon cells tilting skywards from what was once a barren, wind-swept cattle ranch. “It’s big! Yeah! Big!” Gu Bin, one of the engineers responsible for building the Longyangxia Dam Solar Park in the western province of Qinghai, enthused with a heavy dose of understatement during a rare tour of the mega-project. The remote, 27-square-kilometre solar farm tops an ever-expanding roll call of supersized symbols that underline China’s determination to transform itself from climate villain to green superpower. Built at a cost of about 6bn yuan (£721.3m) and in almost constant expansion since construction began in 2013, Longyangxia now has the capacity to produce a massive 850MW of power – enough to supply up to 200,000 households – and stands on the front line of a global photovoltaic revolution being spearheaded by a country that is also the world’s greatest polluter. “The development of clean energy is very important if we are to keep the promises made in the Paris agreement,” Xie Xiaoping, the chairman of Huanghe Hydropower Development, the state-run company behind the park, said during an interview at its headquarters in Xining, the provincial capital. Xie said that unlike Donald Trump, a climate denier whose election as US president has alarmed scientists and campaigners, he was convinced global warming was a real and present danger that would wreak havoc on the world unless urgent action was taken. “When I was a child, rivers usually froze over during the winter; heavy snowfall hit the area every year, so we could go skiing and skating … people weren’t very rich, and nobody had a fridge, but you could still store your meat outside,” the Qinghai-born Communist party official remembered. “We cannot do that any more.” Anders Hove, a Beijing-based clean energy expert from the Paulson Institute, said that as recently as 2012 solar power was shunned as a potential source of energy for China’s domestic market because it was seen as too expensive. No more. Costs have since plummeted and by 2020 China – which is now the world’s top clean energy investor – hopes to be producing 110GW of solar power and 210GW of wind power as part of an ambitious plan to slash pollution and emissions. By 2030, China has pledged to increase the amount of energy coming from non-fossil fuels to 20% of the total. Earlier this month, meanwhile, China’s energy agency vowed to spend more than $360bn on renewable energy sources such as solar and wind by 2020, cutting smog levels, carbon emissions and creating 13m jobs in the process. “The numbers are just crazy,” said Amit Ronen, director of the George Washington University’s GW Solar Institute, who described feeling “awed” by the scale of the Chinese solar industry during a recent trip to the country. Activists now hope Beijing will up the ante once again following Trump’s shock election. Amid fears the billionaire US president will water down attempts by his predecessor, Barack Obama, to fight global warming, campaigners are calling on China’s rulers to seize the mantle and position their country as the world’s number one climate leader. “As Mr Trump drops Obama’s legacy, Mr Xi might establish one of his own,” Greenpeace campaigner Li Shuo told the Guardian on Wednesday . That campaigners are now looking to China for green leadership underlines the once unimaginable changes that have taken place in recent years. While China remains the world’s biggest emitter, thanks to its toxic addiction to coal, it has also become an unlikely figurehead in the battle against climate change. Last September campaigners hailed a major victory in the war on global warming when China and the US jointly announced they would formally ratify the Paris agreement. “Our response to climate change bears on the future of our people and the wellbeing of mankind,” Xi said, vowing to “unwaveringly pursue sustainable development”. Ronen said: “A decade ago, China’s attitude was: ‘You guys put all that carbon in the atmosphere growing your economy, we should be allowed to put a lot of pollution up there too to grow our economy. Now look at where we are.” Sam Geall, the executive editor of China Dialogue, a bilingual website on the environment, said Beijing viewed having a climate change denying US president as a rare and unexpected opportunity to boost Chinese soft power by positioning itself as the world’s premier climate change fighter. “[China sees it as] an opportunity for them to show leadership,” he said. “I’ve already heard that from people who work in environment bureaucracy in China. They see this as an opportunity for China to step up.” Ronen said China’s renewable revolution, which has seen sprawling solar and wind parks spring up across its western hinterlands, was part of a dramatic political U-turn that culminated in Beijing throwing its weight behind the Paris climate accord last year. He said part of the explanation was air pollution – repeated episodes of toxic smog have convinced Beijing it must take action to quell public anger – and part was climate change. “They are very much impacted by a lot of these climate change weather patterns that are particularly troublesome: drought in the north, flooding they are very vulnerable to,” Ronen said. But Paulson Institute’s Hove said the key driving force behind China’s low carbon quest was economic. “Most of the things that China is doing related to the environment are generally things that China … wants to do for the economy as well,” he said, pointing to Beijing’s desire to rebalance the economy away from investment-led heavy industry-focused growth while simultaneously making itself the key player in an “industry of the future” and guaranteeing its own energy security. Hove said Beijing saw a “huge investment opportunity” in exporting low-carbon technology such as high speed rail, solar power or electric vehicles to developing nations in Africa, south Asia and Latin America. “This is a 20-30 year mission to develop [clean] markets,” he said. A recent report captured how China was already dominating the global clean energy market, pointing to billions of recent investments in renewables in countries such as Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam. Xie, the Huanghe chairman, said his company was now making its first steps into Africa with solar and hydro projects under development in Ethiopia. “We are actively going global,” he said, warning that the developing world could not copy the west’s dirty development model without bringing about “the destruction of the world”. Geall said one indication of whether China was prepared to become the world’s premier climate leader would be if it was seen helping to finance more low-carbon projects beyond its own borders – such as a huge Chinese-built solar park in Pakistan. “You’d hope to start seeing more of those sorts of projects around the world being financed … rather than [China being] just a source of cheap finance for dirty energy projects.” Not all are convinced China is ready or even willing to become the world’s top climate leader in a post-Trump world. Zhang Junjie, an environmental expert from Duke Kunshan University, believed China would stick to its Paris commitments out of self-interest, particularly since the fight against global warming empowered its environmental agencies to crack down on toxic smog despite strong resistance from vested interests. “[But] if China needs to do more, to commit more, I don’t expect that is likely,” Zhang added, noting that China wanted to be a climate leader but not the climate leader. “Leadership is not just power … it is responsibility.” With China’s economy losing steam, Zhang said tightening regulations on greenhouse gas emissions further would inflict “major trouble” on its manufacturing sector. China’s clean industries were not sufficiently developed to provide jobs for all those who would be made unemployed as a result. “I would say, don’t count on [China to fill the gap left by the US],” he said. “China has its own troubles now.” China’s push to develop renewables has not been entirely plain sailing either, with concerns about over-capacity, falling demand for electricity and curtailment, the amount of energy that is produced but fails to make it to the grid. Hove said despite the rapid growth of the sector, wind still accounted for just 4% of China’s electricity last year and solar for about 1%. Government subsidies meant many of the biggest solar and wind parks had been built in “sub-optimal” locations such as Qinghai, Gansu and Xinjiang, far from the southern and eastern metropolises where the energy was most needed. Those behind the world’s largest solar park admitted obstacles such as energy wastage and transmission had yet to be overcome, but said there was no looking back as China forged ahead towards a low-carbon future. “New energy is surely the future ... It’s hard to predict the future but I believe that solar energy will account for 50% of the total in 50 years,” said the engineer Gu. Xie said authorities in Qinghai were now so confident the future of China was green that they were planning two massive new solar parks on the Tibetan plateau, with the capacity to produce 4GW of power. In a sign of the central government’s support for the renewable revolution, Xi recently visited Xie’s company, urging staff to “make every reasonable effort to develop the PV industry”. Xie, who hosted the Chinese president, scoffed at Trump’s suggestion that climate change was a Chinese hoax and said such claims would do nothing to dampen his country’s enthusiasm for a low-carbon future. “Even if President Trump doesn’t care about the climate, that’s America’s point of view,” he said. “The Chinese government will carry out and fulfil its international commitments as they always have done in the past, and as they are doing now in order to try to tackle climate change. Xie concluded: “I don’t care what Mr Trump says – I don’t understand it and I don’t care about it. I think what he says is nonsense.” Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2015/dec/04/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-04T21:00:26Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/dec/04/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2015/dec/04/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• A photograph of Elsie Owusu, a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects’ governing council, published with a report in Friday’s paper (Senior architect accuses RIBA of institutional racism, 4 December, page 25) should have been credited to “Matt Writtle/Evening Standard/eyevine”. • We said the Indian government was expected to invest an initial $90m (£60m) in setting up the headquarters of a new international solar energy alliance (120 countries sign up for solar alliance led by India, 1 December, page 17).

The UK routinely topped the annual league table for attractiveness to clean energy companies, run by consultancy Ernst &amp; Young (EY), in the mid-2000s. For the first time, however, it has slid to 13th in the global rankings. Investors in renewable energy are being put off the UK by political posturing hostile to renewables and green efforts, and the slashing of government support for clean power supplies, in favour of potentially more expensive alternatives such as shale gas and nuclear power. Renewable energy investment worth tens of billions a year, and thousands of jobs, is likely to be lost by the UK as a result, the report found. Ben Warren, energy corporate finance leader for EY, said the results showed the government had a long climb if it wished to restore the UK’s leadership in gaining new energy investment. “A non-committal approach is putting the attractiveness of the UK’s renewable energy sector on a landslide. The current approach is going against the grain of almost universal global support for renewables, and is masking the UK’s advantages of a growing energy imperative as ageing power plants are retired, strong natural resources, and efficient capital markets.” If current policies, or government attitudes, prevail, then “the only way for the UK is down” in terms of renewable energy, he said. However, wind energy companies said they were “confident” that the UK’s renewable energy market would continue to grow. Hugh McNeal, chief executive of RenewableUK, which represents wind companies, told the Guardian: “The government has made it clear that the UK’s energy needs will be met by gas, nuclear and renewables, but not coal. While in office, the government will oversee a doubling of wind energy’s contribution to at least 20% of UK power needs by 2020. With onshore wind now the cheapest source of new power generation, and with our country by far the world’s biggest offshore wind market, we’re confident about growth in the UK market.” The EY report found there were reasons for optimism on UK renewables in the next few months, as auctions of the licences to operate new offshore windfarms take place, but that the conditions the government was placing on the licences, and the track record of policy U-turns, left “some uncertainty”. The turn against green energy in the government’s rhetoric began in the later days of the coalition government, when ministers began to voice anti-green sentiments, in contrast to the environmental commitments made by David Cameron when in opposition and in the early days of his first premiership. From claims to be “the greenest government ever”, the prime minister went on to be reported in 2013 as ordering ministers to “cut the green crap”. Cameron’s administration went on to slash support for wind and solar energy; remove obligations on housebuilders to make new homes greener, although the Committee on Climate Change has said this may mean new homes must be retrofitted; and scrap the flagship green deal home insulation scheme without a replacement. Lisa Nancy, Labour’s energy and climate change shadow secretary, said: “This damning analysis [by EY] shows how the Tories’ ideological crusade against green energy is destroying jobs, damaging investment across the country, and making Britain’s power crunch worse. Conservative MPs are voting to block windfarms that enjoy local support and offer value for money, while defending generous handouts to fund more expensive alternatives.” A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change told the Guardian: “We are dedicated to reducing our emissions and moving to low carbon energy, but this has to be done in the most cost-effective way for households and businesses. The UK remains an attractive location for investment in renewable energy. “In the last Budget we helped to give investors the long term certainty they need by announcing £730m of funding for renewables contract auctions this parliament to drive further investment, building on the record levels we saw last year.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/16/uk-solar-industry-what-you-can-do-help-stop-cuts-threatening","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-16T15:47:15Z","webTitle":"What you can do to help stop the cuts threatening the UK solar industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/uk-solar-industry-what-you-can-do-help-stop-cuts-threatening","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/16/uk-solar-industry-what-you-can-do-help-stop-cuts-threatening","fields":{"headline":"What you can do to help stop the cuts threatening the UK solar industry","bodyText":"The public has less than one week to influence planned government policy changes that are expected to dramatically scale back the solar industry. The government is proposing to cut the solar feed-in tariff by 87%. The subsidy supports householders, small businesses and community groups to invest in solar energy. The changes are currently scheduled to come into force next year, but the public can still contribute to the consultation and potentially influence the outcome. Why is this significant and what can you do to influence the plans? What’s all the fuss about? In the past fortnight, three major solar firms have gone bust, blaming the cuts. More than 1,000 jobs have been lost in the process. The Solar Trade Association, which represents the industry, said: “The government’s proposals for solar are so extreme that most solar companies are not able to envisage surviving next year. “The few that can are looking to exit the UK. The government must recognise they have made a very serious mistake and act quickly to stabilise the British solar industry.” Some energy experts have even predicted that the changes could kill off the industry altogether. Community groups, social housing tenants and householders will also be affected because the amount of money they can earn back from generating solar energy will be drastically reduced. Energy experts have predicted that it will not be possible to earn back the money invested in solar panels within their lifespan. A charitable project that has helped to install more than 1,000 panels on top of schools is also set to close if the changes come to pass, with a similar scheme to support mosques also likely to end. When is all this happening? The consultation closes on Friday 23 October. Changes are currently planned for 1 January 2016, but this could be delayed. How can you influence the decision? You can contribute to the consultation by filling a form here. You can read the consultation here (pdf). You can also ask your MP to intervene. Find and email your MP here. The environmental charity 10:10, which launched the solar schools project has launched a campaign called Keep Fits, where you can find information about the changes and read the stories of people affected. Join the campaign here. What have the government said? Amber Rudd has called the solar industry “a great British success story”, but argues that the cuts are necessary to reduce consumers’ bills. Speaking on Thursday, the government energy and climate change secretary blamed the Liberal Democrats for overspending the budget. She said: “I want to make sure that bill payers who pay for the subsidies are making the right contribution to solar and that they don’t overpay, so I’m doing a consultation at the moment to look at what might be the right level of support for solar.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/jun/16/for-a-clean-secure-energy-future-the-uk-must-stay-part-of-europes-vision","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-16T11:31:36Z","webTitle":"For a clean, secure energy future the UK must stay part of Europe's vision | Michael Grubb","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/16/for-a-clean-secure-energy-future-the-uk-must-stay-part-of-europes-vision","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jun/16/for-a-clean-secure-energy-future-the-uk-must-stay-part-of-europes-vision","fields":{"headline":"For a clean, secure energy future the UK must stay part of Europe's vision","bodyText":"Energy is the lifeblood of society. It heats our homes, powers our industry and entertainment, and fuels our transport. It has become yet another punchbag in the UK referendum campaign, with claims and counterclaims about costs. But there is a simple and very positive story to be told. Some 65 years ago, after the devastation of world war two, the European Coal and Steel Community provided the vision, the coordination, and the investment that fuelled an unparalleled period of growth and stability in Europe. It laid the foundations for what then became the European Communities, the EEC and then the European Union. But ironically the energy sector got left behind. Now is the time to update the vision. The great strength of that original community was not to obsess about sovereignty, but to focus on a real, substantial and urgent task that required collective action. At long last, EU countries have initiated an Energy Union. It started from perhaps unexpected quarters, as Poland sought a unified European response to concerns about their excessive dependence on Russian gas. But the solution is not to go back to the dirty fuels of past centuries. Europe’s energy future can be clean, diverse, secure, and interconnected. The old ways of energy production, emitting 40bn tonnes of heat-trapping gases every year, are slowly choking our planet. Last year was the hottest on record; the Arctic ice has continued long-term decline in volume. Fortunately, the solutions are at our fingertips. Within less than a decade, the cost of solar energy has halved, that of wind has fallen by a third, batteries by 60%, and some technologies for energy efficiency by even more. Crucially, the costs of both electricity system management and long distance transmission have also fallen. What this means is that we can have radically new energy systems, combining localised generation and storage with larger resources and backup pooled across regions. But there is a catch. The cost reductions to date have been driven by the collective impact of national efforts, including those in the framework of the EU’s commitment to get 20% of its energy from renewables by 2020. Europe is on course to deliver that goal and it has driven the creation of new industries and scale economies. The next stage will be harder. Going much further requires a more integrated effort with more connected energy systems. The wind does not blow (or cease to) everywhere at the same time across the continent. The biggest and best resources are scattered in different corners of Europe, and the vast swathes of the North Sea, the Baltics and parts of the Mediterranean. The sun’s track from east to west can help solar output to smooth morning and evening peaks, but far more important is the difference between north and south, and across the seasons. We will need storage of both electricity and gas. Gas is much cleaner than coal, and we can use our gas infrastructure and storage further into the future as we move towards ‘greener gas’ – for example producing hydrogen from surplus wind and solar output and injecting it into gas grids. There is one big catch: politics, most fervently on display in the UK Referendum. The UK could play a great role in building this future. We have leading energy expertise, superb wind resources, and are well on our way to doubling our electricity interconnections with the continent, to benefit from cheaper prices there through cables which have proven to be amongst the most reliable sources of power, helping to ‘keep the lights on’ in recent winters of tight UK supply. Our gas systems complement each other: central European dependence on Russia is matched by British dependence on the Middle East, so conjoined, each can help the other. As our own gas reserves decline, the North Sea also offers wind, waves and capacity to store both gas and perhaps carbon dioxide, as well as connections to Scandinavian hydroelectricity storage. The economic value of the industries will be immense, and the savings arising from fully integrated approaches in energy by 2030 have been estimated at up to €50-€80bn (£40bn-£63bn) a year by 2030 – hundreds of euros per household. But all that needs an integrated approach, and investor confidence grounded in a clear European vision, strategy and collaboration. That is what the Energy Union can provide. On both sides, the referendum campaign has been astounding in its negativity and inward nationalism. Britain is bigger than that. We should raise our sights, and aspire to help build the EU’s new Energy Union.

The search for a zero-waste beer","bodyText":"Have you ever pondered how sustainable your favourite beer is? No, I hadn’t either – until I started brewing. In truth – and it pains me to say it – the act of transforming barley into fermented beer carries an environmental footprint of pretty epic proportions. To put it into perspective: average energy consumption is estimated to be about 0.2 kilowatt hours for each bottle of beer, enough energy to run a 40-inch TV for almost three-and-a-half hours. As for water, although it’s hard to quantify exactly how much is used to create beer – from the growing of hops and barley to the cleaning of brewing equipment – recent studies suggest it can take up to 300 litres of water to create just one litre of beer. Worse still, the majority of ingredients used to make beer are never actually consumed, with most leftover hops and malt earmarked for landfill. Craft beer fans with an eco-conscience may want to avert their eyes now because the high alcohol, hoppy beers associated with this scene can sometimes be even worse for the environment. Why? High aroma is generally achieved through a process known as dry hopping, meaning the addition of hops post-boil. On a commercial scale, this often requires an energy-rich process of recirculation, plus the movement of beer between tanks, ultimately requiring the use of electricity for pumps and water for cleaning. What’s more, hoppy, high-percentage beers generally demand more ingredients. It is not uncommon for some craft brewers to use twice as much malt as an industrial brewer and 25 times more hops. In Scotland alone, annual beer-related by-product waste is estimated to total 53,682 tonnes. The good news is that - thanks to their diminutive size – so-called craft brewers are far more likely to leave a smaller environmental footprint than their mega-brewery counterparts. However, all this could change as the latter begin to mimic craft beer’s ingredient-heavy styles. But do we really have to make a choice between good quality, flavoursome beer and sound environmental credentials? Perhaps not. The Leeds-based Northern Monk Brew Co has just released what could be the world’s first zero-waste beer – and it tastes incredible. The beer, Wasted, is a 6.7% golden farmhouse ale made in collaboration with the Real Junk Food Project, a charitable foundation that runs a series of “pay as you feel” cafes serving waste food sourced from supermarkets, allotments, restaurants and food photographers. The brew was created using 120kg of waste pears, croissants and brioche,. Not content with saving food, the beer’s creators have also packaged the beer in 100% recyclable glass and have donated all the hops and malt used in its production to a local farmer for use as feed and fertiliser. The beer’s champagne yeast, meanwhile, is being used in other brews. Northern Monk’s brew is an echo of a wider trend for sustainable brewing in the US. Last year, the Half Moon Bay Brewing Company, located south of San Francisco, created a version of its Mavericks Tunnel Vision IPA using recycled “grey water” – water that has been used in sinks, showers and for washing clothes. It was made with the help of the same technology found on the International Space Station, which transforms urine and sweat into drinkable water. Although it hasn’t yet been released commercially, a tasting panel of experts couldn’t detect any differences between the brewery’s original IPA and the waste-water version. Another Stateside pioneer of sustainable brewing is Sierra Nevada, which recovers 99.8% of its total solid waste through reuse, recycling or composting, and is powered almost entirely by solar energy and micro-turbines. The brewery also grows its own organic hops and barley, and has reduced its water intake by 25% with the help of rainwater catchment cisterns. It even boasts its own herd of cattle – reared on spent brewers’ grain – which supply the brewery’s onsite restaurant with beef. Closer to home, Hackney Brewery in east London has recently started producing an impressive amber beer for the food-waste charity Feedback. The beer, aptly named Toast, is made from surplus bread. Its creator, Tristram Stuart, estimates the beer will help to offset some of the 24m slices of bread thrown away each year by UK households. The beer’s creators have discovered that toasting the bread prior to brewing adds subtle caramel notes that balance the bitter hops. (This does prompt the question: how much energy does it take to toast industrial quantities of sliced bread?) The south-east London brewery Four Pure, has switched from bottles to cans, a form of packaging that is not only infinitely recyclable but also smaller and lighter than a glass bottle, making it more efficient to deliver. In Suffolk, meanwhile, Adnams is using the first “anaerobic biodigester” in the UK to transform waste liquid into methane gas, which it uses to power its brewery and distillery. Purity Brewing Co in Warwickshire has installed a series of ponds, ditches and reed beds around the brewery, which filter and clean its waste water. The effluent not only feeds willow and alder trees, but also provides food for insects and helps green algae and other aquatic plants to reoxidate. The dawn of sustainable craft beer, it seems, is upon us. But how will British drinkers respond? A pint of helles landfill lager, anyone? Or how about a glass of grey-water gueuze?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2016/nov/16/canada-oil-pipeline-expansion-killer-whales-kinder-morgan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-11-16T11:00:17Z","webTitle":"Big oil v orcas: Canadians fight pipeline that threatens killer whales on the brink","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/16/canada-oil-pipeline-expansion-killer-whales-kinder-morgan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/nov/16/canada-oil-pipeline-expansion-killer-whales-kinder-morgan","fields":{"headline":"Big oil v orcas: Canadians fight pipeline that threatens killer whales on the brink","bodyText":"On one shore there are snow-capped mountains. On the other side loom towering skyscrapers. These churning waters off the coast of Vancouver are marked by a constant flow of ferries and containers ships – but they are also home to 80 or so orcas. Known as the southern resident killer whales the group has long had a fraught relationship with the urban sprawl they live alongside, leaving them on the knife’s edge of extinction. In the late 1960s and early 70s, dozens were captured and sold to aquariums and theme parks around the world. Those who remained were exposed to runoff chemicals used in local industry, making them some of the world’s most contaminated marine mammals. But now the orcas of the Salish sea face what conservationists say is their biggest threat to date: an expansion proposal for a pipeline that would snake from Alberta to the Pacific coast. Spearheaded by Texas-based energy infrastructure company Kinder Morgan, the C$6.8bn ($5bn) Trans Mountain Expansion project is designed to transport Alberta’s landlocked bitumen to international markets. The proposal – which still needs the approval of the federal government, led by Justin Trudeau – would expand an existing pipeline to lay nearly 1,000km of new pipeline from Alberta to Vancouver’s coastline. Oil tanker and barge traffic in the region would soar nearly sevenfold, to as many as 408 tankers a year. Conservationists warn that the spike in tanker traffic would be disastrous for the resident orca whales – a genetically unique population that is already classified as endangered in both Canada and the US. “The approval of the project is also the approval of the extinction of the population,” said Ross Dixon of the Raincoast Conservation Foundation. “No one is disputing it. Nobody is saying that’s not accurate. It’s been accepted.” In May, Canada’s energy regulator wrapped up two years of review into the Trans Mountain proposal, recommending that the federal government approve the project. The approval was conditional, subject to 157 conditions that include 49 environmental requirements. The regulator also noted the project “is likely to result in significant adverse effects to the southern resident killer whale”. Trudeau’s cabinet has until 19 December to make its final decision. Analysts have long speculated that the approval of the pipeline is imminent. “The choice between pipelines and wind turbines is a false one,” Trudeau told attendees at a Vancouver conference on clean technology in March. “We need both to reach our goal, and as we continue to ensure there is a market for our natural resources, our deepening commitment to a cleaner future will be a valuable advantage.” Trudeau has faced immense pressure from Alberta – where sagging oil prices have sent unemployment soaring to around 8.5% – to approve a pipeline, but promises by Donald Trump to resurrect plans for the Keystone XL pipeline could alleviate some of this pressure. Many are not taking any chances. The Raincoast Conservation Foundation has joined forces with several other organisations to launch a legal challenge against the energy regulator’s approval of the project, arguing that it failed to take into account the impact on the orca whales and their habitat. The groups are currently waiting to hear whether their application for judicial review, filed in June, will be given the go ahead by the court. The anticipated increase in tanker traffic will heighten the physical and acoustic disturbances in the water, said Misty MacDuffee of Raincoast Conservation Foundation. “The noise of the propeller and the engine emits at a frequency that can mask the communication of the whales,” she said. “And the overall traffic combines to create sort of a din … so it reduces the actual space over which the whale can hear and be heard by other whales.” The result could hamper the whales’ ability to catch food, she said. “They’ve got a unique diet, they’ve got a unique language in terms of their dialect and they’ve got a unique culture. And it’s that package that’s in jeopardy.” Climate change has steadily diminished the availability of Chinook salmon, the whales’ main food source. Drone research has revealed whales with altered body shapes and lacking fat deposits, suggesting they are starving. “You can visibly actually see the ribs on some of these whales,” said MacDuffee. If tanker traffic increases, the whales will not simply move to another area. “That critical habitat is not just a space on the map. It has these acoustic components, food supply components and water quality components.” The fate of the orcas is just one facet of the broad opposition the project is facing. More than 20 municipalities and 17 First Nations communities have come out against the proposal while hundreds of youth marched in Ottawa last month to urge the government to shelve the proposal. Thousands more are expected to turn out for a protest march in Vancouver this Saturday. The existing pipeline – which began operating in 1953 – passes near several schools, at one site running under a school playground, said Karen Wristen of Living Oceans. It was concerns over this trajectory that launched 92-year-old Elsie Dean into action. “It comes right through our community,” said Dean, pointing to the pipeline’s route through her home of Burnaby, a city of some 220,000 people in British Columbia. Since 1961, the pipeline system being eyed for expansion has reported approximately 82 spills to the country’s energy regulator, she noted. “It just seems rather insane to consider putting this amount of bitumen in a community of people.” Dean helped launch Broke, or Burnaby Residents Opposed to Kinder Morgan Expansion, four years ago in an effort to steer Canada – whose greenhouse gas emissions rank among the highest per capita in the OECD – away from fossil fuels and towards meaningful efforts to tackle climate change. “We know that if we don’t cut back on fossil fuels, the future generation or certainly my grandchildren will be affected adversely by climate change.” One First Nations community has countered the proposal with a demonstration of the alternative. The Tsleil-Waututh Nation, which sits directly across an inlet from the existing Kinder Morgan tanker terminal, recently launched a fundraising campaign to expand the community’s commitment to solar energy. “It’s a poetic way to illustrate the choices before us,” said Charlene Aleck, a councillor with the community. The Kinder Morgan project was analysed through the same lens as all others that come through the territory, said Aleck. “Is it feasible, is it something good for the water, land and air?” The community of 500 people was unanimous in its opposition. “It didn’t even pass the lowest entry form of how we would run business on our land.” Chief among the community’s concerns was the possibility of an oil spill, she said. “One accident and the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people, as well as salmon, dolphins, whales, seals and a multitude of other aquatic and hundreds of thousands of avian species, would be destroyed forever.” Earlier this month, Trudeau announced C$1.5bn in funding to improve response measures. The move was widely seen as an attempt to quell some of the opposition to the proposed pipeline. Aleck welcomed the funding as a way to address the issues arising from the industry already in operation in the region. “But the best way to mitigate an oil spill is not to approve the Kinder Morgan expansion,” she added. When queried on the opposition facing the proposal, Kinder Morgan pointed to a series of links on their website highlighting the company’s funding of orca research and its efforts to engage communities affected by the pipeline. The project has received 41 letters of support from Aboriginal groups located along the pipeline and marine corridor in Alberta and British Columbia, said the company. More than C$13m in funding had been provided to some 98 communities who wanted to learn more about the project, it added. The pipeline does not run under any buildings, the company noted. “Living or being active near our pipeline does not pose any health risk.” Where the pipeline runs near schools, it said, “we are open to working with individual schools or districts to fully support their safety efforts and ensure their emergency response plans and ours are coordinated.” If the project is approved, the company said it would invest more than C$150m in marine spill response in the region. “The investment will fund five new response bases, about 115 new employees and approximately 26 new vessels at strategic locations along BC’s southern shipping lane,” the company said. The millions in funding does little to address what seems to be a certainty of the project – the risk posed to the resident orca whales, said Dixon of the Raincoast Conservation Foundation. “If this population goes extinct, it’s gone for good,” he said. “They’re part of our identity, they’re part of the place in which we live.

Now the focus of protests has moved elsewhere, but the villagers are continuing their anti-fracking revolution in the form of a new, carbon-free, source of energy for the area. An array of solar panels, paid for by a fundraising drive among residents, were switched on at a nearby farm this week, giving villagers an alternative vision of clean power. On Grange Farm, about 4 miles from Balcombe, 69 panels have just gone up on the south-facing, second-storey roof of a large byre. They will generate about 1% of the community’s electricity needs, offering the power first to the farm, which has a herd of beef cattle, sheep, poultry and a shop selling fresh produce, as well as outbuildings housing other small businesses. (“It’s nice to see the cowshed roof being put to good use. The cows don’t seem to have noticed,” said the owner, Chris Jarvis.) But even as they celebrated the project, which has taken 18 months from conception, through planning, legal hurdles and fundraising, to finally generating clean energy, the volunteers responsible were facing the possibility that this first success might also be their last. Tom Parker, along with fellow volunteers in the REPOWERBalcombe group, said he was worried about tax code changes that will come into force from April. “I’m not sure that we can carry on,” he admitted. “We put a huge amount of time and effort into setting up the group, and administrative costs, such as accounting and legal costs, are a big expenditure for us, as everything else is done by volunteers. So it would be really difficult for us to change all that now and start again.” Community renewables experts have said the changes will severely inhibit the ability of local groups to form the legal entities and raise the funds necessary to put up new solar panels or wind turbines. Existing groups face having to change their legal structure or make a much less attractive appeal for funds. The changes relate to the tax relief currently offered to such schemes, in recognition of the benefits they offer in local growth and investment. The tax relief, under the Enterprise Investment Scheme rules, currently forms an important part of the financial planning for these projects, which typically spend nearly all the money on technology and infrastructure, and a minimum on administration. Many co-operative schemes depend on being able to claim the relief in order to sell shares in their projects, and offer a decent rate of return to attract investors. The EIS for renewables is being replaced with Social Investment Tax Relief, which co-operatives will not be able to take advantage of unless they change their legal structure to become community benefit companies. The government has said the change means new community groups will still be able to form, and existing ones to carry on building renewables, but those involved have said it will become much harder, and the solar industry has said there is uncertainty about the long-term future of SITR. The Balcombe array is capable of generating 18,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a year, cost about £30,000 and will generate a 5% return for investors, with an extra £1,000 a year going to a fund to tackle fuel poverty and energy efficiency. But REPOWERBalcombe’s plans for similar arrays at three schools are in jeopardy, as the group must raise £300,000 before the end of the current tax year in early April, to avoid falling foul of the upcoming regulatory change. Jackie Emery, a group member, said the process of getting all the legalities in order for the initial array was hard enough. “It’s taken a lot; there were times when things seemed to progress very slowly,” she said. “I believe that in 10 years’ time we will have solar panels everywhere and people will see it as normal, but it has been a big effort for us.” The new rules risked causing further confusion in an already complex field, said Julia Groves, chief executive of Trillion Fund, which crowdfunds for clean energy projects. “We do not as yet have clarity on exactly which tax reliefs and subsidies will apply, and in what combination, depending on how the community group is structured,” she said. “Anyone in the renewables industry will tell you that uncertainty like this is a real challenge to an industry that is not yet at scale.” Another concern was the future of feed-in tariffs, the premium rates that solar generators are paid for their electricity. These subsidies, intended to promote the growth of renewable energy and bring down its costs, have been subject to sweeping cuts and rule changes under the current government, prompting unease among investors and the renewables industry. Leonie Greene of the Solar Trade Association said: “The new FIT rules which will allow communities to run a 5MW project alongside a commercial developer 5MW project are too constrained to allow any real growth. This is a real shame since there is huge interest from the solar industry in doing this.” Groves said the government should be doing everything it could to encourage the schemes, “which ultimately benefit all of us.” There are serious doubts among renewable energy enthusiasts over the government’s commitment to clean power. David Cameron said last autumn that onshore wind turbines should no longer receive subsidy and that people were “fed up” with them, despite polls showing public support. In October, Liz Truss, environment secretary, called solar arrays in the countryside a “blight” on the landscape. Alasdair Cameron, renewable energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The fact that the government continues to undermine community renewable energy by removing tax relief, while giving huge tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry, says a lot about its priorities.” He called on the government to allow investments in renewable projects to be included in ISAs, and to allow schools to borrow money to invest in solar energy. For Parker, the view from the Grange Farm roof is as clear as the cold winter sky: the government has turned its back on its promises of a renewable future, and he blames the big six energy suppliers. “If you look at Germany, the community renewables sector has grown very big, and it is making a dent in the big electricity companies’ profits. They [the big six] don’t want that to happen here,” he said. “I don’t understand, otherwise, why the government would not want local cooperatives to do this, to generate their own energy. We’ve shown it can really work.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/mar/02/good-energy-promises-uks-first-subsidy-free-windfarm","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-02T16:55:19Z","webTitle":"Good Energy promises UK's first subsidy-free windfarm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/02/good-energy-promises-uks-first-subsidy-free-windfarm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/mar/02/good-energy-promises-uks-first-subsidy-free-windfarm","fields":{"headline":"Good Energy promises UK's first subsidy-free windfarm","bodyText":"The UK’s first onshore windfarm to be built without government subsidy is now under planning in Cornwall, to be financed in part by the local community. The Big Field windfarm, near Bude, will consist of 11 turbines, none of more than 125m in height to the tip of the blade, and provide electricity for 22,000 homes. Its backers hope it will point the way to further such projects, after the damages to the onshore wind industry caused by the reversal of policy on government support for clean energy. Likely to cost about £30m to build and install, Big Field is planned by the green power company Good Energy. While other wind and solar farms have been cancelled or left in limbo by the government’s scrapping of incentives for onshore wind, the company decided instead to try to raise funds locally to support the installation. An initial application for planning permission for the turbines was filed under the previous subsidy regime. However, that was blocked, and with the withdrawal of government support for onshore wind, the plan looked at an end. Good Energy revived its prospects with a new project that would use the same number of turbines, of the same size, but with 50% more generation capability, because of changes to the turbine technology. The revised scheme will only go ahead if planning permission is granted, but the company is hopeful that the support of local residents in agreeing to co-finance the project will help to tip the balance. The inquiry will start in April and, if the green light is given, the windfarm could be operational in 2018. Bill Andrews, who lives close to the site, said: “This is a very welcome development. A lot of my neighbours already support this wind farm, and giving local people the chance to invest in the project would mean the community will see even more of the benefit.” The abrupt alterations to government support for wind and solar energy have caused severe disruption in the UK’s renewable energy industries. Thousands of jobs have been lost, companies forced to close, projects mothballed or abandoned, and future developments left in doubt. Onshore wind technology has tumbled in price in recent years, a factor the government used to justify its withdrawal of support, but the economics of energy generation are complex. Ministers have also introduced new rules to make it more difficult to construct renewable energy projects, and increased subsidies to the fossil fuel industries through the “capacity market”. Juliet Davenport, chief executive of Good Energy, said: “The benefits of the Big Field wind farm are too great for it not to go ahead just because subsidies are being withdrawn. Being community-owned will ensure that the economic benefit of the wind farm can be retained locally and re-invested in Cornwall.” Good Energy said it was too early to decide how much of its own money and how much the local community would be expected to put into the project, or what returns investors could expect. However, if successful, it hopes this could provide a new blueprint for small onshore wind farms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2015/jan/11/floor-tile-generates-power-from-footsteps-energy-electricity-startup","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2015-01-11T12:30:16Z","webTitle":"The floor tiles that use foot power to light up cities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/11/floor-tile-generates-power-from-footsteps-energy-electricity-startup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2015/jan/11/floor-tile-generates-power-from-footsteps-energy-electricity-startup","fields":{"headline":"The floor tiles that use foot power to light up cities","bodyText":"Six years ago, Laurence Kemball-Cook had a brainwave. A graduate of Loughborough university, he was doing a placement year at the energy company Eon, where he was given the job of finding a way to power street lighting with solar energy and wind. It didn’t work, he says, in part because there’s a lot of shade in cities. This got him thinking about other potential sources of power in busy urban spaces. The answer, he realised, was underneath his feet. “My idea was a floor tile that would convert the kinetic energy from a footstep into electricity,” he says. “Every time someone steps on the tile, they generate seven watts of power. The energy is stored within batteries, and then used to power lighting when it’s needed. It’s an off-grid power source for cities.” We are talking in the headquarters of Pavegen in King’s Cross. He set up the company in 2009 but it took several years to develop the technology and convince people to take it on. His first installation was unorthodox, to say the least. “Investors wouldn’t invest without tiles in the ground, so I broke into a building site on the south bank of the Thames at 2am, installed the product illegally, took photos and put them on our website saying: ‘Celebrating our latest installation.’ I closed a deal with Westfield pretty soon after that.” Since then, Pavegen has worked with brands such as Coca-Cola and Siemens. The company has tiles at Heathrow terminal three and are planning an installation outside the White House. During last year’s World Cup, it went into a favela in Rio and laid a whole football pitch with tiles, hooking them up to spotlights so that play could continue after dark. Light isn’t the only thing it generates. When Kemball-Cook and I have a go on the demo tiles in the Pavegen office, our jumping around causes a radio to turn on. And there’s another, potentially more powerful application. “When you stand on a tile, it sends out wireless data. This is useful for crowdflow modelling – seeing how people move through cities. You can use it to control lighting more efficiently. It’s also a really key way for retailers to know how many people are visiting their shops. We imagine Google will cover streets with this in the future and use the data in interesting ways.” Pavegen’s product, which looks like a regular floor tile until you lift the rubber (or Astroturf) surface and see the hub of circuitry within, is manufactured in eastern Europe. “We didn’t find the Far East was viable for us,” says Kemball-Cook. He cites concerns over IP violation, shipping times and travel costs as reasons for choosing a manufacturing hub closer to home. In eastern Europe: “There’s a really strong industrial base and a we-can-fix-it attitude,” he says. The company has now has 30 employees and a second office in Los Angeles. But Kemball-Cook acknowledges there’s still a long way to go. One major obstacle is price – it costs around £1,250 to cover one square metre of ground with Pavegen tiles. “The holy grail for us is to make our product the same cost as normal flooring,” he says. “It takes a lot of time and investment to get there,” he adds. “Solar took 58 years to get to the point it’s at now. I reckon we’ve done about the first 20 years with our technology. Our investors know it’s not an overnight play. We are establishing a whole industry that never existed before.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/jun/16/investors-solar-poor-dark-finance","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-16T04:00:25Z","webTitle":"Unless investors see light on solar, women will still give birth in the dark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/16/investors-solar-poor-dark-finance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/16/investors-solar-poor-dark-finance","fields":{"headline":"Unless investors see light on solar, women will still give birth in the dark","bodyText":"High in the Usambara Mountains of northern Tanzania, a woman prepares to give birth in the pitch black. Her family clusters around her. With no electricity at the birthing clinic, someone shines a mobile phone above the midwife’s head. The baby is the last to be born in near darkness at the Zahanati ya Tema clinic. The next day, a local solar company brings access to clean electricity in the form of a solar home system. The initiative was made possible by solar finance business, SunFunder, which aims to bridge the funding gap between investors and up and coming solar businesses in east Africa. Across the world some 1.2 billion people lack access to electricity, and a further 1bn struggle with unreliable service. When the sun goes down, millions of families spend their limited household income on costly kerosene oil to light lamps, exposing their children to noxious fumes and inadvertently contributing to atmospheric warming. Solar technology can transform this. It’s becoming more affordable, and it’s a viable investment proposition for investors. Yet solar businesses are struggling to get the cash they need to scale up and reach more off-grid communities. Why? Dennis Tessier of ARTI Energy, the company that brought solar-powered light to the birthing clinic, explains: “Access to finance is the biggest hurdle we face as a small solar company. Grant funding from donors has helped us make some progress, but interest rates are high, and we haven’t managed to secure any loans from banks.” Banks are often cautious about lending money to solar businesses as they lack specialist knowledge of the sector, according to SunFunder’s Lais Lona. Other types of investors would like to invest, but it’s simply not cost effective to vet each individual loan. The trouble for companies such as ARTI is they need working capital to cover upfront costs like importing more solar lights or expanding distribution networks. Without it, they face sluggish growth, while the huge market opportunity for solar products, such as lamps, home systems and mini-grid connections, goes untapped. “Just last year, we took over responsibility for running the SunnyMoney [a social enterprise founded by charity SolarAid] distribution network in Tanzania, but the transition required investment,” says Tessier. “We had the database and call centre all set up. But we had no lights to sell as we’d exhausted our funds. SunFunder provided us with a loan to import the first 3,000 lamps.” Accessing the money Founded in 2012, SunFunder has bold aims to unlock billions of dollars of investment for solar energy in Africa and beyond. It has already raised more than $30m and provided $12m of loans to 25 solar businesses, helping some 300,000 off-grid households gain access to solar electricity. The company, based in San Francisco and Tanzania, has just won clean energy charity Ashden’s International Gold Award and Innovative Finance awards for the “game- changing” nature of its work. “There’s a lot of capital available, but it’s hard to access,” says SunFunder’s chief executive, Ryan Levinson. “We’re getting close to the solar industry in east Africa to really understand its financing needs. We aim to minimise the risk of default and offer low risk investment opportunities with attractive returns.” SunFunder focuses on supporting solar businesses with a proven track record that need funding to scale up. Its Tanzania-based team conducts a thorough check of their finances, sales pipeline and technical abilities with the aim of providing a clean bill of health to show investors. Monitoring continues throughout the term of the loan, and to date and the company says its loan default rate stands at 1%. Currently $3.8m has been repaid and $8.3m is outstanding. Meanwhile, SunFunder’s finance team in San Francisco seeks out potential investors, offering them the opportunity to invest in a “solar note” – a big pot of cash that the company then divides between diverse solar businesses and countries. This helps keep the risk low for investors, who receive quarterly interest payments of up to 9% and see their original contribution returned after a pre-defined period. The current solar note, the company’s largest to date, aims to raise $50m by the end of the year. Investors include the US government’s development finance arm, Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), which has provided $15m. While SunFunder’s venture is commendable, it’s important for investors to enter this type of investment with their eyes open, says Philip Bazin, renewables investment expert at Triodos Bank. “It stands to be high impact, but could also be high risk. Investors need to consider how ... they will get their money back if the solar businesses are unable to repay the loans, particularly if they are waiting several years to see their original investment returned.” Bazin adds: “It’s important to look at which countries the money is going to – are they suffering from political instability or civil unrest? A lot rests on the quality of the vetting completed by SunFunder. This needs to be as transparent as possible.” Back in Tanzania, the team tailors loans to companies’ needs – ranging from $50,000 to $2m – and loan terms span six to 36 months. With its $73,000 of SunFunder loans, ARTI has been able to increase its purchases of solar lights, freeing up cash to open a new distribution hub, hire three new employees and buy a delivery truck. In 2015, the company achieved solar lighting sales of $75,000, a 222% year-on-year increase."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"science/grrlscientist/2015/mar/12/sustainability","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-12T13:01:05Z","webTitle":"How photosynthesis inspires solar power research | @GrrlScientist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2015/mar/12/sustainability","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/grrlscientist/2015/mar/12/sustainability","fields":{"headline":"How photosynthesis is inspiring solar power research","bodyText":"The impacts that people have upon the global environment has been a concern to scientists for more than 100 years. These impacts are due, in large part, to the fuels we use. To reduce environmental damage, people must develop and use alternative fuel sources. “The one source of energy that is abundant across the developed and the developing world is the sun’s energy”, says chemist Robin Perutz, a professor at the University of York and Fellow of the Royal Society. “We need to learn how to use more of the sun’s energy both to generate our electricity and our fuels.” To meet the planet’s growing energy needs, scientists are casting their eyes towards plants, which long ago perfected the process of capturing the sun’s rays – light energy – and transforming that into starch – chemical energy – that can be stored. Might scientists be able to adapt the photosynthetic process pioneered by plants and adapt it to meet human demands? Physical chemist Elizabeth Gibson, a lecturer at the University of Newcastle, is working to do just that. Her research focuses on designing solar cell and solar fuel devices that function at a molecular level. To accomplish this, her group specialises in developing dye-sensitised nanostructured electrodes for use in tandem dye-sensitised solar cells that capture light energy under a variety of conditions. In this fascinating video, Professor Perutz and Dr Gibson discuss what inspired them to pursue their research careers and how new ideas such as alternative fuels were built upon old ideas like the greenhouse effect, which were published in the world’s oldest scientific journal Philosophical Transactions: This film is part of a series of science stories that celebrate 350 years of scientific publishing by the Royal Society.

While solar energy has become a global success story over the past few years, with tumbling costs and exploding deployment, Britain, which was keen on the technology, has slammed on the brakes, casting a shadow over a sector which employed more than 30,000 people but is now shedding jobs by the thousand. The big picture on solar is, well, big. Last year $161bn (£111bn) was invested around the world, more than gas and coal combined. Europe will reach a 100GW peak of solar deployed this year, enough to supply about one-fifth of the European Union population with clean power. Britain experienced a surge and now has 10GW, with 800,000 homeowners enjoying the technology’s indisputable benefits. We now produce 25% of our electricity from renewables – 10% from solar, with the rest mainly wind power. This is more power than we get from coal, something unthinkable just a few years ago. Solar is jobs-intensive and many small and medium-sized firms have grown to meet the demand and build up skills they are now deploying around the world – a success story at every level. But the government ditched support for solar farms last year, worrying they might push some Tory voters in the shires into the arms of Ukip. Once rid of the renewables-friendly Liberal Democrats, the new Conservative government got out the wrecking ball. It also slashed support for roof-mounted solar, leading installation volumes to collapse by 80% so far this year. The only renewable left standing was offshore wind, although it is much more expensive than onshore wind or solar, and receives a lot of government largesse. I am a fan of all renewables, but the government justifies its slashing of support for onshore wind and solar due to the cost of “subsidies”, as it wrongly labels the feed-in tariff or renewables obligation – mechanisms which have driven huge cost reductions. Subsidies in the true sense keep prices high and industries inefficient. Remember the EU wine lakes and butter mountains. Think, too, of the huge price being offered to Hinkley Point C nuclear station for its power up until 2060. That’s a massive subsidy, as well as a burden on future generations, which will do nothing to bring costs down; quite the reverse. The energy secretary, Amber Rudd, says solar must stand on its own two feet. We in the industry agree and have all been merciless in bearing down on costs, which are down 80% over the past five years. But it is downright dishonest of the government to call for free markets without support but reserved solely for solar or onshore wind. The truth is that Britain is not a free market economy. It remains a corporatist economy run by big firms that love big solutions such as offshore wind farms (no SMEs there) or nuclear power stations. Conventional energy corporations, scared to death of the massive drop in the cost of solar, tell ministers that renewables can never be the solution. Pity the facts belie this nonsense, but the Tories have swallowed it. Solar is only a couple of years away from not needing any support at all, but still the government wants to prevent it even surviving that far. They are allocating £12m a year support for the next three years – only about 1.5% of the support available to other technologies under the so-called Levy Control Framework, the details of which the government scandalously refuses to reveal. The government is not the only problem. In 2013 the EU mandated a minimum price for Chinese solar panels. This has prevented costs falling rapidly in lockstep with incentives reductions and slashed margins. Moreover, wholesale electricity prices have tumbled along with oil prices and so solar plants can earn less from the power they sell. Britain’s electricity grid is a problem too. It is weak and has little capacity left for renewables to connect. Thus grid connections are scarce and expensive. Will solar survive in the UK? Well, storage technology is rapidly advancing and costs are falling. With the grid a mess, solar with storage will enable lots of warehouses and factories to be provided with clean power where and when they need it. The next couple of years will be tough, and deployment a fraction of recent levels. But fear not – the tough, innovative, solar industry will be around long after this Canute-like government has been and gone. •Ashley Seager is director of Sun4net Ltd and a former Guardian economics correspondent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2016/jul/13/coal-india-accused-of-bulldozing-human-rights-mining-operations-amid-production-boom-amnesty-international","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-13T10:29:10Z","webTitle":"Coal India accused of bulldozing human rights amid production boom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jul/13/coal-india-accused-of-bulldozing-human-rights-mining-operations-amid-production-boom-amnesty-international","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2016/jul/13/coal-india-accused-of-bulldozing-human-rights-mining-operations-amid-production-boom-amnesty-international","fields":{"headline":"Coal India accused of bulldozing human rights amid production boom","bodyText":"The bulldozer came to Barkuta village at 10am one February morning. Nirupabai was working in the fields when her neighbours called, telling her to rush home. By the time she reached her house it had been reduced to rubble. “I cried, I screamed, trying to save it,” she says, recalling the eviction now two years on. “All my things, my son’s school books, a year’s worth of rice, everything was scattered, everything in ruins.” Barkuta is one of seven villages that neighbour the Kusmunda opencast coalmine in the state of Chhattisgarh. In 2005, the government drew up an emergency coal production plan to curb the effects of huge, impending energy shortages in the rapidly industrialising country. Kusmunda was one of 16 mines identified for expansion. In 2014, the bulldozers came, and Nirupabai had no home. According to a report by Amnesty International released on Wednesday, state-owned Coal India and its subsidiaries in the states of Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh have neglected both local and international human rights law in the eviction and land acquisition process as mining operations expand. The Ministry of Power has slammed the report as “baseless canards”, which are “part of a conspiracy to derail the development and progress of India”. The brunt of the coalmine expansion, according to Amnesty, is being borne by India’s Adivasi aboriginal communities. Aruna Chandrashekhar, a researcher at Amnesty, said interviews with 124 people in the three states reveal human rights violations. “Adivasi communities in these areas have been routinely shut out from decision-making processes around their traditional lands, rights and resources. “Many have had to wait for decades for the compensation and rehabilitation they were promised when their land was acquired. The violations of their rights to consultation and consent – around land acquisition, environmental impacts, indigenous self-governance and the use of traditional lands – has led to serious impacts on their lives and livelihoods,” she said. Since the evictions, Nirupabai’s family have been living in a hut made from mud and straw. “We don’t have light, water – nothing. Our farm lands have turned black. My son missed his exams because of all this – how is he supposed to study when our whole village, all our lands, have been dug up?” she said. The government started acquiring land in 1979, and set up a rehabilitation colony 6km away from Barkuta, but a handful of families stayed in their homes, campaigning for jobs in the mines in exchange for their lands, as officials had promised. Over the years, Nirupabai approached the coal company’s headquarters many times, asking for a job, but was turned down for being a woman. “Daughters should donate their land – this is what I was told,” she says in the report. Others villagers have been forced to move to surrounding villages, claims Amnesty, where they are treated as outsiders. Residents of the rehabilitation colony were never given jobs, nor were they given new lands to farm. They weren’t given proof of residence documents, which means they can’t use their homes as collateral for loans. “Our whole village has been ruined, our lives have been ruined,” said Nirupabai. Coal is India’s main source of power and successive governments have attempted to expand production. In 2015, India consumed 990 megatonnes of coal, second highest in the world after China. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, this figure will grow by about 7% every year until 2021. At this pace of development, India is facing a huge energy crisis. Power cuts are frequent and many companies rely on generators. In 2012, a blackout affected 700 million people across the country: traffic lights stopped working, causing jams in city centres, hospitals had to cancel surgeries, and half-burned bodies were left rotting in electric crematoriums. Prime minister Narendra Modi’s election campaign promised to revitalise business and prioritise economic development at all costs. Pressure to cut India’s $120bn (£90bn) annual energy import bill means Coal India, already the world’s biggest producer of coal, is under pressure to produce even more. Laxmi Chauhan, a local human rights and environmental activist from the organisation Sarthak, has seen the villages around the Kusmunda mine being destroyed. “For these people, their land is their identity, it is everything for them. When you take that away, you take their dignity,” he said. “These villagers are evicted by force, they are beaten until they go; entire villages are emptied out. And they get nothing in return. I have been to villages two or three kilometres away from the coal plants, and they don’t even have electricity. So you may say development, but whose development?” India’s dependence on coal has come under scrutiny in the past. At the Paris climate summit last year, under pressure to reduce carbon emissions, Modi announced a $30m solar energy plan, but also argued that India should be able to grow using fossil fuels. Modi’s government has always argued that coal is crucial for industrialisation and that per capita consumption is much lower than that of western countries. The Ministry of Power said it strongly objects to the claims in the report. In a statement, it said: “It is always easy to provide a few stray cases and exaggerate the findings instead of looking at the structural reforms which are sustainably improving the lives of 125 crore [1.25bn] Indians. “India constitutes 17% of [the] world’s population and is contributing less than 2.5% of greenhouse gas emissions. In fact our coal consumption today is less than what the western countries were consuming 150 years ago,” said a ministry spokesperson. “The government has dedicated funds for the welfare of local people in mining areas which will generate $1bn annually to support clean water, healthcare, sanitation, education, skills development, women and childcare, welfare of aged and disabled people, environment conservation and sustainable livelihoods. This is an unprecedented step for which no country in the world has ever provided such large sums of money. “India has embarked on the world’s largest renewable energy programme, a strong message reflecting the commitment of the government to balance development imperatives with concern for the environment.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/jan/18/denmark-broke-world-record-for-wind-power-in-2015","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-18T16:44:44Z","webTitle":"Denmark broke world record for wind power in 2015","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/18/denmark-broke-world-record-for-wind-power-in-2015","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jan/18/denmark-broke-world-record-for-wind-power-in-2015","fields":{"headline":"Denmark broke world record for wind power in 2015","bodyText":"Denmark produced 42% of its electricity from wind turbines last year according to official data, the highest figure yet recorded worldwide. The new year-end figures showed a 3% rise on 2014, which was itself a record year for Danish wind energy generation. The country’s minister for energy, utilities and climate, Lars Christian Lilleholt, called the record significant and said: “Hopefully, Denmark can serve as an example to other countries that it is possible to have both ambitious green policies with a high proportion of wind energy and other renewables in the energy supply, and still have a high security of supply and competitive prices on electricity.” Two Western Danish regions – Jutland and Funen – supplied more electricity than the area’s inhabitants consumed for the equivalent of 60 days of the year. “The fact that we are now generating surplus power 16% of the time in the Western Danish power grid illustrates that... we can benefit from imports and exports across borders to an even greater extent,” said Carsten Vittrup, an adviser to Energinet, Denmark’s transmissions systems operator. One of the main reasons for the record-breaking year was that 2015 was a particularly windy year. If two large onshore windfarms at Anholt and Horns Rev 2 had not been out of action, wind would have made up 43.5% of total power, Energinet said. As it was, wind turbines provided 55% of the electricity in Denmark’s west, and 23% in its east. On one day, 2 September, Denmark operated without any central power stations being switched on at all, using electricity exclusively from wind turbines, solar cells, local combined heat and power plants and imports from neighbouring countries. On another windy day in July, Denmark produced so much electricity that it was able to meet all its electricity needs and export another 40% of its power abroad. The Scandinavian country’s surplus wind energy is mostly sold to consumers in Norway, Sweden and Germany, while it imports hydroelectric power from Norway and solar energy from Germany. The Danish government looks to be well on the way to meeting its goal of producing half of all electricity from wind by 2050, despite mooting a scale back of ambitions over the summer. Reacting to the new figures, the European Wind Energy Association (Ewea) called for a renewed focus on how large amounts of electricity could be integrated into Europe’s power systems. “These figures show that we are now at a level where wind integration can be the backbone of electricity systems in advanced economies,” said Kristian Ruby, Ewea’s chief policy officer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/mar/20/energy-efficient-street-lights","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-20T00:05:24Z","webTitle":"Let there be light!

Futuristic street lamps tap into the oldest energy source: the sun","bodyText":"Not far from the House of Commons, a stone’s throw from Westminster bridge, two streetlamps will soon be erected. Paid for by Transport for London, these are no ordinary lights. According to their manufacturer, they could play a major role in tackling Britain’s energy crisis. The Monopoles, unveiled at a German trade fair last week, convert sunlight to streetlight via photovoltaic (PV) panels. The energy they generate can then be stored in a battery and used during the night to power the lamps. As a result, the “zero-emission streetlight” eliminates electricity costs. But not only do they generate enough energy to light themselves, they create a surplus which can be sold to the National Grid, potentially making millions of pounds for Britain’s local authorities, for which running streetlights costs an estimated £300m a year. Many councils are now dimming their streetlights or switching them off, raising fears of an increase in accidents and crime. A survey of 141 of 150 councils found that 50 have switched off all their lamps, while 98 confirmed that they have dimmed at least some. According to Scotia, the company behind the new technology, the average local authority operates 33,000 street lights, whose energy usage equates to emitting 7,600 tons of carbon dioxide a year. A freedom of information request to Greenwich council in south-east London revealed that in 2010 it spent £925,810 operating 22,000 lights. There are 7 million streetlights in the UK. Scotia claims that if they were all replaced with lamps equipped with solar technology they would generate more than 4 terrawatt hours of energy a year – half the output of Sizewell B nuclear power station. That would cut the UK’s CO2 output by more than 2m metric tons a year. “Instead of being a drain on the National Grid and a huge expense for local authorities, Monopoles turn streetlights into mini-power stations,” said Steven Scott, Scotia’s chief designer. “They’ve already proved to be hugely successful in our pilots in Copenhagen, Abu Dhabi and Riyadh and we anticipate demand will be high from around the world. A small Monopole can be erected by just two people, without the need for machinery, in under five minutes.” Sceptics may point to Britain’s drab weather and ask whether the lamps will be much use in the dark winter months, but Scotia insists that the lamps can function even in the bleakest conditions. The pilot scheme by TfL is part of a wider drive to equip Britain’s infrastructure with energy-producing solar panels. Proponents of the technology believe many sites around the UK are ripe for development. “With over 17, 000 car parks in the UK, there is a great opportunity for this sector to reap the benefits of solar PV panels, particularly now with falling costs and technical advances that enhance performance outputs,” said Jonny Williams, director of the BRE National Solar Centre. But some question whether the technology can compete against rival energy sources. The current low oil price is unlikely to stimulate demand for solar energy. And cash-strapped councils and governments may be wary about committing to a fledgling innovation that could be manufactured more cheaply by other companies in the future as economies of scale kick in. Nevertheless, energy experts believe solar technology has an increasingly significant role to play. In 2014, the International Energy Agency issued two reports claiming that the sun could be the world’s largest source of electricity by 2050, ahead of fossil fuels, wind, hydro and nuclear. Energy Watch Group, an independent, non-profit global network of scientists and parliamentarians, suggests that, as the cost of PV panels continues to decline, it will stimulate growth in the number of installations of the technology worldwide. “At the same time more financial investors are turning their back on fossil and nuclear projects in favour of renewable energies,” the group argues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2016/sep/23/copenhagen-christiania-drugs-commune-future","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-23T06:30:02Z","webTitle":"Paradise lost: does Copenhagen’s Christiania commune still have a future?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/sep/23/copenhagen-christiania-drugs-commune-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2016/sep/23/copenhagen-christiania-drugs-commune-future","fields":{"headline":"Paradise lost: does Copenhagen’s Christiania commune still have a future?","bodyText":"Late in the evening on Wednesday 31 August, gunshots were fired in the centre of Christiania, Copenhagen’s semi-autonomous freetown. Three people were injured, including one police officer, who remains in critical condition. The gunman – a 25-year-old Dane who was later shot and killed by the police – is believed to have been involved in Christiania’s hash trade. Cannabis has long been sold and enjoyed in this unique neighbourhood, a famous utopian commune in the heart of Denmark’s capital. Historically a centre of freedom and resistance, it will celebrate on Monday the 45th anniversary of the day that squatters – known as slumstormerene – broke down the barricades of an abandoned military base, creatively activating disused spaces in a time when living conditions were poor. In 1973, the Social Democratic government gave Christiania the official temporary status of “social experiment” – a term that many criticised as its residents had not agreed to participate. Nonetheless, this ruling allowed Christiania to persist, and a majority vote in parliament in 1989 set the Christiania Law in stone, legalising the squat. Stroll beyond “downtown” Christiania, with its bars, cafes, shops and performance venues, and you’ll stumble across the things that make the community unique. Residents have renovated old barracks, adapting them into practical spaces such as houses, kindergartens, workshops and cafes; they have built their own avant garde homes; and in the birthplace of the iconic Christiania cargo bike, the streets are completely void of cars. The community also has its own social services in cooperation with the municipality, known as Herfra og Videre (Onwards and Upwards), as well as a health centre. With the exception of schools, hospitals and social services, Christiania likes to do things its own way. It has established a self-administrating system that spends 29m kroner (£3.3m) annually on maintaining common property, kindergartens, sewers, recycling and waste collection. Drug use was always a part of the community. In recent years, however, the cannabis trade has evolved. Once led by small-time dealers, it is now controlled by large, multinational organisations, including the Danish branch of the Hell’s Angels, who are neither residents nor employees of Christiania. “This transition has happened over many years,” says Risenga Manghezi, a community spokesperson who has lived in Christiania for seven years. “In the last 10 to 15 years, the police have been really hard on Pusher Street. This means the softer ‘mom-and-pop shops’ have disappeared, and it’s only the ones who are most willing to take risks and manipulate Christianites who have stayed.” Recent figures from the Copenhagen police estimate that between up to 1bn kroner (£115m) changes hands each year in Pusher Street. “Today you have pre-rolled joints, different types of hash,” says Manghezi. “It’s all very systemised and there is a lot of money going through there.” In this otherwise semi-autonomous and socially minded community, a capitalist-style “drugs supermarket” had developed, and was spinning out of control – culminating in the recent shootout. “This was something most of us knew could happen,” Manghezi says. “It’s not the first time somebody’s been shot in Christiania. But I’ve always thought that the day a police officer gets shot, that’s the day things will get really bad.” Indeed, the next evening, roughly 400 of Christiania’s 700 adult residents gathered in the community’s meeting space. The democratic process in Christiania is based on a consensus mechanism, and cannabis sellers are often present at community meetings: to have a hash stall in Christiania, you must be a resident. Some gangs, however, have manipulated locals into acting as a front for their trade. Their presence at meetings, Manghezi laments, makes it difficult to build momentum to change the way Pusher Street is run. But this time it was clear something drastic would happen: by the end of the meeting, residents had decided to demolish all stalls in the “cannabis supermarket” and reclaim the area from outside dealers. “The whole vibe around Pusher Street has really sucked a lot of the energy out of Christiania. This has been a wakeup call for what we have here,” says Manghezi. “Police confrontation around Pusher Street has halted a lot of the great things that could go on. I hope that what we’ve done will now release some new energy so we can focus on the cool things happening.” Since the stalls were destroyed, the atmosphere is noticeably different: pop-up community meals have taken place, and there is talk of plans for a fountain. There have always been a lot of positive lessons to learn from this alternative urban enclave. The community continuously experiments with green building techniques, stormwater management, solar energy and water-treatment systems to reduce their ecological footprint. Christiania’s creativity and experimentation has always existed, but the presence of Pusher Street has dominated the focus. “It has made people sort of not talk about the social experiment,” says Manghezi. “It’s given the general feeling that things we do here are illegal – they really aren’t!” This freedom to experiment is at the core of Christiania’s principles. When resident and archivist Ole Lykke first moved to the freetown in 1979, he says, “you’d have a good idea, you’d go ahead with it, and if somebody complained, you’d deal with it. If not, then you’d just go ahead.” But in 2011, their principles were threatened when the Danish government insisted that Christiania either purchase the land or be bought out. Because of Christianites’ rejection of property rights, the prospect of ownership was unappealing. So they set up a foundation to buy the land. Many supporters of the commune jumped at the chance to “buy a little share of freedom”, more than 12.5m kroner was raised, a mortgage was secured and Christiania was saved. The mortgage payments rise every year, but this “rent” is immensely cheaper than the rest of central Copenhagen – giving Christiania “the perfect elements for gentrification”, says Manghezi. Autonomous or not, Christiania faces the same challenges as many inner-city neighbourhoods when it comes to the pressures of market forces. Just across the water, in an area known as Papirøen (Paper Island), a former paper factory is being colonised by a food market, a gallery and design offices, preparing the area for transformation into a luxury development. Furthermore, the city’s “kissing” bridge finally opened this summer, linking up colourful Nyhavn harbour to Christiania via the likes of the famous high-end restaurant Noma and the city’s opera house. As the land around it grows more expensive, how will this more de-commodified space continue to thrive while staying true to its values? “When Christiania started, there was nothing around here,” says Lykke. “If you were coming to the area, you either came here or to the ship-building factory, which closed down in 1986. If Christiania hadn’t started in these old military barracks, most of this area would’ve been torn down. Then they would’ve built concrete houses that probably would’ve been torn down by now. We saved this area, and have made an attraction in the city.” Indeed, with up to a million annual visitors, Christiania is the Danish capital’s second most popular attraction. “Copenhagen needs grassroots movements like Christiania because they add new dimensions and dynamics to our culture and urban life,” says the city’s mayor, Frank Jensen. “The city needs to make room for people that give Copenhagen the edge and contributes to making it stand out, nationally and internationally.” It is increasingly clear, however, that combating the illicit drug trade is key to ensuring Christiania’s survival. In a recent “landmark” agreement, residents agreed to let police install video surveillance. And Christiania is now urging cannabis customers to buy their drugs elsewhere. As the smoke of the gang-dominated hash industry clears, will Christiania still hold the same attraction it once did? “We cannot allow for the cannabis market to keep funding organised crime,” says Jensen. “We need to find a lasting solution to this problem … I think a carefully controlled legalisation would be a better way to regulate the cannabis market than the current prohibition.” As Ole Lykke watches Christiania’s last hash stall being crane-lifted on to the back of a truck, on its way to Copenhagen City Museum to memorialise this latest chapter in a unique community’s 45-year story, he considers the implications of what he’s seeing. “The next steps depend on the narcotics politics of Denmark,” he says. “We’re really writing history here.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2016/jul/25/an-insiders-guide-to-jodhpur-blue-buildings-and-green-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-25T11:46:51Z","webTitle":"An insider's guide to Jodhpur: blue buildings and green energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/25/an-insiders-guide-to-jodhpur-blue-buildings-and-green-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2016/jul/25/an-insiders-guide-to-jodhpur-blue-buildings-and-green-energy","fields":{"headline":"An insider's guide to Jodhpur: blue buildings and green energy","bodyText":"In five words Blue, hot, iridescent and friendly Sound of the city The plaintive sounds of the kamaicha and dholak, played here by Sakar Khan Manganiar, Feroze Khan and Khadtal Gazi, encapsulates the essence of Jodhpur’s globally renowned folk music. Best building That would have to be the sprawling Mehrangarh Fort, which dominates the Jodhpur skyline. Built in around 1460 by the founder of Jodhpur, Rao Jodhya, it sits atop Bhaurcheeria hill and is one of India’s largest and most magnificent forts. A very close second would be the Umaid Bhavan Palace (now a hotel managed by the Taj Group), which is built on a smaller hill. The former Jodhpur ruler, Maharaja Umaid Singh, initiated construction of the palace in 1929 and finished it in 1943. Among the world’s largest private residences, its rose-pink structure is a visual amalgam of multiple architecture styles. It was was recently voted the world’s best hotel. And the worst ... The vast majority of Jodhpur buildings are constructed from chittar, a stone mined from the surrounding hills. But nowadays, construction companies are avoiding using materials from the local environment and indigenous practices – since they are more costly and labour intensive – and instead are creating concrete structures with glass facades, which are neither visually attractive nor climate-appropriate. Many such buildings are appearing in the city’s commercial districts. This one stands at the busy C-Road, which is packed with shops and home to several traditional and western menswear shops. How green is your city? Jodhpur has banned the use of plastic bags in the city; however, it is not always implemented. Acknowledging the potential of solar power (incidentally, the city is commonly known as Sun City), the Indian Institute of Technology has a new centre for researching solar energy, while India’s first solar train is set for a trial run from the city. Commercial establishments are increasingly incorporating solar power, having received incentives from the government to do so, and domestic homes are waking up to the idea of exploring it as well. There are also plans to set up solar parks in the city. Best Instagram Igersjodhpur is a very active community of enthusiastic Instagrammers and amateur photographers. Biggest controversy A far cry from the barren desert city it used to be, Jodhpur is now experiencing issues caused by excessive water seepage. The decision was made to pump water from the Indira Gandhi canal – the water itself being diverted from the five rivers of Punjab – into one of the city’s lakes in order to provide drinking water to the city’s people. But it subsequently caused seepage issues as Jodhpur’s horizontally stratified rock structure easily absorbs the water. Many household basements have essentially become swimming pools. Favourite venue I love visiting Arna Jharna, an alternative museum of and for local communities built on a rocky outcrop. Envisioned by the late Komal Kothari, one of India’s leading folklorists and oral historians, and currently run by his son, Kuldeep Kothari, the museum involves various interactive learning experiences linked to rural culture and traditional knowledge. Since 2010, it regularly hosts live musical performances, children’s workshops and seminars, making it an ideal place to access Jodhpur’s folk culture. Homegrown talent A dancer of the renowned nomadic trible Kalbeliya, Suva Devi is one of the 20,000 performers belonging to various professional hereditary musician communities in the Jodhpur region, where the knowledge of music has been passed down from one generation to another over the last five centuries. But there are so many others: from the Langa community, Haya Mohammed Langa is an exceptional sarangi player; from the Bhopa community, Sugnaram Bhopa expertly plays the ravanhatta and sings; and Anwar Khan is a gifted folk singer belonging to the Manganiar community. They perform locally and at concerts all over the world, as well as at homegrown international musical festivals such as the annual Jodhpur Rajasthan International Folk Festival. What does your city do better than anywhere else? We excel at tying turbans in a way specific to the city, safa. While there is already a rich diversity when it comes to turbans in Rajasthan, the Jodhpuri safa distinguishes itself through its regal aura, and its characteristic long, extended tail. Incidentally, six different types of safa material and safa-tying experts were sent from Tripolia Bazaar in Old Jodhpur to tie the safa on the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, for his first Independence Day speech after being elected in 2014; the event was a matter of great pride for the city. Street style More under-rated location A centuries-old Shiv temple, only accessible through the narrow serpentine lanes of Old Jodhpur, sits halfway up the Bhaucheeria hill, which is also home to the Mehrangarh Fort. To get there you have to take an auto-rickshaw from Moti Chowk to City Police, where you disembark and climb a steep flight of stairs cut into the hill. Go up at dusk and you should be able to enjoy the stunning view of the city-scape alone. Moment in history Jodhpur shot into the international limelight when British actor Elizabeth Hurley married Indian businessman Arun Nayyar in 2007; pre-wedding functions were held at Nagaur and Mehrangarh forts before culminating in a spectacular wedding reception at Umaid Bhavan Palace. Ever since then, Jodhpur has become a greatly coveted place to get married. Best local artist Lal Singh Bhati is an award-winning artist who originally belongs to the city. He has created over 15,000 paintings, many of which are in the Jodhpur school of Rajasthani miniature painting, which usually depict aristocracy and figures from Hindu mythology, as seen above. He also sculpts in clay, etches in glass, restores antiques, reinterprets traditional handicrafts and has also won numerous government and international awards for his gold-embossed work on leather and wood. As if that wasn’t enough, he also runs a gallery and an art school – he’s taught thousands of children in the last three decades. Top insider’s tip Jodhpur’s sweets – and savouries – are legendary amongst gourmands and locals alike; however, if you want to sample its best gulab jamuns (fried semolina balls soaked in rose syrup and a popular dessert across India), ask for the neighbourhood of Chaturbhuj in the lanes of the old city where you can sample the best of these delectably flavoured beauties.

The power station on the edge of the Saharan desert will be the size of the country’s capital city by the time it is finished in 2018, and provide electricity for 1.1 million people.Noor 1, the first section at the town of Ouarzazate, provides 160 megawatts (MW) of the ultimate 580MW capacity, helping Morocco to save hundreds of thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions per year. “At around 2pm, the king will press a button, the parabolic mirrors will start turning, the heat will begin to turn the turbines and the plant will come to life,” said Maha el-Kadiri, a spokeswoman for Masen, Morocco’s renewable energy agency. King Mohammed VI will then lay the foundations for Noor 2, the next stage of the solar complex. Noor 1 had been due to open in December but was delayed by unspecified “agenda concerns,” el-Kadiri said. After it is switched on, the plant will initially provide 650,000 local people with solar electricity from dawn until three hours after sunset. “It is a very, very significant project in Africa,” said Mafalda Duarte, the manager of Climate Investment Funds (CIF), which provided $435m (£300m) of the $9bn project’s funding. “Morocco is showing real leadership and bringing the cost of the technology down in the process.” The north African country plans to generate 42% of its energy from renewables by 2020, with one-third of that total coming from solar, wind and hydropower apiece. Morocco hopes to use the next UN climate change conference, which it hosts in November, as the springboard for an even more ambitious plan to source 52% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. “Between now and [the next conference], many projects will have come to light and we will prove that we can match our energy demands with renewables,” the country’s energy minister, Abdelkader Amara, said at a meeting during the Paris climate summit in December. Such a move would have regional implications. CIF estimates that if international banks and governments deployed another 5GW of solar energy, electricity production costs could fall by 14%. Scaling that up to 15GW would cut costs by 44%. Some $3.9bn has been invested in the Ouarzazate solar complex, including $1bn from the German investment bank KfW, $596m from the European Investment Bank and $400m from the World Bank. If the dreams of its architects are realised, the resulting energy will eventually be exported north to Europe, and eastwards to Mecca, as well as providing a secure source of energy at home. “Morocco knew their demand for electricity was growing at 7% a year and that they were dependent on imports for 97% of that energy,” Duarte said. “They had a vision to promote renewables at a time when oil prices were high and they undertook regulatory reforms, put institutions in place, and they have done a great job.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/dec/16/us-oil-export-ban-budget-deal-congress-republicans-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-16T20:08:00Z","webTitle":"Environmentalists condemn budget deal that lifts US oil export ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/16/us-oil-export-ban-budget-deal-congress-republicans-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/dec/16/us-oil-export-ban-budget-deal-congress-republicans-environment","fields":{"headline":"Environmentalists condemn budget deal that lifts US oil export ban","bodyText":"Environmentalists have condemned a budget deal in Congress to lift a 40-year ban on US crude oil exports as “a disaster for the climate”. Republicans have trumpeted the move as a major victory that will create 1m jobs and add $170bn to annual GDP. They argue that the restriction, imposed in 1975 during chronic oil shortages, has been rendered obsolete by burgeoning US supplies enabled by new drilling methods. But the pressure group Oil Change International claimed the bipartisan compromise represented a backward step just days after Barack Obama helped forge a landmark climate change agreement in Paris. Stephen Kretzmann, its executive director, said: “Just days after we all were given new hope in Paris, the empire has struck back. Congress’s response to an historic climate deal? Incentivise further oil production. It’s hard to imagine a clearer example of how far politics still has to go on climate in order to catch up with the science.” He added: “This deal to lift the export ban is a disaster for the climate and for American communities that our children will view as a cynical indictment of a corrupt political system not yet willing to confront the powerful interests behind the climate crisis. “The good news is that the rebellion confronting Big Oil’s empire is more powerful outside the halls of Congress than within them. If they want to expand production, they are going to have to build more infrastructure, and we will be there fighting permit approvals and blocking construction with our bodies if need be.” The measure came as Congress reached an agreement on a $1.1tn spending bill to fund the government for the 2016 budget year and extend $680bn in tax cuts for businesses and individuals. Paul Ryan, the House speaker, described it as “a big win for American jobs and for our energy industry”. He claimed that in the past few years alone, the US has lost 80,000 jobs because oil producers have been forced to scale back their rigs by nearly 60%. But Obama has previously threatened to veto such legislation, contending that it will not address the country’s energy problems. On Wednesday, his press secretary, Josh Earnest, expressed disappointment that Congress had intervened. “That is something we did not support,” he said in a White House briefing. “Frankly, we still don’t support it. Our objection has primarily been along procedural grounds. This is authority that was already vested with the administration. We believe legislation in this regard was unnecessary.” But Earnest said the president was not “overly concerned” with its substance because the US already exports 4.3m barrels a day of refined petroleum, while existing legal waivers allow the export of half a million barrels of crude oil each day. “Yes, this is a legislative action that would require the lifting of this ban, but the fact is there were already substantial oil products, both refined and crude, that were being exported.” The spokesman also pointed out that Democrats won green tradeoffs including five-year extensions of credits for wind and solar energy producers and a renewal of a land and water conservation fund. They also blocked Republican proposals to thwart clean air and water regulations. The Obama administration has trebled wind power, making the US the biggest producer in the world, and overseen a 30-fold increase in solar energy, a sector that creates jobs at 10 times the rate of the economy, Earnest said. “When you take a look at the entire package, I think the country can feel good about how this budget reflects the priorities the president has laid out when it comes to transitioning to renewable energy.” However, the Democrats got the worse of the horse trading, according to Kretzmann. “When it comes to the ‘deal’, the extension on wind and solar tax credits appears weak: a lot was given up and little was gained for climate champions in this agreement,” he said. “Importantly, this move guts any remaining credibility of Big Oil when it pretends to be on the side of everyday Americans. They just took the first law designed to promote energy independence and repealed it, all in the name of desperate attempts to increase profits.” But there was disagreement from commentators such as Phil Flynn, senior energy analyst at the Price Futures Group. “I’m very excited and might crack a few barrels of oil to celebrate,” he said. “We’ve finally got to the point where the politicians decided it makes sense, and it does. The reasons the ban was in place don’t exist any more. We were worried about a cartel cutting off our oil supply. Now we have the opposite problem: a glut of oil. “Lifting the ban is going to allow the free flow of oil instead of a bottleneck that’s been created in part by a policy that doesn’t make sense any more.” The move will allow US energy companies to compete “on a level playing field” and help the world avoid price spikes at times of political turbulence, Flynn added. The tax and spending bill also reauthorises national intelligence programmes, tightens several security requirements of the visa waiver programme – denying visa waivers to people who have travelled to countries such as Syria and Iraq in the past five years – and includes cybersecurity legislation that would encourage companies to share threat information with the government. In addition, Congress was poised to approve a long-awaited overhaul of the International Monetary Fund, giving more voting power at the global lending agency to fast-growing emerging market countries such as China and India. The House will vote on the tax package on Thursday and the spending bill on Friday. Senate passage of both measures would come after another year of bitter divisions that forced speaker John Boehner to step down. Obama is widely expected to sign the pact."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2016/jun/15/rio-olympics-exclusion-zone-gentrification-favela-babilonia","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-15T10:37:53Z","webTitle":"Olympic exclusion zone: the gentrification of a Rio favela","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jun/15/rio-olympics-exclusion-zone-gentrification-favela-babilonia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2016/jun/15/rio-olympics-exclusion-zone-gentrification-favela-babilonia","fields":{"headline":"Olympic exclusion zone: the gentrification of a Rio favela","bodyText":"“Look at that house,” says Nivia Bruno Ribeiro de Cajazeira, pointing to a small dwelling hidden by lush vegetation near the top of Babilônia hill, in the south zone of Rio de Janeiro. “All the homes in the favela used to be built like that, from pau-a-pique [wattle and daub containing bamboo].” We have arrived at her own blue wooden house via a dirt path splattered with the red pulp of the jaca fruit, its terrace offering a glimpse of the distant sea. Outsiders rarely come to this part of the favela; to do so requires stepping so close to people’s homes that it can feel like an invasion. Two theories explain why this favela – one of more than 1,000 informal settlements in Rio – is called Babilônia: some say it borrowed from a local brewery when it was founded at the end of the 19th century; others believe the area’s exceptional natural beauty evoked the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Near the top of the green mountain where residents must lug food and supplies on foot, many people lack basic sanitation and nature still seems to hold sway. For five generations, Ribeiro’s family has lived here, a short distance from the white sands of Leme beach. The favela has always been known for its tranquility, says Ribeiro, 38, who teaches computing. “For years, people used lanterns at home as we had no electricity. Being so near the sea we have many natural springs, where people would wash clothes. When I wake up, I am surrounded by birds in the trees.” Now, as Babilônia undergoes rapid gentrification, Ribeiro is among the residents who are waiting to hear if they will be rehoused 40 miles away in Santa Cruz, in the west of Rio – a consequence of the city’s prize-winning Morar Carioca plan, introduced in 2010 to upgrade all favelas as part of the social legacy of the Olympics. In Babilônia, the plan provided for the removal of homes in three “risky” categories: those in Areas of Environmental Protection; those whose residents receive social rent and who have been rehoused; and homes in “areas of risk”, where rains can trigger landslides, such as Ribeiro’s. It is André Constantine, president of the residents’ association, who is taking their fight to the city. Fittingly, it seems, the concrete building housing his office is located just above the point where the paved road ends. From here, he mediates with the housing office, organises meetings to tell residents about their rights and dispenses advice to those who climb the stairs to his green door. When I visit, a small group of women are waiting in the shade outside the health post next door. Constantine is angry that the city has not kept its initial pledge to rehouse all the residents in those categories into three eco-friendly new apartment blocks in Babilônia and the adjacent favela, Chapeau-Mangueira. The Morar Carioca plan, which has been criticised for not delivering on its original promises, led to a partial extension of the main road and improvements to the drainage system, but the money ran out before all three apartment buildings could be completed. Meanwhile, some residents still lack basic sewerage facilities, he points out. Constantine is particularly enraged by what he says was a deliberate deception. “If this is an area of risk, why have they done nothing to make it safer? It was declared an area of risk six years ago and nothing has been done.” The “lie” of Morar Carioca goes to the heart of a wider cause that consumes him: the battle against the city’s “project” of gentrification, which he says is pushing poor, mainly black, residents out of favelas in desirable areas like the south zone, ahead of the Olympics. “We residents are paying a very high price for these mega-events,” he says. Constantine entered politics following the murder in 2007 of his father, who was caught up in the drugs trade. After such a life-changing event, you might choose that or religion, he says. He read about political theory and today he is a militant leader of the rights movement Favela Não Se Cala (“the favela won’t shut up”). All over the city, he says, similar battles are being fought. Constantine is in no doubt that the ultimate goal of the UPP pacification project begun in 2009 – whereby armed police seize control of and then occupy favelas controlled by drug gangs – is gentrification. “What people have to understand is that the UPP police are the protagonists for this process,” he says, referring to the tide of property speculation, that has led to inevitable “social cleansing”. Since the UPP project began, the price of buying or renting property in the favela has doubled, he says, pushing out tenants and preventing settlement by migrants from poorer areas of Brazil. “Someone from the north-east cannot come here and rent a place because it is too expensive now. It is only the middle classes who can afford to rent a place here now. Even foreigners are moving in to the community, and it is pushing the poverty to the edges [of the city].” Nevertheless, the community looks as though parts of it are still being built with bare hands. Above his office, builders are hefting bags of cement on their shoulders up the hill. Below, at the UPP unit on the main road, armed police look on as foreign tourists trudge up to one of the hostels that has opened since pacification. While these new developments might look as modern as any building along the beachfront, there are concerns about construction methods and materials. Meanwhile, some residents at the top don’t even have toilets, he says. Human excrement is just hurled into the trees. Ribeiro expresses frustration that the community now has to cater for tourists, who leave extra rubbish, for example. “We have so many problems here and we have to take care of tourists as well. It’s so difficult for us and tourists add to our problems. It makes me angry. We don’t even have a proper path to go up [the hill].” While gentrification has led to new buildings and interest from outsiders, few visitors have left anything tangible for the residents, Ribeiro says. “These big architecture projects are not carried out in accordance with our reality. They don’t bring a school or health clinic, or install internet cables.” The interest from outsiders is merely transient, she says. “I am tired of answering interviews, filling in surveys. Does all that leave anything solid behind? If people come here to do a film project, for example, why don’t they donate a camera?” That gentrification has opened up the area and brought new income is evident from the crowd usually milling around Bar do David, one of several eateries at the entrance of Chapeau-Mangueira. The food has won awards and the bar is famous for the display of 200 varieties of cachaça (a spirit made from sugarcane juice). Most evenings, Brazilians and tourists alike climb the lower part of the hill to sit with a beer and watch the sun go down over the apartment blocks that drive a wedge between the favela and the beach. Nearby, a welder in orange overalls is mending a rickety metal cart with the word “lunch” scrawled on it. Bar owner David Bispo, 44, was struggling to make ends meet as a fisherman before opening his bar after pacification six years ago. But today he is on edge; after years of relative peace, there has been a rare explosion of violence between rival drug factions in the two favelas. Two nights ago, locals steered foreigners into his bar and drew the shutters. During a weekend of gunfire, two men died and a third was injured by a stray bullet while he was taking a bath at home. Locals say the gangs were goaded into the violence by others from their factions elsewhere in Rio. Police cars are stationed at the favela entrance as a helicopter hovers overhead and a caveirão (the feared black armoured police vehicle) lumbers up the hill, sending residents and tourists from the centre to the edges of the road. Bispo, a friendly host who chats in English to customers, says pacification has made many feel safer and enabled him to start a successful business, but he, too, is wary. “You see foreigners arriving and wanting to live here and start a business here in the favela, fleeing taxes elsewhere ... this is a kind of cowardice.” He points out that such businesses invariably have an advantage over their rivals – the local residents. His father founded the first residents’ association in Chapeau-Mangueira and was involved in the luta, the struggle to remain in the favela under Brazil’s military dictatorship. Shouldn’t the benefits of the new era go to the “true deservers” he asks, whose ancestors fought for the community? Outsiders help businesses like his to thrive, but it irritates him, for example, that a foreign toddler has a place at the community nursery but there is no space left for a relative’s child. For decades, state neglect forced a pace of progress that was slow and painful in Rio’s favelas, which – unlike many other informal settlements around the world – have a largely stable population. While some residents express satisfaction that state involvement has brought new income streams and improved security, there is anger that changes are imposed from outside, without consultation with residents. Some residents talk about the golden era of the mutirão (an indigenous word meaning a group of people who work together to benefit all), when residents pooled resources to build their homes. Gentrification belongs to the more individualistic development of Rio that has characterised the run-up to the Games, they say. To counter this trend, Pol DHuyvetter, a Belgian who has lived in Babilônia since 2012, launched solar power project RevoluSolar, empowering residents to become energy self-sufficient as electricity bills have risen. “I found out that Babilônia had been presented during Rio+20 summit as a pilot project on sustainable development. But I soon learned this had been a PR operation by the Rio host governments and some big companies,” he says. A member of the Belgian renewable energy cooperative Ecopower, he “realised that a solar energy cooperative would be a perfect instrument for sustainable development with clear economic, social and environmental benefits”. He says: “One company took advantage of the pacification, the electricity company Light … The solar energy project of RevoluSolar wants to counter this negative side of gentrification, where a energy company abuses its position and is overcharging low-income families despite promises of social tariffs at the start of the pacification.” In Bar Nosso, a restaurant near the bottom of the hill, owner Francisco Nunes welcomes the integration of tourists provided that visitors respect the residents, a sentiment that Constantine shares, as he tells me when we meet again. “We are not against foreigners but we are only in favour of tourism that is good for everyone.” He adds: “We are against ‘safari tourism’ and we have a campaign: the favela is not a zoo. It has never been so ‘cute’ to stay in a favela. People take selfies in the favela. They come to see how exotic we are.” Preserving the favela’s culture concerns residents. Some point to Vidigal, another favela in the south zone, as an example of where gentrification has eradicated this identity. Constantine wants to open a museum in the community that celebrates black culture and traditions, as well as the Candomblé religion, but the building that was meant to house it has been earmarked for more UPP police. “I dream about a better Brazil, but this is only going to be possible if we invest on the right issues like education, culture, art and leisure,” Constantine says, clearly frustrated. “What we in the favela want is our rights ... If you keep the favelas on the margins of society there will always be problems.” After a deadline expired for the city to reveal its plan for rehousing the residents of Babilônia, he is now organising legal action with those affected. For Ribeiro, meanwhile, the uncertainty continues. “My home is everything. I don’t want to leave,” she says. “Ideally, they would build a retaining wall behind my house [to prevent a landslide]. I don’t know why they can’t do that.” Constantine adds: “There are lots of intelligent, interesting people here ... [This is] a favela in the middle of a rich area of the city where the taxes are the highest, and some people don’t even have a toilet in their home. How long are we going to stay here without the government investing in the infrastructure and facilities?” That evening, after leaving Babilônia, I hear on the radio that violence has erupted again in the favela. Local residents and foreigners have barricaded themselves in a friend’s building and thrown themselves on the floor during 20 minutes of shooting. A third local man is shot dead. It seems lasting progress in poor communities is a less reliable outcome than gentrification.

A team from the CSIRO, Australia’s national science agency, took five weeks to construct a “solar thermal field” containing 50 heliostats – large mirrors that reflect the power of the sun – at Pentakomo, located in the south of Cyprus. The CSIRO won an international tender to provide its technology to Cyprus for a trial that could lead to broad solar take-up in the country and elsewhere. It is understood that several other countries in Europe and the Middle East are interested in adopting CSIRO solar technology. Cyprus hopes to take on the technology so it can reform its oil-dependent economy and meet a European Union target of 13% of energy coming from renewable sources by 2020. The Mediterranean country is also plagued by water shortages and may use solar energy to power desalination plants. The CSIRO technology uses mirrors to track the sun and reflect it towards a single receiving point on top of a tower. This heat then warms a fluid, in this case molten salt. The molten salt, heated to 250C, is stored in a hot tank and the steam produced powers a turbine for electricity. Crucially, this storage method allows for energy to be produced long after the sun has disappeared. “The question about solar is always about storage at night-time,” said Wes Stein, solar research leader at CSIRO. “This liquid is cheaper and more efficient than batteries, such as those made by Elon Musk. We can generate steam for electricity on a cloudy day. “This is Cyprus’ first foray into real solar infrastructure and hopefully it’s replicated across the country. They are close to countries such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia who could translate this technology as well.” The Cyprus project provided $500,000 for the CSIRO but Stein said the returns could be in the “tens of millions” if other countries licensed the technology for larger scale developments. Stein added that Australia could theoretically provide all of its electricity via solar energy in this way, requiring a site measuring 50km by 50km, a third of it taken up by mirrors. CSIRO built the first version of the heliostats in 2006 and hopes to license its technology to manufacturers around the world. The science agency believes its heliostats are superior to those used elsewhere because their smaller mirrors provide a higher control over the reflected sunlight, while the infrastructure requires just two people to install it. An experimental heliostat facility in Newcastle, New South Wales, has 450 mirrors. But opportunities for deployment across Australia have been stymied over the past 12 months amid a quest by the federal government to slash Australia’s renewable energy target. Investment in large-scale renewable energy in Australia has slumped 90% in the past year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Just one large-scale renewables project, worth $6.6m, has been financed this year, due to uncertainty caused by political negotiations over the RET’s future. More than 2,300 jobs in the renewable energy sector have been lost in the past two years, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show. “Hopefully there will be an opportunity to use heliostats in Australian projects,” said Stein. “Australia has the best solar radiation of any continent in the world and we are looking for opportunities to deploy this technology here as well as overseas.” According to the Australian Energy Market Operator, building a 100% renewable energy system would cost the nation between $219 billion to $332 billion, depending upon the scenario. Proponents of a complete switch to renewable energy argue that this level of investment, over a 35-year period as coal is phased out, is reasonable and similar to current levels of spending upon fossil fuel development."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/jan/14/solar-power-still-good-option-despite-subsidy-cut-vat-hike","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-14T11:23:10Z","webTitle":"Solar still a good option despite subsidy cut and VAT hike, says industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/14/solar-power-still-good-option-despite-subsidy-cut-vat-hike","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jan/14/solar-power-still-good-option-despite-subsidy-cut-vat-hike","fields":{"headline":"Solar still a good option despite subsidy cut and VAT hike, says industry","bodyText":"Solar panels still make financial sense for consumers despite a double whammy of subsidy cuts and a rise in VAT rates, the industry has said. Midnight on Thursday marks the final chance for homeowners to secure the current incentive of 12.47p per kWh for electricity from solar panels. The feed-in tariff scheme then closes to new applicants for three weeks and anyone installing panels will get 4.39p per kWh, a 65% cut that was branded “huge and misguided” when it was announced just before Christmas. The cost of solar panels could soon go up by as much as £900 for the average home after the government said they should no longer qualify for a lower rate of VAT because of EU state aid rules. A consultation on the VAT change ends on 3 February. The Solar Trade Association said solar was still attractive even though the payback period for an average system – costing about £6,000 – would now be about 14 years, up from eight years with the current incentive rates. “It’s still a great investment,” said a spokeswoman for the trade body. “And for anyone who is replacing their roof, it’s a no-brainer to be replacing with solar.” A significant part of installation costs are for scaffolding. The Liberal Democrat peer Lynne Featherstone has tabled a regret motion in the Lords over the subsidy cuts. If the motion wins significant Labour and Lib Dem support, it could potentially block them. The shadow energy secretary, Lisa Nandy, has written to the environment secretary, Amber Rudd, calling on her to abandon the changes or at least allow a debate in the Commons. She said: “Just as solar energy is reaching cost parity with fossil fuels, the chancellor’s cuts to the feed-in tariff are shortsighted and misguided. The government is derailing an industry with the potential to be a new British powerhouse.” After the revised feed-in tariff scheme reopens on 8 February, the total paid out to new homeowners will be capped each year at £100m, with caps set every quarter. The government expects the cap will limit the number of solar installations to about 15-16,000 each quarter this year. If a homeowner misses out on a quarter because of the cap, they can “queue” for the next quarter. “[The] industry will survive in the long-term but we could see a big decline for the next two years,” said Alasdair Cameron, a renewable energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, which is unhappy at what it sees as a cap on aspiration for solar. Cameron said the 4% return that consumers are expected to get with the lower solar payments was inconsistent with the higher returns new nuclear is expected to get, which is also being subsidised by government. He said: “It’s hard to avoid the assumption that the government is treating renewables differently.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/feb/23/nevada-solar-power-industry-workers-customers-costs-solarcity-elon-musk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-23T17:00:11Z","webTitle":"Nevada's solar workers and customers reel as new rules 'shut down' industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/23/nevada-solar-power-industry-workers-customers-costs-solarcity-elon-musk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/feb/23/nevada-solar-power-industry-workers-customers-costs-solarcity-elon-musk","fields":{"headline":"Nevada's solar workers and customers reel as new rules 'shut down' industry","bodyText":"The conversation at SolarCity’s hollowed-out warehouse in Las Vegas felt like it came after a funeral, and in a sense it did, with workers cycling between sadness, disbelief and anger at the untimely death of the rooftop solar industry. The cause, as seen by workers drifting in to clean out their belongings, was state-assisted suicide, after the Nevada regulator imposed costly new rules for residential solar customers. The decision to replace economic incentives with new higher fees pulled the carpet out from under an industry that provided 8,700 jobs in the state last year, according to the Solar Foundation, and stranded some 17,000 homeowners who have already gone solar with a financial liability on their rooftops. Three companies, including SolarCity, announced they were quitting the state, laying off about 1,000 workers. “Everyone in this warehouse was let go, 550 people across the valley,” said Chandler Gray, who lost his job as an installations inspector for SolarCity. The havoc turned solar panels into a hot topic for Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton ahead of the Nevada caucuses on 20 February. Call it the solar wars. From Arizona to California to Florida and now Nevada, states are struggling to reconcile residential solar – with its promise to give homeowners greater independence while fighting climate change – with highly centralised business models of the electricity industry. California and a number of other states eventually defeated efforts by energy companies and corporate lobby groups to claw back incentives for solar customers. Now Nevada has raised the stakes, levying the highest charges to date and breaking with convention to impose those charges on existing customers as well as new ones. The solar showdown pits Elon Musk, the electric car billionaire and cofounder of SolarCity, against Warren Buffett, owner of the state’s monopoly electricity provider NV Energy. The new rules, confirmed on 12 February, raised the monthly fees to solar customers from $12.75 to $38.51 over 12 years while dramatically cutting back the rates that customers were paid earlier for feeding surplus power back into the grid from about 11 cents a kilowatt hour to about two cents. Homeowners who are suing NV Energy in a class action estimate the new rates add 40% to their monthly bills, while reducing the amount they get paid for the solar energy their panels produce by 18%. SolarCity’s warehouse was still plastered with posters advertising the “infinite power of the sun” – but the company’s power to change the residential roofline of Nevada cities was, for the moment, gone. Orders stopped the moment the new rules came out, Gray said. Until the axe fell, SolarCity was shipping up to 1,600 solar systems a week from this and one other warehouse in southern Nevada. “It used to be like Raiders of the Lost Ark when you went into this warehouse,” he said “It was massive,” Gray went on. “Then they dropped the bomb.” Gray, who saw SolarCity as an escape from dead-end retail jobs, was let go. So was his partner, who also worked for SolarCity. “Our household income was zero for a couple of weeks there,” Gray said. His partner was rehired – and Gray hopes he will get taken on too. But for the moment he is looking after their six-year-old son, and campaigning for a ballot initiative to overturn the rules. “We are going to fight to bring solar back, and once we do, we will get our jobs back too,” he said. SolarCity is keeping its Las Vegas headquarters in an upscale shopping mall where the glass conference rooms are decorated with the names of island vacation destinations like Aruba and Maui. But the office will operate mainly as a sales center. Roz Holden’s last day arrives on 21 February, after which the top saleswoman plans to put her four-bedroom house on the market and move into a rental – just to keep costs down – and start hunting for work. The company offered Holden a job in its call centre or to move her to another state, but neither was a good option for a single mother supporting two daughters who are firmly settled in Las Vegas. Even now, Holden still can’t fully believe the good times for solar are over in Nevada. “It’s unfathomable,” she said. “We expected some changes this year, but we didn’t expect they would shut us down completely. It was quite shocking.” SolarCity arrived in Nevada in 2014, shaking up the market for rooftop solar with a leasing plan that allowed homeowners with good credit ratings to put solar panels on their rooftops with no money down. The company could barely keep up with demand – until 22 December, when the new rules were announced. “We literally stopped business within that hour, pulled installs off the roof, finished up the jobs we had within that hour and we were done,” Holden said. “It pretty much shut down the industry.” Some of their customers were caught in limbo, like Kelly and Charisma Schwarze, whose installation was completed but whose panels have still not been switched on by the electricity company. The couple had been excited to go solar, once the leasing option put it in their budget. Now “I feel like we are being punished for trying to do the right thing”, Kelly Schwarze, an independent film-maker, said. For Mike Stitely, the new rules destroyed the tiny thrill he got each day when he checked the iPad to see how much electricity was being produced from the 16 panels on his roof. Stitley’s wife is still working, at Walmart, but he is retired. He is very worried about higher bills, and selling the house when the stairs become too much. “People are going to be scared off,” he said. “It blows my mind and really upsets me,” Stitley said. “It’s pretty high anxiety. At this time of your life you like to know what is going on.” The public utilities commission (PUC) claims solar customers were not paying their fair share for maintaining the grid. “When solar rooftop ratepayers reduce energy consumption with solar generation, they lower their bills at the full retail energy rate, which includes charges not only for fuel costs but also for fixed and demand costs; these fixed and demand costs do not go down simply because the rooftop solar ratepayers consume less energy,” Peter Kostes, a spokesman, wrote in an email. “Solar rooftop ratepayers are under-paying.” Patricia Farley, a Republican state senator who drafted a bill last year to revise the state’s solar policies, claimed solar was only for rich people, and that the new rules were fairer for all Nevadans. “We don’t see people with lower income putting solar on their homes,” Farley said. “I think if you looked at who bought solar, you don’t really see diversity. You have got people who can afford it, and some of the experts told me the people who can’t afford it are paying the difference.” But the new rules struck clean energy advocates and campaign groups as retrograde. Instead of limiting rooftop solar, Nevada should be promoting residential arrays as a means of fighting climate change and diversifying the electricity grid, in case of natural disaster or attack, they argued. Clinton issued a statement saying it was “punitive” to change the rules on existing homeowners. Bernie Sanders, who met with solar installers in Reno, said it was “just wrong”. Rooftop solar is also likely to figure in next November’s elections. “This is an existential battle for the future of solar being waged right now in front of regulatory bodies,” said Adam Browning, director of the Vote Solar campaign group. “It is really about who gets to decide how much solar is installed and who owns it.” Others see the solar wars as an uncomfortable blip on an inevitable energy transition. Solar was barely on the radar when Louise Helton went into the solar business in 2007, inspired by hearing Bill Clinton describe his vision of Nevada as a “Saudi Arabia for solar energy”. She went on to found 1 Sun Solar, offering residential solar installations out of the same shopfront where she runs her electrical contracting and stone tile business. After the recession hit, landing harder on Las Vegas than other towns, it took until 2011, when the prices of solar panels began coming down, for Helton to get her business up and running. By Helton’s own estimates, she stands to lose about $500,000 a year because of the PUC decision. But she is relatively philosophical about the eventual outcome of the solar wars. “It’s sort of the same problem we had to go through when you first had cellphones. Ma Bell wasn’t happy,” Helton said. “It was a disruptive technology that changed industry, that took it from being top-down and inverted that pyramid completely.” It was clear which side was going to win the end, Helton said. And then she picked up her cellphone and smiled."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2015/oct/01/money-talks-young-people-in-a-pension-hole-while-older-people-struggle-to-liberate-theirs","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-01T11:46:41Z","webTitle":"Money Talks: Young people in a pension hole, while older people struggle to liberate theirs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/oct/01/money-talks-young-people-in-a-pension-hole-while-older-people-struggle-to-liberate-theirs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2015/oct/01/money-talks-young-people-in-a-pension-hole-while-older-people-struggle-to-liberate-theirs","fields":{"headline":"Money Talks: Young people in a pension hole, while older people struggle to liberate theirs","bodyText":"Hello and welcome to this week’s Money Talks – a roundup of the week’s biggest stories and some things you may have missed.

The Indian finance minister Arun Jaitley would be meeting Future Fund chairman Peter Costello to discuss using the Fund to help finance Adani’s Carmichael coal mine. There was no announcement of the meeting in Australia, but the questions must be asked: how should Australia’s sovereign wealth fund be used, and should it, a “future” fund, be considering the energy projects of the past? The prospect of Costello dedicating sovereign funds to the massive coal mine in the Galilee Basin is so misguided. Future energy investment lies in renewables, not coal, and this trend is already playing out worldwide. The Australian economy already runs a real risk of becoming fossilised, caught in the past and missing out on the huge investment market in renewable energy as the world inevitably decarbonises and shifts to a zero emissions economy. This global transition to renewables is an unavoidable condition for containing global warming below 2C. The future is renewables, the past is coal, and the economic benefits are easy to highlight. In this transition, Australia stands to attract a major portion of the $2.3tn annual trade value from emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries, like cement, steel, and aluminium. In this era, countries with abundant, cheap, high quality renewable energy will attract these industries. The Renewable Energy Superpower report to be released in Sydney on Monday 4 April shows that Australia is consistently in the global top three of countries with economic wind and solar energy resources, whether based on energy production potential per square kilometre, energy production potential from total land area, energy production potential from un-utilised land area, or energy production potential from rural land area. Under various scenarios developed by the International Energy Agency for their World Energy Outlook, investment in renewables and energy efficiency will make up around half of the future investment in energy in the next two decades, with investment in coal only making up 1-2%. Whichever scenario the IEA looks at, renewables and energy efficiency attracts more investment in the next two decades than coal, oil and gas combined. Some $28tn is expected to be invested globally in renewable energy and energy efficiency by 2035. Investment in renewables and energy efficiency globally is already large – around US$390bn is estimated to have been invested in 2013 alone, according to the International Energy Agency. In order to contain global warming to the 2C, the IEA estimates the annual investment in this market to more than double by 2020 to around US$750bn annually, and then to grow exponentially to US$2,300bn annually by 2035. It also estimates that the renewables dominated power sector and energy efficiency markets will be 20-40 times the value of future coal sector development. The other important point that is relevant to Australia is that power sector and energy efficiency investment is skewed towards Australia’s neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region (40%) compared to global fossil energy investment (25%). So how large is Australia’s renewable energy resource? While it is widely accepted that the total renewable energy resource across Australia is significant, the Superpower report conservatively models only the solar and wind resource that is available within 10kms of Australia’s existing electricity grid and able to generate power at a price competitive with other new power stations. This is the resource that is immediately available to the existing electricity grid. The results are staggering even when only this small portion of Australia’s total renewable energy resource is captured – it is equivalent to 5000 exajoules, enough to power the world for 10 years. Put another way, this solar and wind resource is greater than Australia’s coal, oil, gas and nuclear resources combined. Many proponents of fossil fuels argue that there are enough fossil fuels to power the world for hundreds of years, that coal is cheaper and is good for humanity. These arguments ignore the reality that burning fossil fuels is incompatible with meeting the globally agreed goal of limiting warming to 2C, that new renewables are cheaper than new coal and new gas, and that many developing countries want solar. In the decarbonised world in which we are heading, Australia will be a renewable energy superpower if it plays its investment cards right. If we are serious about our Future Fund funding the future for all Australians, it is renewables – not coal – where the investments must be made. Guardian Australia and the author sought comment from Future Fund before publication. Future Fund responded after publication with the statement that “Finance Minister Jaitley has never raised Adani with the Future Fund.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/apr/20/building-with-nature-cities-that-steal-smart-ideas-from-plants-and-animals","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-20T00:10:17Z","webTitle":"Cities that steal smart ideas from plants and animals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/apr/20/building-with-nature-cities-that-steal-smart-ideas-from-plants-and-animals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/apr/20/building-with-nature-cities-that-steal-smart-ideas-from-plants-and-animals","fields":{"headline":"Building with nature: cities that steal smart ideas from plants and animals","bodyText":"With soaring glass skyscrapers and swaths of concrete, modern cities often seem actively to work against nature, pushing it down and suppressing it rather than working alongside it. Yet a growing number of progressive architects, designers, engineers, scientists and urban planners are looking to the Earth’s systems for inspiration. Biomimicry is based on the idea that animals, plants and the Earth’s natural processes are the ultimate engineering feats. The approach looks to replicate nature’s clever ideas, whether it be designing a water collection device with inkjet-printed microdroplets imbued with binding agents, based on the Namib desert beetle’s ability to harvest vapour from fog; or a passively cooled building in the style of a termite mound. Biomimicry stems from the logical conclusion that nature’s systems function well: examples of when they fail are found only in the fossil record. Of course, there is a big gap between marvelling at a spider’s ability to spin a web, and designing a fabric that mimics its selectively sticky properties. And the sheltering tree does not provide the solid cover of a roof to keep out rain. But the glimpses of light and moving shadow the tree casts could offer other benefits, such as negating the need for illumination at specific times of day. A smart building might exploit these. Dr Cheryl Desha was a panellist at last month’s event Catching up with the Jetsons: Cities in 2050 at the World Science festival in Brisbane. The Queensland University of Technology lecturer in sustainable development foresees a future in which cities are more like natural environments, functional and resilient, protecting inhabitants from weather, pollution and viruses, while minimising their carbon footprint. But there is a long way to go. “Technology is improving, but nature is ahead of us. Kilometres underwater there are organisms that, without even solar energy, are able to glow. And we are still talking about lightbulbs,” she says. Thankfully there are great minds working on it. Desha points to the not-for-profit Biomimicry Institute, founded by the eminent US natural scientist Janine Benyus. Its website, asknature.org, is an online library of more than 1,800 bio-inspired applications for architects and engineers. The peel structure of the grapefruit–related pomelo, for example, allows it to withstand a fall of 10 metres without damage. This structure has inspired a new aluminium composite material being tested for building safety applications. Deloitte’s Netherlands office, The Edge, is the poster child for smart buildings. Among many innovations, the offices are powered by super-efficient LED panels that require such negligible amounts of electricity that they run on the same cables that carry internet data. The panels are also imbued with sensors for motion, light, temperature and humidity – a digital ceiling that wires the building like a brain’s synapses. Melbourne city council’s headquarters Council House 2 (CH2), which is cooled using salt, is a worthy Australian example. The ceiling panels are chilled by water supplied by large tanks, each containing 10,000 stainless steel balls filled with a salt suspension that freezes at 16C. The frozen salt balls chill the water before circulating it to the panels when cooling is needed. The water returns to the tank 3C warmer, and the balls’ absorption of heat moves the salt back into liquid phase, so they act collectively as a thermal storage battery. CH2’s architect, Mick Pearce, also designed the Eastgate mixed-used building in Harare. Its design, inspired by the way ants cool their mounds, allows passive cooling through its solar stack. Eastgate has side channels and a vertical tunnel along its centre through which hot air is drawn upward and out via a convection current. Desha says European investors for the project baulked at the idea of a building without airconditioners so, though superfluous, they were bolted on after construction to assuage investors’ fears. “That’s very telling about human psychology and how a finance system doesn’t trust the engineering. That has to change,” she says. Putting nature to work in an urban setting is more obviously showcased by an increasing number of buildings that are literally green. Vegetation covering the sides and roofs of office blocks not only breaks up a cityscape of concrete and glass, but performs the air cleaning and cooling functions of a forest. Sydney’s One Central Park and Milan’s Bosco Verticale are spectacular examples. Pasona Group, a recruitment company in Tokyo, takes nature’s bounty one step further, with integrated urban farming facilities. Hydroponic and soil-based farming of 200 species of vegetables and rice are grown and harvested for the staff cafeteria amid daily office functions, while tomato vines are suspended above conference tables and lemon trees act as screening partitions between desks. The urban built environment is a relatively new phenomenon in the history of human habitation, while nature’s most successful processes have been honed over millions of years. Using them as a blueprint seems a wise model for developing our existing cities and planning those of the future."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/28/live-qa-financing-paris-agreement-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-28T15:03:25Z","webTitle":"Live Q&A: So now we've agreed to stop climate change, how will we pay for it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/28/live-qa-financing-paris-agreement-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/28/live-qa-financing-paris-agreement-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Live Q&A: So now we've agreed to stop climate change, how will we pay for it?","bodyText":"On Wednesday the United Nations urged global business leaders to double investment in wind and solar energy to $600bn (£400bn) a year by 2020. The announcement comes one month after the Paris climate agreement, where nearly 200 countries agreed to dramatically cut emissions. This week UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon urged business leaders to act decisively to hasten the transition away from the fossil fuel economy – or they would put the historic accord in jeopardy. But even if business leaders do reach this ambitious target, it only marks the start of the investment needed to meet the agreed 1.5 degree target. The International Energy Agency has estimated that to hit this taget the world will need to spend more than $16trn (£10.55trn) over the next 15 years, to cover the costs of replacing coal and gas-fired power stations with emissions-free sources of energy such as wind, solar and nuclear as well as the costs for improving existing energy efficiency in homes and businesses. So who’s going to foot the bill? What can developing countries do to help ensure we reach the 1.5 degree target? How can markets be used to promote private-sector solutions to climate change?

Protests were held in Melbourne on Friday, and in Darwin, Brisbane and across New Zealand on Saturday, followed by Sydney, Canberra, Adelaide, Hobart and Perth. Around the world, more than 600,000 people took to the streets in 175 countries to call for a strong deal in Paris that will see a swift transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. We asked our readers to share their experiences of the protests by contributing to our Guardian Witness assignment. The march in Melbourne on Friday was attended by more than 60,000 people, with environmentalists, unionists, religious organisations, youth groups, doctors, Indigenous organisations, and people from the aid and development sector all part of the crowd. On Darwin’s waterfront on Saturday, more than 500 people marched in “sweltering heat and humidity” to call for an immediate shift away from fossil fuels. “The Northern Territory currently has no Renewable Energy Target in place and no plans to cut climate pollution or adapt to climate change, despite being a hotspot for solar energy,” wrote Guardian reader Anna Boustead in her submission to Guardian Witness. “The Territory is currently experiencing a 7.1mm sea level rise each year, causing rapidly increasing saltwater intrusion of freshwater wetlands, flooding and coastal erosion without efforts to reverse climate change.” Brisbane residents also marched on Saturday. Despite the heat, the mood of the Sydney march on Sunday – attended by more than 40,000 people – was rambunctious, even festive, with the impact of rising sea levels on Pacific nations a key strand. Perth and Hobart also joined in on Sunday. Rallies were held across New Zealand on Saturday, with marches in Wellington and Auckland among the 35 events organised for the day. In Europe peaceful “human chain” formed in central Paris made up of thousands of people, including children, holding placards reading “climate justice” and “keep it [fossil fuels] in the ground”. More than 2,200 marches were scheduled around the world, with events in locations ranging from Madrid and Rome, which had 20,000 people each on their streets. In Sana’a in Yemen, about 70 people gathered and held up a banner despite air raids nearby.

We’ve already operated our first spacecraft and by 2025 we hope to have robotic spacecraft produce the first litre of water in space. Mining asteroids is technically possible, but it’s not going to happen by itself; it needs innovators like ourselves to create the reality from what was previously science fiction. The new law has tackled the issue head on, and while there will always be people who worry about it, one of the exciting things for me is conveying to people that this isn’t something that might happen in the future – it’s under way. PROFESSOR LINDA FRENCH Planetary astronomer at Illinois Wesleyan University People have been talking about asteroid mining for 10 years or so, and back then I felt we should just leave things alone because we’ve not done all that good a job of stewarding our own planet. But what with the Osiris-Rex mission and the support from the Obama administration, it seems like this is the direction that things are moving in, and the major players involved in developing it seem to have advisers who are good scientists, so I haven’t decided to man the barricades against it. Harvesting water from asteroids, instead of lifting it off the Earth’s surface, would be a huge saving. But I have some concerns about the feasibility of, say, bringing platinum back to Earth. Still, more data is always welcome – we learned so much from bringing back the moon rocks. DR GBENGA ODUNTAN Senior lecturer in international commercial law, University of Kent I was surprised when the new US Space Act was signed into law with very little debate. I have the rather nasty impression that it was all hurriedly done. People might not notice what it really represents, which is the beginnings of unilateral claims over natural resources in outer space. This is out of line with the letter and spirit of space law, which are based on common ownership by mankind. My hope is that some member states will raise an issue about this at the next UN general assembly, because the same argument that allows the US to do this will also avail China and any other countries with the technical capability. The environmental concerns are also very frightening. I am not a scientist but I don’t see how you can employ swarms of robots to attach themselves to asteroids without contamination taking place. And when you’re dealing with private companies it’s much more difficult to attribute responsibility for potential damage. DR LEOPOLD SUMMERER Head of advanced concepts team, European Space Agency We already harvest resources from space to help with space exploration – solar energy, gravity etc – in my view it’s just a matter of time before we use other materials. At the ESA we’ve studied various forms of in situ resources utilisation, including fuel-production and 3D printing of habitats from lunar material. It’s impressive how much public interest and private funding have been generated around asteroid mining in the US. At the ESA, we have been exploring public-private partnerships since last year and, while none of them concerns asteroid mining, it might yet come. The ESA is the only one that has landed on an asteroid and is currently preparing an asteroid mission that would include the deployment of microlanders. Whatever we do, we have to do it responsibly, respecting the rights of future generations and the protection of scientifically valuable places."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2016/jun/06/australian-election-2016-turnbull-shorten-coalition-greens-labor-briefing","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-05T21:36:55Z","webTitle":"Today's campaign: poll reveals the rise of team Xenophon and independents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/06/australian-election-2016-turnbull-shorten-coalition-greens-labor-briefing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2016/jun/06/australian-election-2016-turnbull-shorten-coalition-greens-labor-briefing","fields":{"headline":"Today's campaign: poll reveals the rise of team Xenophon and independents","bodyText":"Four weeks down, four to go. Good morning, and welcome to what would usually be the pointy end of the election campaign but is instead the bump in the middle. Time to lip-sync your favourite pop-song for the halftime entertainment and make a cup of tea before we sink into week five, day 29, of the election campaign. The big picture Newspoll in the Australian this morning has the Coalition up one point in two-party-preferred terms, which puts the major parties at 50-50. Which is interesting, but less interesting than its other finding, which is that support for independents and minor parties has grown three points to 15%. That’s the highest it’s been in the poll’s 31-year history. If you include the Greens vote in the mix, it shows that one in four people plan to vote for someone other than the major parties. The Australian reports: While the two-party-preferred vote sees the first improvement for the Coalition since April — from 49% to 50% — the government’s primary vote has dropped one point to 40%, which is the lowest level since the prime minister replaced Tony Abbott as leader almost 10 months ago. Labor’s primary vote has also fallen for the second consecutive Newspoll survey, dropping one point to 35%, while the Greens lost one point to fall to a six-month low of 10%. That 5% support for independents and micro-parties breaks down as 3% for the Nick Xenophon Team (that’s the national vote – in South Australia it’s polling at 22%), 3% for Family First, 1% for Palmer United Party, 1% for One Nation and 7% for all the rest. It appears to indicate that the Senate voting changes may not result in a friendlier upper house. The poll also suggests that if the Coalition was returned it would face a repeat of the difficulties from the last parliament in passing legislation through the Senate and would rely on a crossbench principally controlled by Senator Xenophon, in cases where it could not secure the support of Labor or the Greens. While voters think about new parties, Malcolm Turnbull was in Melbourne on Sunday for a bit of classic wedging. He joined a protest of CFA volunteers against a pending industrial relations deal between the firefighting body and the United Firefighters Union, which volunteers say is designed to push them out of the organisation. The Age reports that the Andrews government, which backs the union, could push the deal through as early as today. Turnbull promised volunteers that he would protect their rights. And the Greens want to regulate to ensure a “fair price” is paid for solar energy. Gabrielle Chan reports: The policy, to be launched on Monday by the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, and MP Adam Bandt would force a “fair price” to be paid by energy companies. Solar homes and businesses would be protected from fees and charges “likely to be imposed by electricity networks clawing back their diminishing revenues as our electricity system decentralises and consumers become empowered”, the policy says. On the campaign trail Both Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten have started the day in Melbourne. Shorten is continuing to campaign on Labor’s $3bn childcare policy, released yesterday. Gabrielle Chan reports: The centrepiece is a 15% increase in the Child Care Benefit (CCB) as well as a rise in the childcare benefit cap from $7,500 to $10,000. Labor has said every family earning under $150,000 will benefit from the change. Labor’s finance spokesman, Tony Burke, said the policy was a stark contrast to the Coalition, which has delayed rebate rises until 2018. “Any child who was born when the government first announced they were going to do something about childcare will be in school by the time their policy comes in,” Burke said. “We’re not willing to wait. So we’d bring it all forward to 1 January. For the people who are reliant on the childcare benefit, that increases by 15%. That means for low to middle income earners up to $30-a-week improvement for them.” The campaign you should be watching Rural Australia is frequently ignored in election campaigns, because its seats are usually safely held. That’s not the case any more: Indi, in Victoria, is the most marginal seat in Australia, held by independent MP Cathy McGowan on just a handful of votes, and even the deputy prime minister, Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce, is facing a challenge in his electorate of New England from former independent MP Tony Windsor. My colleague Gabrielle Chan digs through the issues here. And another thing(s) The Liberal party has released a new set of campaign ads focusing on Malcolm Turnbull’s relationship with his father, Bruce Turnbull. Turnbull has spoken before about being raised by a single-father in a two-bedroom flat, to show his “battler” roots. He elaborated in the video: We didn’t have much money, he was a hotel broker and for most of that time he was battling like a lot of people are, a lot of single parents are, certainly. But he taught me a lot of amazing things ... And he did well after a while; in the latter part of his life he kicked a few goals after a lot of effort. He was incredibly loyal, very, very strong, very disciplined. I was the main object of everything he wanted to achieve. He was very focused on doing what was right for me. And finally, Mayo is apparently the happiest electorate in Australia, according to the Personal Wellbeing Index, conducted by the Deakin University Australian centre on quality of life. The result is reportedly based on polling of 154 Mayo residents, of which the sitting member, Liberal MP Jamie Briggs, who is facing a significant challenge from his former staffer and Nick Xenophon party candidate, Rebekha Sharkie, was perhaps not one. AAP reports: Residents of Australian’s federal electorates – more than 100 from each and a total of more than 24,000 – were polled on how satisfied they were with their standard of living, health, relationships, achievements in life, safety, community connections and future security.

The Victorian Liberal MP, Sarah Henderson, has written to the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, asking that the government include wind and small-scale solar energy in its investment mandate. Henderson stopped short of criticising the government’s proposal to stop the CEFC investing in wind and small-scale solar as part of a focus on emerging technologies, saying she wanted its draft mandate broadened. “The focus on the CEFC investing in innovation and emerging technologies is the right one,” she said. “However, a broadening of the draft investment mandate as proposed by the government to include emerging technologies in wind and small-scale solar (such as battery storage technology) is both consistent with the CEFC’s investment objectives and will help to produce an even greater dividend for Australian industry and jobs.” Henderson made a point of criticising Labor’s carbon tax while praising the government’s own policy on climate change. “The federal government is currently providing very significant support for the wind and small-scale solar renewable energy industries,” she said. “Over the next five years, the Renewable Energy Target (RET) is expected to drive between $5.6bn and $8.7bn of investment in the renewable energy sector.” Henderson said tackling climate change was vital and a broader CEFC investment mandate would be a positive step forward. “The measures used to drive down carbon dioxide emissions must be fair and equitable and not cost thousands of jobs,” she said. Her letter, dated 23 July, said the people of Henderson’s electorate, Corangamite were “extremely supportive” of renewable energy. The CEFC sought legal advice on the government’s proposed mandate and will be providing a response in the next few weeks. Tony Abbott avoided speaking directly on Henderson’s request, instead attacking the Labor party for increasing the renewable energy target to 50%. “I’m very pleased that we’ve been able to give certainty to the renewable sector,” he said on Monday. “Renewables do have an important part to play in our power system but frankly at 23% that’s more than enough,” Abbott said. “One of the truly bizarre decisions coming out of the Labor conference on the weekend was this move to increase the proportion of renewables in our system to some 50%, now this constitutes a massive, absolute massive hit on consumers and on jobs because to move to 50% renewables by 2030 will mean a massive bill, perhaps $60bn or more that will have to be carried by consumers of Australia.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/16/solar-firm-blames-subsidy-cuts-for-uk-exit","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-16T18:26:45Z","webTitle":"Elon Musk-backed solar power firm blames subsidy cuts for UK exit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/16/solar-firm-blames-subsidy-cuts-for-uk-exit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/16/solar-firm-blames-subsidy-cuts-for-uk-exit","fields":{"headline":"Elon Musk-backed solar power firm blames subsidy cuts for UK exit","bodyText":"A solar power company backed by the billionaire inventor Elon Musk has pulled out of the UK, blaming the government for not supporting the technology. Zep Solar UK, which is owned by SolarCity where the Tesla boss is chairman, becomes the fourth UK solar business to close in a fortnight. SolarCity laid the blame squarely on cuts to solar subsidies announced by the Department of Energy and Climate Change in the summer. A company spokesman said: “We had been exploring opportunities in the UK but based on the Decc decision we’re left to conclude that the UK government doesn’t support solar development. We’ve put expansion plans to the UK on hold indefinitely and will focus efforts elsewhere.” Zep Solar set up a division in Milton Keynes eight months ago and hoped to start selling solar panels in the UK this year. The US-based firm was bought by SolarCity, America’s largest solar company, in 2013 for $158m (£99m). SolarCity said six staff were affected, with four being laid off and two reassigned to other roles. This month’s closures of three other companies – Southern Solar, Mark Group, and Climate Energy – have cost around 1,000 jobs. Howard Johns, the chief executive of Southern Solar, said his company going into liquidation was “a direct result of the government’s recent announcements that kill off support for solar energy via the feed-in tariff scheme.” On Thursday the energy and climate secretary, Amber Rudd, said she was concerned at job losses but she had to control costs to consumers. She claimed solar still had a future in the UK. Construction News first reported that Zep Solar UK was folding.

It’s near Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which might be best remembered for its work on the Manhattan Project. The 1,150-megawatt plant is undergoing testing to go fully online this month, and will join the existing 1,100-megawatt Watts Bar plant, which already provides 650,000 area homes with electricity that emits zero carbon emissions. When Watts Bar 2 is fully operational, it will be the 100th operating nuclear power plant in the US, the country with the most nuclear power stations in the world. Watts Bar 2 is making history for being the first nuclear power plant to be built in the US in two decades. Its existence also happens at a time when the role of nuclear power in the country’s energy future is uncertain. While states such as California are shutting down nuclear power plants over safety concerns, other states see nuclear power playing an important role in their march to replace fossil fuels with energy sources that emit little or no emissions. Georgia and South Carolina, for example, are currently building plants. The number of states that support nuclear is by no means high. Although 29 states have renewable energy goals, until recently, only Indiana and Ohio expressly included nuclear energy in those strategies. But other states are starting to craft plans to subsidize nuclear power generation, which accounts for 20% of the nation’s total electricity production. Unlike coal and natural gas plants that emit carbon emissions while producing electricity, nuclear generates none and accounts for 63% of the country’s zero-emission electricity, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), a nuclear power advocacy group. New York recently joined the two other states by including nuclear as part of its clean energy plan, which calls for 50% of its electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030. The move illustrates the difficulties of reaching the goal with renewables such as solar and wind alone. “If you think of the time it will take to make those renewable additions, we are digging the hole too deep on carbon emissions and losing time. New York did the right thing,” said Paul Meier, an environmental engineer at Blumont Engineering Solutions, specializing in modeling energy and emissions scenarios. The new plan also includes an unusual subsidy program to pay struggling nuclear plant owners more for the power. The subsidy program reflects a major shift in energy planning in an era of historically low natural gas prices, increased availability of renewable energy and new technology development to generate and deliver electricity more efficiently. New York experiment What makes New York’s subsidy program unique is it’s the first time that nuclear power will receive the same environmental and social benefits ascribed to wind and solar, said Gene Grecheck, former president of the American Nuclear Society, a professional organization of engineers and scientists and a current co-chair of a committee at the society that advises state policy makers. Unlike wind and solar energy which receive hefty federal and state subsidies, nuclear providers have not seen the same support despite providing a consistent, large scale and reliable carbon-free energy. The enormous cost of developing a nuclear power plant and safety concerns that grew out of the three melting Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactors in Japan in 2011 have made nuclear seem a risky option for addressing climate change. Each nuclear power plant could take around $10bn and 10 years to develop and build, said Matt Crozat, NEI’s senior director of business policy. Justifying that cost is tough at a time when natural gas doesn’t have the same risk profile, and its price is low. The US Energy Information Administration estimates the cost for producing electricity averages $56.40 per megawatt hour at new, basic natural gas plants and $99.70 per megawatt hour at nuclear plants. The production costs, which take into account tax credits, average $50.90 per megawatt hour for wind power and $58.2 per megawatt hour for energy from solar panels. As a result, nuclear is a particularly expensive energy in states that allow multiple electricity retailers to do business in the same region. A utility that buys nuclear power will likely have to raise the price it charges and become a less desirable option. In states that allow utilities monopolies, such as California, the utilities need to justify the higher rates when they seek state approval to charge customers more, but they don’t have to worry about competition. Since 2013, about 13 nuclear plants around the country have been or are slated for shutdown, largely because of low natural gas prices and the rise of renewable energy, NEI said. California plans to close its last nuclear power plant in about nine years. Illinois has not come up a plan to avoid early retirement for two plants. Nebraska’s nuclear plant will close, said Edward Kee, chief executive officer of the Nuclear Economics Consulting Group. Ohio is trying to come up with a plan to keep its Davis-Besse nuclear plant going. Under the new program, New York is requiring its energy suppliers to start, in April 2017, to pay to pay a premium for nuclear energy because of its environmental benefit. The higher revenues will make two of New York’s plants profitable and help the third at least break even, said Lela Jgerenaia, US power market analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. In 2015, the average wholesale electricity prices for the two plants ranged from $22.49 per megawatt hour to $39.36 per megawatt hour. The average cost of running nuclear power plants nationwide is about $35 per megawatt hour to run, Kee said. If the three struggling plants in New York closed today, the state’s carbon emissions would increase by more than 31m metric tons during the next two years, resulting in public health and other societal costs of at least $1.4bn, the governor’s office said. In the first two years of the 12-year program, the credits are forecast to cost about $1bn and raise residential power bills by less than $2 a month, the office added. Geoffrey Heal, professor at Columbia Business School with a focus on environmental economics, applauds New York’s decision to create the zero-carbon emission credits, rather than seek to close and replace them with natural gas plants. “If you really want to reduce carbon substantially – and the US stated in its Paris (climate agreement) submission that it would like for these carbon emissions to be down 80% by 2050 – that would mean basically taking all fossil fuels out of electricity production. If you’re going to go carbon free in power generation, you have to have wind, solar and nuclear,” Heal said. Nuclear is tough to love Whether New York will lead other states to use emissions credits to support nuclear power is too early to tell, Grecheck said. Public opposition to nuclear has historically played a role in prolonging the time and cost of developing a power plant. But lately, some environmentalists believe climate change is so far gone they’re willing to overlook the pitfalls of nuclear, including the headache with disposing of toxic nuclear waste. For Bob Brecha, professor and research director for the Hanley Sustainability Institute at University of Dayton in Ohio, the best role currently for nuclear is to be a substitute for fossil fuels until wind and solar, along with technology to store these intermittent energy sources, can meet 100% of the power needs. Environmental objection remains strong for groups such as the Sierra Club, which opposes to the nuclear provision in New York’s clean energy plan. “It does not make sense to force New York’s consumers to buy expensive, dangerous nuclear power when real clean energy options are available for less, and with costs continuing to fall,” said John Coequyt, global climate policy director, for Sierra Club. Unless natural gas prices go up, the future of new nuclear production may only occur in states, such as Georgia and North Carolina, that allow electric monopolies, said Christopher Muir, utilities analyst at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Georgia and South Carolina are two states currently building plants. Southern Company’s $8bn Vogtle plant in Georgia will be the largest US nuclear plant when it’s scheduled to open by 2020. The Vogtle Power Plant in Georgia, majority owned by Southern Company, will be the largest US nuclear plant when it’s scheduled to open by 2020. Southern Company’s share of the project is estimated at $8bn, and some estimates place the entire price tag at $21bn. “Completing the new units at Plant Vogtle remains the best cost option for meeting Georgia’s future energy needs – once the new units come online they will put downward pressure on customer rates and provide reliable, carbon-free energy for 60 to 80 years,” said Craig Bell, spokesman for Georgia Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"us-news/2016/apr/26/san-diego-mayor-renewable-energy-plan-kevin-faulconer","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-26T12:35:16Z","webTitle":"San Diego Republican mayor pushes plan to run on 100% renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/26/san-diego-mayor-renewable-energy-plan-kevin-faulconer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2016/apr/26/san-diego-mayor-renewable-energy-plan-kevin-faulconer","fields":{"headline":"San Diego Republican mayor pushes plan to run on 100% renewable energy","bodyText":"As presidential nominees Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, respectively, call climate change a “religion” or a “bullshit … total hoax” dreamed up by China, it is deeply unfashionable for any Republican to take the issue seriously, let alone push for radical reforms to remedy it. Kevin Faulconer, the mayor of San Diego, could therefore qualify as one of the most outlandish, as well as green-tinged, Republicans in the US. Faulconer has thrown his weight behind a binding plan to make San Diego run on 100% renewable power by 2035 – the largest American city to have such an ambition. Faulconer is as much a product of his largely liberal surrounds as he is of his party, of course. The 49-year-old mayor will march for LGBT pride and supports a path to US citizenship for undocumented immigrants. But San Diego’s bipartisan push to embrace clean energy such as solar and wind, while radically paring back greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, is a glimpse into how the rancorous brawls over climate change could have been avoided across the rest of the US. “This isn’t a partisan issue,” Faulconer told the Guardian. “I’ve said from the very beginning there’s enough partisan politics at the national level. I was a volunteer for our parks before becoming mayor; I love our natural resources, our beaches and landscapes. I feel strongly about protecting them.” While Republicans, including Florida senator Marco Rubio, have warned any action to cut emissions will raise power bills and lead to economic ruin, Faulconer has sold a vision of low-carbon innovation, jobs and clean air. San Diego’s business community is now on board, although Faulconer admitted it took “a lot of persuasion”. “I pride myself on being fiscally responsible and environmentally conscious,” he said. “The two aren’t exclusive. I’ve never seen it as a zero sum game. We want a plan that is ambitious and leads the way for the rest of the country.” A plan endorsed unanimously by San Diego’s Democrat-dominated council in December would see America’s eighth largest city transformed into one riddled by bicycles and public transport, with roofs swathed in solar panels. The city will switch half its fleet of vehicles to electric power, and almost all the methane from sewage and water treatment will be recycled. A key selling point for the plan is the resulting jobs and investment in clean energy – San Diego ranks second in the US in electrical output from solar energy, and the city is openly courting clean tech firms to set up shop there. It already derives 40% of its power from clean sources. But public concern about climate change is also a key driver. “People have seen and felt the drought, the wildfires, the flooding,” said Nicole Capretz, who wrote the first iteration of the climate plan before the controversial exit of previous mayor Bob Filner. “People were witnessing a lot of things in their backyard. When you see your quality of life is at risk, people start to wake up and say ‘it’s time.’” “The beautiful part about having a Republican mayor embrace this plan,” she added, “is that he did outreach to his own friends and factions and persuaded them it was the right thing to do for economic reasons.” There remain hurdles for San Diego to clear. An implementation plan has yet to be finalized but much will rest upon an intervention into the electricity market. San Diego’s utility has said it cannot meet the 100% renewable goal itself, meaning that the city will have to branch out to source its power elsewhere while the utility retains control over poles and wires. “There’s a battle brewing on that,” Capretz admitted. “It’s the largest part of the climate plan – we can’t get to the goal without it.” On the plus side, the 2035 decarbonization plan is legally binding, unlike the aspirations of other large cities. And some measures should be straightforward to achieve, such as an initiative to increase San Diego’s tree canopy cover to 35%, which would soak up carbon and help cool the city with more shade. Improvements to train and bike infrastructure should also prove popular, but a price tag has yet to be put on this. It’s likely that help from Californian or federal coffers will be required. Regardless of whether the target is met, San Diego is among a large group of cities impatient with federal government bickering over climate change. Municipalities from New York to San Francisco have goals to either majorly or completely switch to renewable energy, while Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, has spearheaded an international coalition of mayors that is looking to wean urban areas off fossil fuels. While a record number of nations have signed up to cut emissions, there is still a significant gap between their pledged action and what is required to avoid the worst ravages of climate change, such as drought, extreme weather events and sea level rise. Faulconer said this shortfall can be plugged, in part, by cities taking the lead. “Cities are leading the federal government, yes,” he said. “They are leading on innovation and policy. The technology is advancing incredibly quickly. We need to have our eyes wide open on this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/15/energy-secretary-blames-lib-dem-predecessor-for-solar-industry-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-15T18:29:22Z","webTitle":"Energy secretary blames Lib Dem predecessor for solar industry crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/15/energy-secretary-blames-lib-dem-predecessor-for-solar-industry-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/15/energy-secretary-blames-lib-dem-predecessor-for-solar-industry-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Energy secretary blames Lib Dem predecessor for solar industry crisis","bodyText":"Amber Rudd has blamed a mounting crisis in the solar industry on budget overruns by her Liberal Democrat predecessors that had forced her to slash spending. Under fire from all sides after a third solar business collapsed in one week, the Conservative energy and climate change secretary insisted on Thursday she was “always concerned about job losses”, but still thought solar energy had a great future in Britain. “It’s a great British success story and I believe it will continue to be so,” she added. Lisa Nandy, Labour’s shadow energy and climate secretary, said Rudd was suffering from acute short-sightedness in proposing to cut rooftop subsidies by 87% in one blow when the industry was close to self-sufficiency. However, Rudd said she also had a duty to protect consumers, despite Southern Solar following the Mark Group and Climate Energy in making redundancies as they called in the administrators or were liquidated. “I want to make sure that bill payers who pay for the subsidies are making the right contribution to solar and that they don’t overpay, so I’m doing a consultation at the moment to look at what might be the right level of support for solar,” she told a parliamentary press briefing. “I would add to that solar has had a large subsidy. Larger than expected under projections made in 2012 ... and there is less money available now because we’re working in an environment where we have to stay within budgets.” Rudd sought to lay the blame for the subsidy cuts on overspending by her Lib Dem predecessor Ed Davey, who ran the department for energy and climate change under the coalition government. “This was a Lib Dem run department under the coalition and therefore had a completely different complexion to other departments,” she said. “The first thing I did was try to get a grip on the spending.” “One of the key changes between having a Conservative secretary of state and a Lib Dem secretary of state [is that] I have got to stay within the budget.” Rudd said the amount spent on renewable energy subsidies under the last government represented “quite a significant overspend”. “That, I’m afraid, characterised the start of being secretary of state, reigning in those numbers,” she said. But writing in the Times on Thursday, former Conservative energy minister Greg Barker said that cuts to solar subsidies were “catastrophic”, adding: “Solar needs a bold plan, not just pruning shears.” Responding to his comments, Rudd said: “Solar has given a yield to people who put solar [panels] up of 10%. We are consulting on whether 10% of bill payers’ money going to support solar is too much. “In my consultation that is out at the moment ... we are looking at 4%. Greg Barker has taken the view that that isn’t enough. We’re looking at it and will respond once I’ve sufficiently digested what’s in the consultation.” However, Nandy said there was an even worst element to the solar debacle. “I have been contacted by people from across the renewable energy sector and they are telling me that these government policies are making the UK uninvestable in future,” said the Labour MP. “There are no long-term guarantees and it is not a stable environment for investors. While other countries around the world are moving forward [on low carbon energy] we are going backwards. This will damage our standing at the UN climate change talks coming up in Paris.” Howard Johns, the founder and chief executive of Southern Solar, said he had been forced to make more than 20 redundancies in the last of a series of cutbacks in a failed bid to save the company. “The demise of Southern Solar is the latest example of human misery generated by the misguided policies of the current government,” said Johns. “This is a direct result of the government’s recent announcements that kill off support for solar energy via the feed-in tariff scheme.” The administrators brought in to help wind up the Southern Solar business have confirmed that government policy changes to subsidy levels were mainly to blame. Jon Beard, from business rescue and recovery specialist Begbies Traynor, said: “It is without doubt that the removal of the feed-in tariff subsidy has had a significant impact on the business of the company.” A spokesman for the industry lobby group, the Solar Trade Association, said: “The government’s proposals for solar are so extreme that most solar companies are not able to envisage surviving next year. The few that can are looking to exit the UK.” Meanwhile employment lawyers, Morrish Solicitors, have been brought in to assist with potential financial claims against the Mark Group which collapsed into administration last week. Morrish believes that Mark, which 24 hours before administration had been owned by the giant SunEdison solar group, failed to provide 939 staff with proper notice before making them redundant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/nov/29/paris-climate-talks-innovation-climate-change-planet-investment","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-29T00:05:09Z","webTitle":"Innovation will save our warming planet – so where is the investment? | Will Hutton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/29/paris-climate-talks-innovation-climate-change-planet-investment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/29/paris-climate-talks-innovation-climate-change-planet-investment","fields":{"headline":"Innovation will save our warming planet – so where is the investment?","bodyText":"The most obvious response to climate change should be to transform the way the world generates energy. Living standards have risen 40 times over the last 250 years in the west, driven neither by the small state beloved of conservatives nor the large state favoured by socialists. Rather, the growth has resulted from a complicated interaction between capitalism and science and technology, of necessity publicly funded, creating wave after wave of transformations in the character of our economic base and the quality and quantity of what it produces. The same now has to be done for the world’s energy production. It needs to be technologically transformed to become as near carbon-free as possible, which will only work if there is a substantive global research and development effort led by governments, matching those of conquering space or winning a war, to explore the necessary technologies. Embracing global political solutions such as a global carbon tax or global emission caps are beyond political reach, given the range of entrenched interests, not to mention the stubborn refusal by many conservatives to accept climate change science. It will be innovation that will save the planet. This is the blisteringly obvious truth that should be written in neon in the skies above Paris at tomorrow’s launch of the 2015 UN climate change conference. Its goal is to try to agree binding agreements to limit the increase in global temperature to two degrees centigrade by 2100. Given the investment of Barack Obama, China’s President Xi, Germany’s Angela Merkel and 144 other global leaders in attending, and the plethora of commitments to lower carbon dioxide emissions beforehand, the conference is already likely to succeed, however partially. The issue, rather, is whether, with the range of interests that have to be assuaged, the agreements can be as universal and effective as they need to be. The good news is that, amazingly, 170 countries have produced some kind of response to the UN’s call for an “intended nationally determined contribution” (INDC). Before Paris, the world was set to produce some 65bn tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2030 compared with today’s 50bn tonnes, someone close to the negotiations told me, an increase that would have triggered a dangerous increase in global temperatures. Add up the INDCs and now the likely outcome in 2030 is 55bn tonnes. Even China and the US, hitherto both climate change recalcitrants, have made significant contributions, with China promising its emissions will peak in 2030, if not before, and the US agreeing to a 26% to 28% cut. It is good, but not enough to turn the global trends around. The task in Paris will be to convert those INDCs into harder and tougher commitments, get the 2030 projected aggregate to 50bn tonnes or lower, and then set the world on a trajectory to zero carbon emissions by 2100. If there are to be more than fancy conference promises then there have to be technologies available to replace burning fossil fuels. India, especially, has to be headed off from its plan to follow China’s path of economic development. Currently it burns as much coal as China did a generation ago; if in a generation’s time it burns as much as China does today, even allowing for more carbon efficiency, it will pump an extra 13bn tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. World temperatures would rise by nearer four than two degrees. But Prime Minister Modi is clear: if the choice is between poverty and climate change, India will choose the latter. The average Indian generates a quarter of the carbon emissions of an average European or Chinese and an eighth of an average American. India is determined to grow and it has huge and easily accessible coal reserves: it intends to burn them just as others burned theirs on their road to development. Modi’s point is dangerous if understandable, except India has another, even more abundant source of energy than coal: the sun. Solar energy used to be clunky and expensive; now plastic photovoltaic electricity and concentrated solar power are challenging that assumption. What is needed is the R&amp;D, along with investment in capacity, to turn solar into a major energy source as competitively priced as open-cast mined coal.But one of the consequences of privatisation is a collapse in energy R&amp;D. The CEGB and National Coal Board, for example, were great investors in scientific research. No more. Today, whether it’s energy utilities or solar equipment manufacturers, the sector spends less than 2% of its sales on R&amp;D compared with, say, 15% for pharmaceuticals. Privatisation has weakened the capacity to combat global warming. Thus the case for governments to fill the gap – the argument of “a global Apollo programme to combat climate change”, authored by Sir David King and lords Browne, Layard, O’Donnell, Rees, Stern and Turner. If global R&amp;D on energy was raised from $6bn to $15bn, focused on new build energy from renewables, principally solar, that could feed into national grids and be guided by a road map committee, the authors think solar energy could be grid competitive with coal as soon as 2022. India could grow as China has done – and world carbon dioxide emissions could definitely peak by 2030. $15bn may seem a far away target but, compared with the hundreds of billions of dollars of subsidies governments give fossil fuel production, it is trivial. Intriguingly the knight and six lords behind the Apollo programme may even be making progress with their argument: Obama and Bill Gates will announce on Monday in Paris a multibillion dollar public private fund, backed by more than a dozen countries along with companies and philanthropists, to back an Apollo-style programme for energy. Decarbonisation is going to become a big global market But India’s solar-powered grids, wind farms or even coal-powered fire stations that capture and store carbon (CCS) will not be built by the British, any more than those in the rest of Africa and Asia. Apart from nuclear, where Osborne last week announced an innovative programme to back small nuclear reactors where we do have some expertise, the story is of domestic retreat on renewables, cancellation of the £1bn CCS challenge fund and hiding behind the EU’s 2030 commitments on carbon emissions. Paris is emerging as a potentially important moment, but from which Britain is semi-detached. It is a moral obligation, global challenge and economic opportunity all going begging."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"childrens-books-site/2015/aug/07/astrosaurs-sunsnatchers-steve-cole-review","type":"article","sectionId":"childrens-books-site","sectionName":"Children's books","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-15T11:00:01Z","webTitle":"Astrosaurs: The Sun–Snatchers by Steve Cole – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/07/astrosaurs-sunsnatchers-steve-cole-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/childrens-books-site/2015/aug/07/astrosaurs-sunsnatchers-steve-cole-review","fields":{"headline":"Astrosaurs: The Sun–Snatchers by Steve Cole – review","bodyText":"This book is about space dinosaurs who go to a Wooly Rhino planet and discover one of the suns is missing.

Developed by researchers at Malaysia’s University of Malaya, the Eco-Greenergy outdoor lighting system consists of an LED street lamp that produces low levels of carbon dioxide to lure mosquitoes. Head researcher Chong Wen Tong says the smell of CO2, produced by combining ultraviolet light with titanium dioxide, is irresistible to mosquitoes. He says the level of CO2 emitted by the light is relatively low, and the benefits of the clean energy it provides outweigh the emissions. “The mosquito trap takes advantage of the mosquito’s sensory abilities by tricking them with features that mimic the odours associated with humans,” Chong says. “Decoyed mosquitoes enter the trap through the capture windows on the upper part, and then are strongly sucked into the capture net in the lower part by a suction fan. Once they are sucked into the capture net, they cannot fly away.” The light was developed primarily to fight dengue fever, the mosquito-borne viral disease that has increased 30-fold in the past 50 years. The disease has taken particular hold in Asia-Pacific countries, where 1.8 billion people are at risk. Malaysia experienced an unprecedented outbreak of dengue fever in 2015, which killed more than 200 people. In Asia, the economic cost of the disease is estimated at $2bn a year. Chong says the light’s ability to function on wind and solar energy makes it a viable option in developing countries. “For remote areas with no access to the electrical grid, this system can serve as a stand-alone, self-sustained renewable energy source to supply basic electricity needs. It is scalable to match the energy demand,” he says. Eight street lamps have been installed at the University of Malaya campus and other sites in Kuala Lumpur as part of a pilot programme. The research team says the first version of the light is ready for market and a licensing agreement with one private company has already been signed. Although LED lights can be expensive to buy and install, Chong argues that eliminating reliance on mains electricity provides a range of benefits, including a more reliable power supply in areas where blackouts are common. “Based on life-cycle analysis – electricity prices are relatively low in Malaysia – the payback period is six years. In urban settings, the installation of the conventional street lights requires landscape disruption in order to have electrical connection. With this invention, these indirect costs, such as trenching, cabling, rebuilding the landscape and maintenance, are minimised or eliminated,” he says. “Moreover, the battery, electrical wiring and controller have been designed to be placed on the top portion of the pole and this allows the system to continue functioning during floods. “For urban areas where the energy demand is very high, this invention helps to reduce the demand. And for remote communities with no access to electricity, it helps to generate energy for [its] basic needs,” he adds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/mar/28/arctic-sea-ice-record-low-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-28T20:13:18Z","webTitle":"Arctic sea ice extent breaks record low for winter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/28/arctic-sea-ice-record-low-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/mar/28/arctic-sea-ice-record-low-winter","fields":{"headline":"Arctic sea ice extent breaks record low for winter","bodyText":"A record expanse of Arctic sea never froze over this winter and remained open water as a season of freakishly high temperatures produced deep – and likely irreversible – changes on the far north. Scientists at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre said on Monday that the sea ice cover attained an average maximum extent of 14.52m sq km (5.607m sq miles) on 24 March, the lowest winter maximum since records began in 1979. The low beats a record set only last year of 14.54m sq km (5.612m sq miles), reached on 25 February 2015. “I’ve never seen such a warm, crazy winter in the Arctic,” said NSIDC director Mark Serreze. “The heat was relentless.” It was the third straight month of record lows in the sea ice cover, after extreme temperatures in January and February stunned scientists. The winter months of utter darkness and extreme cold are typically the time of maximum growth in the ice cap, until it begins its seasonal decline in spring. With the ice cover down to 14.54m sq km, scientists now believe the Arctic is locked onto a course of continually shrinking sea ice – and that is before the 2016 melt season gets underway. “If we are starting out very low that gives a jump on the melt season,” said Rick Thoman, the climate science manager for the National Weather Service’s Alaska region. “For the last few years, we have had extremely low ice cover in the summer. That means a lot more solar energy absorbed by the darker open water. That heat tends to carry over from year to year.” After this winter’s record ice lows, scientists now expect more than ever that the Arctic will be entirely ice-free in the summer months within 20 or 25 years. “Sometime in the 2030s or 2040s time frame, at least for a few days, you won’t have ice out there in the dead of summer,” said Dr John Walsh, chief scientist of the International Arctic Research Centre. Those changes are already evident on the ground. In 1975, there were only a few days a year when ships could move from Barrow to Prudhoe Bay off the north coast of Alaska. Now that window lasts months. The Arctic will always have ice in the winter months, Walsh said. But it will be thinner and more fragile than the multi-year ice, and less reliable for indigenous peoples who rely on the ice as winter transport routes or hunting platforms. “It’s not just about how many hundreds of thousands of square kilometres covered by the ice. It’s about the quality of that ice,” Thoman said. The extent of ice cover is a critical indicator of the changes taking place in the Arctic – but the shrinking of the polar ice carries sweeping consequences for lower latitudes as well. The bright white snow-covered ice reflects about 85% of sunlight back into the atmosphere, compared to the dark surfaces of the open water which absorb most of the heat energy. “Basically the polar regions are the refrigerator for the Earth,” said Dr Donald Perovich, a researcher at Dartmouth University. “They are extremely important for being able to keep the Arctic colder, and in turn help keep the rest of the planet colder.” Since 1980, however, the summer sea ice cover over the Arctic has gone into a drastic decline, from 7.8m sq km to 4.4m sq km in 2012, before rebounding slightly. “It would be as if the entire United States east of the Mississippi melted away plus the states from Minnesota down to Louisiana, past North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. It’s huge,” Perovich said. This winter scientists said the Arctic freeze stalled early on, across the polar seas. The sea ice extent was exceptionally low both in the Barents and the Bering seas – which in past years has been one of the most prolific producers of ice. And it was thinner, especially in the Beaufort sea north of Alaska, scientists said. There were a number of causes, in addition to the record high temperatures and carry-over effects of earlier ice loss. The El Niño weather system produced more warming, and the Arctic saw influxes of exceptionally warm water from the Pacific as well as the Atlantic side. In any event, Walsh said it was becoming increasingly clear the Arctic would never return to its previous frozen state, even if there are small gains in ice cover in a single year. “The balance is shifting to the point where we are not going back to the old regime of the 1980s and 1990s,” he said. “Every year has had less ice cover than any summer since 2007. That is nine years in a row that you would call unprecedented. When that happens you have to start thinking that something is going on that is not letting the system go back to where it used to be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/may/20/environmental-design-we-design-the-stuff-you-feel-not-the-stuff-you-see","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-20T05:08:13Z","webTitle":"How circadian rhythms and Roman baths are transforming Australian cities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/20/environmental-design-we-design-the-stuff-you-feel-not-the-stuff-you-see","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/20/environmental-design-we-design-the-stuff-you-feel-not-the-stuff-you-see","fields":{"headline":"How circadian rhythms and Roman baths are transforming Australian cities","bodyText":"Hidden beneath Federation Square, the heart of civic Melbourne, is a complex labyrinth of concrete cells. This labyrinth – the world’s largest de-coupled airside thermal storage system –acts like a rechargeable battery. On summer evenings it stores cool night air to use during warm days and, in winter, daytime heat to use at night.The apparatus was inspired by Roman bath and cave systems used more than 2,000 years ago that fed naturally cooled air to ancient villas in northern Italy. Opened in 2002 and costing $400m, Federation Square’s labyrinth has since paid for itself seven times over, according to Atelier Ten, the global environmental design consultants behind the design. In 2014, when five consecutive days topped 40C, temperatures in the Atrium above it stayed at a comfortable 28C – without any artificial cooling. Founded in London in 1990, Atelier Ten has collaborated with architects ranging from the late Zaha Hadid to Foster and Partners. In 2005, they established Australian offices in Sydney, led by American-born environmental designer Paul Stoller. The company’s philosophy is to design structures that “tread more lightly on the planet”. “We design the stuff you feel, not the stuff you see,” says Stoller. Examples include controlling the smell, the temperature, the acoustics and the air quality of an environment, not to mention its energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. The firm has identified three key principals in creating top-notch buildings: preventing environmental harm, protecting occupant health and promoting occupant wellness. That includes improving circulation, an abundance of natural daylight, access to views, removing harmful substances in materials, water and air, and design that can help to reduce carbon footprint. In 2012 Gardens by the Bay opened in Singapore. The SGD$1bn national botanical gardens are housed in two vast glass domes. Plants that usually grow in cool mountain climes had to flourish in hot, humid, tropical Singapore, making the conservatory, particularly one of this scale, an eco nightmare. Yet Atelier Ten came up with a novel solution: to use the waste trimmings from Singapore’s street trees that had, up until then, filled landfill sites – and turn that wood into biomass energy used to cool the domes. Meanwhile, steel “super trees” jut into the skyline. These chimneys not only look striking, making Gardens by the Bay an architectural landmark, but, like real trees, have multiple purposes, says Stoller. “First, they collect solar energy through the photovoltaic array ‘canopies’; second, they discharge hot and humid air through chimneys in their ‘trunks’; third, they serve as an armature for native vegetation, which clings to the ‘bark’ as it climbs toward the sky.” The conservatories have been certified as carbon neutral with the help of these systems. Yet Stoller warns that for other developments to achieve carbon neutrality they need to think beyond territorial boundaries. As with the innovative use of tree trimmings at Gardens by the Bay, resources and technologies of the scale needed to make an impact are often only available outside the direct site. “Sustainability is going to suffer from this idea that the ideal neighbourhood or development is about doing everything yourself – generating your own power,” says Stoller. “That is simply not possible. You have to share resources.” Stoller, who teaches environmental design at Sydney’s UTS school of architecture, believes everyone must reduce the demand for energy. Yet acting sustainably does not mean having to plump for a lower quality of life or, contrary to popular opinion, doing everything themselves. It just requires them to be smarter, using better design. To that end, Atelier Ten has its own tech research lab, “more often a building site than a back room with gizmos and test tubes”, says Stoller with a laugh. The company has been a pioneer in the “wellness movement”. This is not just about creating spaces that don’t make us ill. It is also about creating spaces that are enjoyable to be in, and hopefully lead to happier, more productive workers. Circadian health is one key wellness topic at the research lab, with the lighting design team at Atelier Ten pioneering varying light temperatures that emulate natural cycles to improve the indoor health of occupants. That came into play in Adelaide’s futuristic $200m South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI). There, the spaceship-esque eco-façade became a solar-responsive building skin. It balances daylight levels within the interior while providing views across the city. Studies have shown that better indoor air quality, with high ventilation rates and low concentrations of CO2 and pollutants, can lead to productivity improvements of up to 11%, according to the World Green Building Council. “It’s easy in the discussion to focus on technologies, wizardries, and not on people. What’s good about wellness is that it squarely focuses us back on people,” says Stoller. Changing attitudes is fundamental – particularly in the built environment, where the property and construction industries are highly risk-averse due to the vast costs involved. A new generation of net-zero buildings are showing that taking the plunge does have tangible benefits. They can now generate as much energy on site as they use through super insulated walls, solar control windows, LED lighting, ultra low-energy HVAC and rooftop PV. Attitudes are also changing, slowly, in big mixed-use developments. Sydney’s Barangaroo South, for example, has been awarded six stars in the Green Star sustainability rating system. The developer has committed to carbon-neutral operations and water-positive operations, so that the site will export more unpotable (recycled) water than it imports potable water. This is important in dry climates like Australia “where drought is always a threat”, explains Stoller. “Having the ability to generate one’s own non-potable water ensures that there is a reliable supply.” Stoller insists that use of the systems like Green Star sustainability rating and its American equivalent LEED, means “buildings are meeting a minimum level of quality, which is a lot more than they would be doing otherwise”. But there is still a long way to go. As he notes, there remains a “lot of sick buildings”."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2016/jan/27/un-urges-business-leaders-to-double-investment-in-green-energy-by-2020","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-27T15:00:08Z","webTitle":"UN urges business leaders to double investment in green energy by 2020","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/27/un-urges-business-leaders-to-double-investment-in-green-energy-by-2020","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jan/27/un-urges-business-leaders-to-double-investment-in-green-energy-by-2020","fields":{"headline":"UN urges business leaders to double investment in green energy by 2020","bodyText":"The United Nations urged global business leaders on Wednesday to double investment in wind and solar energy to $600bn (£400bn) a year by 2020. One month after the Paris climate agreement, Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, told business leaders they needed to act decisively to hasten the transition away from the fossil fuel economy – or they would put the historic accord in jeopardy. “I call on the investor community to build on the strong momentum from Paris and seize the opportunities for clean energy growth,” Ban told a UN investors’ meeting in prepared remarks. “I challenge investors to double – at a minimum – their clean energy investments by 2020.” Global clean energy investment attracted a record $329bn last year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. But Ban told the New York meeting that was still not fast enough to build the new green infrastructure that would enable countries to meet the Paris goal of limiting warming to below 2C. He said it was time for investors and fund managers to move from “aspiration to action”. The gathering today of about 500 investors, organised by the Ceres sustainable business network, was the third stop for Ban and other UN officials this month on an itinerary designed to get business leaders firmly behind the Paris climate agreement, after meetings in Abu Dhabi and Davos. Under the agreement, 196 governments agreed on the 2C goal, an aspirational goal of 1.5C, and to build a net-zero carbon economy in the second half of the century. Rich countries committed to providing climate finance, and all countries committed to revisiting and strengthening their national climate goals, starting as early as 2018. But the commitments made at Paris would at best cap warming to 2.7C. Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief, who will also address investors on Wednesday, and other leaders, have acknowledged that governments cannot finance the economic transformation, and that mobilising support from business leaders was a critical component of the Paris agreement. The message to those business leaders underlined at the Davos and Abu Dhabi gatherings and again in New York on Wednesday was that, left unchecked, climate change posed a dangerous risk, and that there were business opportunities in the transition to a clean energy economy. In Davos, some 750 experts gathering for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum declared a climate catastrophe to be the single biggest threat to the global economy in 2016. A few days earlier, the annual meeting of the International Renewable Energy Agency in Abu Dhabi was told that doubling renewable energy to 36% of the global energy mix by 2030 would take countries halfway to the Paris goal of limiting warming to 2C, and increase global GDP by up to $1.3tn. “We had this extraordinary agreement in Paris, we have got points on the horizon,” Rachel Kyte, the UN special envoy for sustainable energy, who will also address investors, said on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi meetings. “Now we have got to get down to the nitty gritty of long term development of the low carbon economy and that is a lot less sexy in some respects than things negotiated last year.” The International Energy Agency estimated it will cost the global energy industry $16.5tn by 2030 to make the switch from high-polluting power plants to wind and solar electricity generation, required by governments’ commitments at Paris. But a number of experts, including those of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, say the prices on new wind and solar projects are coming down - and could come down even further if there is a dramatic increase in investment. Ceres said business leaders needed to start moving now to take advantage of those new greener markets. “Ultimately, global investment portfolios need to shift far more capital to low-carbon business activity and away from risky high-carbon sectors that may perform poorly in the years ahead,” Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, said in prepared remarks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/24/olafur-eliasson-little-sun-charge-mobile-phone-charger","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-24T07:00:10Z","webTitle":"Olafur Eliasson and the power of the sun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/24/olafur-eliasson-little-sun-charge-mobile-phone-charger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/24/olafur-eliasson-little-sun-charge-mobile-phone-charger","fields":{"headline":"Olafur Eliasson and the power of the sun","bodyText":"Installation artist Olafur Eliasson was born in Copenhagen in 1967 to Icelandic parents. He is best known for creating a giant sun in Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall in 2003, viewed by more than 2 million people, and for making four dramatic waterfalls in New York harbour in 2008. In 2012, he launched Little Sun solar-powered lamps for areas of the globe with no electricity (though they have also proved popular at music festivals in the developed world). This month, he releases the Little Sun Charge, which uses solar energy to power mobile phones. How successful has the Little Sun lamp been? Right now, for every lamp we sell in on-grid areas of the world – where people have access to power, like the UK – we deliver two lamps at cost price in, for instance, rural Africa. And in May, we expect to cross the half-a-million-lamps line. That’s our next little target. There’s an alarming statistic that an evening of breathing in the emissions from a kerosene lamp is similar to smoking two packs of cigarettes. Not to mention the CO2 that kerosene produces. Do you feel Little Sun is making a difference yet? It’s exciting because when you are talking of hundred of thousands of Little Suns, the impact on the amount of kerosene or petroleum used, then it’s a different scale. Because one Little Sun obviously, one wonders does that even matter? But if we talk about 100,000 Little Suns in use... The new Little Sun Charge will sell in developed countries for ₧99. How will it be affordable in Africa? Of course it’s €99 or £78 when you buy it in Europe or the UK. That money goes to paying shipment and import taxes, so that we can drive the charger into the hands of people in Africa at around US$22-24. Phones, communication, the internet is exploding on the continent and this is so exciting. Every single person we’ve shown the solar lamp to says, “We love the fact it’s affordable, but we’d pay almost anything to charge our phones.” Because if the light goes out, you can still light a candle or turn on the petroleum light. But if you lose power, you cannot charge your phone. There’s nothing you can do: if the power’s gone, the phone is dead. You’re primarily an artist, so why did you want to get involved in a philanthropic project like this? I was fortunate to enjoy a lot of exposure in that incredible resource-full part of the art world, where, let’s face it, there’s quite a bit of wealth. So on one side I felt privileged and yet I also wanted to see if I could test my creative muscle and make it useful in other situations. And, frankly speaking, I say that Little Sun is a work of art that works in life. How does your work with Little Sun connect with, say, a bridge in Copenhagen or the sun at Tate Modern? Or doesn’t it? Oh, it absolutely does connect. First of all, because I made both! That’s a nice connection. But secondly, the Tate Modern and the bridge for that matter, it’s about public spaces, it’s about social spaces. It’s about exercising diversity and inclusion at the same time. When I did the project at the Tate, it was about this feeling where I am reconnected somehow, but not to some God, not to some external mystic trajectory. I am reconnected to the other people. There’s a strong environmentalist element in your work. How optimistic are you that the message is getting through? Well, I’m a part of a dialogue. That’s why I brought the glacial ice from Greenland to the 2015 United Nations climate change conference in Paris [Ice Watch], so that people could put their hands on the ice. I was being very banal but they could literally feel on their own skin the water the politicians are actually talking about. Why do you say “banal”? I love it when people say, “Oh, I could have done this…” because that means that at least the thought that they might do something like that is not impossible to them [laughs]. There’s an archery target in your studio in Berlin. Can you explain what role that plays in your creative process? Ha! Well, I have been practising archery for some years on and off, in my own hobbyistic, inconsequential way. And occasionally I ask the target – where the bullseye is yes and the rest is no – whether I should begin a project or delay. Then it’s up to my attention to drive the yes. Generally I try to follow it, because sometimes your wish has a superficial nature. Because you sometimes say yes to be nice. So it’s a way for me to test, “Do I really mean it?” And occasionally I shoot a few extra arrows just to check. Do you plan any more Little Sun projects? Oh yeah, the project is for sure evolving. We are currently getting great advice from MIT, which has taken Little Sun in as a sort of methodology study object. So we have lots of ideas… Our challenge is that we have too many ideas.

Last weekend, the world’s governments agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions in a momentous pact aiming at holding global warming to 2C. While oil and gas associations professed themselves happy with a Paris agreement they believe gives a fillip to natural gas prospects, the coal industry fears it will be squashed by a clean energy juggernaut. In his letter, Brian Ricketts, Euracoal’s secretary-general, lashed out at what he called “mob rule” by a cabal of world governments and protesters at the Paris climate summit which posed a threat to democracy itself. “The world is being sold a lie, yet most people seem to accept the lie, even if they do not believe it,” Ricketts warned. “The UN has successfully brainwashed most of the world’s population such that scientific evidence, rational analysis, enlightened thinking and common sense no longer matter.” “You might be relieved that the agreement is weak,” he went on. “Don’t be. The words and legal basis no longer matter. Fossil fuels are [being] portrayed by the UN as public enemy number one. We are witnessing a power bid by people who see the democratic process as part of the problem and have worked out ways to bypass it.” Ricketts is an affable and respected figure on the Brussels lobby scene, and campaigners suggested that stress and industry desperation may have played a part in his outburst. In the aftermath of the Paris agreement, shares in coal firms plunged rapidly. Peabody, the world’s largest coal firm, saw stock values drop 12.6%, while Consol Energy holdings was down by 3.3%. Renewable energy companies rose modestly on the markets, with the MAC global solar energy index up 4.5%. A Monday morning investor note from Barclays said that “investor momentum around portfolio decarbonisation will likely continue to build.” But the US Oil &amp; Gas Index also increased its value in the first day of trading after COP21, finishing 0.2% higher, due to expectations of more fuel switching from coal to gas, a less carbon-intensive fossil fuel. “An optimist sees in every difficulty an opportunity,” said Patrick Pouyanné, the CEO of French oil giant Total SA. “I’m definitely an optimist; I have to be.” Beate Raabe, the secretary-general of Eurogas, a trade association which represents BP, Shell and Total in Brussels, hailed the Paris deal as “a major step in the right direction” and called for new market-based mechanisms to help leverage investment in the industry. European trades unions, however, raised concerns about the equity of the agreement in a letter sent to the European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, seen by the Guardian. “The absence of unambiguous support from the EU negotiators towards proposals, for instance from Canada, to retain references to just transition and decent work in the operational part of the agreement has been extremely disappointing,” said Luca Visentini, the general secretary of the European Trades Union Confederation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/feb/05/welsh-home-installs-uks-first-tesla-powerwall-storage-battery","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-05T09:52:39Z","webTitle":"Welsh home installs UK's first Tesla Powerwall storage battery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/05/welsh-home-installs-uks-first-tesla-powerwall-storage-battery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/feb/05/welsh-home-installs-uks-first-tesla-powerwall-storage-battery","fields":{"headline":"Welsh home installs UK's first Tesla Powerwall storage battery","bodyText":"The setting is decidedly modest: a utility room in a red-brick house at the end of a cul-de-sac in Wales.

Householder Mark Kerr has become the first British owner of a Tesla Powerwall, a cutting-edge bit of kit that the makers say will provide a “missing link” in solar energy. Like many owners of solar panels, Kerr and his family have a basic problem. They tend to be out at work and school when the sun is shining and the 16 solar panels on the roof of their home in Cardiff are producing power. The excess they miss out on is fed into the grid and they make a return on it but it does not seem right that they do not get to use the power from their panels. However, from now, energy produced but not used during the day will charge the Powerwall and can then be used to provide them with the energy they need when they’re at home and their lights, music centres, computers, televisions and myriad other devices need feeding. A self-confessed tech-head and an electrician by trade, Kerr could hardly contain his excitement when the Powerwall arrived. “This is the future, definitely,” he said. “For me this is the logical next step. We have the solar panels but we need a way to make best use of the power they produce.” “Me and my family are all out in the day, and we are not making use of the enormous amount of clean energy that our solar panels produce. The battery will allow us to store the energy we don’t use in the day to use when we need it in the evenings.” There are other battery systems on the market, but since its launch in California last year by Tesla’s billionaire founder, Elon Musk, the Powerwall has gathered something of a cult following. Kerr is clearly a disciple: “It’s a gorgeous-looking piece of technology, its design is very sleek and minimalistic and something you can hang on the wall like a piece of art, definitely nothing like some of the other clunky looking batteries.” If Kerr’s partner, Lyndsey, finds him missing one evening, it sounds like she may find him gazing at his new gizmo. There is a growing school of thought that 2016 could be the year of energy storage. At one end of the scale are large schemes – such as Highview Power Storage project, due to start generating power next month by turning air to liquid and back again, driving a turbine in the process. At the other end of the scale is Kerr’s utility room. The 7kWh Powerwall is a lithium-ion-battery system invented by the company that has popularised electric sports cars. Not one to underplay his products, Tesla CEO Musk heralded the battery as “a fundamental transformation [in] how energy is delivered across the Earth”. A company called Solar Plants, based in Port Talbot, south Wales, has installed Kerr’s Powerwall. Its managing director, Oliver Farr, said it had e-mailed 3,000 customers about the device. Of the 1,500 who opened the e-mail, 600 said they wanted one. “There is a lifestyle element to it,” said Farr. “It’s like people who have an iPhone wanting an Apple Watch.” Kerr’s is a freebie. Farr said he wanted to check how it worked before he sold it to other customers. He is not putting a price on it yet either. At the launch event, Musk said it cost $3,500. But this does not take into account the cost of the switchgear needed to make it work, and installation costs. Some experts both in the UK and Australia have suggested it could be more than a decade - the length of warranty - before the Powerwall pays for itself. The number-crunchers will not put Kerr off. He believes that his solar panels have already reduced his electricity bills by 20% and thinks the addition of the Powerwall might lead to a total reduction of 80%. “But it’s not just about the money. We’re environmentally minded and this seems the right thing to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2016/may/06/surfing-perfect-wave-kelly-slater","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2016-05-06T21:27:37Z","webTitle":"Is surfing ready for Kelly Slater's 'perfect' artificial wave project?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/06/surfing-perfect-wave-kelly-slater","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2016/may/06/surfing-perfect-wave-kelly-slater","fields":{"headline":"Is surfing ready for Kelly Slater's 'perfect' artificial wave project?","bodyText":"The wave curls, whip-fast and flawless; it goes on, and on, and on. Inside it, surfing in the barrel of the wave – the feeling, the high, that surfers yearn for – is Nat Young, an American pro-surfer, ranked ninth in the world. Above him, a drone films his run – 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds. It was the longest barrel of his life. Young had never surfed a wave like this before. Yet this was 110 miles from the ocean, in California farm country in a specially constructed, exquisitely engineered freshwater pool. And it was perfect. “It’s an awesome feeling,” Young told the Guardian. The pool was built by 11-time World Surf League champion Kelly Slater, who for 10 years had been focused on an idea that many thought was impossible – building a machine which could reproduce the ideal wave, and create it on command. Few people thought it was possible. But in December, after two years of construction in near perfect secrecy, Slater released an extraordinary video of his machine in action. The excitement the video caused in the surfing community is hard to overstate. “That thing basically broke the internet,” said Craig Brokensha, surf forecaster for surfing news site Swellnet. In that video, the wave curls over silently, dark and mysterious in the early morning light. The water from which it rises is glass-flat; the wave’s curling edge is smooth, sharp, almost sculptural. “It is,” Brokensha said, “almost too perfect.” “It’s the most bizarre-looking thing you’ve ever seen,” said Tom Lowe, a British professional surfer. “A robotic wave which goes forever.” Lowe watched the first video, when it came out in December, 20 times over. “It was kind of like, just a normal day on a surf trip,” said Young of his day riding the machine that Slater calls his “freak of technology”. “We woke up pretty early, 6 or 6.30, had some food, some coffee, got the wave pool up and running, and we went and we surfed. “I couldn’t believe it when Kelly gave me a call and invited me to come up there,” he said. “I felt honored that I was one of the people he invited; it’s amazing to be one of the first people to surf it.” Young was joined by WSL women’s champion Carissa Moore, Californian pro Kanoa Igarashi and Robert “Wingnut” Weaver, a veteran American surfer who starred in the 1994 surf movie Endless Summer II. Young said the narrowness of the pool – 700 yards long, but only 40 or so yards wide – struck him when he saw it in person. “My first impression, when I saw the first wave come through, was disbelief,” he said. “It’s a flat pond, and then, all of a sudden, you’re watching a perfect wave.” Slater’s machine is powered entirely with solar energy, and the wave itself is created with a specially shaped foil or plough, which is pulled along mechanically beneath the surface, shaping the wave and pushing it forward. Nick Houndsfield is founder and CEO of The Wave, a British-based company currently constructing their own artificial surf pool in Bristol. He said that wave machines have been around for 40 years, but that it is only in the last 15 years or so that the technology has been good enough to make waves suitable for surfing. The Wave’s Bristol project will use pneumatics – pulsating the water for constant waves, rather than the displacement foil Slater used. The difference, Houndsfield said, is that pneumatics create a variety of waves near constantly, while Kelly’s foil displacement system creates just the one – albeit eerily perfect – breaker. “What [Slater has] produced right now is mind-bending,” Houndsfield said. “It is brilliant – but it is brilliant for professional surfers. I’m not going to be sticking my kid in it any time soon.” The technology is extraordinary; but while Young said that it was a paradigm shift in terms of bringing surfing to areas distant from the sea, Houndsfield disagreed. “I can count on two hands the number of people I know that could surf a high, perfect, barreling wave, day in, day out,” he said. This might change however. Surfing has exploded in popularity over the past 20 years, with an estimated 500,000 regular surfers in the UK alone. “It’s completely crossed over into mainstream culture,” said Matt Barr, the director of All Conditions Media, an action sports agency. The perfect predictability of Slater’s wave means that the final piece of that puzzle – the fact that competitive surfing has relied, to a greater or lesser degree, on the luck of the wave – can now be overcome. “The problem with surfing is it’s so unpredictable,” Barr said. “If you can build this at an Olympic city, you’ve got a surfing event.” Young, who rode Slater’s wave this week in a VIP session along with several other pro surfers and executives in the World Surfing League, also agreed. “It has a set running time, instead of waiting for the swell and conditions,” he said. “So, that’s huge. And being able to recreate the same wave over and over gives people an even playing field – because it’s sometimes a bit of luck catching waves [in the ocean].” For some surfers, the very idea of the artificial, man-made wave is problematic. “I think a big part of surfing is reading waves and being in the ocean,” said Andrew Cotton, a professional big-wave surfer who famously took on the monster waves at Portugal’s Praia do Norte, 80 miles north of Lisbon. “The one in California looks absolutely amazing – it’s like the dream wave. Any surfer would be excited to surf it,” said Cotton. “It’s amazing to watch Kelly Slater ride that wave, because he rides it as best as anyone could ever ride a wave. But it’s amazing watching Kelly Slater ride, full-stop. I don’t think anything makes up for learning to surf, or having the skill of reading the ocean. That’s surfing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/davehillblog/2016/mar/07/london-mayor-race-high-ideals-and-deep-denials-at-green-alliance-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-07T08:37:02Z","webTitle":"London mayor race: high ideals and deep denials at Green Alliance debate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/mar/07/london-mayor-race-high-ideals-and-deep-denials-at-green-alliance-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/mar/07/london-mayor-race-high-ideals-and-deep-denials-at-green-alliance-debate","fields":{"headline":"London mayor race: high ideals and deep denials at Green Alliance debate","bodyText":"All mayoral candidates say they want a greener London, so which has the best ideas for achieving this and which is the most likely to deliver? The Green Alliance think tank held a hustings at 1 Wimpole Street with Liberal Democrat Caroline Pidgeon, Conservative Zac Goldsmith, Labour’s Sadiq Khan and the Green Party’s Sian Berry on the panel. James O’Brien of LBC Radio chaired. Candidates’ hopes, dreams, bold assertions and no go areas regarding some of the main themes are compared and contrasted below. Congestion charging This is one of the two environment policy areas that make politicians most nervous, in spite of strong arguments that embracing it would be good for London. It isn’t only the green lobby that would like to see more congestion charging in the capital. A range of organisations, including the RAC Foundation, London First, the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Institution of Civil Engineers believe that an expanded and more advanced road-pricing system is desirable for economic as well as for air quality reasons. Even Boris Johnson’s transport strategy accepts that more congestion charging needs to be considered. The problem is that, like any other curb on motorists, opposition to it can be fierce. That makes advocating it a risky proposition for mayoral candidates with serious chances of winning. Goldsmith has ruled it out following remarks he made to LBC last year which sounded like support for the idea. Khan has not proposed it. By contrast, Pidgeon has argued for increasing the current charge, particularly in peak hours on polluting vehicles, and for piloting a new charging zone round Heathrow airport. And Berry is the boldest on this issue. She challenged fellow candidates to commit to “a new and smarter distance-based road charging system” in London with the money raised funding more cycling, walking and public transport. “We can’t do without traffic reduction measures in London and we can’t reduce air pollution with green vehicles alone,” she said. Building on the green belt This makes London politicians even more nervous than congestion charging. All four candidates say they would preserve the green belt, which takes up 22% of Greater London territory. Goldsmith has claimed that Khan can’t be trusted to do this and insisted that he can double house-building to 50,000 new homes a year by 2020 without reassigning any green belt land. That does not accord with the findings of a joint report by housing charity Shelter and planning consultants Quod, which advises many of London’s major property companies. They find that there simply isn’t enough brownfield land in London to enable a 50,000 a year target to be hit: “Any attempt to rely on brownfield land alone is doomed to fail.” A great deal of green belt land is taken up with golf courses, pony clubs and even farming. Much of it isn’t even very green and little of it is freely accessible to the public. According to the Shelter/Quod report, persuading boroughs to redesignate some of its green belt would have to be part of any realistic plan to get 50,000 new homes built in London each year, which is the minimum target London needs to hit. Economist Paul Cheshire has calculated that a massive 1.6 million new homes could be built at average densities on London green belt space if just a fraction of its 32,500 hectares was reclassified. Yet no candidate will commit to looking seriously at doing this. Such is the harmful power of the green belt taboo. Buses, cabs and diesel fumes The candidates were asked to commit to phasing out all diesel black cabs and private hire vehicles (PHVs) by 2020 and to have the entire London bus fleet running on clean fuel by 2025. Doing this would mean a big step up from current policy. All new black cabs and PHVs will have to have a “zero emissions” capacity from January 2018 but diesel ones bought before that date could, as Goldsmith pointed out, still be around for years. “You can’t just push them off the road because you’ll push a lot of black cab drivers out of business,” he continued, adding that many are “right up against it anyway” because of “unfair competition with the likes of Uber.” He said the obvious solution was to retrofit those vehicles to run on liquified petroleum gas: this would cost around £6,000 per cab, but would pay for itself within three years at most. On buses, he pledged that every one in Greater London would be “at the very least” compliant with the requirements of the forthcoming Ultra Low Emissions Zone (ULEZ) by 2025, through a combination of new buses coming on stream and retrofitting. Pidgeon would want Transport for London (TfL) to “bulk buy huge numbers” of the latest, Chinese-made, electric cabs, which will become available next year in order to keep their prices down and would “look to help drivers in terms of subsidy.” She said there are single decker electric buses in use around the world and that London’s should be replaced with these “straight away,” along with piloting double deckers. She also stressed the importance of increasing the number of charging points for electric vehicles. Berry agreed that it was “only fair” that cab drivers should get the scrappage and retrofit grants they are seeking and said it was not acceptable that, as things stand, there would be over 2000 diesel buses still on London’s roads in 2020. Khan warned that “we need to be realistic” about how many drivers would upgrade to new greener cabs, because taxis are expensive even at a discount price. But he wants to introduce ULEZ sooner than 2020 and look at expanding it to cover wider arterial roads. He criticised the cost of Boris Johnson’s New Routemaster and invited the audience to “imagine the race there would be” among bus manufacturers to produce an electric bus for not only London but many other cities” instead. He also favoured “clean bus corridors,” with new generations of buses introduced on to the most polluted routes. He is not, however, scoring very well with the Clean Air in London campaign, which gives him four out of ten so far compared with eight for Berry and seven for Pidgeon. He’s doing better than Goldsmith, though. The noted environmentalist is trailing on just 3.25 out of ten. Increasing walking and cycling Berry said investment in making all London’s town centres better for walking should match what’s gone into Mayor Johnson’s Outer London “mini-Holland” cycling schemes and an investment levy raised on supermarkets. She stressed the importance of building support at local level for the introduction of cycling infrastructure and other street improvements to ensure they command public support. Goldsmith too spoke about the three mini-Holland schemes. He judged the one in his parliamentary patch in Kingston, which was secured when Richmond Council was in Lib Dem hands, to be “wildly popular” with residents because “they did a good consultation job.” He contrasted this with the Enfield scheme which he said is “really, really unpopular and all the data suggests it’s been handled incredibly badly.” Why? “Because I don’t believe the ‘top-down’ approach works. You have to work with communities.” He made the same point about walking: “I am a localist and I will work with local authorities on their own schemes for walkability and making walking safer.” He said cycling injuries are “not just about infrastructure” and that action was required to remove HGVs from roads during peak travel times. Pidgeon, who has already pledged a heavy goods and construction vehicle peak hours ban, wants “much more of London pedestrianised” and complained that “cycling and walking is buried in basically the bus directorate at TfL. The people who run it are bus men. What are they interested in? Buses.” She’d like walking and cycling given the same prominence. She wants to promote play streets and drew attention to the slow rate at which road crossings had been adapted to help visually impaired people. Khan said he would install a “pedestrian champion” in City Hall. He invited people to think of the parts of the Thames and “green corridors” you can’t walk along “because it has become private land” and parts of London you can’t walk through because of roads. “We need to think differently about how London can work.” He praised the King’s Cross redevelopment for its public realm element. Like the others, he enthused about Mayor Johnson’s cycle superhighways and called for more quiet routes, cycle bridges and storage space. The solar power city Another challenge put to the candidates was to make London a “world-leading solar city” with a 10-fold increase in solar capacity, meaning something like 200,000 solar rooftops. All four accepted it and also talked more widely about energy policy. Khan, calling for a “far more ambitious” approach to solar, said he would set up a City Hall unit called “Energy for Londoners” which would look at a policy for all public buildings in London. He thinks London’s solar energy output, which he said was just 1% of the total at present, could be increased to 20% “without too much trouble.” He praised the use of solar at Blackfriars Bridge and in the Olympic Park, pointing out that TfL land could accommodate many photovoltaic cells and criticising government cuts to solar programme subsidy. He also praised the on-site combined heat and power plant at King’s Cross and the green energy centre on Islington’s Bunhill estate. Asked about the effect of government cuts, Goldsmith said that solar, which he’d written about in The Ecologist magazine in 1996, was now an economic proposition and would be more so “if we can negotiate to get rid of the tariffs in Europe that prevent us from getting the cheapest solar energy from China.” He acknowledged that mayors can’t make that happen but said that they could negotiate with local authorities to make roof space available across the city and write “the highest possible standards” into the London Plan for new buildings, “not just for solar but all energy efficiency.” Pidgeon said she would have “a solar task force” to audit all buildings with the GLA group of partner organisations and challenge the capital’s larger private sector organisations to do more. Help should be given through the planning process. “We need to develop a London feed-in tariff,” she said, to encourage to uptake of small scale renewable and low-carbon electricity generation and move forward the process of City Hall itself becoming a junior electricity supplier. Berry, who didn’t get much time to address the question, said she’d aim for 30% of London’s electricity to be from solar power by 2030. She said the capital had fallen behind under Johnson, and the same was true of home insulation, producing “really high levels of fuel poverty.” And finally, Europe One of the more striking moments of the event came when O’Brien asked each candidate to name the most dangerous policy position adopted by an opponent. Khan moved very fast to pick Goldsmith’s decision to campaign to leave the European Union. This produced a large round of applause and served as a reminder that Brussels is seen by many as both a leader and a protector on environmental issues in the UK. It’s hard to know to what extent candidates’ stances on the EU referendum will affect the mayoral vote either way, but it seems that Goldsmith’s position won’t help him with the section of the London electorate represented at 1 Wimpole Street."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2016/jun/06/10-best-mountain-cabins-lodges-europe-france-spain-italy","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-06T05:30:01Z","webTitle":"10 of the best mountain cabins and lodges in Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jun/06/10-best-mountain-cabins-lodges-europe-france-spain-italy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2016/jun/06/10-best-mountain-cabins-lodges-europe-france-spain-italy","fields":{"headline":"10 of the best mountain cabins and lodges in Europe","bodyText":"Loen, Norway By a tranquil lake, near the village of Loen in western Norway, this cosy wood cabin is the perfect base to explore the spectacular geography of the region.

The briefings even gave rise to speculation that Adani Enterprises, which has previously flagged spending $4.1bn on the Carmichael mine in north Queensland, might abandon its plans for the mine altogether amid a huge move by the company into solar energy. A note from an Axis Capital stock analyst who was briefed by Adani Enterprises management on Tuesday gave valuations of the company stock that included one factoring in a “write-off of [its] dormant investment in Australia coalmine”. “Management mentioned that further investments in its Australian coalmine project shall be dependent on visibility of revival in global coal prices,” it said. Axis said that, despite the Carmichael mine receiving environmental clearance from the Queensland government this week, no major capital expenditure was expected “in the near term”, meaning until after June. Adani Enterprises has already announced solar projects worth US$16b – more than the total A$16.5b flagged investment in the Carmichael mine and accompanying rail and port expansion. The indefinite pause in its mine investment came as Queensland’s Liberal National party opposition called on the state government to urgently grant a mining lease. The leader of the LNP, Lawrence Springborg, said the resources minister, Anthony Lynham, was “dragging the chain” on the lease approval while “tens of thousands of direct and indirect jobs are on the line and the state is missing out on the billions of dollars the Carmichael project could be pumping into the state’s economy”. Tim Buckley, a former Citibank analyst now working with the pro-renewable energy Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said the numbers revealed in the company’s December 2015 quarter results meant it had “a very remote prospect” of funding a new multibillion-dollar coalmine. Buckley said no financial institution was going to finance Adani’s Australian coal venture in the face of a Indian electricity sector transformation, whereby record growth in domestic coal production and record high inventories would trigger a rapid fall in Indian coal imports this year. Adani must show “financial closure” on its project before the Queensland government will allow dredging of Great Barrier Reef waters to expand its Abbot Point port. Buckley noted that Adani Enterprises’ net debt of US$2.5b was double the market value of the company, itself down 44 per cent in the nine months to December 2015 to just US$1.2b. Net profit in the same period dropped 21 per cent to US$129m. However, the company was “on track to commission the world’s largest solar project”, a US$650m, 648MW project in Tamil Nadu from next month, which Buckley said was part of a “massive strategic shift” into Indian solar projects. “This suggests both Adani Enterprises’ focus on and capacity to finance Carmichael is more remote with every month, particularly with the ongoing collapse in coal import demand and prices,” Buckley said. A spokesman for Adani’s Australian arm, when asked if he could confirm the Indian parent’s position that further investment hinged on a coal market rebound, responded with a statement referring only to the need to obtain regulatory certainty obtaining government approvals amid legal challenges by conservation groups. He said that “endless appeals or extra delays or new red tape could still undermine these projects and we would have more confidence to get some of those works that were disrupted last year back on track were these resolved”. Adani last year suspended engineering work on its joint venture rail line and Abbot Point expansion, as well as the project management team for the mine. Adani Australia was “in a position to resume some of the development and other works on its projects within months of a mining lease being granted”, the spokesman said. “So, while endless appeals are designed to prevent jobs and prevent final investment decisions, we can resume a number of contracts that had to be disrupted by approvals uncertainty during 2015,” he said. “The company has continued to progress contracts, with a view to ensuring that some work can get under way that will allow some jobs to start to flow within months.” The Queensland Greens senator Larissa Waters said it was “clear this pollution bomb is a white elephant” and called on state and federal government to “rule out wasting taxpayer money by propping up this unprofitable project, which threatens agriculture and Great Barrier Reef tourism jobs”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2016/jun/30/battle-for-wentworth-activists-rub-salt-in-turnbulls-climate-change-induced-wounds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2016-06-29T22:10:50Z","webTitle":"Battle for Wentworth: activists rub salt in Turnbull’s climate change-induced wounds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/30/battle-for-wentworth-activists-rub-salt-in-turnbulls-climate-change-induced-wounds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2016/jun/30/battle-for-wentworth-activists-rub-salt-in-turnbulls-climate-change-induced-wounds","fields":{"headline":"Battle for Wentworth: activists rub salt in Turnbull’s climate change-induced wounds","bodyText":"Malcolm Turnbull’s failure to get his party to adopt a strong policy on climate change is something he now appears to wear as a mark of pride – like a battle scar, showing how he’s fought for the cause. “I am absolutely committed to achieving a global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to ward off unsafe global warming,” he reminded thousands of millennials and others during his Facebook-broadcast debate with Bill Shorten on 17 June. “I have paid some heavy prices over the years, as you probably know, for my commitment to the climate change challenge.” He was speaking, of course, about his rise and fall as leader of the Liberal party while in opposition in 2009 – a battle that was fought primarily over Turnbull’s support for an emissions trading scheme. His eventual return as leader – and as prime minister – in 2015 appeared to most to be accomplished on the basis of a commitment to support the party’s current climate policies, which he once harshly derided. It is fitting then, that in his own electorate of Wentworth, activists are rubbing salt in his climate change-induced wound. Groups from around the country have piled into Sydney’s glitzy eastern suburbs electorate, raising awareness of Turnbull’s current climate change policies, or lack thereof, and simultaneously trying to make Turnbull aware of his constituents’ views on climate change. And views they have. However, Wentworth, it seems, is an electorate full of incongruent qualities. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Turnbull’s electorate is rich. It has the highest house prices of any electorate in Australia. Harbourside mansions – like Turnbull’s own in Point Piper – push the median house price up to about $2.5m. Fitting with those prices, Wentworth has remained a safe non-Labor seat, held by conservative politicians since federation. And Turnbull is not the first Liberal leader to hold the seat, with John Hewson representing Sydney’s wealthy eastern suburbs crowd back in the 1990s. More surprisingly, however, the electorate can also be very progressive – putting the small “l” back in Liberal. Take the Greens vote. In 2011 they got a healthy 17.4% of the primary vote. That dropped to a more modest but still respectable 14.6% when Turnbull, who grew up in the area and is known by many residents, ran in 2013. And when those voters are asked about what they think about environmental issues, they support positions that are much more progressive than those of the current Liberal party. In April a ReachTel survey commissioned by renewable energy campaigners Solar Citizens found 63.5% of Wentworth voters would be more likely to vote for a party that promised to take Australia to 100% renewable energy within 15 years. And perhaps even more surprisingly, according to leftwing activist group GetUp, Wentworth is where it has its highest density of members anywhere in the country. People there sign GetUp’s petitions on issues like marriage equality, renewable energy and asylum seekers in droves. And now, tugging at the loose threads left by the chafing of these incongruent qualities is a cabal of environment groups, hoping to find leverage among the small “l” liberals of Wentworth. Buoyed by the finding that a healthy majority of Wentworthians would be swayed by a policy that quickly shifted Australia to 100% renewable energy, Solar Citizens held a public meeting in Paddington Town Hall on 8 June. “We had 500 people there,” says Claire O’Rourke, national director of Solar Citizens. “That was the biggest event we’ve ever held.” Despite Wentworth’s enthusiasm for solar, they’re the second-worst electorate in the country in terms of uptake of the technology, according to Solar Citizens. Out of the 150 federal electorates, the group says Wentworth is ranked 149, with just 2,352 voters living under solar-adorned roofs. “To see 500 people in an electorate that has the second-lowest proportional uptake of solar was really encouraging,” says O’Rourke. One thing holding back the uptake of solar in the electorate is not the will of the people but the way they live. Crowded alongside the harbourside mansions and eastern beaches are stacks of apartment blocks, each trying to peer over the other to catch a glimpse of Sydney’s glistening harbour and ocean. There are so many apartments, that Wentworth is Australia’s second-most dense electorate. And current renewable energy policies don’t make it easy for renters or even apartment owners to get solar energy. Since that Solar Citizens meeting, other groups have been bombarding the Turnbull’s electorate with climate-change related messaging. GetUp produced posters to hijack Turnbull’s own messaging in the electorate. Strapped to street poles beneath the prime minister’s head and shoulders were posters with the rest of his body. They said “trust me on climate change” and have Turnbull’s fingers crossed. The group even made a video of two women running around installing the posters – labelled “Guerilla Nannas” by Getup. “We know these are people who care about climate and the environment and who wanted and thought they were getting a prime minister in Turnbull that would deliver,” says Sam Register, head of campaigns at GetUp. GetUp has also been working with Sydney artist Michael Agzarian, who produced the now-famous “fizza” posters of a dazed-looking Malcolm Turnbull, roughly in the style of the Obama “hope” posters. Adding a twist to the original posters, Agzarian produced specific “climate change fizza” posters, complete with rising sea levels drowning Turnbull’s face and bleached coral in the background. “We wanted to make sure that he knows that his electorate cares about climate and they demand better – no matter who they vote for this is an issue they care about,” says Register. The “fizza” posters are hitting a sore point. Polling commissioned by the local Labor candidate, Evan Hughes, in May suggested a majority of Wentworth residents thought Turnbull had failed to live up to their expectations. Even among Liberal voters, 35% said they thought less of him since he took over the party in September. According to that poll, Turnbull’s two-party-preferred vote will be cut from 68% in 2013 to 58% – a healthy win, but a drop that reveals disappointment in the electorate. In the weekend before the election, environment groups went into overdrive. Last Friday, Greenpeace activists hung banners from Turnbull’s Edgecliff office on the busy New South Head Road. The posters said “Turnbull’s legacy: bleaching brought to you buy Malcolm’s mates in the coal industry”. Then on Saturday, a flotilla of kayakers – many of whom were Pacific Islanders – rowed from Blues Point to Lady Martins beach, just metres from Turnbull’s home. Then on Sunday locals demonstrated in Double Bay’s Steyne Park against what they perceived as Turnbull’s lack of action on climate change. Speaking to a rally of an estimated 2,000 people, the former member for Wentworth, John Hewson, said Turnbull’s current policy position was a “national disgrace”. “I think climate change should be the dominant issue of this campaign – it should have been for quite some time,” he told the crowd, to resounding cheers. While the protest occurred, Greenpeace boats motored around to Turnbull’s house, where they were met by a significant police presence guarding the waterfront. And as election day approaches, green groups are gearing up for their last push in the battle for Wentworth. Every environment group in the country seems to have created election scorecards, many of which will be handed out at polling booths in Wentworth. GetUp will be there too, asking voters to put the Liberals last. “Who knows what will happen on election day,” says GetUp’s Sam Register. “But we know the electorate is frustrated and they feel let down. They wanted more and we are expecting that to be reflected on polling day. “[Turnbull has] got one of the safest seats in the country and is highly unlikely to lose his seat. But what we want to do by being there is [make] sure that him and other major-party MPs know that we can’t not act on climate anymore and get away with it. People want real action and we’re going to make that an issue of this election campaign.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2016/aug/23/inside-shanghai-tower-china-tallest-building-green-skyscrapers","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2016-08-23T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"Inside Shanghai Tower: China's tallest skyscraper claims to be world's greenest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/23/inside-shanghai-tower-china-tallest-building-green-skyscrapers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2016/aug/23/inside-shanghai-tower-china-tallest-building-green-skyscrapers","fields":{"headline":"Inside Shanghai Tower: China's tallest skyscraper claims to be world's greenest","bodyText":"Twisting high above Shanghai’s financial district, China’s tallest tower – and the second tallest in the world – is preparing to officially open its substantial doors to the public next month. The Shanghai Tower, reaching 632 metres, is the third “supertall” tower on the city’s iconic skyline. Looking out from the 119th floor, the city lies below like a toy model, a densely packed mass of streets and high-rise buildings. China loves a world record, and its new building boasts plenty, including the world’s fastest elevators, highest hotel and restaurant, and tallest viewing platform. Reassuringly, it also required the largest ever cement pouring for the foundations. But most importantly, the 128-storey tower also claims to be the world’s greenest skyscraper. Awarded the top green rating, LEED Platinum, the government is hailing the tower as a sign of China’s growing green credentials. China’s sustainability record in the past has been abysmal. The country burns 47% of the world’s coal, according to the US Energy Information Administration, and is facing the impact of decades of rapid deforestation and water pollution. With some of the most polluted air on the planet, killing as many as 4,000 people a day, an increasingly restive population is demanding more government action. Nervous of the impact that smog-filled days and clogged roads could have on social stability, the government has begun tree planting programmes, ordered thousands of cars off the roads in cities such as Beijing, and is investing in green technology in a big way. China is now the biggest renewables market in the world, more than double than in the US, and home to almost one of every three wind turbines globally. Green buildings, however, make up a woefully small part of the green industry, with most work focused on quick construction and quicker sales. Estimates put the number of green buildings on the mainland at less than 1%, though a 2014 target by the State Council wants 30% of new construction projects to be green by 2020. In Shanghai, engineer Shunfu Cha points to 200 wind turbines spinning at the top of the tower – the world’s tallest turbines, naturally – which generate around 10% of the building’s electricity. “These are one of the most obvious green technologies,” he says, gesturing upwards into the clouds. “But only one part of bringing down the energy use.” The building collects rainwater and re-uses waste water, has a combined cooling and heating power system and uses 40 other energy-saving measures that developers claim cut 34,000 metric tonnes from its annual carbon footprint. The building is wrapped in two layers of glass for natural cooling and ventilation, and in total developers say a third of the site is “green space”, including 24 sky gardens sitting between the two skins. “At the moment, everyone is trying to achieve top green certification criteria,” says Xiaomei Lee, managing director of Gensler Shanghai, the building’s architect. “But nobody yet has achieved LEED Platinum for a supertall building. People assumed that a building of this size can’t achieve such a high sustainability rating.” Shanghai Tower might be the only supertall tower to achieve LEED Platinum, but it is part of an increasing movement for towers to market green credentials as the demand for more sustainable urban development is felt. The world’s first Passivhaus-certified office tower – a certification rating that considers ongoing annual energy use, considered more stringent than other energy codes – was opened in Vienna two years ago, using 80% less heating and cooling energy than an equivalent tower through efficient power systems. London’s tallest building, the Shard, also has a raft of sustainability features which enable it to use 30% less energy than a conventionally designed skyscraper of the same height. Globally, 75 skyscrapers are LEED rated. More buildings are also turning green, literally. The Two World Trade Center development in New York has been designed to include a series of green terraces featuring different biozones. And in Milan, the Bosco Verticale is a pair of residential towers with 800 trees and thousands of plants on concrete balconies, maintained with recycled water. In Tel Aviv, plans for the Gran Mediterraneo tower include farms, vertical gardens and a range of fauna. Advocates say that far from their reputation as polluters, skyscrapers offer environmental benefits. “Per capita, skyscrapers use less energy and water, generate less waste and provide for a more engaged living experience,” says Mahesh Ramanujam, chief operating officer at the US Green Building Council. “When properly developed, they also preserve and protect precious green space in urban markets.” But the concept of “green skyscrapers” itself is controversial. Buildings are the largest contributor to climate change through carbon emissions, and critics point out that logically, taller towers will need more resources both to run and to construct. So are we just seeing the latest version of “greenwashing”? Environmental concerns include the fact that clusters of towers can make the streets below dark, trapping hot air and pollution at ground level. There is a knock-on impact in terms of carbon emissions, blocking light to surrounding properties, forcing the need for more electric lighting and eradicating the possibility of solar energy. Tall towers also face charges of elitism. News that London has 260 new skyscrapers in the pipeline met with bitter opposition from campaigners earlier this year, largely on the grounds that these towers will mostly offer luxury apartments that do little to help problems of affordable housing. And money is certainly to be made in green development. Investors and companies are increasingly looking to benefit from cost efficiencies, with maintenance bills around 20% less than typical commercial buildings. While they cost more to build, the USGBC estimates most green projects pay for themselves in around seven years, especially as property agents say rents in LEED-certified buildings can be up to 30% higher. The UN expects two-thirds of the world to live in cities by 2050 – the Chinese government’s target is 60% by 2020 – presenting challenges over how to provide sustainable buildings in space-starved cities. Research has suggested that high-rise buildings are the most sustainable form of urban development. A 2013 report by Terrapin Bright Green, commissioned by the New York government, recommended knocking down Manhattan towers that were too inefficient and replacing them with even bigger skyscrapers. Modern replacements could be 44% larger and still use 5% less energy, the study claimed. While Terrapin acknowledged that demolishing and rebuilding wouldn’t be appropriate – or affordable – in every case, they found that even where buildings were knocked down and replaced, the energy needed to dismantle the existing building and construct a new one would still be offset within 15 and 28 years. “Some people have opposed taller buildings on the premise that they use more energy, but they have failed to consider the larger spillover effects of urban sustainability that come from a dense urban fabric,” claims Sarene Marshall, executive director for the Center for Sustainability at the Urban Land Institute. “While buildings are the largest contributor to climate change through carbon emissions, transportation is a very close second. When you have a denser urban population, people are more likely to walk, bike or use public transportation to get to work. So if you build taller buildings, you have a denser urban fabric. “If you build lower buildings and spread them out over a longer distance, what often happens is a much higher footprint in automobile transportation.” A study by the New Climate Economy backs this up. Comparing the cities of Barcelona and Atlanta, with similar populations, Atlanta was found to have a much larger carbon footprint because people used cars to get around a large, sprawling urban area. The thinktank concluded that taller, denser buildings can dramatically reduce a city’s carbon impact. However, green credentials and promises don’t always stack up. Critics say that LEED criteria focuses too much on the development of the building, and not enough on how it is used afterwards. A New Republic report claimed that The Bank of America tower in New York, hailed as the world’s most “environmentally responsible” office building when it opened in 2010, actually produces more greenhouse gases and uses more energy per square foot than any comparably sized office building in Manhattan. In relying too much on LEED ratings, critics argue, developers and governments can get additional publicity without necessarily being energy efficient in the long run. In many US states, there are also tax breaks for energy-efficient buildings, leading to claims that building designers target the easiest and cheapest green points in order to qualify as LEED rated and gain tax exemptions. And there are cases where the new technology disappoints. In London, the Strata Tower in Elephant and Castle, met criticism by residents when it opened as its in-built wind turbines – designed for helping heat and cool the building properly – weren’t turning. “I feel like I’m in an eco experiment that has gone wrong at the design stage”, one resident said. The promised new public garden at the Walkie Talkie tower in London also attracted criticism for being neither particularly green nor public enough. For advocates of high-rise buildings, vertical development seems to be the future, and they remain convinced that green skyscrapers like the Shanghai Tower are the only sustainable way to do it. Sceptics will be watching closely for evidence that their optimism is not unfounded.

Redback Technologies, which last week inked a commercialisation deal with UQ, claims to have harnessed the power of algorithmic software and efficient design to produce the most cost-effective solar storage system on the Australian market. Despite relying on a smaller battery than the Powerwall – which is widely expected to be the catalyst for rapid growth of the solar storage market this year – Redback says its “Ouija board” system, available from June, will pay for itself in half the time. Redback’s founder and managing director, Philip Livingston, said it would take an average 5.6 years to earn back the Ouija’s $9,000 price tag through electricity bill savings, versus 11 years on the Powerwall’s $15,000 to $17,000 installation cost. Livingston said the company, set up just last year, was less concerned with batteries as the cutting edge of the household solar energy market as it was with tackling its key problem: how can households consume more of the power their solar panels produce? “We’ve realised that even if batteries were free today, they only count for about 25-30% of an overall system cost, which means you don’t get anywhere near a five-year return on investment,” he said. Five years was considered the benchmark in 2012, when returns for solar panel owners selling back to power companies were at their high-water mark before state governments drastically cut those rates. “Fundamentally, the big thing we all need to be talking about as consumers is not batteries or whatever, but self-consumption – that is the itch we have to scratch,” Livingston said. The average solar-powered house consumed only 25-30% of the power it produced, the rest now fetching scant rates on the wholesale power market, he said. The Powerwall, with its Lithium battery, would take “self-consumption” to 57%. The Ouija system would better that at 61% and “about a third less in cost” than the Powerwall, Livingston said. This was in part because of a different approach to design, he said. Redback’s system components were not separated out and were lighter, he said, meaning they could be installed more quickly and by fewer staff. “The heaviest unit in the device is the inverter, it’s 40kg; the battery enclosure we bring out next month is 25kg and each battery you place inside it is 20kg and they’re all outdoor-rated,” Livingston said. “So effectively, a few guys and a small truck can get it installed rather than four guys and a crane, which is what you need for a Powerwall. “In integrating these systems, what needs to be considered is not just the aesthetic, but that all the other elements add cost when integrating a system. “While it’s great to have a battery that’s really sexy, at the end of the day, a lot more people buy Toyotas than they do Lamborghinis – or Teslas for that matter.” Redback also claims to more efficiently exploit its smaller battery by using a cloud-based software platform to control appliances such as “hot water systems, heaters, pool pumps and the like”. “It’s not being done by a person per se – although they can put schedules in – but by machine learning and that’s where we’re going with this,” Livingston said. “People don’t have to be focused on using expensive hardware solutions for things that can be done with software.” This reliance on software to boost the efficient use of power is what led Redback to signing its memorandum of understanding with University of Queensland last week. “Who better than a university that specialises in the creation of heuristic algorithms for machine learning?” Livingston said. “By working with UQ we are getting years and years of experience of analytic calculations, supercomputers they have on site, and we are able to use their faculties and build machine-learning capabilities that allow us to optimise these types of scenarios so we can become even less reliant on batteries over time.” Learning to drive energy efficiency through software is a “rabbit hole that continues to grow because we are learning how to optimise these scenarios to a greater and greater extent”, Livingston said. While the hardware is designed in Seattle and manufactured in China, all the intellectual property is generated in Brisbane, where the company has 16 staff and plans to increase its ranks of engineers. Livingston, whose early career included installing solar water systems in the Philippines with the US Peace Corps, said he believed the Australian market for solar storage systems would soon “cut across the ‘chasm’, as they call it, of early adopters into the early majority” in line with the one in five households that now had solar panels. “It should be quick because the economics are going to get even better than they are now,” he said. Dean Moss, the chief executive of UniQuest, the University of Queensland commercialisation arm whose past projects include the cervical cancer preventing vaccine Gardasil, said the collaboration with Redback would “convert research discoveries into exciting, innovative new products that create change”. Paul Meredith, the director of UQ Solar, said the company with its “energy storage innovations [and] entrepreneurial drive” would be tapping into an institution with “a rich history of cutting-edge renewable energy research, particularly in the systems integration space”."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sport/2016/mar/28/stefan-wilson-i-want-to-honour-justin-and-do-him-proud-at-indy","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-28T09:00:22Z","webTitle":"Stefan Wilson: 'I want to honour Justin and do him proud at Indy'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/28/stefan-wilson-i-want-to-honour-justin-and-do-him-proud-at-indy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2016/mar/28/stefan-wilson-i-want-to-honour-justin-and-do-him-proud-at-indy","fields":{"headline":"Stefan Wilson: 'I want to honour Justin and do him proud at Indy'","bodyText":"Stefan Wilson moved from England to Indianapolis with his wife, Katie, to chase a dream: to compete for the first time this May in the famous 500-mile race on the northwest edge of the city. To race in the 100th Indianapolis 500 would be thrilling enough, but Wilson is also pushed by the memory of another IndyCar driver – Justin Wilson, his older brother, who died in an accident during a race last August. “I want to honor him, and do him proud at Indy,” Stefan Wilson tells the Guardian. Justin Wilson was only three weeks past his 37th birthday when he was hit in the head by debris from another car. Wilson, well-liked by fellow competitors, died of his injuries the next day, leaving a wife, Julia, and two daughters. Other than what Justin once called a “five-minute go-kart race,” the brothers raced each other just once, at the 2013 Baltimore Grand Prix, through city streets. Justin finished fourth, Stefan 18th. There should have been many more races between the brothers, but that would be it. While Justin Wilson drove in the IndyCar Series for two more seasons, Stefan scrambled in vain to scratch up enough corporate sponsorship to fund a ride, let alone a competitive car. But Stefan Wilson won’t quit. Besides this being the 100th Indy 500, Wilson says, “I didn’t want to end my career without racing at Indy.” He has driven in 81 open-wheel races in the last 10 years, winning 10 and finishing in second or third place another 11 times, but the Indy 500 is different. Racing runs in the family. His father, Keith, was a formidable Formula Ford racer in England before a crash ended his career in 1975. Justin won seven IndyCar races and drove in eight Indy 500s, finishing fifth in the 2013 race. Stefan Wilson was in Indianapolis earlier this month when Juan Pablo Montoya won the opener of the 16-race season Sunday in St Petersburg, Florida. But Wilson announced in late February that he had formed a unique partnership with SolarAid, which will help offset his racing carbon footprint through a social community, called the Speed of Light, that provides solar energy to communities without access to electricity. He said he has meetings scheduled with companies that may be interested in funding his drive for the Indy 500, if not more races, and he said several “good” race teams, which he won’t name, are interested in putting Wilson in a car if he can raise enough money. “The trick in motorsports is that it’s the funding that makes it all work,” he said. Justin Wilson knew all about that, bouncing from ride to ride. After driving in Formula One in 2003 and finishing eighth in the US Grand Prix, Wilson drove for two teams in four years in the now-defunct Champ Car Series, a rival of the Indy Racing League. He then drove for three teams in eight seasons in the IndyCar Series. Stefan Wilson raced go-karts as a youngster before moving up to the Formula Palmer Audi and British Formula Three series, then driving in 32 races over four years in the Firestone Indy Lights series, just one level below the IndyCar Series. His last race in the Indy Lights Series was in 2012 for a team called Fan Force United, which aspired to move up to the big time. In June 2014, Fan Force United announced that Justin Wilson would be its driver for a full-time IndyCar Series run in 2015. “[The sponsorship funding] all sort of fell through,” Stefan Wilson says. He says of raising money, “It’s part of the job which doesn’t get a lot of light on it.” Stefan had enjoyed racing against his brother in Baltimore. Justin started fourth that day, with Stefan starting 21st in the 25-car field, but, as team-mates for Dale Coyne Racing, Justin shared data with his younger brother during practice runs. It was the first time two brothers had started in an IndyCar race as team-mates since Gary and Tony Bettenhausen did so in 1983. “It was amazing to work next to him,” he says. “He was so, so talented.” Justin Wilson had scuffled for work last year, too, He drove in only six races for the team owned by Michael Andretti, a champion driver who is the son of the legendary Mario Andretti, finishing 24th in what would be his last Indy 500. Because auto racing is so expensive, most (but not all) rides tend to be taken by kids from wealthy families or kids from famous racing families, the Andrettis being one example. “With me and Justin, we didn’t have rich friends or rich families,” Stefan Wilson says. “We’re solely trying to do it on talent, and find [the money] ourselves. It’s not a struggle, but it’s definitely harder for us.” Justin Wilson’s death was the first in IndyCar racing since 2011, when Dan Wheldon, a popular and congenial 33-year-old British driver who won the Indy 500 twice, was killed during a season-ending race in Las Vegas. Sir Jackie Stewart was among those who attended Justin Wilson’s s funeral in September in Northamptonshire. A day after Wilson died, Stefan announced that six people had received his brother’s organs. That weekend, Stefan attended the final race of the 2015 IndyCar series, in Sonoma, California. Oriol Servia drove Justin Wilson’s No25 car in the race. “It was actually almost a bit therapeutic,” Stefan Wilson says. “I know that sounds crazy, but it was good being back in the environment that Justin and I love.” Stefan Wilson has not piloted an open-wheel racer around the track since then, but he has firm plans to do so for the first time in May at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He is planning to use a solar-powered pit box.

In a survey of sustainability experts released Thursday, 90% of respondents said that companies would need to play as big of a role as national governments in combating climate change to prevent environmental disaster. The 2015 Climate Survey, by research consultancy GlobeScan and thinktank SustainAbility, asked 624 sustainability experts from 69 countries about their expectations ahead of the United Nations’ Climate Change Conference (COP21) taking place in Paris in December. “Businesses are expected to lead on climate because they are seen to be able to deliver results,” said Eric Whan, sustainability director at GlobeScan. “Traditional institutions like governments and multilaterals have failed to do so, and more and more, experts are calling for collaborative solutions.” The survey reflected a lack of confidence in governments’ abilities to devise effective solutions to complex problems. While more than 90% of respondents said they expected COP21 would result in a global agreement, only a third believed it would have binding powers to implement any substantive changes on a wide scale. Moreover, only 4% of respondents expected the agreement would be sufficient to contain global warming below 2C (36F), which is the temperature level that scientists and world leaders have agreed will help to avoid environmental catastrophes like super droughts and volcanic eruptions. Respondents also revealed the businesses they saw as leaders in the fight to curb climate change, with 20% picking Unilever as the company that’s achieved the most real, substantial advances. The survey lauded the consumer goods company – which has committed to achieving zero net deforestation by 2020 – for its Sustainable Living campaign, the “bold statements and actions” made by its CEO, and its commitment to published targets. Electric car manufacturer Tesla came in second, while Swedish furniture maker Ikea, technology giant Google and consumer appliances conglomerate General Electric tied for third place. Walmart, Toyota, Siemens, Apple and solar-energy installer SolarCity rounded out the leaders list. The survey results represent a notable shift from the last climate survey ranking, which was conducted in 2009 ahead of the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen. Back then, oil and gas giants Shell and BP made the list, during a time when large industrial companies were applauded for their commitments to reducing pollution and waste. Their more recent performances haven’t lived up to expectations, most starkly illustrated by several high profile environmental disasters such as the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, which led to a drop in public sentiment for petroleum companies. Large consumer and technology companies have since pulled ahead with ambitious sustainability agendas that extend across their value chains. “The fossil fuel sector is widely seen as having failed to shift its business model to address climate change concerns and recently suffered huge losses to its reputation,” said Aiste Brackley, research manager at SustainAbility. “The new leaders such as Unilever, Tesla and Ikea are setting a high bar for corporate leadership.” Only three companies – General Electric, Walmart and Toyota – that were included in the 2009 ranking made it onto this year’s list. For companies that want to boost their reputations, reducing their carbon emissions, increasing their use of renewable energy like solar and hydropower, and clamping down on deforestation are the best ways to act on climate change and prove their commitment to combating it, Brackley said. • This article was amended on 12 November 2015.

Then, in July, a dentist from Minneapolis killed Cecil the lion, the park’s most famous resident, and Rodrigues found himself at the centre of an international media storm. As the head of the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force (ZCTF), the organisation which he founded, Rodrigues was besieged by interview requests as journalists scrambled for information. He would soon play an even more central role in the story, identifying US citizen Walter James Palmer as Cecil’s assailant, and releasing his passport number and address. “They went hunting at night with a spotlight and they spotted Cecil,” he says. “They tied a dead animal to their vehicle to lure Cecil out of the park and they scented an area about half a kilometre from the park. Mr Palmer shot Cecil with a bow and arrow but this shot didn’t kill him. They tracked him down and found him 40 hours later when they shot him with a gun.” Palmer became the subject of an online witch-hunt which forced him to go into hiding after numerous death threats. Eventually Zimbabwe said he would not face charges over the killing, because he had obtained the correct permits. Theo Bronkhorst, the professional hunter who facilitated the killing, is facing legal action in Zimbabwe for violating the terms of his hunting permit. For Rodrigues, the six months since Cecil the lion’s death have given him an unprecedented platform to advocate for the cause that he has made his life’s work. “Cecil didn’t die for no reason. Cecil died for a cause. Things in conservation are going to change in the next few years, and it’s going to make this planet better,” he told the Guardian. “I was shocked at the response from the world. I’ve lived in a bad dream for 35 years, but people who have had something in the back of their conscience about animals, they have now woken up. Even if it has died off in mainstream media, on social media the conversation has actually strengthened. We’ve become a force to be reckoned with. There are a lot of animals that can’t speak out, but we can,” he says. Rodrigues has been invited to give talks at Cecil the lion remembrance marches in New York and Washington DC in July next year. Although he didn’t go into the numbers, he says the ZCTF, which relies on donor funding, has been flooded with new donations. Rodrigues’s elevated profile offers some vindication for the wildlife activist, who has not always had it easy. He has had several run-ins with Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwean government, which has not always appreciated his outspoken criticism of its conservation policy. In 2003, he was told by a director of the National Parks Authority that he was “persona non grata” and would no longer be allowed entry to any national parks. “I’m not the government’s favourite person, but I’m still here,” Rodrigues says. He remains critical of the government. He says: “The cake is big enough. Why is it that the majority of people get the crumbs, and the few get big slices of cake?” Rodrigues argues that the government should do more to improve the economic situation of people near conservation areas, thus removing the financial incentive to hunt. “We could be relying on solar energy, giving it to the people who farm near these wildlife areas. We could be giving a percentage from the tourism industry to these people. We could do so much, but we don’t, because the dictatorship does not benefit. They want to use humans like puppets.” It is people, ultimately, that Rodrigues believes pose the greatest threat to African wildlife. Rodrigues says: “Nobody is talking about human overpopulation. What concerns me is what are future generations going to be doing if we don’t have population control? This planet is not going to feed the masses, and now the people are going into the wildlife areas.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/nov/25/if-we-want-investment-in-sustainable-fuel-rules-cannot-constantly-change","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-25T15:23:10Z","webTitle":"If we want investment in sustainable fuel, rules cannot constantly change | Santiago Seage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/25/if-we-want-investment-in-sustainable-fuel-rules-cannot-constantly-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/25/if-we-want-investment-in-sustainable-fuel-rules-cannot-constantly-change","fields":{"headline":"If we want investment in sustainable fuel, rules cannot constantly change","bodyText":"There is no question that the world faces a tremendous challenge in confronting the threat of climate change. I am confident that the world’s innovators can create the energy technologies necessary to reduce emissions and meet the climate challenge. It is more difficult, though, to have faith in our political leaders to make and keep the policy commitments intended to drive innovation. As CEO of one of the global leaders in the development of low carbon transportation fuels and solar energy, I think our ability to address the problem will come down to two things: whether we can develop and deploy the technologies necessary to change the way we make and use energy, and whether a diverse set of governments can make and keep public policy commitments. Because energy markets are not free markets, and therefore do not properly reward innovation, clean energy investors need policy to gain a foothold in the marketplace. That leaves energy innovation more vulnerable to political pressure, which can result in midstream policy changes that undercut the development of these technologies. Over the last year, we’ve seen firsthand what politics can do to climate agreements in one of the countries most committed to the negotiations in Paris – the US. Consider the fate of the strong Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS), which the United States passed 10 years ago, obligating oil companies to blend specific amounts of low carbon renewable fuel into America’s transportation fuel supply. The policy was designed to ensure that the oil companies who control the distribution infrastructure could not block the growth of lower carbon alternatives to gasoline. It is the only federal climate law on the books in that country, and it is one of the only laws in the world requiring real behavior change in the fossil fuels industry. Based upon that statutory commitment, Abengoa – my company – and others made significant US investments to support the development of first and second-generation biofuels. Barack Obama pledged to support the RFS for its environmental and energy security attributes and he has made action on climate change a central aspect of his legacy. But as fracking enabled the United States to become, for the time being, a global leader in oil production, the Obama administration took the unprecedented step of proposing to change the RFS to allow the volumetric targets to be set based upon the amount of biofuel the oil companies are willing to blend. The highly controversial proposal is scheduled to be approved by Obama on 30 November, the very day that COP21 starts in Paris. What the administration is proposing is not just inconvenient for companies like ours. If finalized, the plan would increase carbon emissions by an estimated 35m metric tons in one year, or the equivalent of the annual emissions of nine new coal-fired power plants. Obama is clearly genuinely concerned about climate change. There is no better champion in the world for the cause. But his decision on the RFS should serve as a bellwether for investors looking at US and perhaps global innovation markets. If Obama fails to modify the EPA proposal, he will be arriving at the UN-sponsored COP21 meetings in Paris at the very moment he is eviscerating the only real climate law America has. And that would shake investor confidence in renewables at the exact moment when we need it most. While it’s heartening to see a number of countries making bold commitments in the run-up to the global climate talks, what the business community really needs to reduce carbon emissions is the political resolve to reach binding agreements and stick to them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2016/mar/31/artist-bruce-munro-field-of-light-uluru-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-31T16:42:11Z","webTitle":"'Seeing Uluru​ changed my life': Bruce Munro's lightbulb moment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/31/artist-bruce-munro-field-of-light-uluru-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/31/artist-bruce-munro-field-of-light-uluru-australia","fields":{"headline":"'Seeing Uluru​ changed my life': Bruce Munro's lightbulb moment","bodyText":"Anyone who’s been to Uluru in the blazing red centre of Australia would recognise “the Rock” as a work of art. From dawn until dark, its colours are constantly changing as shadows and light move across its immense surface. Despite its size, there’s something of the shape-shifter about this natural formation – monolithic when seen from far away, curved and creviced up close. So it takes a brave artist to create a large-scale installation at its base. How do you compete with nature? British artist Bruce Munro isn’t trying to. This week his artwork Field of Light opens to the public at Uluru. From his farmhouse studio in Wiltshire, England, Munro has flown 60,000 lightbulbs, installing 50,000 of them in the sandy red dirt of central Australia (the extra 10,000 were in case of breakages – but Qantas managed not to damage a single one). The bulbs – powered by solar energy – are constantly changing colour too. Although they look great from afar, like a multicoloured blanket spread over a field, they are designed to be viewed at ground level. Visitors are encouraged to make their own path through the lights. The work is strangely affecting, reminiscent of the view from a window of a plane at night as it flies low over a sprawling city, or neurons firing, or nebulae, or a vast, bright coral reef or an Indigenous Australian dot painting rendered in halogen. On the night of my visit, people were walking alone through the lit fields and weeping. This is art you feel, rather than art you view. Of course, the location helps. Our preview was lit by a full moon, encircled by a thin line of cloud in that enormous Northern Territory desert sky. Uluru turned from rust red to dark brown to black. The lights of the installation were soft and in the background, so they didn’t compete with the moonlight, starlight or Uluru itself. The effect was complementary. Bruce Munro, 56, who has lit up cities and landscapes from Arizona to Scotland, says the Field of Light in Uluru has been the culmination of decades of thinking. “I came out here 24 years ago. We were doing a road trip in an old Toyota, our swansong after eight years in Australia,” he tells me. “My Sydney friends kept on saying ‘go to Uluru’, but of course none of them had actually been. When I got here, it changed my life. I jotted this idea down in my sketchbook and didn’t think it would see the light of day. The sketch became the Field of Light.” Back in England, and with a young family to support, Munro decided to become a painter, but eventually settled on the medium of light. He has worked with it ever since his first installation, in a field in Wiltshire, in 2004. “I did the installation after my father died. I thought, life is short, and I wanted to create something.” Munro made further light works in Cornwall in 2008 and at Bath’s Holburne Museum in 2011, before taking his work to the US, with installations in public parks and gardens across America, in Philadelphia, Nashville and Columbus. His work has been treated with respect by the public, except for one occasion in Edinburgh where a boozer fell asleep in the installation after a big night out. The work at Uluru is the culmination of “thousands of man-hours plus 40 people planting stems of light for six weeks,” he says. The installation itself is similar in scale to the Blood-swept Lands poppies at the Tower of London, but Munro hopes it’s respectful to the sky and the land it inhabits. “That’s why it’s not bright – I purposefully toned it down. If you raise the light levels, you fight with the stars and moon.” Munro consulted extensively with the local Indigenous peoples, the Anangu, before going ahead with the project. The work itself is not in the national park, but in land adjacent to Uluru, owned by Voyages Indiginous Tourism Australia. “It had to be totally kosher with the Indigenous people – it’s not on for me to plant something on their home without their permission,” says Munro. “The work is an expression of my excitement and joy and nothing more than that.” As it turns out, the Anangu have named the artwork in their own Pitjantjatjara language as Tili Wiru Tjuta Nyakutjaku or “looking at lots of beautiful lights” – a seal of approval, then. Munro’s light installation can be viewed at dawn, but it is most startling at dusk and night. “Australian light is incredible,” says Munro, who greatly admires the work of Australian modernist painters Sidney Nolan and Arthur Boyd. “Boyd made me see how the midday sun makes everything washed out. Early and late in the day, that is where the chroma is. It’s very visceral light here, but you’ll never see colour as rich as here anywhere in the world – and as washed out. Everything is about light.” Asked where he fits into the UK arts scene, Munro says: “I don’t. I’ve got a load of work that nobody’s seen – that has to do with time and place. It’s not something I even worry about. I just want to make work.” Art is not always an attractive industry, he says. “There’s too much ego and money. I’ve met some wonderful gallerists, but you meet some that are like secondhand car salespeople.” As if to answer his critics, he asks: “Why can’t art be simple stuff as well as really intellectual stuff? There is a cynical side to the art world, which is really boring. We are here for a such short space of time, so to be a smart-arse is a sin and such a waste of time.” Time – and its fleeting nature – is as important to Munro’s work as place. The Field of Light exhibition will be dismantled after a year – a period chosen to allow people to see it in all Australia’s beautiful seasons – after which it will exist only in the memories of those who visited. Even Instagrammers will be disappointed, as the work doesn’t photograph that well. You have to be there. “I like the idea that it’s not there forever, that it has to be experienced,” says Munro. “You might get some pictures, but its two dimensional flatness doesn’t reflect what it’s really like.” But will he mourn it when it’s gone, this work that was so long in the making? “Everything has its moment,” he says. “We’re just passing on our messages to each other. Death happens and things pass – and so it is with art.” Field of Light is at Uluru, Northern Territory, Australia, until 31 March 2017."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/dec/14/the-guardian-view-on-uk-energy-policy-after-paris-amber-rudd-must-flick-the-trip-switch","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-14T20:03:53Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on UK energy policy after Paris: Amber Rudd must flick the trip switch | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/14/the-guardian-view-on-uk-energy-policy-after-paris-amber-rudd-must-flick-the-trip-switch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/14/the-guardian-view-on-uk-energy-policy-after-paris-amber-rudd-must-flick-the-trip-switch","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on UK energy policy after Paris: Amber Rudd must flick the trip switch","bodyText":"When Laurent Fabius brought down his green gavel in Paris on Saturday, the atmosphere in the hall was said to be electric. The global great and good, even the not-so-good, were all smiles, tears of joy and arms around each other, all of them caught up, at least for that moment, in the hope that they might just have been part of saving the world. It must be hoped that Amber Rudd soaked up her full share of this euphoria, because the UK energy secretary is going to need to draw on deep inspiration if she is to close the yawning gap between the UK’s rhetoric at the summit, and the recent UK record back home. The right sometimes complains that environmentalists are like watermelons – green on the surface but socialist red inside. It is, however, now clear that David Cameron’s one-time “vote blue, go green” pitch in opposition was no more than verdigris, a patina rapidly scratched off by the grind of being in government. Even under the coalition, where Ms Rudd’s brief was held by successive Lib Dems, George Osborne stoked anti-environmental sentiment by declaring to his party conference that he would never “save the planet by putting Britain out of business”, as if that were what those concerned with climate wanted. Today, six months into a majority Conservative government, the chancellor has been dictating the terms of environmental policy, to unremittingly destructive effect. On airport expansion the only question is where, not if. The next big idea for the green investment bank is privatisation, with ministers set to cede public control of the bank’s animating principles in order to bring in a little cash and get it off the Treasury’s balance sheet. Above all, the subsidies for renewables have been savaged, in some cases cut by 90%, and the damage to the sector has been redoubled by parallel tweaks to the planning regime. Almost as bad as what has been done is the way the government has set about it. There has been indecent haste, with deep cuts announced two months after the election, and profoundly important changes being written straight into the energy bill, without ever having gone through the standard consultative green or white paper stages. There has been profound imbalance, too. The government gives the falling price of solar energy cells as a reason to cut solar subsidies, but there is no parallel move to raise petrol duties after the oil price freefall. This is in explicit contradiction of the “fair fuel stabiliser” approach propounded during the last parliament, when ministers explained why – time and again – they had cancelled planned petrol duty rises in the face of rising oil costs. We have now reached a pass where even the former chancellor and noted climate sceptic Nigel Lawson berates Mr Osborne for his failure to take the chance to recoup sorely needed revenue at the pumps. Malign symbolism compounds the immediate practical effect of the early closure of the renewables obligation in respect of wind, and the withdrawal of “nationally significant” status from the construction of onshore turbines. The great battle in greening energy is to convince investors that, well, the wind will remain in their sails. But moves of this sort will do exactly the opposite, creating uncertainty and deterring new projects, which is no doubt why such moves appeal to big carbon special interests and anti-environmental obsessives. Ms Rudd is emphatically not in the latter camp. She recently committed to phasing out coal power stations, and sounded serious about it too, emphasising the particular role of cleanish modern gas facilities. A few weeks later, however, came a UK capacity market auction, which awarded coal contracts, did nothing about constructing the mooted cleaner gas facilities, and most bizarrely sponsored the mushrooming of small generators which run off grimy diesel. So here’s hoping that the electricity of Paris will have given Ms Rudd the sort of shock that might jolt her from half-decent intentions into a real and lasting commitment to act."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2016/apr/30/paris-agreement-is-a-strong-signal-that-we-will-solve-climate-crisis-al-gore-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-29T22:08:01Z","webTitle":"Paris agreement is a strong signal that 'we will solve climate crisis', Al Gore says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/30/paris-agreement-is-a-strong-signal-that-we-will-solve-climate-crisis-al-gore-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/apr/30/paris-agreement-is-a-strong-signal-that-we-will-solve-climate-crisis-al-gore-says","fields":{"headline":"Paris agreement is a strong signal that 'we will solve climate crisis', Al Gore says","bodyText":"Al Gore, former US vice-president, Nobel laureate and chairman of the Climate Reality Project, has led the global discussion about climate change for many years. His multi-award-winning film An Inconvenient Truth (2006) has been widely credited with changing the way world leaders and citizens think about the issue. Don Henry is public policy fellow in environmentalism at the University of Melbourne and is a former director of the Australian Conservation Foundation. He is a long-term collaborator with Gore. Their conversation was recorded for the Griffith Review. Don Henry: The Paris climate agreement was recently concluded – what opportunities and challenges does it present to the world for the future? Al Gore: This past December, 195 countries came together in Paris for the 21st conference of the parties (COP21) and reached a historic agreement, which exceeded the highest end of the range of expectations we could have had for it. Now the questions we face are how will we solve the climate crisis, what opportunities are we presented with and what challenges remain? COP21 received an unprecedented level of support from all sectors of society, both public and private, creating a window of opportunity aligning at just the right time for a successful agreement. We have created a major new opportunity by committing to a sustainable future. But we have to steer in the right direction and accelerate our pace because we still face challenges. We simply cannot continue to put 110m tons of global-warming pollution into the atmosphere every day as if it’s an open sewer. The sum total of the commitments made in Paris – the intended nationally determined contributions – will not add up to what is necessary to keep us under the target set by the agreement. The emissions reductions agreements are not mandatory, which, I believe, was the unavoidable and right choice. But because of this and because we know we must change, it is exceptionally important that we focus on the commitments made by countries and the work nations are doing to implement their commitments, as well as process, visualise and share this information widely. Moreover, the regular, five-year review and ratchet provision, and the requirement for transparency in reporting, are mandatory, and they will give people who care about our planet and future generations an opportunity to focus on the decisions being made by their leaders. This is really important. The success of Paris was largely due to the fact that global awareness, and the level and quality of global consciousness about the existential threat we face from the climate crisis, has risen to a point where nations that were in the bubble could not go home without having taken substantial action – and we need to keep the pressure on. Significantly, the process of “review and ratchet” set out in the Paris agreement will occur against the backdrop of a continuing sharp decline in the cost of renewable energy, energy efficiency, batteries and storage, and sustainable agriculture and forestry. The practical ability of nations five years from now to say, “we can do more” will be greatly enhanced. So if the people of the world really pay attention and continue to keep the pressure on, it will make a tremendous difference. The rapidly declining cost of renewable energy, particularly solar photovoltaic (PV) energy, provides a great opportunity for nations around the world to embrace a sustainable, low-carbon economy. Our ability to convert sunshine into usable energy has become much cheaper far more quickly than anyone had predicted. For example, solar energy has been coming down in cost at a rate of 10% per year over the past 30 years. In many parts of the world, renewable energy is already cheaper than that of fossil fuels and in some parts of the world renewable energy is leapfrogging fossil fuels altogether. These cost reductions are continuing. But we must do more to help nations make the transition to a low- or zero-carbon economy. India, for example, has more people without any electricity at all than the entire population of the United States. And in order to invest in solar on the scale at which they require presently means borrowing money for solar farms at an interest rate of 8-12%. That is an absurdly high cost of capital in an era of very low interest rates. We need to address this on a priority basis and the public-private partnerships on which the Paris agreement was built need to do more and go farther. We also need to put a price on carbon and enable markets to more effectively reflect the true costs of sources of energy. Though there is a growing adoption of direct and indirect carbon pricing at local, national and regional levels now being implemented in 40 countries, and 23 large city-states and provincial governments, we must work to make it a universal standard rather than an exception. We need to move faster in eliminating the massive government subsidies of fossil fuels. Regardless of the challenges we still face, there was a powerful signal of opportunity sent from Paris by business leaders and investors, civil society leaders and society in general. That signal is being received around the world: we can and we will solve the climate crisis. Henry: In your book The Future, you examine six drivers of global change. With fresh insights from the last two years, do you still see these as the key drivers of change for the future? Would you add, subtract and emphasise any? Gore: Much has changed since I wrote The Future but the forces that are driving that change have not. For example, our world is becoming increasingly globalised, the biotech revolution is speeding up, the internet has continued to serve as an open public square and there appear to be no signs of these advancements slowing down. This is evident when we witness the ongoing struggle to balance cyber security and surveillance, and when we see automation changing the way we produce goods and services. It’s clear as we watch countries around the world confront the balance of political, economic and military powers, as they shift faster than we have seen at any time in the last 500 years and as advancements in synthetic biology continue to reinvent life and death. If I were to emphasise any key driver of global change, it would be the rapid transformation of renewable energy to fulfil our energy needs and solve the climate crisis. Since The Future was published, we have seen the development of renewable energy continue to progress faster than I could have imagined, along with a stunningly sharp decline in the price of renewable energy. In 2000, analysts predicted that wind capacity would reach 30GW by 2010. In reality, that was exceeded by 14.5 times in 2015. In 2002, analysts predicted the solar energy market would grow 1GW per year by 2010. That was exceeded by 17 times; in 2015 it was exceeded by 58 times and it is predicted to be exceeded by as much as 68 times in 2016. And there are no signs of these trends stopping. I also certainly hoped for, but could not have predicted, the willingness of global leaders to come together so eagerly to chart a path forward to solve the climate crisis this past December. Actors in every part of our global society are recognising not only the challenges we face due to these key drivers but also the opportunities they provide. And they are actively working together to take advantage of these opportunities. We also cannot ignore the speed with which many of these changes are taking place and having an impact on our society as a whole. We can, we will and we are working to minimise their negative impacts and take hold of the opportunities they present us with – but we cannot wait and we must do more. Henry: You refer to the beginning of a massive global transformation to re-establish a healthy balance between human civilisation and the future. What could this look like in 2050? Gore: The good news is that establishing a healthy balance between human civilisation and the future is within our reach but it will require a highly functioning global ideology – and ours currently needs substantial reforms. Capitalism must incorporate reforms to show complete and accurate measurements of the full spectrum of “value”, including both positive and negative “externalities”, so that we can effectively respond to threatening crises like climate change. As for democracy, which until recent history has served as a beacon of hope and leadership for the world, it has been hacked by large corporations and special interests. It no longer reflects the ideals it was established to embody and instead is dominated by the unchecked influence of money in politics. This must be changed urgently so that we can once again harvest “the wisdom of crowds” in self-governance. If we are to have the healthy balance that is well within our reach, we’ll need to re-evaluate our current reliance on gross domestic product, fully recognise the value of public goods, redesign growth, agriculture and forestry with sustainability as a guide, and firmly establish leadership based on the deepest human values. But there is hope. Technology, for its part – particularly the internet – is giving voice to the growing movement for reform. Social media, blogs and digital journalism are leveling the playing field and serving as the foundation for broader participation in democracy, and the elevation of reason over wealth and power. And, as income inequality persists throughout the world, more calls are being made to ensure that our measurements of growth are fair and logical. The Paris agreement shows us that we can do the collaborative work necessary for a healthy, sustainable future. 2050 could be dominated by clean, efficient energy and a zero-carbon, commonsense economy, which utilises a long-term view and protects the planet for future generations. Developing nations like India and Bangladesh, where they are installing nearly two new rooftop photovoltaic systems every minute, and countries in west and east Africa are already embracing a future powered by clean energy. We have all the tools we need to solve the climate crisis and ensure a sustainable future; the only question is how dramatically we can accelerate this transition. Henry: Reflections for Australia – what could this look like in Australia in 2050? Where are Australia’s strengths and weaknesses for this transformed future? Gore: Australia is one of the world’s “canaries in the coalmine”, a place where we are already seeing the impacts of the climate crisis. This past year was one of Australia’s five hottest years of all time and annual rainfall was well below average. Hotter temperatures and rising sea-level projections mean that the climate crisis could cost Australia as much as $200bn. In the face of this harsh new climate reality, there have been political forces in your country working to prevent Australia’s ability to act as the global leader it once was in the effort to solve the climate crisis. The most recent example of this is the announcement of major cuts to Australia’s CSIRO, a global leader and reference point for climate science. These cuts will deeply affect the source of valuable research for the entire world at a time when such information is critical to solving the challenge of our changing climate. They should be re-evaluated at the highest level. In 2014, I was disappointed by the repeal of Australia’s nationwide price on carbon. Despite [Australia’s] legacy as a world leader, this step placed Australia behind other major industrial nations in the growing global effort to reduce carbon emissions. Yet the continued public support for the Renewable Energy Target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Climate Change Authority are encouraging signs of Australia’s continued effort to solve the climate crisis. In areas where the national government has failed to act or when political forces work to prevent climate action, Australia’s subnational governments and businesses are, in fact, proving to be a bold force. And despite government cuts in investment, individuals are leading the way by investing in clean energy like solar PV. According to a report last year, approximately 15% of Australian homes were equipped with solar panels. Much of this growth is due to important policy choices in places like South Australia and Queensland. By the end of 2014, more than 1.4m small-scale solar PV systems were installed across Australia. And there are even more encouraging signs. From June 2014 to June 2015, annual emissions were the second lowest since 2000 and per capita emissions were 28.4% lower than they were in 1990. These examples, along with the Labor party’s pledge to adopt a 50% renewable energy target by 2030, show that there is strong support and opportunity for climate action in the country. Australia has a rich history of beating its international commitments on climate change, beginning with the commitment made under the Kyoto protocol. The country’s business and government sectors must return to the vanguard of solving the climate crisis and remember that political will is a renewable resource. Henry: You dedicate your book The Future to your mother. What did she and your other mentors give you that has helped you think about change and the future? Gore: My mother was a pioneer in pursuing the rights of women. She was one of the first women to graduate from Vanderbilt law school in my home state of Tennessee. After graduating, she could not find legal work anywhere in the city of Nashville because none of the law firms there would hire women. She had to leave Tennessee and go elsewhere in order to seek employment. Even in the prime of her career she still faced this kind of discrimination on a regular basis. When I first encountered the history of women’s suffrage and the long struggle in my country for women’s rights, I imagined the difficulties in those first decades of the 20th century that my own mother faced, not only in finding work in her profession but raised in a society where the right to vote was decided on gender. It hit me like a bolt of lightning. I could not understand how there could be or have been such discrimination against women. But I took from that realisation a message of real hope because if we could change so much from that time until now, it means that more change is possible. And the women’s suffrage movement is not the only moral cause humanity has had to deal with. We have seen similar struggles in the civil rights movement of my country, the movement against apartheid in South Africa and the movement to remove discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. These examples all demonstrate that the political will to act is, itself, a renewable resource. They are fantastic sources of hope for all the work that must be done in order to realise a sustainable agenda for the future. As the great poet Wallace Stevens said: “After the last ‘no’ comes a ‘yes’ and on that ‘yes’ the future of the world depends.” Al Gore is a former vice-president of the United States.

The certificate means SunPower Corporation has met rigorous environmental benchmarks covering every stage of a solar panel’s life. Certification comes from the C2C Products Innovation Institute in the US, which is attempting to drive a “new industrial revolution” and transform manufacturing into a positive force. SunPower designs, manufactures and produces high efficiency solar energy cells, panels and power plants for homes, businesses and utilities. It has been behind some of the most cutting-edge solar power developments. It is supplying one of the world’s largest solar energy projects in California, which will power 255,000 homes when it opens at the end of 2015. This year it also completed a solar plant in Chile, covering 328 acres of land and producing enough energy for 70,000 homes. In seeking a C2C certificate, SunPower’s particular challenges were materials and waste. It will not use conflict minerals such as tin, tantalum, gold and tungsten. Neither will it use cadmium chloride or cadmium chemicals, found in some solar panels. But it brought suppliers on board to achieve its goal to use sustainable materials. All waste – generated during manufacturing and at the end of a panel’s life – is critical. SunPower’s largest solar panel assembly site in Mexicali, Mexico, is its first to achieve zero waste to landfill. It lowered its waste disposal costs by over 50% in the first year, cut water consumption by over 50% and 44% of its energy comes from renewable sources. Mexicali is a model for the company’s other assembly sites, which are on track to achieve the same results in 2015. Inert fluorides left over in solar cell manufacturing posed some difficulty but they are now being made into sludge cakes and the company is partnering with cement manufacturers to use the waste as a raw material. Its approach is to see waste as a design challenge. A member of the Circular Economy 100, set up and run by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the company promises to take back, reuse and recycle the panels it makes. It’s also committed to innovation. More efficient and technologically advanced panels generate more power from the space they occupy. In large solar farms this makes a difference – less land is needed. SunPower’s innovations mean panels degrade more slowly and it has stretched the lifetime of a panel to 40 years. Each month, SunPower’s executive sustainability council debates the technical, environmental, ethical and legal challenges thrown up by manufacturing and employing people around the world. The company makes its solar cells in the Philippines and Malaysia and the panels in the Philippines, Mexico and France. Another of its major projects is the California Valley solar ranch, a 250MW power plant supplying 100,000 homes. The energy it produces is the equivalent to removing about 65,000 cars from the road every year. SunPower’s history is peppered with firsts. In 1993 its solar cells powered a Honda car to win a race across Australia and in 1997 it provided energy for Nasa’s Pathfinder aircraft. In 2011 the company’s technology enabled a prototype solar plane to fly for 26 hours non-stop without using any other fuel – a first in aviation history. The company is based in Silicon Valley, California, and has been majority owned by Total since 2011. It also pays attention to activities that are much less high profile. The company belongs to GRID Alternatives to help communities in need. It runs 3S, a social enterprise on the Smokey Mountain rubbish dump in the Philippines that supplies rechargeable lights to1,500 families living there. The families earn less than $1 a day from scavenging or making charcoal but spend as much as 25% of their income on candles and kerosene. SunPower’s alternative lighting is safer and gives single mothers a livelihood by training and employing them. In fact, some of the company’s newest employees came from the 3S program, which is aimed at breaking the cycle of poverty. The Guardian judges were particularly impressed with candidates in this category. They felt it was important that “net positive” didn’t just mean not doing the wrong things, but equated to making changes, and in some cases creating a positive addition to industry. They felt the category represented a holistic, systemic approach to business operations. The C2C Institute has awarded silver certification to 238 products including work clothes, lithographic sheets, bricks, sunshades and aluminium wheels. The institute has five categories for certifying products: material health, material reutilisation, renewable energy, water stewardship and social fairness. There are also five levels of certificate: basic, bronze, silver, gold and platinum. SunPower is the 2015 winner of the innovation award in the net positive category of the Guardian Sustainable Business Awards."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"business/2015/oct/15/national-grid-winter-capacity-lowest-in-eight-years","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-15T11:26:10Z","webTitle":"National Grid winter capacity is lowest in a decade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/15/national-grid-winter-capacity-lowest-in-eight-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/oct/15/national-grid-winter-capacity-lowest-in-eight-years","fields":{"headline":"National Grid winter capacity is lowest in a decade","bodyText":"National Grid has said it is more likely to draw on additional sources of power to keep the country’s electricity running after the chance of blackouts rose to its highest in a decade. The operator of pipes and pylons said it had enlisted power stations to provide extra capacity and asked companies to be ready to reduce usage to help it meet peak demand. The additional capacity means forecast requirements are manageable, National Grid said. The measures will cost the average electricity customer less than 50p a year, it added. This years forecast capacity margin – the difference between available supply and expected peak demand – is 1.2% before the additional measures, the lowest since 2005-6. With the additional capacity included it rises to 5.1%. In its winter report, National Grid said: “The winter view analysis has informed our procurement of additional contingency balancing reserve. These additional balancing services are in place and there is an increased likelihood we will use these tools to help us balance the system over the winter period. “We expect electricity margins to be tight but manageable for this winter. We have procured our contingency balancing services which we may need to use in order to help us balance the system.” National Grid has faced criticism for allowing a fall in spare capacity from a peak of 16.8% – excluding additional sources – as recently as 2011-2012. This winter it will have less breathing space after closures and reduction in output at a number of power stations. Amber Rudd, secretary of state for energy and climate change, said: “Keeping the lights on is non-negotiable. National Grid has the right tools in place to manage the system this winter and we will ensure that they continue to do so in future.” The solar energy industry has blamed the antiquated state of Britain’s electricity grid for preventing new connections to the system. The distribution network operator for the Midlands, south-west England and Wales has closed the grid to new large renewable projects in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Dorset for up to six years. The solar sector has also criticised the government for lack of support after a series of solar panel providers going into liquidation. The government has placed a cap on the total amount of money available to renewable energy businesses as part of efforts to cut the budget deficit. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, said: “Every year the National Grid say they can keep the lights on, but every winter some still say our energy infrastructure will struggle to cope. “George Osborne needs to empower cities and towns to provide local, decentralised energy which can help provide the resilience that the country needs, alongside a smart interconnected grid and clean energy.” Peak demand periods during the winter are expected to be weekdays between November and February. Demand will be at its highest in mid-December, and supply will be tightest in the weeks beginning 26 October and 11 January, National Grid said. “We currently expect there to be sufficient generation and interconnector imports to meet even the tightest week,” it added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/dec/03/bhutan-has-most-ambitious-pledge-at-paris-climate-summit","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-03T16:52:39Z","webTitle":"Bhutan has ‘most ambitious pledge’ at the Paris climate summit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/03/bhutan-has-most-ambitious-pledge-at-paris-climate-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/dec/03/bhutan-has-most-ambitious-pledge-at-paris-climate-summit","fields":{"headline":"Bhutan has ‘most ambitious pledge’ at the Paris climate summit","bodyText":"The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has made the world’s most far-reaching climate promise to the Paris climate summit, according to new analysis from a respected climate change thinktank. Almost three quarters of the mountainous nation is covered in forests, often watered by snowmelt rivers, and Bhutan has pledged to reforest its land even further. Last summer, it set a world record for the most trees planted in one hour – nearly 50,000. According to the ‘carbon comparator’ tool developed by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), the country is now an unparalleled carbon sink, absorbing three times more CO2 emissions than its 700,000 population produces, mostly through hydropower. A substantial portion of the country lacks access to the electricity grid, however. Richard Black, the ECIU’s director, told the Guardian that the country’s push on agroforestry made sense because of its acute vulnerability to climate change. “As a small state high in the Himalayas, Bhutan faces disruption to water supplies, extreme weather and impacts on ecosystems as a result of changes to the climate, so it is in their interests to address the problem both domestically and through the UN climate process,” he said. Bhutan, which tests all policies and projects against a Gross National Happiness index, has promised to keep at least 60% of its forest cover “in perpetuity”. Beyond agroforestry, the country is planning steps to combat the regional growth of ‘car culture’ including heavy automobile taxes, public transit systems and greater use of electric vehicles. Thinley Namgyel, the country’s chief negotiator in Paris, said public concern about climate change had been a key policy driver, in a country dominated by small subsistence farmers. “People are already noticing the temperature changes,” he said. “High mountains which should be closed for months are now open year-round. Monsoon rains are not arriving on time, and then appearing when we don’t need them, destroying crops.” Many water sources outside forest areas were drying up for reasons unknown, Namgyel said, while flash floods were intensifying. “We see a huge [potential] disaster developing from the mountain glaciers, which are retreating,” Namgyel said. “This threatens people in settlements downstream, as well as the hydropower that we depend upon.” Preserving biodiversity has knock-on benefits for agriculture, waterways, ecosystem services and general resource wealth, that need not be directly related to climate change. It could, for example, aid regional exports, Black said. The ECIU’s carbon comparator’ tool provides a searchable database, allowing national climate records and policy commitments to be compared across 36 metrics. The searches cross-reference climate data supplied by over 190 nations to the UN, World Bank and World Resources Institute. Other surprises to leap out of its databanks include a finding that Paraguay is the world’s leading provider of low carbon energy, generating almost 100% of its energy from hydropower, some of which it exports to its neighbours. North Korea has cut its emissions by around 54% since 1990, according to its INDC, although this would not be an example many wish to emulate, even if it can be verified. “North Korea’s emissions collapsed in the mid-to late 1990s as a result of the failures in the country’s economic model, which led to famine,” said Bill Hayton, an associate fellow at Chatham House’s Asia Programme. “Industrial production declined along with most other forms of energy consumption, so what appears like success is actually failure.” Another surprise is that Europe’s richest country, Luxembourg, generates four times more CO2 emissions than Bhutan, despite having a smaller population. France’s record compares well with most countries due to its reliance on nuclear energy, which is relatively low, and an expanding role for renewables in its energy mix. In terms of scale though, these are dwarfed by China’s plans to bring 200GW of wind and 100GW of solar energy into the national grid by 2020, while peaking coal emissions. “It has been a massive turnaround in the last four years,” Black said. “Our analysis of the INDCs suggests that the eventual figures from China will be a lot bigger than even that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2016/jan/12/david-cameron-denies-backsliding-on-the-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-12T22:14:43Z","webTitle":"David Cameron denies 'backsliding' on the environment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/12/david-cameron-denies-backsliding-on-the-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2016/jan/12/david-cameron-denies-backsliding-on-the-environment","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron denies 'backsliding' on the environment","bodyText":"David Cameron has defended his government’s record on the environment and climate change, saying suggestions of backsliding are “total and utter nonsense”. The prime minister also told the liaison committee, made up of MPs who chair select committees, that the government needs to do “more of everything” to deal with the flooding that has repeatedly hit the UK in recent years. Cameron, who pledged in 2010 to lead the “greenest government ever”, has faced concerted criticism over a series of reversals to green policies, including cuts to renewable energy subsidies and energy efficiency programmes. In November, the government cancelled its £1bn competition for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, despite the project being in the Conservative party’s election manifesto. Cameron said that spending on low-carbon energy was set to double to £11bn in this parliament and that there had been an “absolute revolution in renewable energy” during his premiership, with 98% of solar energy installed since 2010. Subsidies for solar power will be slashed this week, but Cameron said: “You do have to think as prime minister that every penny you put in is a penny on energy bills.” The SNP’s Angus MacNeil, chair of the energy and climate committee, challenged this, saying onshore wind was the cheapest clean energy, but was being drastically restricted by the government. Cameron told the liaison committee in December 2014 that CCS, which traps CO2 from coal and gas power plants and buries it, was “absolutely crucial if we are going to decarbonise effectively”. But he defended the scrapping of the £1bn policy, which was designed to help develop commercial-scale CCS, saying, “The economics are not working at the moment.” This was contradicted by US energy secretary Ernest Moniz, on 7 January, who tweeted: “Carbon capture is critical for solving climate change. And it’s working.” The prime minister highlighted the UK’s pioneering Climate Change Act and the carbon budgets it sets for the nation, and said: “We are more than meeting the targets.” However, a leaked letter in November revealed that the UK was not on track to meet an EU target for green energy in 2020. Furthermore, experts have argued, the government’s renewed dash for gas, including fracking, without CCS will make meeting future carbon targets extremely difficult. Tidal power has been promoted by chancellor George Osborne, who signalled support for a project in Swansea Bay. But Cameron poured cold water on the technology, saying that the current proposals were too expensive: “We have not seen any proposals coming forward that would would beat the [subsidy] strike price.” Friends of the Earth chief executive Craig Bennett said: “If dismantling a dozen green policies and putting 19,000 solar workers on notice isn’t ‘backsliding on green commitments’, I don’t know what is.” Cameron was challenged on flooding by Huw Irranca-Davies, chair of the environment audit committee, who quoted one expert stating that the UK’s “current approach to flooding was not only inadequate, but has no likelihood of ever being adequate”. Cameron cut flood defence spending in 2010, only raising it after floods hit later, and has been repeatedly warned of the UK’s rising risk of floods. “On flooding, there is no doubt we need to do more,” Cameron said. “We’ve seen what are called one-in-100-year events, or one-in-200-year events, and they happened in 2007, 2013, 2015, and the country wants us to do more, and we will do more.” The controversial issue of river dredging was raised by Neil Parish, chair of the environment, food and rural affairs committee, who praised Cameron for restarting dredging on the Somerset Levels. The government is going to allow farmers to dredge ditches without securing permission from the Environment Agency, but experts have warned of the risk of faster-flowing rivers rising more quickly and increasing the risk of flood to towns and villages downstream. Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the Angling Trust, said recently: “It is scandalous that the government has hidden from public view the advice of its own experts on the dangers of unregulated dredging and ignored the findings of the study into the pilot dredging projects. The evidence shows that the best way to reduce the risk of flooding is to manage land upstream to reduce the flow of water and soil off fields.” Cameron said a suggestion from Parish that farmers were given more incentive to store water on their land during periods of high rainfall made “very good sense”. The prime minister recounted an anecdote from the village of Kelmscott in his constituency when he visited a site where farmers were being sued by the EA for dredging without permission. Cameron said the EA was worried that some of the habitat of the water vole might have been destroyed. “At that moment, two water voles appeared on the river bank, almost in conversation, and in my mind, at that moment, the argument was settled,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/dec/02/india-takes-leading-role-for-global-south-nations-in-climate-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-02T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"India pushes rich countries to boost their climate pledges at Paris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/02/india-takes-leading-role-for-global-south-nations-in-climate-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/dec/02/india-takes-leading-role-for-global-south-nations-in-climate-talks","fields":{"headline":"India pushes rich countries to boost their climate pledges at Paris","bodyText":"India has emerged as a pivotal player in the climate talks, championing developing country demands that the rich take the lead in cutting emissions and providing more money for poor countries. But desperate for a strong deal to protect it from the ravages of climate change, it is also backing the US-led principle that all countries should act. Narendra Modi, prime minister of the country of 1.2 billion and the world’s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has so far taken the strongest line of all the developing country leaders in the talks. He’s announced $30m (£20m) of investments in solar energy, and has also argued for a deal that would allow India to continue to grow its economy with coal and fossil fuels for many years. “We hope advanced nations will assume ambitious targets and pursue them sincerely. It is not just a question of historical responsibility. They also have the most room to make the cuts and make the strongest impact,” Modi told nearly 150 heads of state on Monday. He added that a strong agreement was need on ‘loss and damage’, the idea that vulnerable countries be compensated for irreparable damage done by climate change that they did not cause “He wants a deal which will force rich countries to increase their commitments,” says a government spokesman. India is arguing that while all countries should work towards reducing emissions, those which industrialised first and whose emissions led to climate change, such as the US, Britain and Germany, should cut the most and help pay vulnerable countries to adapt. This, it says, is a non-negotiable, fundamental part of the UN’s framework convention on climate change and must not be dismantled. “We are not supporting any one prescription [for cuts] … On historical emissions we start in 1850. We are not singling out countries [for responsibility]. What individual countries do is to be decided by them. But the fact is that historical emissions have led to climate change,” said the spokesman. “Developing countries are trying to take action on their own, but their actions will fall short. It should be the responsibility of developed countries to step in.” With industrialised countries in Paris reluctant to offer new money or to cede ground on loss and damage, India is certain to clash with the US and Europe over the next 10 days. But India is not a deal breaker. It definitely wants a deal , according to negotiators from Africa and the least developed countries, who have been working with India. Sanjay Vashist, a spokesman for Climate Action Network (CAN) South Asia, said: “Modi’s line reflects China’s situation 10 years ago. He is saying that developed countries are protecting their lifestyles while developing countries are negotiating for survival. There must be space for people to live a decent lifestyle too. “To understand India’s position, you must realise that 300 million people live on under $1 a day and have no electricity, and that 700 million people depend on climate-sensitive monsoon-pattern agriculture.” “Only a a strong global deal can generate the finance to avert disaster,” said Joydeep Gupta, editor of India Climate Dialogue, a leading Indian analyst group. “It is trying to be a leader of the developing world. It has led the poor and vulnerable in these negotiations by making these demands.” Bill Hare, a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and founder of climate research group Climate Analytics, said: “I think India has some stark choices ahead of it. If it goes into coal, it will not contain its air pollution problems; if it goes into renewables, it will have a much better chance of a sustainable future. We’re seeing [in India] one of the fastest upscalings of renewables that have ever happened on the planet under way now but, on other hand, a huge lot of talk from the coal ministry about it [coal] being essential to India’s future. “One of the paradoxes of that situation is that India is a hotspot of future with very damaging impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations – there would [with climate change] be major reductions in agriculture production, huge increases in heatwaves, and flooding. India, has a major interest in the outcome of the world reducing emissions sufficiently to get below 2C. I think that’s a major challenge.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jul/31/green-news-roundup-cecil-the-lion-paris-climate-text-and-portland-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-31T14:42:31Z","webTitle":"Green news roundup: Cecil the lion, Paris climate text and Portland protests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/31/green-news-roundup-cecil-the-lion-paris-climate-text-and-portland-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jul/31/green-news-roundup-cecil-the-lion-paris-climate-text-and-portland-protests","fields":{"headline":"Green news roundup: Cecil the lion, Paris climate text and Portland protests","bodyText":"Environment news Zimbabwe calls for extradition of dentist who killed Cecil the lion Obama will use veto to defend climate change plan if necessary French climate ambassador concerned over slow progress of draft Paris deal Green groups express ‘major concern’ over Tory policies in letter to Cameron Portland icebreaker protesters removed after judge fines Greenpeace $2,500 an hour Hillary Clinton’s climate change policy pitch: install half a billion solar panels Europe’s offshore wind hits record yearly high with six months still to go World Bank rejects energy industry notion that coal can cure poverty Bee-harming pesticide firms took part in key meeting on their ban Scientists call for ban on live salamander imports to US to stop skin-eating disease On the blogs Climate models are even more accurate than you thought Peru stalling new national park for unique Amazon mountain range 2015 Arctic melting season won’t break records, but could wipe the ‘recovery’ The Daily Mail and Telegraph get it wrong on Arctic sea ice, again Multimedia The week in wildlife – in pictures Decontaminating Fukushima – in pictures Wild beluga congregate in Canada’s Hudson Bay – in pictures The week in wildlife – in pictures Features and comment What’s greener, beef or potatoes?

The company has seen off the country’s largest brands for this coveted green credential by converting farm and dairy waste and harvesting solar energy – allowing it to rip up soaring monthly energy bills. There are no half measures for Wyke Farms. In fact, it’s not only the first national cheddar maker to be self-sufficient in energy, it’s one of the first UK grocery brands and it’s saving over 22m kilos of CO2 a year. The company sells internationally from rolling countryside around the Anglo-Saxon town of Bruton, where the family’s been making cheese since the 19th century. Wyke Farms occupies nearly 700 hectares and produces the third largest cheddar brand in the UK from its own 1,000-strong dairy herd and milk bought from 150 other suppliers in Somerset, Dorset and Wiltshire. It produces Wyke Farms branded butter and cheese, evaporates milk for Yeo Valley yoghurts and wraps Yeo Valley butter. It is the largest independent cheese maker and milk processor in the UK, turning out over 14,000 tonnes of cheddar, and it exports to more than 160 countries. The Clothier family began making Somerset cheddar in 1861 and Wyke Farms still uses Ivy Clothier’s traditional recipe. But in recent years it has witnessed the damage climate change has brought to its county and seen its fuel bills rocket. No better spur, then, for change of its own. The biogas plant took five years to plan and build. It converts 75,000 tonnes of farm and diary waste each year – most of it cow manure and leftover whey – into energy to run the dairy. Biomethane gas is also exported to the grid, helping offset third-party suppliers’ energy usage. Some also heats nearby Bruton. The plant saved £2m in energy costs and over 5m kilos of CO2 in the last year. It has three 4,600m3 anaerobic digesters and the organic fertiliser they produce saves local farmers more than £100k in artificial nitrogen. It also takes in waste from local food and drink businesses. What’s more, the organic fertiliser it produces doesn’t smell, so the overpowering stench of slurry as it’s scattered over the fields becomes a distant memory. The farm has two buildings fitted with solar panels. A new barn was specially designed to catch the most solar energy and together the buildings carry 380 solar panels, producing about 80,000 kWh of electricity a year and saving over 42 tonnes of CO2. They power cheese production in the dairy and 50% is sold to the grid. Heat generated by chiller units is recovered and used to warm water. The investment programme included a £1.3m water recovery plant too – enabling Wyke Farms to recover up to 90% of its factory water. The company uses electric cars and the whole production process is geared to minimising waste. New wrap-around carton machines and the fine-tuning of production processes have cut packaging waste by 70%. Product waste has also been minimised by a £1m investment in new cutting equipment. Wyke Farms is doing all it can to raise awareness locally and nationally, inviting farmers, schools and retailers to its new visitor centre. Its charismatic chairman, John Clothier, a keen country and western singer, has also promoted the company in his own way by performing in local supermarkets. It’s active on social media, promoting its Friesian herd in 2012 with footage of happy cows dancing to a soundtrack of Carnival of the Animals. The most recent advert, Ode to the Cow, was directed by documentary maker Toby Dye of Ridley Scott Associates. Last year the company succeeded in trade marking its Free Cheese Fridays campaign on Facebook and Twitter. Once there were more than 3,000 farmhouse cheese-makers in the West Country. Now, Wyke Farms is one of fewer than 10 remaining, but its determination to do things differently is flagging up the benefits of independence in a cheddar category dominated by multi-nationals and public limited companies. The company has a target to be one of the most sustainable grocery suppliers in the sector, paying local farmers a sustainable price for their milk. A third phase of its investment project is already underway: it will generate more upgraded biogas to fuel HGV vehicles, including milk tankers, and increase solar energy tenfold by using other roofs and recovering heat from the rear of solar panels. It was this commitment that impressed the Guardian judges, who felt Wyke Farms stood out for its integrated sustainability plan. Wyke Farms is the 2015 winner of the Guardian Sustainable Business Award in carbon and energy management."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"science/live/2016/jul/05/nasas-juno-spacecraft-arrives-at-jupiter-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2016-07-05T13:58:05Z","webTitle":"Juno probe enters Jupiter's orbit following 'amazing' Nasa mission – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2016/jul/05/nasas-juno-spacecraft-arrives-at-jupiter-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/live/2016/jul/05/nasas-juno-spacecraft-arrives-at-jupiter-live","fields":{"headline":"Juno probe enters Jupiter's orbit following 'amazing' Nasa mission – as it happened","bodyText":"Well, what a day. What an achievement. After a five year journey from Earth, Juno the solar-powered spacecraft squeezed through a narrow band, skimming Jupiter’s surface, avoiding the worst of both its radiation belt and its dangerous dust rings. It fired its main engine, slowing its velocity, and allowing it to get captured into Jupiter’s hefty orbit. After it was complete, jubilant scientists fronted a press conference, and tore up a “contingency communication strategy” they said they prepared in case things went wrong. “To know we can go to bed tonight not worrying about what is going to happen tomorrow, is just amazing,” said Diane Brown, a project manager from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Scott Bolton, principle investigator of the Juno mission told his colleagues: “You’re the best team ever! We just did the hardest thing Nasa has ever done.” Now the spacecraft will orbit the planet once every 53 days until October 14, when it will shift to a tighter 14-day orbit. And after about 20 months of learning everything it can about Jupiter’s interior and its atmosphere, it will eventually succumb to the harsh environment and plunge into the planet’s crushing centre. But right now all that is ahead of us. We watch wide-eyed, eager to learn about the giant planet, and in doing so, learn more about how we all got here. To find out more, you can check out the article below, or scroll through the rest of this liveblog to see the action, as it happened. The Juno mission will cost Nasa $1.1billion. After an epic five year journey, where it slung-shot around the Earth to gather speed and travelled for 2.8bn kilometres, it will now circle Jupiter for 20 months, before plunging to a crushing death in Jupiter’s harsh and dense atmosphere. Any reports we get from Juno actually happened 48 minutes and 19 seconds earlier – that’s how long it takes light to get from Juno to Earth. As a result, it gets sent directions ahead of time, and is flown essentially on auto-pilot. Despite Juno’s sensitive electronics being encased in a one-inch thick solid titanium box to shield it from the intense radiation around Jupiter, eventually it will succumb to the harsh environment. At that time – currently estimated to be in about 20 months – it will be commanded to dive into the atmosphere. But in that time, it will use it’s nine instruments to learn everything it can about Jupiter’s interior and atmosphere. It will map Jupiter’s gravity and magnetic fields and track how much water is in the atmosphere. Its colour camera dubbed JunoCam will snap close-ups of Jupiter’s swirling clouds, polar regions and shimmering southern and northern lights. Juno itself is an amazing feat. It’s the first solar powered spacecraft to reach the outer planets. It’s one of the fastest spacecrafts ever made. And it has pulled-off an incredible and dangerous maneuver, entering orbit around the gas giant. But the really amazing things will be the science it does as it orbits the planet. One of the big questions is: what’s at the core of Jupiter? Scientists aren’t sure whether it started off as a rocky planetary core, which then gathered all the gas that today makes up most of the planet, or whether it formed from an unstable region in a gas cloud. Another question scientists hope to answer is how much water is in the planet. For scientists, that’s a measure of how much oxygen there is – locked up as the O in H2O. Based on measurements made from Earth, there seems to be less oxygen on the planet than there is in other objects in that region of the solar system. If there turns out to be lots of water – and so lots of oxygen – that would suggest the planet formed near the sun. If there is relatively little water, that would suggest it formed further out in the solar system, and migrated in. How does that eye remain so stable? By diving below the clouds, Juno aims to map the structure and the motion of the atmosphere. That will help scientists see how deep the features we see on the surface penetrate, and figure out how they formed and why they remain for so long. And now we’ve got up a story, summarising what’s happened so far. After a five-year voyage across 1.8bn miles (2.8bn km), Nasa’s Juno spacecraft has reached Jupiter and successfully entered its orbit. Braving intense radiation and a field of space rocks, the probe inched into the orbit of the largest planet in the solar system at 03.18 GMT. The manoeuvre was extremely complex, with the craft first having to slow down and then turn off its engines to enter Jupiter’s orbit at exactly the right moment. Juno’s success prompted joy at Nasa’s jet propulsion laboratory, where team members had been watching the probe’s progress with bated breath. “Juno, welcome to Jupiter,” said mission control commentator Jennifer Delavan of Lockheed Martin, which built Juno. In the background, scientists could be seen cheering, clapping and hugging each other. “You’re the best team ever! We just did the hardest thing Nasa has ever done,” said Scott Bolton, principle investigator of the Juno mission. You can read the full story here: About 400 years ago, Galileo discovered that some of the “stars” near Jupiter weren’t moving as expected. He figured out they were actually moons, orbiting Jupiter. Until now, nobody had seen that system – like a mini solar system itself, almost – up close. But today Nasa released a spectacular video made up of still images taken by Juno as it approached Jupiter, showing the moons orbiting Jupiter. More from the press conference. Project Manager Rick Nybakken got theatrical at the press conference. He said that before the final maneuver today, Nasa prepared a “contingency communications strategy” – what they would say to the public if things went wrong, presumably. He held that strategy up and tore it to pieces in front of the room. “Juno sang,” he said. “And it was a song of perfection.” Nasa is holding a press conference now and we’ll bring you updates from it as it happens. First up was Diane Brown, Juno’s project manager from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory said “It’s overwhelming.” “The risks that were overcome, it’s amazing. The more you know about the mission the more you know about how tricky it was.” “To know we can go to bed tonight not worrying about what is going to happen tomorrow, is just amazing,” she said. Stay tuned for more... The Juno spacecraft announced on Twitter that it had completed its twist, so that it was now facing the sun, soaking up the solar energy it needs to continue its missions. As mentioned earlier, Scott Bolton, leader of the Nasa team behind the successful mission shouted: “You’re the best team ever! We just did the hardest thing Nasa has ever done.” And on Twitter, people seem to be agreeing with him. And commenters on the blog here have been equally excited, congratulating the Nasa team. But so far there aren’t many updates coming in about whether the spacecraft has completed its turn, and is facing the sun again. Nevertheless, Juno’s heartbeat seems to be kicking along quite nicely. Earlier in the day, before Juno approached Jupiter, Scott Bolton said: “As you can tell it’s not easy for Nasa to get he answers that humanity is seeking here.” But now it looks like they’re much closer to doing so. And now celebrations are rolling in from around the world. Google has got in on the action just now, updating its Google Doodle: Over the next 40 minutes, Juno will spin down again from its current five rotations per minute, down to two. Then it will turn around to face the sun again, so it can recharge its batteries. After that it will switch on its main antenna, and it will start communicating properly with Earth. Nasa says locking into that signal from its main antenna could take 20 minutes or more. Nasa has ended its coverage of the event but stay tuned and we’ll bring you the the last updates as Juno completes its final moves, reactions from people around the world and a final wrap-up of Nasa has achieved today. “Welcome to jupiter,” a voice said over the radio at Nasa’s JPL, with scientists cheering, clapping and hugging each other. The burn time was within one second of the predicted time, putting it in exactly the orbit it needed. “You’re the best team ever! We just did the hardest thing Nasa has ever done,” shouted, principle investigator of the Juno mission, Scott Bolton. Cheers have erupted in the Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory control room as researchers hear a simple tone, revealing Juno’s main engine has switched off, and the spacecraft is in the planned orbit. As far as we know now, Juno has completed one of the riskiest and most important parts of its very long mission! Stay tuned for details and updates as they come in. Now Juno will need to re-orient itself, so that it faces back towards the sun and collects the solar power it needs to continue on its mission. “I’m a little more relaxed than when the burn started,” Scott Bolton says. Now he says he’s getting excited about getting some science. The instruments, which have been turned off now, will be turned back on in a couple of days, but they won’t be properly used for another 53 days, when Juno passes the surface again. Nasa says there is five minutes or less until this burn is complete but still, everything is going as planned. The next milestone for Juno is in about 10 minutes, when the engine should turn off. It needs to burn for exactly the right amount of time, to get the spacecraft into exactly the right orbit. But with a 48 minute delay in signals getting from Juno to Earth, it has to all be done on auto-pilot. Scott Bolton from the Juno team at Nasa said that now, assuming things have gone as planned, Juno is in orbit around Jupiter. It still needs to slow down more so that it gets into the right orbit, but technically, it should now have been captured by Jupiter! Right now, Juno is passing the equator of Jupiter. It’s about 4,500 km above the cloud tops – that’s the closest any spacecraft has come. It also means that Juno has passed through one of the two risky regions of the radiation belt. According to scientists at Nasa, everything so far seems to be going well. They’re recording a change in velocity as Juno slows down – again measured via the doppler effect. If all goes well, that will continue for another 10 minutes or so. Still, those Nasa scientists are looking pretty nervous. Everyone’s eyes are on the tones coming in from Juno to the receivers around the world. What everyone is hoping for is simply to keep seeing the simple sine wave hitting those dishes. As long as that’s happening, Juno is still alive. A simple tone has indicated Juno’s main engine has started to fire, slowing Juno, and beginning to put it into orbit. Over a radio, scientists in the control room heard: “Yeah we see the expected sharp shift upwards in the doppler residuals indicating the engine has started.” A small applause was heard in the control room. And now it’s a 35 minute wait to see how it goes! Here’s what the Guardian’s editor Ian Sample said about the things that could go wrong during these 35 minutes: But first the $1.1bn spacecraft has to arrive safely. Should the rocket burn end too soon or last too long, the mission will be thrown into jeopardy with the probe either failing to reach the right orbit or barrelling straight past the gas giant and onwards to the sun. “There’s a mixture of tension and anxiety because this is such a critical manoeuvre and everything is riding on it. We have to get into orbit,” Bolton said. “The rocket motor has to burn at the right time, in the right direction, for just the right amount of time.” A tense moment too, then, for staff at Moog Westcott in Buckinghamshire who built the engine. “The years of design, development, and rigorous technical scrutiny by a passionate and driven team, are defined in one 35-minute burn sequence,” said site manager Rob Selby. “The team here will be watching the Nasa feed with bated breath.” As an aside, it’s worth noting that actually all this has already happened, since it takes 48 minutes for signals to travel from Juno back to Earth! A bit of background while we nervously wait for the engine turn on: During this first pass that we’re about to see, what everyone is hoping for is just for Juno to survive. It’s a risky move, with its engine open as it passes through a region where there could be dust and rocks. But all the science instruments will be turned off. After that, it will enter orbits that take about 53 days, with the instruments turned on. Those aren’t idea for the science mission, but it will save fuel and it will give the scientists lots of time between passes to learn how to interpret the data coming back, and to observe the planet. Then, on October 14, the orbit will tighten to a 14-day orbit, allowing all the key science to get done. Ok! Juno should now have completed the last move it needs to make, preparing to enter orbit. It has turned towards the planet and has increased the rate that it is rotating. That should have taken about five minutes. Now, in about 11 minutes, the spacecraft will fire its main engine, slowing its velocity by about 540 meters per second. Doing that will take about 35 minutes. Fingers crossed! Things are getting pretty exciting! In about four minutes, Juno will complete its final maneuver before the main thrusters are hit. It is starting to spin the spacecraft a bit faster, to keep it more stable as it enters orbit. It will increase from rotating at about two revolutions per minute to about five revolutions per minute. Nasa scientists are able to confirm the speed it is spinning using the doppler effect. After that happens, the last thing to do is to fire the main engine and enter orbit! Just in: Nasa has confirmed the first rotation of the Juno spacecraft has been completed successfully. As an aside, there has been a little bit of disagreement about whether Juno will be the fastest spacecraft ever. In a press conference today, some Nasa scientists suggested that it would be. But Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics says this isn’t true... I’ll leave it up to them to fight out the details! What Nasa’s Juno spacecrat will have to do to avoid complete destruction is quite spectacular. Around the giant planet are massive radiation belts. Accelerated to almost the speed of light by Jupiter’s massive magnetic field, electrons whiz through the belt, threatening to fry any electrical equipment that crosses their path. In addition, Jupiter has rings around it, full of dust and rocks – the precise make-up of which is still a mystery. Avoiding that radiation and the dust completely is impossible. But Nasa has planned a trip that avoid as much of them as possible. So Juno will slip through a narrow area very close to the planet. That path will allow it to avoid the very worst of the radiation, but as you can see, it will still pass through intense radiation, indicated in orange above. It will hit that at both the north and the south of the planet. That will be an intense 35 minutes! According to the timeline, Juno’s slow burn should now have begun. That should get Juno facing away from the sun. That means it won’t be able to soak up much more solar energy, but it will be positioned so that it can slow its descent into orbit. If you want to check out the “tone” being sent back by Juno – what some are calling its “heartbeat” – you can see it live here on Nasa’s Deep Space Network Now website. It’s how Nasa is keeping tabs on Juno. The tone is being received by several receivers around the world including one in Goldstone in the US and one in Canberra in Australia. If you’ve only just come across the Juno mission, here’s some useful info from the Guardian’s science editor, Ian Sample: Five years and 1.8bn miles into its voyage, Nasa’s Juno spacecraft is about to slam on its brakes and fall into orbit around the vast, cloud-striped planet of Jupiter. With all but the most essential equipment switched off for the critical manoeuvre, Juno will turn away from the sun and fire its main engine at 4.18am Tuesday UK time. All being well, the 35-minute burn will slow the spacecraft to 130,000mph and allow it to be captured by the planet’s immense gravitational field. “The whole team is really excited that we’re finally arriving at Jupiter,” said Scott Bolton, Juno’s lead investigator at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. “We’ve been waiting for a really long time and finally it’s coming.” Bristling with instruments, Juno will peer deep beneath Jupiter’s clouds to learn how the planet formed; what drives its brilliant aurorae; and how its complex weather systems produce the giant red spot and the swirling, enigmatic stripes that decorate its outer layers. The planet formed from an enormous gas cloud 4.5bn years ago under the feeble light of the newborn sun. The material leftover became the rest of the planets, the asteroids and the comets. All would fit easily within the bulk of Jupiter, a planet 11 times wider than Earth and 300 times more massive. “The primary goal is to understand the recipe for how you make a solar system,” Bolton said. “What we can tell from our instruments can help us learn how planets formed in the first place.” Read more of Ian’s story here: For a bit of background, why not check out this dramatic video made by Nasa, explaining the Juno mission, what it aims to achieve, and the hurdles it will face on its way. Ok, as we wait for more information from Juno’s descent, here’s a bit about what to expect. The key event will happen at 8.18pm on the West Coast of the US, 3:18am in Greenwich Meantime, or 1:18pm in Australian Eastern Standard Time. Right now, Juno is slowly turning away from the sun, so that its engine will be facing in the right direction when it needs to slow its descent. Here’s the timeline of events, according to Nasa: -125 minutes Begin transmitting tones; Switch telecom to Medium Gain Antenna -122 minutes Begin slow, first turn of 15 degrees away from the sun, toward the JOI attitude -50 minutes Begin fast, large turn to JOI attitude -37 minutes Switch to Toroidal Low Gain Antenna -33 minutes Begin “nutation damping” activity to remove remaining wobble -28 minutes Begin fine-tune adjustment of the JOI attitude -22 minutes Begin approx. 5-minute spin-up from 2 RPM to 5 RPM 20.18pm PDT (03:18 GMT or 1:18pm AEST) Start 35-minute main engine burn +35 minutes Close propulsion pressurant valves +37 minutes Begin approx. 5-minute spin-down from 5 RPM to 2 RPM; (Items below may begin earlier, if the spin down and/or turn complete sooner) +49 minutes Begin turn to sun-pointed attitude +53 minutes Switch telecom to Medium Gain Antenna (tones no longer received) +58 minutes Begin transmitting telemetry (team expects it will take 20 minutes or more to lock onto Juno’s telemetry signal) A solar powered spacecraft, about the size of a basketball court, is hurtling towards Jupiter, about to fire its engines to slow its descent and enter orbit around the gas giant. Called Juno, the spacecraft plans to peer below Jupiter’s dense cover of clouds for the first time – and live to tell the tale. Since August 2011, Juno has been flying towards Jupiter. And in the last hour, it has begun its final manoeuvres before it inserts itself into the planet’s harsh orbit. It has now begun sending back single frequency tones, letting the team at Nasa know how it’s doing. And over the next two hours, it will change its direction, start to spin a bit faster and then blast its main rockets, slowing its pace so that it can be captured into Jupiter’s orbit. It will face a series of incredible hurdles as it does that. It must slip between bands of intense radiation and rings of rocks and dust. While it fires its main engines, they will be exposed to anything it encounters, threatening to blast a hole in the surfaces that allow them to keep firing. Stay tuned over the next few hours as we follow this historic mission through the clouds of the solar system’s biggest planet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/mar/07/las-vegas-casinos-solar-power-nevada-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-07T18:23:54Z","webTitle":"Las Vegas casinos seek to power their bright lights with renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/07/las-vegas-casinos-solar-power-nevada-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/mar/07/las-vegas-casinos-solar-power-nevada-energy","fields":{"headline":"Las Vegas casinos seek to power their bright lights with renewable energy","bodyText":"The glittering Las Vegas strip is not an obvious model for energy conservation. Yet hidden above the glowing Eiffel Tower, neon resort awnings and a black pyramid that shines a beam of light into space, is one of the largest rooftop solar arrays in the country. Twenty acres of sun-catching glass sit atop the Mandalay Bay convention center, and when new installations are complete, it will become the biggest rooftop solar array in the US. In recent months, three of Nevada’s largest casino companies – MGM Resorts, Wynn, and Las Vegas Sands – have announced plans to buy and produce more renewable energy for their hotels, a move driven both by increasing demand for responsible energy use from the companies that rent their conference halls, and a surplus of cheap power from solar farms in Nevada and California. “It’s no accident that we put the array on top of a conference center. This is good business for us,” said Cindy Ortega, chief sustainability officer at MGM Resorts. “We are looking at leaving the power system, and one of the reasons for that is we can procure more renewable energy on the open market.” But there is a big shadow lurking over a rapid greening of the Las Vegas strip. Regulators will not let casinos simply walk away from the state’s monopoly utility provider, NV Energy. Together, the casinos’ 15 properties account for 7% of NV Energy’s electricity sales, and if that income were lost, the utility says, its remaining customers would have to endure significant rate hikes. As a result, the public utility commission (PUC) of Nevada is demanding resorts pay tens of millions of dollars to leave NV Energy’s services, a December 2015 decision which one casino has appealed. Las Vegas’s power drama captures an ongoing dilemma in the new energy economy. While corporations have been encouraged to go green, their efforts pass the burden of subsidizing old utility regimes on to retail consumers, which regulators cannot allow. “They need to maintain the grid. You cannot let these utilities go bankrupt or else every business in the city dies,” said Bill Ellard, an energy economist for the American Solar Energy Society. “What will happen if they don’t maintain the grid properly and the transformers blow?” In December, Nevada’s three-member PUC effectively destroyed a thriving rooftop solar industry by approving NV Energy’s request to drastically lower the rate at which solar users are compensated for excess energy they provide to the grid. “This is what I call a death spiral for utilities,” said Ellard. “They make it hard to go solar because once you defect from them, that affects revenue. Then they increase rates on everybody else, forcing them to defect.” MGM Resorts has already hurt utility profits though an ambitious energy conservation effort. In addition to building a solar array strong enough to power 1,000 homes for one year, the corporation is replacing 1.3m light bulbs in its properties with LEDs. But to power multi-thousand-room resorts which house nightclubs, pools, theaters and slot machine-packed casinos would require more solar panels than the companies have rooftop space. They are consequently joining a trend in big energy consumers requesting to buy electricity outside the utility system. “They are all very concerned with their bottom lines,” said Rebecca Wagner, a former member of Nevada’s PUC. “The energy market in the west is great right now, so they are seeking to curb costs by getting in that market.” Cheap natural gas is probably driving the initiative more than anything else, Wagner says. But according to Ellard, the antipathy casinos have for NV Energy’s monopoly also previews the next phase in an energy economy where renewables are competitive with fossil fuel prices. “It’s complex because it’s not just electricity,” he said. “It’s natural gas, wind, coal, smart grid, big data, oil – it’s all connected. We’re at this next change point where wind and solar [battery] storage and smart software are going to start to replace all those energy sources.” If the resorts do decide to separate from NV Energy, it will still cost them a combined $126.5m, a price set by the PUC which they say is necessary to prevent broad consumer rate hikes and to compensate the utility provider for losses incurred on power plants and other assets purchased with casino demand in mind. The resorts have complained that this “exit fee” is too high – and perhaps even illegal. “The PUC has simply made up rules as it goes along so as to discourage any applicants from exiting [NV Energy’s] service,” Wynn lawyers stated in a January judicial appeal. (MGM and the Las Vegas Sands are considering their options.) Wynn’s president, Matthew Maddox, also noted in PUC testimony that NV Energy is owned by Warren Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway (based in Omaha, Nebraska), and is therefore, in his estimation, more concerned with maximizing profits than with maintaining Nevada’s grid. Maddox pointed out that their money doesn’t even stay in Nevada, saying: “it goes to Omaha”. Data storage company Switch faced a similar situation last year when it announced plans to use 100% renewable energy to power its giant computer servers. NV Energy was not able to meet those energy demands, and the PUC said the company would have to pay $27m to break up with the utility provider since its large data centers amounted to nearly 3% of NV Energy’s electricity sales. As a compromise, Switch is paying the utility company to build a new solar array in North Las Vegas to meet their sustainability goals. The city of Las Vegas, too, is planning to use 100% renewable energy to power its municipal buildings, fire stations, city parks and streetlights by 2017. That would make Las Vegas the largest US city to achieve such a goal. But to get PUC approval, it also had to promise to buy most of the power from an NV Energy solar plant in nearby Boulder City. Nevadans are thus subsidizing NV Energy’s green investments while it lobbies against private rooftop solar installations by their customers. MGM Resorts’s sustainability chief, Ortega, would not comment on her company’s wrangling with NV Energy and the PUC. But she did endorse the broad push toward sustainability as a way to combat notions that Sin City lacks a conscience. “The more we can dispel the myths around Las Vegas the better destination it is,” Ortega said. “We have the ability to educate a wide variety of stakeholders on how we can exponentially reduce environmental impacts,” she added. “Las Vegas is the perfect place to do that because we have 40 million people come here every single year, and so what better place to start telling that story.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/sep/06/panasonic-slams-governments-damaging-solar-panel-subsidy-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-06T11:02:57Z","webTitle":"Panasonic criticises 'damaging' cuts to solar panel subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/06/panasonic-slams-governments-damaging-solar-panel-subsidy-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/sep/06/panasonic-slams-governments-damaging-solar-panel-subsidy-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Panasonic criticises 'damaging' cuts to solar panel subsidies","bodyText":"Panasonic, one of the world’s largest electronics companies, has urged the UK government to think again about its plans to cut subsidies for homeowners who install solar panels. The Japanese company, which is a major supplier of solar panels in Britain, said it normally tried to avoid intervening in political decisions but could not stand by and watch the industry being attacked. Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, said 10 days ago that she would consult on plans to reduce financial support for solar energy installations in a bid to ease the burden on bill payers. Daniel Roca, the UK country manager for the solar division of Panasonic, urged ministers to think again about their proposals, which involve some feed-in tariff subsidies (Fits) being cut by almost 90%. “Let’s keep [the industry] alive, let’s help it further develop to become fully independent from state support, with energy storage and a closer involvement of utilities. But let’s not push the bird out of the nest before it can properly fly,” he said. “We therefore urge the UK government to immediately open dialogue with the solar industry during this consultation period to evaluate and significantly reduce and balance these proposed cuts and the substantial damage they will inevitably and irreversibly cause.” The strong words from Panasonic follow warnings of a wholesale collapse in the industry from the panel installer Solarcentury. The proposed changes to the Fits come shortly after the early phase out of the renewable obligation subsidy, a support mechanism for larger renewable electricity projects. Frans van den Heuvel, the chief executive of Solarcentury, said: “In little more than three months, the Conservative government has literally turned upside down the certainties which had characterised the UK renewables market and the cross-party consensus that underpinned it. “If the consultation is enacted, we can expect to see a wholesale collapse in solar take-up by homeowners and businesses ... So much for Amber Rudd’s promised ‘solar revolution’ and the former Conservative energy minister’s pledge to put ‘rocket boosters’ under the non-domestic roof sector.” The solar trade bodies have also been up in arms about the changes, which come on top of plans to reduce or axe aid for onshore wind installations, energy efficiency schemes and a climate change levy to encourage renewables. At the time the solar consultation on Fits was announced, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) defended it as necessary to avoid huge budget overruns. “We are taking urgent action to get a grip of this overspend and protect hardworking bill payers. Our support has driven down the cost of renewable energy significantly,” said a DECC spokeswoman. “As costs continue to fall and we move towards sustainable electricity investment, it becomes easier for parts of the renewables industry to survive without subsidies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/dec/11/energy-crisis-1970s-oil-shock-climate-change-opec","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-11T15:20:28Z","webTitle":"Americans weaned themselves off oil in the 1970s.

We can do it again","bodyText":"Americans are capable of dramatically changing their energy use. And our political leaders can take decisive, bipartisan action on global environmental problems. This is not just wishful thinking. We know this because they have done so before – in response to the 1970s oil crisis. Before the crisis, the federal government had no real energy policy. Decades of cheap oil helped fuel the economic boom after the second world war. Until the early 1970s, few policymakers believed this would change. But between October 1973 and March 1974 the price of oil quadrupled, thanks to the October war between Israel and her neighbors, the rising power of Opec and the boycott organized by a group of Arab states. Suddenly political leaders scrambled to find solutions to what became defined as “the energy crisis”. Americans agreed to turn off their Christmas lights and cope with gasoline rationing. The public went from assuming that oil would remain cheap forever to fearing it would soon run out. The energy policies that followed the oil shock had two remarkable qualities. They were overwhelmingly bipartisan: an otherwise-hostile democratic Congress quickly passed Richard Nixon’s emergency conservation measures, including a nationwide 55mph speed limit; the next democratic Congress adopted the Ford administration’s 1975 energy bill establishing mandatory fuel economy standards. Over the next 13 years, average automotive fuel economy rose 81%. There was also bipartisan support for boosting energy and conservation research, leading to a seven-fold funding rise between 1973 and 1979. Some investments yielded little, including the billions of dollars that were sunk into synfuels and nuclear fission. But other projects paid off: the astonishing growth in shale gas production in the 2000s can be traced to federally-funded programs and subsidies in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s that led to breakthroughs in drilling, fracturing, mapping and shale gas recovery. No one took energy policy more seriously than Jimmy Carter. Shortly after taking office in 1977 he declared in a televised address: “With the exception of preventing war, this (energy crisis) is the greatest challenge our country will face during our lifetimes.” Carter pushed for both conservation and price deregulation, and greater reliance on solar energy, coal and “synthetic” fuels made from coal and shale. But the second striking feature of these policies is that many were driven by a mistaken belief that the world was running out of oil. President Carter warned that oil wells “were drying up all over the world”. His secretary of energy, James Schlesinger, predicted “a major economic and political crisis in the 1980s as the world’s oil wells start to run dry”. The energy policies of the 1970s were obviously not designed to reduce carbon emissions. Few policymakers took climate change seriously before the summer of 1988, when Senate hearings during a Washington heatwave created a media sensation. Some of the post-1973 policies – like the promotion of coal-fired power plants – probably boosted carbon emissions. Yet on balance, the policies triggered by the illusory fear of oil depletion have done more to curb carbon emissions than any post-1990 policies meant to address global climate change. The level of decarbonization that the US achieved after the oil crisis is remarkable. In the decade before 1973, US carbon emissions rose an average of 4.1% a year; since 1973 emissions have grown just 0.2% a year. If we had continued on our pre-1973 “business as usual” trend, today the US would be emitting four times as much carbon pollution as it currently does. On a per capita basis, carbon emissions have dropped from 22.5 to about 17 metric tons per capita – which does not sound impressive until you learn that in the decade before 1973, per capita emissions were climbing 3.5% annually. While the move away from energy-intensive manufacturing was a big part of this change, this shift was in itself spurred, at least in part, by the energy crisis itself. The year 1973 became the historic peak year of US per capita emissions: ever since then it has dropped. As a result, the response to the 1970s oil shocks gave the planet a life-saving head start in the struggle to avoid catastrophic climate change. Was it merely good fortune that the energy policies of the 1970s helped address a threat that almost no one anticipated? Maybe. But even if environmentalists of the 1970s were wrong about oil depletion, they were right that unchecked growth in petroleum consumption could push planetary boundaries past dangerous thresholds. Today we need a new round of deep decarbonization to forestall climate change. Americans rose to face a similar challenge 40 years ago; they must simply decide to do so again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2015/sep/17/boris-johnson-speaks-out-against-government-plans-to-cut-solar-subsidies","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-17T12:38:22Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson speaks out against government plans to cut solar subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/17/boris-johnson-speaks-out-against-government-plans-to-cut-solar-subsidies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/sep/17/boris-johnson-speaks-out-against-government-plans-to-cut-solar-subsidies","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson speaks out against government plans to cut solar subsidies","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has said he is “very concerned” about the government’s proposals to cut subsidies to the fast-growing solar industry. The mayor of London reminded ministers that 10,000 local jobs were dependent on this renewable power technology which had, in his view, “many, many attractions”. The warning from the high-profile Conservative was welcomed by “green” politicians and industry leaders and came as the chief executive of Shell predicted solar would become the “backbone” of our energy system. “I am concerned about the government’s potential cuts to feed-in tariffs. We are talking to members of all the representative bodies of solar industry in London,” said Johnson at Mayor’s Question Time on Wednesday. “[We are] looking at what we can do to understand what impact this will have. There are about 10,000 jobs in the solar industry in London and solar panels have got cheaper, which is the government’s reason, I think, they are cutting the feed-in tariffs, but I think it would be wrong if the cut in the feed-in tariff actually stops people from investing in solar, because clearly it has many, many attractions,” he added. The mayor, tipped to be a potential contender to replace David Cameron, was responding to concerns raised by Jenny Jones, London Assembly Green Party member. She said afterwards: “At last Boris Johnson is starting to acknowledge how the government’s proposals to severely cut subsidies for solar energy are very likely to impact on London. The cuts will dash the hopes of London’s residents, schools, community energy groups and businesses wanting to generate clean energy on their empty rooftops.” “The proposals, if enacted, will push large parts of the solar industry over the cliff edge to sink or swim. The Mayor has promised to look at the job loss implications for London, which the government could not even be bothered to assess.” The Solar Trade Association welcomed the support of Johnson, saying government proposals to cut some subsidies by almost 90% were damaging for both industry and consumers. Major companies such as Panasonic of Japan have already been unusually vocal about the threat faced by the industry. Panasonic, along with companies such as Ikea, joined with trade bodies including Energy UK and RenewableUK and unions, including the National Farmers Union, to sign a joint statement on Thursday calling on the government to reconsider its cuts to the feed-in tariffs. Shadow foreign minister, Hilary Benn, said: “the very significant cuts being proposed by the current government are likely to cost jobs and investment in the green economy.” Meanwhile Ben van Beurden, the boss of Shell, told the BBC’s Today programme that solar power was a vital new energy source. Asked how renewable energy could affect his oil business, the Dutchman said solar power could emerge as a much bigger contributor to world energy needs. “I have no hesitation to predict that in years to come solar will be the dominant backbone of our energy system, certainly of the electricity system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/oct/23/tories-kill-renewable-energy-boom","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-23T10:02:57Z","webTitle":"The Tories are trying to kill off our renewable energy boom | Ed Davey","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/23/tories-kill-renewable-energy-boom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/23/tories-kill-renewable-energy-boom","fields":{"headline":"The Tories are trying to kill off our renewable energy boom","bodyText":"In the past three months, for the first time in our history, Britain produced more electricity from renewable sources than it did from coal. Between 2010 and 2015, Britain’s renewable power capacity trebled, with over £40bn invested into onshore and offshore wind farms, solar PV and biomass. But that massive progress in clean energy is about to slow dramatically, thanks to policy changes brought in since May’s general election. Without Liberal Democrats in coalition, the new Conservative government is slashing the low-carbon energy investment Britain needs if we are to tackle climate change and reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels. From making onshore wind farms almost impossible to build, at least in England, to plans to slash support for solar energy by 87%, David Cameron, once a husky hugger, is flushing down the toilet what Tories during the coalition years called “green crap”. And destroying thousands of green jobs in the process. For Liberal Democrat former ministers like myself, these Tory attacks were inevitable the minute they got a majority. My experience as energy and climate change secretary – in the months I spent battling George Osborne over the budget for investment in low carbon, and in the daily attrition with Eric Pickles over onshore wind – was that many Conservatives simply regard their commitment to climate change action as something they had to say to get into power. With some honourable exceptions, most Conservatives I worked with seemed to view Lib Dem green energy policies as part of the political price they paid for the coalition. Happily, the Conservatives cannot undo much of what the coalition achieved: from the trebling of the UK’s renewable power capacity to the 27 contracts I signed in March for more renewable power plants to be built over the next few years, the Lib Dems’ green legacy stands. I have heard that the chancellor has asked if he can get out of the contracts I signed. But he can’t. So I’m looking forward to Conservative ministers opening onshore and offshore wind farms that I commissioned. But the bad news is the Conservatives are failing dramatically to build on the green opportunity we helped create: of tumbling prices for wind and solar power, of a world-beating offshore wind industry, and of the world’s first ever low-carbon power market. Tory policy announcements since May have caused the UK’s renewable energy investment to collapse, large numbers of green firms and jobs destroyed, and our international leadership role on climate change trashed. Conservative ministers are now unbelievably trying to blame this on Liberal Democrat so-called “profligacy”. Yet Tory claims that the low-carbon energy budget is overspent don’t stand up: they have conveniently forgotten that I negotiated a contingency just in case wholesale gas prices fell, as they now have. By not using that agreed contingency, the Conservatives are effectively cutting our long-term green energy investment. It’s economic and climate lunacy. But because the Conservatives are misrepresenting these budget figures, we need parliament to hold them to account. The energy and climate change select committee needs to hold an inquiry into their bogus claims and expose them: thousands of jobs are at stake in Britain’s new solar and wind industries alone. That inquiry also needs to consider the legal aspect. By slowing Britain’s investment in renewable energy, Britain may not now be able to meet either its Climate Change Act obligations or our various legally binding EU targets, such as producing 20% of our total energy from renewable sources by 2020. In the chancellor’s spending review – due before the critical UN climate summit in Paris this December – we will see whether the Tories are embarking on a path designed to break Britain’s international renewable energy legal obligations. So if the Conservatives continue to cut back on renewable energy, it will undermine still further our previous global leadership on climate change – with potentially disastrous implications for these vital global climate change negotiations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/01/balcombe-fracking-village-gets-green-light-to-go-100-solar","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-01T15:00:12Z","webTitle":"Balcombe 'fracking village' gets green light to build solar farm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/01/balcombe-fracking-village-gets-green-light-to-go-100-solar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/01/balcombe-fracking-village-gets-green-light-to-go-100-solar","fields":{"headline":"Balcombe 'fracking village' gets green light to build solar farm","bodyText":"Balcombe, the Sussex village that saw the UK’s biggest anti-fracking protests so far, is set to be powered largely by the sun, after residents won planning permission on Thursday to build a nearby solar farm. But campaigners said they are now racing government subsidy cuts to solar power to get the project underway. The 5 megawatt (MW) project in Sussex will see 18,500 panels installed, generating enough power to match Balcombe’s electricity needs and to power a nearby village. Local residents started discussing the prospects of solar energy in the village two years ago after thousands of people joined protests in 2013 against shale explorer Cuadrilla’s plans to drill there. The company ruled out hydraulic fracturing at the site in 2014 because of natural fractures it found in the rock.The UK’s only Green MP, Caroline Lucas, who was arrested with protestors two years ago, greeted the decision with delight. “Balcombe is showing how things can be done differently – to the benefit of local people. I hope government ministers have their eyes on Balcombe today - and that the huge success there persuades them of the urgent need to rethink their short-sighted cuts to support for Britain’s renewables industry.” The project now needs to beat a deadline for cuts to solar subsidies if it is to be financially viable. A consultation is currently underway on proposed plans to slash subsidies for rooftop solar panels by 87% from 1 January 2016, a move that renewable energy experts have warned will kill off a growing industry. It followed similar proposals by ministers over the summer to cut or end subsidies for larger solar farms and onshore wind, which the government has argued are necessary to protect taxpayers. Charles Metcalfe, Balcombe resident and co-founder of the co-operative Repower Balcombe, told the Guardian: “In Balcombe we said no to the prospect of unconventional gas and oil within the confines of the village. So I feel relieved, proud and pleased that the local district council planning committee have come to the only sensible conclusion, whilst still bewildered by the fact that central government seems to be trying to pull the rug from under our feet in a more general sense. “We would love to go ahead and do more projects like this but they have made it more difficult to be financially viable.” The project must now be built and plugged into the grid by the end of March. It requires £5m of investment, which will come from crowdfunding, local residents and investments from shareholders, said 10:10, an environmental charity supporting the project. Local efforts have already seen smaller projects installed at a primary school and a nearby farm. At a community consultation in May, 87% of people present supported the project. Alice Bell, head of campaign communications at 10:10 said: “Whereas fracking divided Balcombe, solar seems to unite them. Any delay in this project would be a challenge. With recent changes to renewables policy, like a lot of community energy projects, we’re racing the cuts now.” The government has said it will go “all out” for shale gas, announcing a fresh round of licences in August that are expected to open up 1,000 sq miles of England to fracking. This article was amended on 2 October to clarify that the solar farm matches most of the villages’ electricity, not energy, needs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2016/apr/27/five-best-scenic-bike-rides-devon-dartmoor-exmoor-england","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-27T05:30:04Z","webTitle":"Five of the best scenic bike rides in Devon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/apr/27/five-best-scenic-bike-rides-devon-dartmoor-exmoor-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2016/apr/27/five-best-scenic-bike-rides-devon-dartmoor-exmoor-england","fields":{"headline":"Five of the best scenic bike rides in Devon","bodyText":"Okehampton to Brent Tor Distance 32 miles/51km Total climbing 2,546ft/776m Moderate. Mostly on traffic-free former railway path with a loop on hilly lanes Start/finish Okehampton The 11-mile Granite Way from Okehampton to Lydford is a spectacular rails-to-trails cycleway that passes within three miles of High Willhays, the highest point in Dartmoor and the highest place in England south of the Peak District. There are fine views not least from its magnificent Victorian viaducts. This ride adds to the pleasures of the Granite Way with a loop of lovely (and hilly) lanes taking in Brent Tor, one of western Dartmoor’s most iconic landmarks. A mile out of Okehampton is the Meldon Viaduct, a gently curved, tottering Victorian lattice of wrought and cast iron 150ft above the West Okement river. A few miles on is Lake Viaduct with its stately granite arches. The rail trail ends at Lydford, a pretty Dartmoor village that was an important seat of power in Saxon and Norman times. Its castle and fortifications are free to explore while Lydford Gorge, which has a 30m-high waterfall, is free for National Trust members. It’s a steady climb up to Brent Tor, an extinct volcano topped by a 14th-century chapel. A descent through Chillaton leads to a bridge over the river Lyd. The last big climb is onto Galford Down, from where there are fine views to Dartmoor’s highest tors. The return journey follows the Granite Way back to Okehampton. Pub stop The Castle Inn, Lydford, (01822 820241, castleinnlydford.com) is a 16th-century inn with a pretty garden beside the castle.

Bovey Tracey is a pretty town on the edge of Dartmoor and is the home of the Devon Guild of Craftsmen, an acclaimed showcase for contemporary craft and design in an enormous Victorian watermill. From here the route is uphill on National Cycle Route 272 to Ilsington, then across to Haytor Vale. In September this year the Tour of Britain returns to Haytor with a finish at the foot of the famous rocks. Rather than following the main road to Widdecombe, the ride continues on a back road across Haytor Down to Manaton. To begin there are views across the Teign valley to the coast before plunging into dark, enchanting woodland. After crossing the river Bovey it’s a steep climb and then a long descent into Lustleigh in the Wrey valley. There are plans for a cycle track up the valley to Moretonhampstead, following the old railway line, but for now it’s lanes most of the way, picking up the trail a couple of miles upstream of Bovey Tracey, for a welcome flat route all the way back to Newton Abbot that retraces the route from earlier in the day.

Cycle paths, country lanes, including one section on an unsurfaced cycle path Start/finish Exeter The Exe Estuary Trail between Exeter and Exmouth opened in 2015 and is rightly extremely popular, but there’s also excellent riding to be had by following the river Exe upstream, through the aptly named Hidden Valley. This route is mostly on quiet lanes through small villages with a couple of short, sharp hills thrown in. The route crosses the Exe at Thorverton where there’s been a bridge since 1307. East of the Exe the route crosses the floodplain to Netherexe and over the mainline of the Great Western Railway. The 16th-century chapel of Columbjohn sits beside the river Culm and there are good paddling spots nearby. From here the route makes a loop of the landscaped grounds of Killerton Park, once the country seat of the powerful Acland family and now one of the National Trust’s largest estates. The cycle route includes unsurfaced sections but it’s well worth it, especially in late spring for the shimmering displays of bluebells. It’s then along some very quiet, narrow farm lanes to Redhayes bridge, the stunning £3.75m cycling-and-walking bridge across the M5. After a short distance along the narrow, tall-hedged Hollow Lane you reappear into Exeter and can follow the well-signposted E3 cycle route along backstreets into the city centre. Pub stop The Lazy Toad, Brampford Speke, 01392 841591, thelazytoad.co.uk, and there are plenty of great picnic spots the grounds of Killerton Park, as well as a National Trust cafe.

Country lanes, includes some tough hills Start/finish Barnstaple When it comes to hills, Exmoor lanes take a very direct approach: no gentle traverses to ease the gradient, just straight up, sometimes as steep as 25%. But once you are on top the views can be spectacular and so it’s worth trying to maintain altitude for as long as possible. This challenging ride does exactly that by taking in one of the best ridge roads in the West Country, if not all Britain. Starting at sea level in Barnstaple, it’s an undulating climb on the farm lanes of National Cycle Route 3 to Bratton Fleming. Things soon get serious with a tough climb onto Shoulsbarrow Common, beneath the ramparts of an iron-age hill fort. Having gained the ridge half of Exmoor much of mid-Devon is laid out before you in a glorious tapestry. The next six miles is an unforgettable ride on the roof of north Devon and to top it all there’s a pub just by the turn for the thrilling descent into North Molton. The last big climb up Brayley Hill will more than warm the legs up before the ride rejoins the route from earlier in the day for the descent to Barnstaple. Pub stop The Sportsman’s Inn (01643 831109, sportsmansinn.co.uk) is a traditional country pub high up on Exmoor.

Quiet country lanes, fairly hilly, includes two sections on unsurfaced paths Start/finish Totnes The crumpled topography of the South Hams makes for cycling that’s rarely easy going but always rewarding, with a new vista over every hill and narrow, hedge-lined lanes alive with flowers, birds and insects. From Totnes, National Cycle Route 2 is a partially traffic-free route along the river Dart into the grounds of Dartington Hall. Soon enough it’s into the lanes, along a fine ridge road with huge views on either side. Daffodils line the verges around Rattery and the lambs should be audible from behind the hedgerows. This is a landscape defined by farming, and not just crops and livestock: a large solar energy farm near Diptford has raised eyebrows with a local MP describing the fields filled with shimmering photovoltaic panels as an “industrialised desert”. Still, it’s an impressive sight and a glimpse into a techno-pastoral future. The next section follows the valley of the river Harbourne along a beautiful lane that bursts with wildflowers before a typically steep Devon climb up to Ashprington. There are more great views of the river Dart on Cycle Route 2 through the grounds of Sharpham House and back beside the river to Totnes. The cycle path is unsurfaced but generally good, though it can get muddy after heavy rain. There is a lanes alternative but it’s not quite so scenic. Pub stop The Maltsters Arms, Tuckenhay (01803 732350, tuckenhay.com) is a handsome riverside pub just off the route on Bow Creek.

Aiming to shape the “industry of the future”, Andrew Vesey says the rapid rate of technological change means the sector is on the brink of huge transformation which will bring it up to speed with other services such as banking. Energy prices are unlikely to drop, but Vesey hopes to “increase value” with shorter bill cycles, real-time power monitoring and on-site power generation and storage, making people happier with current prices. Vesey, an American, has been in charge of the 180-year-old energy company for just over a year and has already committed to shutting down the coal-fired power stations which make it the country’s biggest polluter. He has also pulled out of AGL’s $1bn plans to develop coal-seam gas in New South Wales but says the next phase of his sweeping program of change will be focused on the company’s more than 3 million retail customers. “Our challenge is digitising the customer interface. We are where the banking industry was about 10 or 15 years ago. We have a feeling that we have the opportunity to bring the customer experience up to what they’re seeing in other industries, specifically banking,” Vesey said in an interview with Guardian Australia. “We’re living in a digital world. That’s a massive undertaking to change the way we’re communicating with and relate to our customers.” Vesey believes the digitisation of domestic electricity services could be combined with rooftop solar and battery storage, the cost of which has declined significantly in recent years, to see the pipe dream of home generation providing power at peak times a reality. In an eye-catching move, Vesey used his knowledge of the US market to invest $28m in Sunverge, a company that has developed a software system to enable homes to take solar energy and feed it back into the grid when it is needed. This is not just the futuristic home of science fiction but the industry of the future, Vesey says, and he sees AGL as the facilitator. “One of the clear bets we’re placing is this significant decline in the cost of home storage technology, a falling trajectory of battery cost,” he says, explaining that the advances in storage mean the economics of home generation are transformed. One thousand homes with solar and batteries would be the equivalent of a 5MW “peaking plant” which could be brought on stream at times of high demand. “We invested in Sunverge to get the capability to be able to orchestrate a lot of distributed resources to make them an important player in the grid which they never were before. Everybody says ‘well, people go off the grid’ if they generate their own power. Nonsense. It’s more value to them to stay on the grid. For the bulk of customers who are looking for a good investment and lower energy costs, declining costs, I can really maximise the return by trading that energy into the grid when they don’t need it.” AGL aims to stage a “very public demonstration of this capability” by the middle of 2016 in order to “engage people to try to figure these things out so as technology becomes more affordable we are able to move”. Months before his arrival, AGL bought some of Australia’s dirtiest power stations from the NSW government for $1.5bn, but the industry veteran has resolved on a new course to anticipate future developments before it’s too late to respond. Investors clearly approve, with AGL’s share price climbing steadily in the past 12 months despite the overall market taking a battering. “We’re not waiting to be in crisis to do these things,” he says. “The industry is based on a technology paradigm of large-scale generation. Technology has challenged that. That’s disruption. Technology has created a capability that isn’t currently integrated into regulation and public policy.” To encourage a closer relationship with customers and reduce the industry’s high churn rate where promiscuous consumers change power suppliers regularly, Vesey will move households on to monthly instead of quarterly billing to help them budget for payments – what Vesey called the “bill shock issue”. People will also be able to use an app to monitor the amount of power being used around the home, potentially enabling them to reduce their bills. “The opportunity will be there to reduce bills but we’re only one part of the cost. Some changes will take costs out so there is potential for that,” he said. “If we fully digitise the interface with the customer, we can give greater value and greater offerings. You’ll see prices staying where they are or moderating, but the value people perceive is going to go up because they’re going to more engaged with their consumption. “People focus on the bill but when you deliver a bill every three months the bill’s pretty big. So what we’re doing is getting people on to monthly bills so they can see consumption before it gets really, really, really big. Digital meters mean people can manage their consumption and the bill and help people manage the bill shock issue. “It will give us a sticky platform that we can use to drive a lot of value for customers,” he says, using industry jargon for getting customers to stick with services. “You don’t have to pick up a phone any more, you can manage it. Customers are as much a part of driving costs out of the business and we want to empower them.” There may be scepticism that consumers will care about anything other than the reliability of the service and the cost, but Vesey has sought counsel from the world’s leading experts in consumer goods. “I was talking to some friends in Silicon Valley and saying that I was headed to Australia, and saying it’s one of the most competitive energy markets in the world, how do I use technology to create stickiness? How do I use technology to gain and keep customers? “And probably the only answer at the end of the day that I could get was you have to give people the internet experience, it’s all about the experience now, not purely economic exchange. It’s not just for customers who are tech savvy – it’s people who’ve never seen a smartphone or a computer. We want to use insights to make sure they get the best experience from us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/14/five-eco-villages-around-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-14T09:38:43Z","webTitle":"Five eco villages around the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/14/five-eco-villages-around-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/14/five-eco-villages-around-the-world","fields":{"headline":"Five eco villages around the world","bodyText":"Guédé Chantier, Senegal “In the 2000s, we felt our land was dying. We were not getting the yields we were expecting,” says Ousmane Pame, who grew up in Guédé Chantier, a village of 7,000 inhabitants in northern Senegal. In the 1970s Chinese agricultural advisers came to the rice-growing area and taught new methods that involved a lot of chemical fertiliser. But by 2002, the soil was seriously degraded and the villagers decided to take action. “The whole village got together for three days to reflect on the agriculture, the economy, the education, because we felt we were going through a crisis.” Pame had been on an eco village design course in Auroville, India, and told the village chief and the whole community what he had learned; the decision was made to transition to an ecovillage, and Pame was later elected mayor. Now Guede alternates between rice and other crops (tomatoes, onions, corn, okra) and has set up community orchards. The village has also established a centre of genetic resources to provide seeds for local species, which are distributed for free to farmers. They also get lessons on composting, seed production and organic farming. The village’s “eco-guardians” organise regular public clean-ups and theatre is used to educate people about the dangers of litter and chemical inputs in the field. The village is also moving to renewable energy, mainly biogas. “We have lots of animals so we can use cow manure to power the biogas,” says Pame. The government has been very supportive of ecovillages in Senegal. It is working on a project to turn 14,000 traditional rural villages into renewable energy-powered self-sufficient communities. In Mbackombel, another model eco village, the children’s academic results went up after solar panels were installed in the village school. Islas del Rosario, Colombia Images of Islas del Rosario, Caribbean islands off the coast of Colombia, show a travel-brochure cliche of paradise. The islands were designated part of a national park in 1977, but that hasn’t stopped wealthy people trying to buy pieces of land from the locals, leading to a long-lasting legal battle. “In May 2014 the locals were recognised as legal owners of the land after a 10-year struggle,” says Margarita Zethelius, an environmentalist who works with the community. During the legal struggle, the community looked at ways to become more sustainable. “They started getting in contact with eco villages and learning about permaculture,” says Zethelius. With the help of NGOs the locals starting installing compost toilets and solar panels. Fundacion Surtigas installed panels for 34 families in 2007 and another five bought their own systems. “The lack of light generates a lot of difficulties – for food storage, for the kids to study,” says Zethelius. “So more and more people have been buying solar panels, second-hand mainly.” The mayor of the region, Cartagena, is supporting community calls for a centralised solar energy system. “If they had a system that would give energy to the whole community they could sell energy to the big hotels,” says Zethelius. “They wouldn’t be the poor ones, but would be selling services to the hotels. That would empower them.” The Source, Jamaica When her mother called for Nicola Shirley-Phillips and her siblings to move back from the US to Jamaica, she only reluctantly agreed. But now the extended family and friends happily live at The Source, a mini eco village with earth-bag homes and renewable energy. The area, St Thomas Parish in the south east of the island, is economically impoverished and the family drew on the professional expertise learned in the US to contribute through healthcare, education and permaculture. The family were the first in the parish to use solar energy. “Jamaica is very much a ‘show me’ place,” says Shirley-Phillips. “So people kept coming in our house to see how it worked, even professors. Then they were able to feel comfortable it. When we started there was only two solar companies in Jamaica and now the phonebook is full of them.” The Source uses a combination of solar and wind for 70% of its energy. The rest is from the grid. “We live on a hill so we can see when the rest of the parish has no power,” says Shirley-Phillips. “When there’s a hurricane people come to us to charge their phones.” Hakoritna Farm, Palestine In 2003 the Israelis built a wall right through Hakoritna Farm, an organic farm in Tulkarm, Palestine, taking 80% of the land. To add insult to injury, they built a chemical factory next door. “We have tried to fight the destruction non-violently, without success,” says farm owner Fayez Taneeb. “However the core of the farm has endured in the middle of all this damage.” Taneeb and his wife decided to make their farm a model of sustainability and peace. Students come to visit the farm to learn how to build biogas tanks that convert animal manure into energy and solar dryers to preserve fruit and vegetables. They can then set them up in their own villages and refugee camps. “By doing this we have created a movement of sustainable energy,” says Palestinian activist Aida Shibli. “It’s an extreme place. You see the contrast between dark and light.” Sekem, Egypt Ibrahim Abouleish’s friends thought he was crazy when he said he going to reclaim part of the desert north of Cairo for agriculture. But nearly 40 years later Sekem (named after the ancient Egyptian hieroglyph for “vitality”) is 2,800 hectares of green crops supplying successful textile, natural medicines and herbal tea businesses that employ 2,000 people. This was all achieved using biodynamic agriculture techniques, a method of organic farming. Sekem’s approach is holistic, with an ethical code of conduct, schools from nursery right up to a university and a development foundation that runs microfinance projects and initiatives to help nearby farms convert to sustainable techniques. Sekem runs a couple of small renewable energy projects but gets most of its energy from the grid. “Unfortunately energy is so subsidised in Egypt that it’s not competitive,” says Thomas Abouleish, grandson-in-law of Ibrahim. But he says Sekem is preparing for the government’s plan to reduce the subsidies: “We recently started some renewable energy projects so they can be ready once people start to recognise that there is an alternative.” These eco villages all feature in ECOVILLAGE: 1001 ways to heal the planet, edited by Kosha Joubert and Leila Dregger.

The renowned naturalist joins a group of eminent scientists, business executives and politicians backing a 10-year public research and development plan to cut the costs of clean energy and deliver affordable technologies to store and transport solar and wind power. In a letter to the Guardian, the group argue that the approach, mirroring the intense Apollo programme that put men on the moon, “will not only pay for itself but provide economic benefits to the nations of the world”. “I have been lucky enough to spend my life exploring the world’s oceans, forests and deserts. But the Earth, with its spectacular variety of creatures and landscapes, is now in danger,” said Attenborough. “Just one thing, however, would be enough to halt climate change. If clean energy became cheaper than coal, gas or oil, fossil fuel would simply stay in the ground.” Scientists estimate that about 80% of fossil fuel reserves must remain buried if global warming is to be limited to 2C, a rise seen as the safety limit. “In the 1960s, scientists overcame immense odds to achieve something extraordinary - the Apollo missions to the Moon,” Attenborough said. “Now some of the finest minds must again unite in the face of an even greater challenge.” “Most of the great advances of the last 100 years have come from publicly-funded research – computers, satellites, the internet, smart phones,” he said. The letter, whose signatories include oil executive Lord John Browne, former energy secretary Ed Davey and climate scientist Sir Brian Hoskins, says: “The plan requires leading governments to invest a total of $15bn (£10bn) a year in research, development and demonstration of clean energy. That compares to the $100bn currently invested in defence R&amp;D globally each year.” “Public investment now will save governments huge sums in the future. What is more, a coordinated R&amp;D plan can help bring energy bills down for billions of consumers,” they say, noting that renewable energy currently gets less than 2% of publicly funded R&amp;D. The backers of the Global Apollo Programme, who also include Unilever CEO Paul Polman, economist Lord Nicholas Stern, MP Zac Goldsmith, former chair of the Financial Services Authority Lord Adair Turner and former cabinet secretary Lord Gus O’Donnell, urge the world’s nations to back the plan ahead of a crunch climate summit in Paris in December. The plan has already been discussed by G7 energy ministers and Sir David King, currently the UK’s climate change envoy, has said Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister and solar energy enthusiast, is keen. Some experts argue that fossil fuels are far more expensive than they appear, when subsidies and the costs of the damage their pollution causes is included. The IMF recently estimated that state support for coal, oil and gas, and the costs to countries of air pollution and climate change was $5.3tn a year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2015/sep/27/uk-to-spend-58bn-on-tackling-climate-change-in-poor-countries","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-27T16:00:05Z","webTitle":"UK to spend £5.8bn on tackling climate change in poor countries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/27/uk-to-spend-58bn-on-tackling-climate-change-in-poor-countries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2015/sep/27/uk-to-spend-58bn-on-tackling-climate-change-in-poor-countries","fields":{"headline":"UK to spend £5.8bn on tackling climate change in poor countries","bodyText":"Almost £6bn of the UK’s foreign aid budget will be spent on tackling climate change in poor countries over the next five years, David Cameron has said, as Britain steps up its contributions by 50% to help meet international targets. The prime minister will unveil the UK’s offer at the United Nations general assembly, before crucial international climate change talks in Paris in December where nations are expected to collectively pledge $100bn (£66bn) a year by 2020. The UK’s promise of £5.8bn between 2016 and 2021 is backloaded, so the UK will contribute the most, about £1.76bn, in the target year of 2020. The new commitment is greater than that of the 2011 to 2016 period, for which the UK offered £3.87bn in climate finance through the foreign aid budget. But campaigners and charities will want to know more detail about how the money is going to be spent and how it affects other international development programmes, which are paid for out of the 0.7% of national income dedicated to foreign aid. Cameron was to discuss climate change at a working lunch at the UN in New York on Sunday, alongside the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and the French president, François Hollande, as world leaders begin to put their 2020 offers of cash on the table. Before the UN meeting, Cameron said tackling climate change and poverty go together and these would help keep future generations secure. “That’s why it is so important that we secure an ambitious, global deal in Paris later this year that keeps our goal of limiting global warming by 2050 to two degrees within reach,” he said. “The UK is determined to play its part, not just by cutting our emissions at home but by providing support overseas to those who need it, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable. That’s why we will increase the amount of aid we spend on climate finance over the next five years, helping communities around the world become more resilient to flooding and drought and providing clean, reliable energy. “That energy not only keeps the lights on, it also improves health and education, spurs economic growth and creates jobs,” he added. The government is aiming to spend 50% of climate finance on adaptation and 50% on mitigation. Typical projects include forestry schemes, flood defences and conversion to solar energy. At the Paris summit, leaders will have to thrash out whether money to help poor nations deal with warming is going to the right places and how any deal is policed. The conference will also aim to restrict global warming to 2C in order to avoid catastrophic climate change, but the UN’s climate chief has warned that pledges submitted by countries so far will fall short of that goal. Downing Street said it hoped the Paris talks would represent a turning point in the fight against climate change and send out a strong signal for low-carbon industries across the world. However, Britain’s support for renewable energy at home has not been so committed in recent years, with the government cutting subsidies for windfarms, solar plants and biomass. This article was amended on 29 September 2015. It mistakenly stated that the UK would contribute about £1.87bn in 2020. The figure should have been £1.76bn. This has been corrected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/14/leading-solar-entrepreneur-to-put-business-into-liquidation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-14T20:08:01Z","webTitle":"Leading solar entrepreneur to put business into liquidation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/14/leading-solar-entrepreneur-to-put-business-into-liquidation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/14/leading-solar-entrepreneur-to-put-business-into-liquidation","fields":{"headline":"Leading solar entrepreneur to put business into liquidation","bodyText":"One of Britain’s leading solar entrepreneurs is set to announce that his business has gone into liquidation, in the third high-profile casualty for the sector this month. Howard Johns, the former chairman of the Solar Trade Association and a government adviser on renewable energy, is expected to blame the collapse of Southern Solar on the government for failing to support the industry properly. Earlier this month the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) denied that proposed cuts of 87% in solar subsidy levels have tipped solar companies into crisis. The latest collapse comes as the National Grid is expected to confirm that Britain faces the highest risk of blackouts in almost a decade this winter. The company founded by Johns has played a major role installing solar power systems for schools, local authorities and businesses. Its failure will add to the pressure on Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, to find a way of averting a growing crisis in the sector. Lisa Nandy, the shadow energy secretary, accused the government on Twitter of overseeing a “chaotic energy policy (that) is putting jobs at risk particularly because of the severe cuts they have made to solar energy schemes”. Speculation about the future of Southern Solar soured an already troubled atmosphere at the Solar UK trade show in Birmingham this week. One delegate at the show, Jonathan Selwyn, managing director of another leading solar company, Lark Energy, said the industry was steeled for more business failures. “We are all pretty angry. Every company I know is thinking about redundancies. “More companies will go bust if the government does not change track. This just puts more people on benefits. It really does not add up as a sensible government policy.” Selwyn and other executives insist the industry wants to move quickly to a point where it does not need more financial aid. Last week, almost 1,000 jobs were lost when the Leicester-based Mark Group was put into liquidation. Climate Energy quickly followed, putting a further 128 jobs at risk. In Whitehall, DECC insists that renewable power must learn to live with zero or lower subsidies. It argues that consumer bills are being driven up by the cost of green energy and solar barely needs financial aid given a fall in industry costs. The introduction of a levy control framework by the government means the total amount of cash made available to renewables and other technologies is capped. The industry insists the blame for this lies with George Osborne’s austerity programme at the Treasury rather than at the DECC. Johns was unwilling to comment ahead of a formal announcement on Thursday when he is expected to launch an angry attack on the way he feels his business has been let down by the government. One of the early pioneers of the British solar scene, Johns was chairman of the Solar Trade Association from 2007-12 and sat on a heat and water taskforce advising ministers on generating heat from renewable sources. He also founded a community energy cooperative, Ovesco, and is a trained plumber as well as holding a degree in energy and environmental technology. Southern Solar has already laid off some staff in the past 12 months and more will now follow. The Solar Trade Association lobby group has told the government that the industry’s long-term survival could be guaranteed by extending subsidies for four more years. But it said “draconian cuts” now will sink a major British success story at a time when ministers are doing all they can to support new nuclear plants. The STA has previously warned that as many as 27,000 jobs could be in danger and has pointed out that there have been a series of earlier cuts in subsidy levels over many years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2015/dec/08/australia-community-solar-energy-project-take-on-the-big-energy-companies","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-08T00:58:14Z","webTitle":"Small is beautiful: the community solar projects taking on big energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/08/australia-community-solar-energy-project-take-on-the-big-energy-companies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/08/australia-community-solar-energy-project-take-on-the-big-energy-companies","fields":{"headline":"Small is beautiful: the community solar projects taking on big energy","bodyText":"What do Sydney’s Young Henrys brewery, Shoalhaven Heads’ Bowling and Recreation Club, and Bendigo library have in common? They’re all hosts to some of Australia’s first solar power projects funded and run by local people in community energy groups. Projects like these are becoming increasingly popular in Australia. The Coalition for Community Energy (C4CE) 2015 national community energy strategy states that there were 19 community energy groups operating in early 2015, with a further 59 projects in development. So, why the surge in community energy? The solar energy subsidies are part of the appeal, although for many it’s the fact that it allows local people to decide where their energy should come from, whether that be solar, wind, hydro or other forms, and puts any profits generated into local hands, rather than those of energy companies. For example, 19 members of the Repower Shoalhaven community group invested $119,800 to pay for 400 solar panels, which were installed on the bowling club roof. The club purchases the energy generated from the panels, which generates revenue for the investors (approximately 7% ROI per year) and helps the club save money (it reportedly saved $4,000 in the first month alone). At the end of the 10-year contract term, the solar power system will be gifted to the club. Local authorities have taken note. Lismore city council in New South Wales is looking into solar farming options, while Byron shire council, also in NSW, is supporting the creation of Australia’s first community-owned renewable energy retailing and installation business, Enova. “There are two great benefits of community energy,” the Byron shire mayor, Simon Richardson, explains. “It allows more people to be part of the solution, part of the low-carbon economy, and be in control of their economic and environmental sustainability. “It’s also a way of ensuring renewable energy can come to the local area independent of what is happening on the energy agenda at a federal level. And it allows the community to be [potentially] self-sustaining in terms of energy.” But, despite the appeal of community energy to locals, it is, unsurprisingly, less attractive to the big energy companies that are needed to purchase the energy generated. One of the barriers to bringing community energy projects online is finding a buyer for the energy produced. It is this issue Enova is hoping to counteract, as it intends to compete with big energy retailers, such as AGL Energy, Origin Energy, and EnergyAustralia, which buy energy from the wholesale market and sell it on to customers. “One of the main reasons why people thought about setting up a social enterprise as a retailer is [because] it’s almost impossible to get community energy projects in place unless you have someone to buy that energy from you to sell back to the community,” says Alison Crook, Enova chair. “The big energy retailers just don’t want to buy from small-scale community energy projects … their systems are too big, their legals are too complex. “We have the time to sit down with community groups and discuss what they need.” Enova has the backing of the Byron Bay community, which is buying shares in the social enterprise, to help the company raise the required $3m to be listed on Australian stock exchange.Byron shire council is also looking to further the potential of community energy by undertaking a feasibility study into a local energy trading system. This could see the excess energy production from the solar array of one building, credited by the energy retailer against the consumption of another building. Ideally this would save local businesses money, as they’d avoid the full retail costs of energy. It’s this sort of system that could see traditional energy companies get involved with community energy. Marc England, executive general manager for new energy at AGL Energy, says: “The grid was built to be one-directional – with energy from big power stations a long way away using an economical and cost-effective transmission to the end user … The move forward is for the grid to be multi-directional, where there will be communication between different locations. “The way we look at it is that someone is going to have to manage that [system] for them, and we believe there is a business model in managing the distributive energy ecosystem. “We have quite an important opportunity here to pull in partners and suppliers from a range of different areas in order to integrate and provide that community solution.” He adds: “But while our traditional business model will evolve, it won’t go away, because it’s still giving an important backup source of power in part of that overall ecosystem.” Whatever the structure of future energy generation and supply models may be, it’s clear that the disruptive force of the growing community energy sector is causing huge ramifications for the whole industry, paving the way for a new era of renewable energy and forcing traditional energy providers to transform their business models."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/feb/13/renewable-energy-investment-fossil-fuel-divestment-investor-summit-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-13T15:00:07Z","webTitle":"Have we reached the tipping point for investing in renewable energy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/feb/13/renewable-energy-investment-fossil-fuel-divestment-investor-summit-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/feb/13/renewable-energy-investment-fossil-fuel-divestment-investor-summit-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Have we reached the tipping point for investing in renewable energy?","bodyText":"Divestment – the decision to voluntarily reduce one’s fossil fuel investments – has been a hot button topic of discussion since 2011, when university students began calling on their institutions to remove fossil fuels from their portfolios. Divestment arguments have often focused on the morality of investments, but the economic value of divestment has recently become hard to ignore. In January, portfolio planner Advisor Partners reported that, between 2014 and 2015, New York City’s biggest pension fund lost $135m because of its fossil fuel holdings. And, earlier this month, Market Forces, an activist group that works in environmental finance, reported that fossil fuel investments cost 15 of Australia’s top funds an estimated $5.6bn. On average, this cost each member of these funds $1,109. For a long time, the corporate case for sustainability has been focused more on public relations than profit. Companies that pursued sustainable policies, the reasoning went, benefitted by gaining valuable points with customers, avoiding embarrassing scandals and – especially in recent years – getting their pick of eager young millennial workers. But profitable sustainability is coming of age, at least as far as renewable energy is concerned. With the value of fossil fuel holdings plummeting and the profitability of renewables growing, investors and companies are increasingly looking to sustainable investments for good long term bets. At January’s UN Investor Summit on Climate Risk – an event attended by 500 global investors representing an estimated $22tn in assets – most of the presenters shunted aside the standard public relations and millennial hire arguments in favor of an old fashioned look at profits and losses. And, as they made clear, companies and investors that shun sustainable, low-carbon assets stand to lose a lot of money. Michael Liebreich, chairman of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, explained the new math of fossil fuels. Coal, he pointed out, is losing value in every country except India. Gas prices have also fallen sharply, leading to a steep drop in investment. A recent Citibank report predicted that oil is likely to “bottom out” in 2016. And Bloomberg recently quoted Vitol oil holding group CEO, Ian Taylor, as saying that crude oil will likely stay at $60 a barrel for at least 10 years. The rise of renewables On the other hand, renewable energy is becoming increasingly viable, a trend that could potentially be a game-changer for investors, particularly large scale, global investors like the ones attending the UN summit. The falling prices of renewables-generated electricity are pulling the rug out from under fossil fuels, which are getting priced out of the market. According to former vice president Al Gore, who also spoke at the UN Investor Summit on Climate Risk, solar power has been dropping by 10% per year. If this curve continues, Gore said, then its price is going to fall “significantly below the price of electricity from burning any kind of fossil fuel in a few short years”. In some places, Liebreich said, this is already happening. A year ago, a solar project in Dubai went online, and offered electricity at a rate of $0.058 per KwH. “This was the solar equivalent of the shot that was heard around the world,” he explained. “In the Middle East, a solar project was producing electricity more cheaply than you could produce it using natural gas.” This month, Liebreich said, Morocco announced an offshore wind farm that will produce electricity for $0.03 per KwH. “This is probably the cheapest new electricity that you could build anywhere in the world,” he said. And not only is this a boon for consumers, but it also sends a clear message to utilities. “When you get electricity this cheaply, you have to buy some.” The same thing is happening in the US. Gore pointed out that in Nevada, energy generators are selling solar electricity to utilities for $0.3 cents per KwH, a price well below that of coal-based electricity. And some utilities are even giving electricity away for free. Gore cited TXU, a utility in Texas. “Here’s their new rate plan: your rates will go up a little bit during the peak use periods during the day, but from 9pm until 6am the next morning, you can use all the electricity you want for free,” he said. “They have to get rid of it because it’s too hard to turn off the turbines. And in south Australia and parts of Germany, they’ve gone to negative rates for renewable electricity.” The case for global investment Falling electricity prices are great news for companies that use electricity and bad news for investors with holdings in fossil fuels. But what about people who hope to invest in renewables? As several of the UN summit’s participants pointed out, building a wind or solar farm requires a significant initial investment, after which the actual price of power generation will remain low indefinitely, as the sun will continue to shine on solar cells and the wind will continue to turn turbines. This is in stark contrast to fossil fuels, which require a large upfront investment for building power plants, followed by continued expenditure for extracting, transporting and burning fuel. And investors have gotten the message: as the Financial Times pointed out last year, the six major renewable investment funds yield between 5.5% and 7% – attractive returns in the current market. Not surprisingly, there has been sharp growth in renewable generation. “A dozen years ago, the best predictors in the world told us that the solar energy market would grow by 2010 at the incredible rate of 1 GW per year,” said Gore. “By the time 2010 came around, they exceeded that by 17 times over. Last year, it was exceeded by 58 times over. This year, it’s on track to be exceeded by 68 times over. That’s an exponential curve.” In 2015, global clean energy investment hit $329bn, its highest level ever. But, despite all evidence of value, many corporations and investors are still hesitant to invest in renewables, and they often charge outrageous interest for solar projects. UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon emphasized that the recent COP21 summit – particularly the pledges made by companies and governments from around the world – could encourage investment in renewables. “The Paris agreement provides a durable, yet flexible framework,” he said. “There are transparent rules of the road to monitor progress and enhance accountability.” Ultimately, Moon says, both investors and corporations now have a signal that the time has come for them to direct their energies toward low-carbon, climate-resilient growth. “It marks the beginning of the end of growth built solely on fossil fuel consumption,” he said. “The once unthinkable has now become unstoppable.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2015/oct/08/uk-solar-firms-going-bust-what-consumers-need-to-know","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-08T12:52:14Z","webTitle":"UK solar firms going bust - what consumers need to know","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/08/uk-solar-firms-going-bust-what-consumers-need-to-know","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/oct/08/uk-solar-firms-going-bust-what-consumers-need-to-know","fields":{"headline":"UK solar firms going bust - what consumers need to know","bodyText":"Two solar panel-installing businesses have gone bust this week - where does this leave anyone who has had a system installed? What’s happened? Two domestic solar panel firms have called in the administrators this week - Leicester-based Mark Group and the Croydon firm Climate Energy. It’s very bad news for customers - particularly anyone who has paid a deposit and was waiting for an installation to be completed. This will no longer happen. I’m in that boat - have I lost my money? Customers of the Mark Group, who signed contracts between July and yesterday, will be OK if their contract has its parent firm SunEdison’s name on the paperwork. In statement the company said it would honour existing contracts. Other customers have almost certainly lost their money. The administrators of both firms have said that all appointments have been cancelled for surveys and installations. They will be writing to affected customers shortly. It you paid any deposit by bank card - contact your card provider and explain what has happened, and you should be refunded. If you paid by cheque, bank transfer or in cash, you have most likely lost your money. I have one of their systems installed - will I still get my feed-in tariff payments from the government? Yes. Assuming the system is up and running and registered, your feed-in tariff (Fit) payments will still be paid for the agreed term - 20 or 25 years depending on when it was installed. Fits are actually paid by the home’s electricity supplier, and are unaffected by this week’s news. I have a system on my roof, but it is not connected - what should I do? Your best bet is to get it connected. Any Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS)-accredited installer can finish the work and register your system. The MCS wesbite has a find a local installer search facility. The YouGen website is a good source of tried and trusted installers. Climate Energy customers will likely have to pay the new contractor - assuming you have the money. SunEdison will complete its contracts. I have a system installed by one of these firms - what will happen if my existing system has a problem? Again this is going to be tricky, but not impossible. SunEdison will continue to look after customers who bought a system over the previous three months. Other customers will likely be on their own. Solar panels came with long warranties and if you have a problem, the manufacturer should be your first port of call - if you can find them. On the plus side, solar panels were built to last 20 years or more, and are the component that is least likely to fail. Inverters are often the most expensive single part of a solar energy system, and the most likely to fail. Again contact the manufacturer. If that yields nothing, you will be on your own. Solar PV systems are not that dissimilar and it should be possible to find someone to work on your system. Again use the MCS site or the YouGen website to find someone who knows what they are doing. I was about to install a system. Where does this leave me? Very nervous. If an installer asks you for a deposit, only pay by credit card as this gives you consumer rights if he/she later goes bust. Don’t hand over cash. The Fit payment is available at current rates until the end of the year but thereafter will be cut by 87%. It is sadly highly likely that more PV firms will collapse in the coming months. You have been warned."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2016/apr/11/where-put-cash-savings-rates-rock-bottom","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-11T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Where to put your cash while savings rates are rock-bottom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/11/where-put-cash-savings-rates-rock-bottom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2016/apr/11/where-put-cash-savings-rates-rock-bottom","fields":{"headline":"Where to put your cash while savings rates are rock-bottom","bodyText":"As interest rates languish at the lowest level in living memory, there is little hope for savers looking on in disappointment at their bank statements. The average savings account now pays a dismal 0.61%, according to Moneyfacts.co.uk, and the firm recorded just 12 rate rises in February – and 235 cuts. For the many people trying to build on their deposits, there are other options available – some of which are potentially more rewarding alternatives, but carry with them risks alongside the possibility of better returns than the banks. Bonds Traditionally, bonds have been the next step up from cash, although 10-year UK government bonds now yield a miserly 1.41%. You can get a higher return from corporate bonds, which essentially are IOUs issued by companies to raise funds. Most investors will buy a fund of corporate bonds in order to spread the risk in case one company goes bust. Darius McDermott, managing director of Chelsea Financial Services, says fixed interest is attractive when inflation is low. “Falling interest rates have driven a 30-year bond bubble, but that could burst if inflation returns,” he says. Performance has been poor lately, with the average fund down 1.5% over the past year. Stocks and shares While cash is safe and dull, stocks and shares are risky and more rewarding. The benchmark FTSE 100 index hit an all-time high of 7,122 in April 2015, but is down almost 15% since. Patrick Connolly, certified financial planner at Chase de Vere, says shares are only for long-term savings. “Never invest money you need in the next five or 10 years.” Most people reduce the risk by investing in a fund, but these can still be volatile. Peer-to-peer lending Peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms offer a tempting alternative to cash, with pioneers Zopa and Ratesetter paying between 3.5% and 6.5% a year. The platforms take money from savers and loan it to individuals and small businesses, cutting out the banks to give both sides a better rate. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, says P2P is riskier than cash as you are lending money rather than saving it. “Given the higher rates, many consider the risks worthwhile.” Your money is not protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which guarantees the first £75,000 of bank savings. Platforms carefully vet loan applicants and spread each loan across many borrowers, while some run contingency funds in order to cover losses. Since last week, you can take your returns free of tax, via the new Innovative Isa. Crowdfunding Equity crowdfunding websites allow ordinary people to invest in start-up businesses in return for a share in future profits. The companies looking for funding can range from pop-up restaurants hoping to expand, to electronics companies launching new products or even funding schemes for films. Given the failure rate – half of start-ups don’t survive for five years – this is a high-risk area. Andrew Hagger, personal finance expert at Moneycomms.co.uk, says: “You could make a handsome profit, but also risk losing all your capital.” Premium bonds More than 20 million Britons hold around £50bn in premium bonds, making them the UK’s favourite flutter. Many are lured by the prospect of winning the monthly £1m jackpot, but David Black, banking specialist at DJB Research, says more than 98% of prizes are worth just £25. “You may get lucky, but how many people do you know who have won a large prize?” Each bond costs £1 and the chances of winning a prize are 26,000-1. This worsens to 30,000-1 in June when the average prize rate is being cut from 1.35% to just 1.25%. Premium bonds are run by National Savings &amp; Investments and backed by HM Treasury so your money is absolutely safe, but Black says they are unsuitable if you want a regular income or guaranteed returns. Gold Gold is supposed to be the ultimate safe haven, but it can be highly risky. The gold price spiked to $1,900 an ounce in August 2011 during the eurozone crisis, but today trades at $1,240, punishing investors who bought at the top of the market. Guy Foster, head of research at Brewin Dolphin, says gold is a curious asset: “It is supposed to be a store of value, but by conventional investment metrics it is almost valueless.” You can invest in exchange traded funds such as the SPDR Gold Trust, which tracks the spot price of gold; a gold miner such as Randgold Resources; or buy bullion or coins. Foster says: “If you buy physical gold, you have to factor in the cost of storing it.” Adrian Ash at Bullion Vault, an internet exchange, says gold does well when inflation is high, investors are nervous, and other assets are falling. “This makes it a useful tool for diversifying from your other investments.” Buy-to-let Buy-to-let has been one of the most successful investments of the past 20 years, but has also been blamed for squeezing first-time buyers off the property ladder. The average landlord in England and Wales earned rental income of £8,394 and capital growth of £13,594 in the year to January, giving a total return of £21,988, according to estate agents Your Move and Reeds Rains. The glory days may be over, however, as chancellor George Osborne launches a tax crackdown on amateur landlords. From this month, new investors must pay a 3% stamp duty surcharge, which will drive up the charge on a £300,000 property from £5,000 to £14,000. Osborne will phase out higher rate tax relief on mortgage interest payments from April 2017, and cut wear and tear allowances, while the Bank of England may stiffen borrowing rules. Green funds You can save money and the planet by investing in environmental funds, but going green could also land you in the red. This sector was expected to shine until a £910m tax raid by Osborne turned down the heat. Mick Gilligan, head of fund research at Killik &amp; Co, says there are still some tempting funds. “Bluefield Solar Income invests in 59 solar energy sites across the UK and currently yields 7.3%.” He also rates Greencoat UK Wind. “It has a well-diversified portfolio of UK wind farms and yields 6.2%.” Numerous P2P crowdfunding sites invest in renewables, notably Abundance Generation, says Andrew Hagger. “You can invest in a solar farm run by Swindon borough council at a fixed return of 6% a year over 20 years.” Alternative investments Savings don’t have to be in bank accounts or on a share certificate. They can be hung on your wall or put in a glass cabinet - or even be small enough to fit in your pocket. ■ Rare coins Investors in rare coins have been in the money lately, with prices rising 6.2% last year, according to the Stanley Gibbons Coin Index. Keith Heddle, managing director of Stanley Gibbons Investments, says: “Luxury and collectible coins are much more enjoyable to own than a share certificate or a unit in some fund.” Numismatics is the official term for coin collecting, and Lawrence Chard, director of Blackpool-based dealer Chards, recommends buying coins in the highest grades or best condition you can afford. “Look for unusual mintmarks, striking errors, flaws and low mintage figures. Just because a coin is old, it doesn’t make it valuable.” ■ Art and antiques Investing in art and antiques might sound daunting, but Colin Sheaf, chairman of Bonhams UK and Asai, says things have changed. “Auction houses have taken enormous strides to make it accessible for everybody.” You can view upcoming sales online and visit the auction house to talk to experts, Sheaf says. “You could invest in Georgian furniture from around £500, or early 18th-century English porcelain from £1,000.” Buying a painting or installation is an art in itself, so master your technique before risking serious money. “Buy what you love, there is no guarantee you will make money from it,” warns Sheaf."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2015/may/22/solar-fuel-carbon-dioxide-co2-climate-change-photosynthesis","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-22T16:22:57Z","webTitle":"Can high-tech photosynthesis turn CO2 into fuel for your car?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/22/solar-fuel-carbon-dioxide-co2-climate-change-photosynthesis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/22/solar-fuel-carbon-dioxide-co2-climate-change-photosynthesis","fields":{"headline":"Can high-tech photosynthesis turn CO2 into fuel for your car?","bodyText":"Imagine having a fuel pump in your driveway that uses photosynthesis, the same process plants use to feed themselves, to turn carbon dioxide into fuel for your car. It’s not science fiction: research groups all over the world have been working to develop artificial photosynthesis, which could greatly reduce our dependence on crude oil and make use of the growing amount of manmade carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change. The concept received a nod from US President Barack Obama when he mentioned “turning sunlight into liquid fuel” in his State of the Union speech in January. Despite carmakers’ efforts to roll out electric cars, liquid fuels aren’t likely to disappear any time soon. First of all, drivers are comfortable with – and accustomed to – their internal combustion engine vehicles and the process of finding gas stations and filling up a tank. And even if everyone decided to switch to electric cars tomorrow, they wouldn’t be likely to get rid of their conventional cars right away, given that cars often last 10-15 years. Battery technology also isn’t ready to replace all fuel tanks: batteries are heavier than gasoline and take up more space to deliver the equivalent power. The battery needed to power a jumbo jet over long distances, for instance, would be so large that it would leave no room for passengers. Electric powertrains also are unfeasible today for big ships. Here’s how artificial photosynthesis works: solar energy is used to split water and carbon dioxide into hydrogen, oxygen and carbon. A catalyst then recombines the molecules to create liquid fuels, such as methanol. Methanol is the simplest hydrocarbon that works in internal combustion engines. China already has already blended it into gasoline at low levels (15% or less) at retail pumps, and has taxi and bus fleets running on high-level blends of 85% methanol or more. “When we develop a way to economically mimic photosynthesis, the impact on everything from global warming to our global economies is world changing,” says Tim Young, chief executive officer of HyperSolar, a Santa Barbara, California-based company working to produce low cost hydrogen fuel from solar energy. After 30 years of research, scientists have made significant progress over the past five years in bringing artificial photosynthesis to the market. Scientists at the California Institute of Technology have created a lab-scale device that converts 10% of the sunlight that reaches it into fuel, according to research published earlier this year. This compares with plants’ ability to convert 1% to 2% of sunlight into sugars and other carbohydrates. Speed bumps ahead However, there’s still a long way to go before the technology is ready for mass production. For one thing, it’s still too expensive. One of the biggest challenges has been figuring out how to split hydrogen and CO2 from water without using fossil fuels, which would undermine the environmental benefits, in a way that isn’t cost-prohibitive. To reduce the cost, significantly higher efficiency than 10% is needed, researchers say, as well as a cheaper catalyst. One of the most efficient and stable catalysts for splitting water is platinum, which – at about $1,100 an ounce – is too costly to be commercially viable for artificial photosynthesis, says Syed Mubeen Jawahar Hussaini, assistant professor of chemical and biochemical engineering at the University of Iowa and the main researcher at HyperSolar. Making a device that’s long-lasting will also be key to driving costs down, researchers say, and then there’s the challenge of developing manufacturing equipment around the device that can mass produce fuels at a comparable production cost to gasoline. “The real challenge is going to be how do you make something like [artificial photosynthesis] at a reasonable scale and have it work in the real environment,” says Kathy Ayers, vice president for research and development for Proton Onsite, which is developing equipment to produce hydrogen gas for industrial applications. In addition, while researchers have figured out how to split water and CO2 in separate processes, they have yet to come up with a single, long-lasting device that can do both, according to Dick Co, managing director at the Solar Fuels Institute at Northwestern University. Solar Fuels Institute researchers are taking a modular approach: they plan to put the existing technologies for splitting water and CO2 together, building block style. They aim to complete a $250,000 prototype by the end of this year, says Kimberly Williams, the institute’s managing director. “These technologies have never been integrated in this way,” Co says. “We want to find out what are the challenges, what are the integration risks. More importantly, let’s have this in front of people, so they can see it from soup to nuts, from solar to fuel.” Myriad possibilities The institute aims to bring its technology to the market within five years, targeting high end consumers that might currently be considering electric cars like the Tesla. But it’s unclear what the end products will actually be. Researchers are thinking broadly, and say they could be anything from consumer products that make fuel at home, such as a mobile carbon-capture device to regulate oxygen levels in classrooms in order to improve learning, to a commercial factory like a solar-based vodka distillery. The institute plans to either license the technology or partner with other firms to commercialize it, Co says. Finding multiple markets for solar fuels will be critical to reducing their production cost, he adds. If that happens, then solar fuels could become as cheap as conventional fuels like gasoline in 10 years, he predicts. Researchers at Northwestern’s solar institute worry about whether they’ll be able to secure enough government funding to even complete the work on the prototype, however. They hope to raise at least $100,000 in a Kickstarter campaign later this year. “A pain point for researchers is the cycle of funding – it’s high, it’s low,” Co says. “It’s really difficult to manage. Ideas come and go. You can’t just sit and wait 15 years.” The Kickstarter campaign’s success or failure will also indicate consumers’ interest in alternative fuels, he claims. Meanwhile, last month the US energy department announced it was renewing its five-year $75m grant to Caltech’s Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, the US’s largest research program dedicated to developing artificial solar fuel generation technology. The institute, a global research consortium that includes the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, Sweden’s Uppsala University and French energy company Total France, also aims to speed up artificial photosynthesis research by creating a database of academic papers, newspaper articles and other materials on the subject. It has developed algorithms to help its scientists search for information quickly and find collaborators. The database already contains about 50,000 pieces of data. The institute isn’t the only one working to develop artificial photosynthesis technology. Panasonic is working to create formic acid, a fuel that, like methanol, can be synthesized from CO2 and can be used in hydrogen fuel cells. A European team of researchers is developing solar jet fuel. And the New CO2 Fuels program at Israel’s Weizmann Institute of Science seeks to convert CO2 into fuel. Harry Atwater, director of Caltech’s Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, said solar fuels research is about where the solar energy industry was about 30 years ago, and it’s just starting to create a new industry. “We are powerfully inspired that we have a photovoltaic industry that is worldwide, multi-scaled with integrated manufacturing,” he said. “We’re laying the foundations that could produce [an artificial photosynthesis] industry in the future.” The Science Behind Sustainability Solutions blog is funded by the Arizona State University Walton Sustainability Solutions Initiatives.

But Britain, once regarded as a global leader, has relegated itself to the ranks of those reluctantly being pulled along in Obama’s wake. Since the election, the government has performed a series of dizzying U-turns on its green policies. It has announced cuts to subsidies for onshore wind and solar energy; scrapped the zero carbon homes standard; ended the green deal for home insulation; and reversed its promise to exclude national parks from fracking. There is no question that the green policy framework has been ripe for reform. Some subsidies have been unnecessarily generous and the green levies that pay for them are highly regressive, costing poor households six times as much of their income than the most affluent. But to scrap many subsidies and regulations altogether will be hugely damaging to Britain’s efforts to reduce emissions and is antithetical to Mr Cameron’s 2010 pledge to lead the “greenest government ever”. It is vital that any framework provides long-term certainty to encourage private investment in green technology. Any reform therefore needs to be gradual and signalled well in advance to maintain industry confidence. But to the alarm of green NGOs and business groups alike, the government has ripped up its green policy framework overnight. This will have a long-term effect on investment, and not just in the green sector: business will question whether they can take government commitments at face value. The implications for the UK’s targets to reduce carbon emissions are serious: the independent advisory committee on climate change has warned they are now at risk. And internationally, the timing of the about-turn could not be worse, with global leadership more important than ever in the lead up to Paris. The success of the summit is predicated on countries pushing each other to go further in signing up to targets enshrined in national legislation than they would have done without international co-operation. The targets on the table represent huge progress since the 2009 Copenhagen summit, but more will be needed to limit global warming to the internationally agreed target of two degrees. International leadership will be critical in achieving this, but the UK has stepped back from the leadership role it previously played. George Osborne has explicitly argued that Britain should be going no further than other countries in reducing global warming. If the US, China and India took this attitude, the Paris summit would quickly result in a race to the bottom. The frustration the US is feeling with Britain was evident in Al Gore’s September speech in London: a damning indictment of Britain’s new backseat approach. The Tories have appeared cynical on climate change. In 2006, freshly elected as party leader, Cameron grasped on the green agenda as a way of modernising the Conservative brand. In coalition, the Lib Dems strongly pushed the green policies. So it has only really been since the election in May that the utter lack of Conservative commitment in this area has become so apparent. The green agenda is problematic for the leadership, with Tory backbenchers worried about the unpopularity of onshore wind and green energy levies. But it is clearly not an area Cameron is willing to push: climate change barely got a mention in his conference speech last month. This is in stark contrast to the second-term Obama, who is using the fact he no longer faces re-election to reinvigorate his leadership on climate change. It sets the UK out of kilter with the global dynamic: growing numbers of business leaders embracing the need for action, and countries such as China now part of the international consensus. The Bank of England governor Mark Carney’s recent speech to Lloyd’s on the financial risks of climate change was a signal that the debate had reached the zenith of business thinking. All national leaders have to manage the tension between domestic politics and international affairs. But whether on climate change or Europe, Britain increasingly looks a country for whom short-term domestic politics always trumps international relationships and global co-operation. Our lack of leadership to slow global warming is not just bad for our planet’s climate – it is bad for our long-term national interest.

When the price of something increases, demand falls. The evidence is in on the markets for electricity and tobacco where government-imposed price hikes have seen consumption fall sharply. There are clear implications from these economic laws with the government’s proposed Medicare co-payment and higher university fees that will mean less use of health services and fewer people going to university as those price hikes impact on demand. The price on carbon, the colloquially named “carbon tax”, saw electricity prices rise 10% when it was implemented in July 2012. One of the many objectives of the price on carbon was to give a financial incentive for consumers to curb their consumption of electricity. This was seen to be through a combination of switching to more energy-efficient appliances, self-generation (solar panels on the roof), and better insulation so that the length of time heaters and airconditioners were on was reduced. Use less electricity and the price rise will not hurt the household budget all that much. It was as simple as that. The carbon price was in place for two years; the repeal was passed by parliament in July. In those two years, the volume of energy consumed by the household sector fell sharply. The Australian Bureau of Statistics says that in the June quarter 2014, the final quarter in which the carbon price was still in place, the volume of energy consumed by the household sector was 4.6% below the level of the March quarter 2012, the quarter before the carbon price took effect. On a per capita basis, the decline in those two years was more than 8%, a quite massive decline as consumers reacted to the shock of rapid price rises. In the June quarter 2014, household consumption of energy was the lowest since the September quarter 2007, over which time the population had increased by about 12.5%. It must be noted that the carbon price was only a small part of the sharp rise in electricity costs over the past five years. There was a range of other factors specific to the generation and distribution of electricity which forced prices higher. That said, the sharp price rises, whatever the cause, only reinforced the downward pressure on electricity demand. There are also some other factors that were likely to have dampened electricity demand. The global climate change debate no doubt has seen some consumers change their behaviour and consumption patterns for altruistic reasons and not just for financial concerns – people doing their bit to cut carbon emissions by using less electricity. It was a similar issue with household consumption of tobacco, where the impact of excise increases has seen demand for tobacco in the first half of 2014 fall to the lowest level ever recorded. Price signals are working as consumers turn away from smoking and spend their income on other things. Government policy helped drive the consumption of tobacco down 3.5% since the end of 2012, down 28% since 2000 and a quite remarkable 55% since 1980. As for electricity, other factors are no doubt driving that fall. The plain-packaging laws are discouraging young people from taking up smoking, and the deaths of 15,000 people a year from tobacco-related illness is also a factor behind the fall in demand as tobacco companies somewhat ironically lose their valuable customers as a direct result of the goods they are selling to them. The end point of the examples of the carbon price and tobacco excise is that price signals and well-crafted government policies work to bring about behavioural change. This means that the proposed Medicare co-payment will, without question, cut demand for GP services as people stay away from the doctor because of the higher cost. The government has noted that this is a main motivation for the co-payment. So, too, with higher university fees that result from university deregulation. Higher fees will inevitably lower demand for a university education, which has what should be obvious implications for the skills levels of the population in a decade or so. The politics over the price signals relating to the carbon price and tobacco excise yielded what most thinking people would conclude are desirable results. The economy, societal wellbeing and even government finances benefited from these changes. The doctor co-payment and higher university fees will no doubt help with the budget bottom line, at least in the short term, but the higher cost of these services will probably result in people being a little bit sicker, less skilled and a little more ignorant. • Stephen Koukoulas is a research fellow at Per Capita, a progressive thinktank"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2016/mar/04/fossil-fuel-divestment-new-york-state-pension-fund-hurricane-sandy-ftse","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-04T21:04:00Z","webTitle":"New York pension fund could have made billions by divesting from fossil fuels – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/04/fossil-fuel-divestment-new-york-state-pension-fund-hurricane-sandy-ftse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/04/fossil-fuel-divestment-new-york-state-pension-fund-hurricane-sandy-ftse","fields":{"headline":"New York pension fund could have made billions by divesting from fossil fuels – report","bodyText":"New York State’s pension fund would have an additional $5.3bn to give to its retired employees if it had divested from fossil fuel companies and put that money into clean energy, according to a new report. The analysis, compiled by research firm Corporate Knights, assessed the fund’s top 100 domestic and international equity holdings, and calculated how much it would have earned over the past three years if it had got rid of its investments in coal, oil and gas companies. The New York State Common Retirement Fund is the third largest pension fund in the country, behind California’s CalPERS and CalSTRS, with $184.5bn held in trust for retirement benefits. According to the report, released this week, a move away from fossil fuels would have made each of the fund’s 1.1 million members more than $4,500 richer, and helped the state cover nearly 12% of the costs following Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Toby Heaps, CEO and co-founder of Corporate Knights, said the numbers show that divestment makes prudent financial sense. “Divestment is good for reducing portfolio risk,” he said. “It’s also a powerful way of sending a message about the expectations investors have of companies and governments to be rational about accelerating the energy transition in a timely manner so that we avoid scenarios of climate chaos, which would make it difficult for anybody to earn returns.” Scientists and world leaders have agreed that to curb the effects of climate change and prevent environmental catastrophes like extreme floods and super droughts, the planet’s temperature cannot rise by 2C above pre-industrial levels. This means dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions, largely caused by the burning of fossil fuels to produce energy. Countries are recognizing the threat that excess carbon dioxide poses to the health of the planet. During the climate talks in Paris in December, nearly 200 nations committed to cutting carbon emissions, signaling a shift away from fossil fuels to a green energy economy. “Government policy, which we think will only strengthen, is beginning to capture the societal costs of burning fossil fuels, enhancing the competitive position of investments in energy efficiency and renewables,” said Stu Dalheim, vice president of shareholder advocacy for Calvert Investments, which invests in socially and environmentally responsible businesses. “The Paris Agreement sent a clear and important signal to the market that we are moving toward a low carbon energy system.” The report comes as New York State Senator Liz Krueger is pushing to pass a bill that would require the state’s pension fund to divest from fossil fuels. The Fossil Fuel Divestment Act would require the fund to sell off its stocks in the top 200 largest fossil fuel companies by 2020. “By divesting from fossil fuels, the [Common Retirement Fund] will send a message that it is unacceptable for any institution to profit from activities that threaten the future of society, and will begin the process of delegitimizing a business model that, while financially profitable in the short run, is socially and morally bankrupt,” wrote Krueger in her announcement of the bill. The pension fund administrator, the state comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, declined to comment on the report. But he referred to a letter he sent to Krueger last December that outlined long term plans to put several billion dollars into industries with lower carbon footprint. He said a review of the pension fund’s investments since 2010 showed that it had gained $1.8bn in oil and gas stocks and lost $261.6m in coal. “I have taken a comprehensive, reasoned, prudent and scalable approach to addressing the risks of climate change with new investment and engagement strategies,” DiNapoli wrote. The Corporate Knights report looked at how the fund would have performed if it had divested from fossil fuel companies starting in October 2012. Researchers removed the most carbon-heavy coal and fuel companies, ranked by Fossil Free Indexes, which lists the top 100 coal companies and the top 100 oil and gas companies by the potential greenhouse gas emissions emitted from their reserves. The analysis also excluded utilities that generate more than 30% of their electricity from coal, provided by South Pole Group. The report then replaced these investments with money in climate-friendly companies that earn more than 20% of their revenue from environmental markets and technologies. Verified by FTSE Environmental Markets Index or Bloomberg New Energy Finance, these companies include Dover, an industrial equipment maker, and Whole Foods Market. The report’s findings are in step with market trends. A record-breaking $329.3bn was invested in renewable energy worldwide last year, while falling oil and gas prices have delayed $380bn worth of investments in deepwater and other projects. “Clean energy indices have out-performed the market over the last year, three years, and five years,” said Brett Fleishman, senior analyst at 350.org, a climate policy advocacy group. “And clean energy indices have way out performed oil and gas indices over the last 12 months.” Investments in fossil fuel companies aren’t delivering significant returns because demand for crude, gas and coal is outpacing supply, which drives the price down. “The simple fact is that the world price of crude oil has crashed, natural gas prices are very low and coal prices have fallen,” said Severin Borenstein, economics professor at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. “Any investments in fossil fuels when that happens are going to lose money.” Borenstein said it’s difficult to predict whether fossil fuels will be a better or worse investment than alternative energy into the future. “In order to outperform the market with your investment picks, you have to know something the market doesn’t,” he said. “If everyone knew that fossil fuel companies were overvalued, the stock would have already dropped to reflect that.” If fossil fuel prices rebound, then the value of oil and gas will go up, at least in the short term, Fleishman said. But this doesn’t necessarily make fossil fuels a good long term investment. “Large pension systems and endowments are lumbering giants, who should not pretend they can swiftly out maneuver the market, meaning riding oil prices back to some ephemeral peak and selling their stocks before everyone else,” he said. But some experts say the demand for fossil fuels is likely to remain high, making them a sound financial bet. “The long term prospects for fossil fuels are extremely bright, simply because demand continues unabated,” said Frank Wolak, a professor of economics at Stanford University. “Unless you can reduce the demand for fossil fuels, it’s highly unlikely to be a poor investment into the future.” But demand could drop as countries work to achieve the ambitious emissions targets agreed on in Paris. Divestment campaigners say that it’s safer to invest capital in an industry that isn’t facing possible limits to its production. “While fossil fuel stocks may represent opportunities for in-and-out investors who believe they can make money by timing the market, for long-term strategies it is irrational to risk being stuck with a bag of stranded assets,” said Heaps. For investors looking to put their money in green industries, solar energy might not necessarily be the best option. Some solar company stocks, like SunEdison and SolarCity, haven’t performed well over the past 12 months. Heaps said investors need to broaden their view and look beyond solar power to the clean energy industry as a whole. Heaps said investors can use as guidance the FTSE Environmental Opportunities Index, which measures the performance of the 100 biggest such companies, across a range of industries. “There is a misconception that climate friendly investing starts and stops with pure play solar and windmill stocks,” he said. “There are hundreds of blue chip companies which earn more than 20% of their revenue by providing environmental or climate solutions.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/aug/10/2015-global-temperatures-right-in-line-with-climate-model-predictions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-12T10:00:21Z","webTitle":"2015 global temperatures are right in line with climate model predictions | John Abraham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/aug/10/2015-global-temperatures-right-in-line-with-climate-model-predictions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/aug/10/2015-global-temperatures-right-in-line-with-climate-model-predictions","fields":{"headline":"2015 global temperatures are right in line with climate model predictions","bodyText":"In an earlier post, I wrote about some research that compared ocean temperature measurements to climate model predictions. It turns out, the models have done a great job estimating the increase in ocean heat although they have slightly under-predicted the change. What about other components of the Earth’s climate? For instance, how have the models done at predicting the changes in air temperatures? With recent data now available, we can make an assessment. I communicated with NASA GISS director Dr. Gavin Schmidt, who provided the following data. The graph shows the latest computer model simulations (from the CMIP project), which were used as input to the IPCC, along with five different temperature datasets. The comparison to be made is of the heavy dashed line (annotated in the graph just below the solid black line) and the colored lines. The heavy dashed line is the average predicted temperature including updated influences from a decrease in solar energy, human emitted heat-reflecting particles, and volcanic effects. The dashed line is slightly above the colored markers in recent years, but the results are quite close. Furthermore, this year’s temperature to date is running hotter than 2014. To date, 2015 is almost exactly at the predicted mean value from the models. Importantly, the measured temperatures are well within the spread of the model predictions. If we next consider earlier predictions using the prior generation of climate models, we see results below. Again, we see that in recent years, temperatures are slightly below the average of the models, but well within the uncertainty range. Furthermore, if we were to add the current 2015 temperatures, it would be very nearly at the model mean. So we see the models are doing a pretty good job. Certainly, they are good enough for us to project out into the future. I think of models as a crystal ball. We use them to see the future, albeit as a cloudy picture. While we cannot expect models to be perfect, they are good enough to help inform our decisions today. A very good update on models is published in the US CLIVAR summer letter, available here. Gavin Schmidt’s article is pages 25-29. The lead author, Kate Marvel and colleagues investigated various reasons behind changes to the rate of surface temperature increases since 1998. They look at biases in observations, errors in model forcing, uncertainties in trends due to the short time period and they also recommend steps to move forward by focusing on seasonal or regional aspects of climate change. It is a freely available report and a short clear read. Kate’s article doesn’t try to show that computer model predictions are necessarily compatible with observations. Their main point is to show that “compatible” is ill-defined and that differences between models and observations can arise from many different sources, none of which we can differentiate by looking at short-term global mean trends."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2017/jul/15/50-best-vegetarian-vegan-ethical-beauty-products-sali-hughes","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-15T07:00:00Z","webTitle":"Sali Hughes: the 50 best ethical beauty buys","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/jul/15/50-best-vegetarian-vegan-ethical-beauty-products-sali-hughes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2017/jul/15/50-best-vegetarian-vegan-ethical-beauty-products-sali-hughes","fields":{"headline":"Sali Hughes: the 50 best ethical beauty buys","bodyText":"A few months ago, I decided to write a column on the best beauty products for vegans, and soon realised that one column wasn’t going to cut it: I probably had enough for 30. The cruelty-free (no animal testing), vegetarian (no byproducts of animal slaughter) and vegan (no animal ingredients at all) beauty market has exploded in recent years. Previously, vegans were barely catered for, with some uninspiringly packaged cold-pressed face oil and lavender everything. In much the same way as vegetarians are always presumed to want mushroom risotto, vegans were expected to want to smell like an airing cupboard pomander. But nowadays even the large beauty companies are releasing exceptionally good vegetarian and vegan products. This is driven not only by a surge in young people becoming vegan (some 542,000 British people aged 15 or over now describe themselves as such, up from 150,000 in 2006), but by everyday consumers who broadly agree that the harming of animals in the pursuit of beauty is pretty indefensible. Which isn’t to say the situation is simple. Any beauty product bought in the UK is by definition cruelty-free: animal testing for cosmetic use in the EU has been banned since 2013; and it’s illegal to sell cosmetic products within the EU that have been, or that contain ingredients, newly tested on animals (clearly some everyday ingredients were tested on animals aeons ago, and one can’t change that now). The issue of cruelty-free becomes more complicated when brands enter foreign markets. Animal testing remains legal in the US and Australia, although most major brands there have long since chosen not to do it. The bigger concern, though, is China, where animal testing is required by law for all cosmetics sold on its soil. Nothing on the list on the following pages sells in China, which is why they can truly be called “cruelty-free”. Thankfully, transparency of policy and ingredients is improving (although the misinformation and inconsistency is alarming), and after a number of backlashes against leading brands, multinational corporations are learning the hard way that consumers, whether vegan, vegetarian or not, broadly expect cruelty-free and vegan products to remain that way, however keen shareholders are to expand into China. Overleaf is my final selection, though I was so spoilt for choice that I could easily have doubled it without compromise. In the end, my picks were chosen to reflect what a diverse and exciting market this has become, from luxury vegan foundations to a 100% vegan high street chemist skincare line. It is entirely possible to maintain your principles without sacrificing either luxury or performance. Top vegetarian picks Liz Earle Hand Repair, £10.50 With the exception of beeswax, propolis and manuka honey, none of the ingredients in this range are animal-derived, making it suitable for vegetarians. I have singled out this brilliant hand cream because it is one of the few to moisturise thoroughly, while leaving an ungreasy, matte finish. I can open the bathroom door without sliding off the handle. Marks &amp; Spencer Formula Absolute ultimate sleep cream, £22 Every product in M&amp;S’s own-brand beauty range is suitable for vegetarians, and much of it is vegan-friendly, too; but nothing boasts as devoted a following as this clinically proven, independently tested night cream for all skin types. M&amp;S can barely keep it in stock. It is a rich but ungreasy night-time moisturiser, to be massaged in post-cleanse, following serum, to comfort skin and give it a well-rested look. Body Shop camomile gentle eye makeup remover, £3 This happens to be vegan, but every product in the Body Shop range is at least vegetarian-friendly, which is especially impressive when you consider there are several thousand of them. This is my favourite. It removes heavy eye makeup with neither effort nor grease; it lifts stains from clothes, carpets and upholstery; it even lifts grease from the hairline, allowing blow-dries to limp through an extra day. Magic. Mandara Spa Bali Santi indulgent bath and shower cream, £7 I love everything about this brand, which makes affordable luxury bath, shower and body products containing no animal ingredients except beeswax, honey and milk. It also boycotts parabens, mineral oils and skin-drying, environmentally dubious sulphates, all without sacrificing the bubbles and scents I crave. This shower gel is refreshing, floral and coconutty and leaves skin soft, clean and smelling of summer. RMS Beauty Magic Luminizer, £30 RMS (named after its founder, makeup artist Rose Marie Swift) is little known outside beauty-nerd circles, but those who love it really, really love it. It is too expensive, but its champagne-hued, balmy illuminator is the best if, like me, you favour subtle gleam over disco-ball spangle. Use fingertips to work into cheekbones, between the eyes and on the brow bones when all else has been applied. Every product in this small range is vegetarian, with five suitable for vegans, too. Marks &amp; Spencer Rosie for Autograph Lipshine, £14 This Cruelty Free International-approved tint (in a solid choice of rose-based shades) makes the perfect starter lipstick for those who fear bold colour. It is moist, sheer and shiny, but neither sticky nor too muted. It goes on easily, regardless of skill level or access to a mirror: I neatly applied the Blood Roses colour by gazing briefly into a knife. Childs Farm organic raspberry bubble bath, £3.99 With the exception of its hair conditioner and detangler (which contain honey) and its sunscreen (beeswax), Childs Farm is vegan-friendly. These are gentle products that I routinely give as presents to parents worried about their children’s skin. Time after time, they tell me these are the only lotions, creams and shampoos their kids with eczema or psoriasis can tolerate. The natural smells make them seem fun, not medicinal. Tata Harper purifying cleanser, £55 There is a lot to love in this 100% vegetarian natural skincare line (much of which is also vegan). I have chosen the cleanser because I’m amazed at how much I love it. Facial washes, often moisture-stripping and insufficiently cleansing, are high on my beauty hitlist, but this one can stay. Its soft, creamy formula grips dirt and comforts skin, while fruit enzymes leave my face feeling perkier. Living Sea Therapy bath soak, £22 If, like me, you are a sucker for a long, luxurious soak, but feel disappointed by how many posher bath products are bubble-free, try this. It contains sustainably harvested, top-quality Cornish sea salt and seaweed, plus environmentally friendly, detergent-free foaming agents that fill the bathroom with the most beautiful, natural orange scent. Everything from this lovely brand is vegetarian-friendly, but this in particular leaves my head clear and my skin soft. Ilia Multi-stick, £30 Canadian organic makeup line Ilia was born out of founder Sasha Plavsic’s annoyance at the common belief that organic means less effective. Organic ingredients are used wherever possible, a dozen of its small range of products are vegan-friendly and the entire range is suitable for vegetarians. Just dab on cheeks as though marking a bingo card, then tap and rub to blend into a healthy flush. At Last is the perfect white-girl rose, while Cheek To Cheek looks glorious on dark tones (and has clear, vibrant pigment to avoid dullness and ashiness). Drunk Elephant C-Firma day serum, £70 It seems as though every US beauty nerd is raving about Drunk Elephant; if this serum is anything to go by, they have a point. It is an antioxidant, anti-ageing serum that contains vitamin C (ascorbic acid), ferulic and hyaluronic acids and heaps of gentle oils from the likes of grape and pumpkin. It has a pleasant, moist, slippery formula – I’m able to pop it straight under sunblock, skipping moisturiser altogether – and it doesn’t leave behind any grease. It has made my skin brighter and smoother and I have already bought a top-up. Best-practice brands Soap Co black poppy and wild fig hand wash, £12 (£11 for refills) This non-profit British brand employs a workforce that is 80% blind or disabled to produce a truly superior range of soaps and washes, packaged beautifully (including braille) and priced fairly. Staff are trained to increase their skill set and confidence, with a view to moving into the wider workplace, while those with more limited opportunities are given the security of long-term employment. This project is so much more than soap, but the products are exceptional. My Trusty sunflower face and body oil, £7.99 Few people realise that the NHS has its own skincare range, never mind that it is available nationwide. My Trusty is a sunflower oil-based line developed by NHS scientists who were dissatisfied with the available skincare products for dry, dehydrated and scarred skin. All the products are clinically proven to help reduce the appearance of scars. Users also report significant benefits for dry, itchy and oily skin, and for those with acne, eczema, psoriasis and rosacea. I have chosen this face and body oil on the basis that it gives a good, smooth, ungreasy finish and plenty of skin-softening moisture, causes no irritation and (as with the entire line) contains no sulphates, parabens or artificial perfumes. It is also cracking value, with all the profit going back into the NHS. Soaper Duper vanilla shea body wash, £6.50 The most interesting advances in beauty are happening in the high street and budget sector, not on the high-end department store counters. These delicious-smelling washes, lotions and creams contain no microbeads, phthalates, mineral oils, sulphates or parabens, just gentle, plant-derived foaming agents and nut butters, all packaged in satisfyingly chubby pump bottles recycled from plastic milk cartons. The brand has pledged to give at least £150,000 to Water Aid by the end of next year. I use its hand washes almost exclusively, but this body wash, squirted with abandon into a bath, is my Sunday-night treat. Clean Reserve citron fig, £79 An eco-positive perfumer? I never thought I would see the day. But Clean Reserve is obsessed with making sustainable, animal-friendly fragrances that people want to wear. The attention to detail is extraordinary. The alcohol is derived from corn and carried in an aloe vera base to avoid drying or irritating the skin; all the fragrances come in recycled and recyclable packaging; and the manufacturing process is powered by solar energy. None of this is to the detriment of the perfumes. Citron fig is my favourite: bright and summery. As the day wears on, expect a warming ginger note, spicy cardamom (which stops it from being too daytime) and a cheerful spike of mint. Lovely. Lush Ultrabland cleanser, £7.95 Lush does much more than boycott animal testing; it has been campaigning against it for decades. The company sources all of its (vegetarian-friendly) ingredients ethically, paying suppliers fairly for their environmentally sound ingredients (which are never tested on animals) and ensuring employees throughout the supply chain are working willingly and for fair pay. Its list of ethical, environmental and animal considerations is near-endless, so I will save space by saying this instead: Ultrabland is the best affordable cleanser on the high street. It removes all makeup quickly and gently (although you may need a separate eye makeup remover for heavy shadow and waterproof mascara). Massage in nightly and remove with a clean, hot facecloth. Your skin will look better in a month, if not sooner. The vegan selection Mavala Mini Nail Colour, £4.95 I had always loved these dinky nail polishes – then I discovered that they have been vegan for more than five decades. The appeal of Mavala lies in its understanding that while you might wish to own thousands of different shades of nail polish, you are unlikely to finish a big bottle of any of them. These tiny polishes come in every shade and finish, have a good brush and decent longevity, and contain exactly the right amount to leave me wanting more. Klorane extra-gentle dry shampoo with oat milk, £8 For years, this dry shampoo has featured in every stylist’s kitbag. They love it, because it gives great volume without causing scalps to itch, it doesn’t take excessive rubbing to work off the chalkiness and it smells natural and clean, rather than sweet and synthetic. The rest of the Klorane family, from a fragrant pomegranate shampoo to an excellent eye makeup remover, is vegan, too. Le Labo Santal 33, £120 Le Labo is vegan across its large range of high-quality perfumes, lotions and candles, but whenever I visit the counter I rarely get past this beautiful, gender-neutral scent that smells of creamy sandalwood, powdery flowers and new leather shoes. If you happen to pass a tester, do give it a chance: the immediate hit is no match for what it becomes an hour or so later. IT Cosmetics Your Skin But Better CC+ SPF 50+ cream, £30 Finally, a tinted moisturiser with as much coverage as a foundation and as high an SPF as a sunblock. This hero product from the vegan brand has been raved about by practically every beauty editor and blogger this season – and with good reason. The exceptional base blends well, stays put and neither dries out nor oils up the skin. Even the dated packaging adds to its charm. It is with great relief that I hear new owner L’Oréal intends to keep IT’s ethical standards high. Barry M Dazzle Dust, £4.59 It is gratifying to discover that one of Britain’s most iconic bargain brands has among the most transparent animal-welfare policies and simplest labelling systems. I wish luxury houses would deign to watch and learn. The 80% of Barry M products that are vegan are marked with a green badge, while the rest (vegetarian, but containing beeswax) are not. The company demands yearly written declarations from suppliers and works on animal welfare initiatives. It also makes the best budget glitter in the business and flogs it for less than a fiver. The endlessly cheering Dazzle Dust comes in an array of colours that change seasonally – I love Petrol Black, smudged over eyeliner (and covering any wobbles in the process). Zelens Daily Defence sunscreen SPF 30, £55 It may be seriously spendy, but this tube replaces two products. An elegant moisturiser and effective sunscreen in one, it goes straight over serum without greasiness, peeling or stinging, and provides an excellent base for foundation. One of my all-time favourite sunscreens, it is vegan and contains no parabens, should you happen to be concerned about them (broadly speaking, I’m not). Urban Decay 24/7 eye pencil, £15.50 When L’Oréal acquired Urban Decay and attempted to take it into the Chinese market, where animal testing is a legal requirement, there was such uproar that the brand swiftly changed its mind. Animal welfare was a founding principle of this excellent brand. Click on any product on the Urban Decay website and you will see immediately whether it is vegan; gratifyingly, 32 of the 41 shades of these eye pencils (which are the smoothest, boldest, coolest and longest-lasting) are. More and more products are undergoing conversion. Aesop post-poo drops, £20 There were so many worthy options from this all-vegan (with the exception of natural-bristled shaving brushes) Australian brand that I went for novelty and originality. Post-poo drops serve exactly the purpose one would imagine and they work brilliantly. Simply squeeze a couple of drops of this essential-oil blend into the toilet basin to deodorise the room and make it smell of orange zest. The stylish and weirdly covetable glass bottle raises so many eyebrows and smiles that I routinely bring one for dinner hosts instead of wine. Invariably, they love it and vow to replenish when empty (which takes months). Nailberry L’Oxygéné nail polish, from £14.50 One of the coolest, most coveted luxury brands in nailcare is also vegan-friendly. Each of the 48 shades in Nailberry’s Peta‑certified L’Oxygéné range is long-wearing, halal-certified and free from alcohol, parabens, DBP, toluene, camphor, formaldehyde, xylene, ethyl tosylamide, triphenyl phosphate, animal derivatives and gluten. Highlights are Rouge, a perfect specimen of classic Hollywood red, and Viva La Vegan, a sludgy summer khaki that looks wonderful against denim and sandals. There are no duds here. Vita Liberata Body Blur Instant HD, £29.49 Without question the most-used body makeup in my kit, this adds realistic colour, camouflages veins, scars, signs of poor circulation and blotches, and creates the impression of smoother, silkier skin. It is not cheap, but a little goes a long way (and all but one of Vita Liberata’s products – the night moisture mask – are vegan-friendly). Indispensable for anyone keen to show some skin. Real Techniques brushes, from £7.99 Vegan brushes must be made from synthetic, rather than natural, bristles. The affordable synthetics of yore, while fine for creams and lotions, were useless for powdered makeup. The game changed with this range of relatively inexpensive synthetics, which have a soft, plush texture and a lightness of touch, and are accompanied by a series of YouTube tutorials. I love the setting brush for under eyes and I’m rarely without the eye shade and blend duo, but others seem devoted to the Expert Face Brush. Cover FX illuminating setting spray, £22 It was hard to pick a favourite product from this brand’s entirely vegan line of hi-tech, racially inclusive complexion makeup (I like brands that pick a speciality and stick with it). However, since I have been using this since Christmas, it seemed only fair that it made the cut. It is a refreshing mist that locks down makeup (face or body) for the night, layering up for greater glow. It works brilliantly, looks great and, like everything from Cover FX, contains no parabens, fragrance, gluten, mineral oil or talc. The Ordinary Vitamin C suspension 23% + HA spheres 2%, £4.90 What would happen if you took away all the unnecessary skincare ingredients, leaving only those in proper concentrations that were proven to deliver results? And what if you scaled down packaging, making product names transparent and everything vegan-friendly? This was Brandon Truaxe’s thinking when he developed The Ordinary, an affordable skincare brand that has caused the biggest stir in beauty in at least 20 years. There are many commendable products, but I have chosen this anti-ageing serum, since it has a higher concentration of antioxidant vitamin C than many rivals costing five, 10 or even 20 times the price. Kat Von D Tattoo Liner, £16 Vegan tattoo artist Kat Von D reportedly intends to transition her cruelty-free beauty line to vegan-friendly status by the end of the year. If you are impatient, though, this liner, adored for its durable wear and fine, sharp-tipped brush, is already good to go. The best vegan-friendly liner I have tried, it goes on opaquely and effortlessly, although I don’t support its claim to be waterproof. Hourglass ambient lighting powder, £40 This range is mostly vegetarian-friendly, while plenty of it – including this, the best product – is vegan. There is at least one shade for everyone: I dust Diffused Light, a red-reducing, skin-brightening yellow, all over my face (either over foundation or just concealer), and Radiant Light, a soft brown, on the cheeks, temples and wherever the sun would hit. Sleek Blush, £4.99 Sleek is a cruelty-free brand that has pledged not to sell in China until the country changes its laws on animal testing. This is China’s loss, because Sleek’s makeup is among the best ever sold on the high street. Its forte is eyeshadow (peerless colour payoff in its price bracket) and blusher, the latter being vegan. The shade choice is good, but Rose Gold is particularly flattering on everyone and is the spit of Nars’s Orgasm. St Tropez gradual tan tinted lotion, £15 I don’t know why I was surprised to learn that Britain’s most popular tanning brand is vegan, but then I’m someone on whom self-tan usually disappears without a trace. This gradual tanning lotion is a notable exception. It gives good moisture, an instant bronze tint and a deeper, but still realistic, tan in just a couple of applications. My advice is to spend extra cash on the brand’s mitt: you get a much smoother, more even application and no orange palms. e.l.f. B Bare total face makeup palette, £9 I have been waiting years for this excellent, all-vegan, bargain brand to launch in the UK, having feverishly stocked up whenever in the US. All the palettes are great and the primers are a dead ringer for premium brands; but this palette for pale skin – containing bronzer, highlighter and two cheek colours – is cleverly curated and more restrained than comparable products on the high street. Pixi Glow Tonic, £18 About 50 products in Pixi’s relatively small makeup and skincare line are vegan, including Caroline Hirons’ excellent Double Cleanse and this, its best bargain (the bottle is around two and a half times bigger than most). It is a liquid exfoliant (ie the only kind of skin toner worth a damn), containing alpha hydroxy acid to deflake and brighten dull skin and soften the appearance of fine lines. After a proper cleanse, saturate a cotton pad with Glow Tonic and sweep all over the face. Sam Farmer teen skincare, from £4.49 As a father of teenagers, Sam Farmer was horrified at the sexualised branding, gender stereotyping and cynical marketing of toiletries aimed at young people. Instead of writing a furious letter, he retrained as a cosmetic scientist and made his own range. My sons and all my friends’ teens love this range for its fair prices, cool, minimal packaging and fresh, unobtrusive fragrances. Every product in the lineup is free of animal ingredients, which, given that almost half of vegans are aged 15 to 34, seems commercially smart as well as ethical. Illamasqua Radiance Veil, £34 Illamasqua is one of the largest cruelty-free brands, but fans may not realise that more than 90 of its products are vegan, too. It was hard to pick a favourite – Beyond Powder, one of the best highlighters I have used, came close – but in the end I plumped for this glow-giving primer, which, as well as providing a smooth, long-lasting base for foundation, looks wonderful when worn with a little concealer and powder. It is perfect for dull or sallow complexions. Niod copper amino isolate serum 1%, £38 My colleagues rave about vegan brand Niod, but I have had limited success with many of its skincare products. The exception is this, which works a treat. The unorthodox idea is not to tackle symptoms of skin ageing directly, but rather to keep skin in a heightened state of self-repair. You mix together the serum and “activator”, then apply straight after cleansing. I have found it particularly effective on visible pores around the nose and chin, on uneven texture and in brightening dullness, but others report all manner of skin-improving capabilities. There is now a more concentrated (5%) version, but it costs a small fortune; you will probably find this one sufficient. Collection Lasting Perfection concealer, £4.19 Another high street brand that hides nothing from its consumers. The website lists every product it makes and explains clearly which are vegan, which are vegetarian and which are cruelty‑free. This, its best, is vegan-friendly (and racially inclusive). Just dab the liquid directly from the wand on to dark circles and blemishes, then tap with your middle finger to blend. You will find it behaves much like luxury concealers at five times the price. Vintner’s Daughter active botanical serum, £175 I was determined to hate this face oil. It is exorbitantly priced and its marketing is based on the kind of “no chemicals, no toxins” message that I find enraging. But, oh, it is so lovely on the skin (even spotty types). Just one six-drop application of this 22-oil, vegan-friendly blend before bed (after any anti-ageing serums and before or instead of cream) revives and moisturises the complexion and imparts visible glow by morning. It is beautiful, if way too expensive. Axiology vegan lipstick, £24 Vegan lipstick is hard to find, because ingredients such as beeswax, lanolin, cholesterol and collagen are so often used to add comfort, slip, moisture and plumpness.Here, though, is a wonderful example of how it can be done. The formula is silky, comfy and long-lasting. The shades (I recommend Worth, a vintage-looking red) are every bit as cool and bold as those of the department store luxury brands. The packaging makes it a beautiful gift, too. Starskin After Party brightening bio-cellulose second-skin face mask, £8.50 There is something hugely satisfying about a one-hit sheet mask. This one, from the mostly-vegan Starskin portfolio, is among my favourites. There is no scrimping on ingredients here: the mask positively drenches the face in reviving serum, which leaves skin brighter, perkier and healthier-looking (in fact, you will probably have enough gunk left in the sachet for tomorrow). Wonderful as a hangover cure or an in-flight treatment. Infuse My. colour wash, £13.95 I’m hugely impressed with these colour-refreshing shampoos. Simply, they work. Copper brightens red hair beautifully, while Platinum strips brassiness from blond and grey hair and brightens any white and silver; the Gold shade glosses my hair like nothing else. All five options are vegan and none contains sulphates, silicones, parabens or toxic dyes. Superdrug B. Pure micellar water, £4.99 I give huge props to Superdrug for making its entire B. skincare and makeup line vegan-friendly, particularly this makeup remover, which is one of the few of its kind not to make me break out after several days’ continued use. It swipes away heavy foundation and mascara in seconds, making it an ideal first step before a deeper cleanse with a balm or oil (there is no substitute, long-term). It is also brilliant for quick makeup changes, correcting smudges and errors and, dare I say it, when you are too tired and emotional for a thorough night-time routine. Keep next to your bed with the Alka-Seltzer. Too Faced Brow Quickie, £17 I was put off slightly by this cruelty-free brand’s teenybopper packaging, but with perseverance I have found some corking products. Everyone raves about the superior lengthening capabilities of Better Than Sex mascara, but my personal favourite is Brow Quickie, a fibre-filled brow gel in a perfect, suits-everyone taupe that thickens and holds brows in place better than anything else I have tried. It is only one of the 50 or so vegan products in the Too Faced portfolio. Kypris Moonlight Catalyst, £60.50 My issue with many of the natural, organic skincare brands I see is that, while they are often lovely in terms of smell and texture, they don’t seem to do much for their high price tag. Kypris is an exception. Vegan, organic, sustainably and locally sourced, devoid of any petrol-industry byproducts and synthetic ingredients, its kinder beauty credentials are flawless. The products themselves are just as impressive. This, my favourite, is a night-time serum that uses pumpkin enzymes to gobble away dead skin and calm irritation. It gives great glow and leaves skin exceptionally soft and smooth. It is also very good on spotty or upset-looking skin. It is expensive, yes, but comes in a larger bottle than most in its category. Pai Copaiba deep cleanse AHA mask, £30 There is an assumption in beauty that spotty skin must be hardy enough to withstand chemical torture in the name of treatment, but this is simply not true. Pai skincare (certified by the Soil Association and the Vegan Society) is unusual in its understanding that oily, congested skin can be as sensitive and easily upset as any other type. This mask is a great example of how it is possible to get kind and hardcore in one tube. Smooth all over just-cleansed skin (I take it right under the eyes, but not over the eyelids), leave for 10 minutes, then buff off with a hot facecloth. The Ordinary Serum Foundation, £5.70 Another entry for this new but influential, eco-friendly, vegan brand. It is the best budget foundation I have ever used. Yes, there is a six-week waiting list and, yes, there are few bricks-and-mortar stores allowing you to try before you buy, but, at a little over a fiver, how much can one complain? Besides, distribution and stock problems are likely to vanish soon: Estée Lauder has just invested in The Ordinary’s parent company, Deciem. Tarte Maracuja creaseless concealer, £21 There are lots of vegan products within this natural-ingredient-based, animal-friendly brand and I was delighted to find this old favourite among them. It is a waterproof, racially inclusive coverup that is brilliant for hiding birth marks, dark circles, melasma and scars, and any blemishes on menopausal skin prone to hot flashes. It blends well with fingers or a buffing brush and is so concentrated the little tube lasts for ages. Rahua shampoo and conditioner, £30 each On paper, Rahua looks like the kind of brand I avoid. It is expensive and comes with a too-familiar marketing message: beauty professionals get out of the rat race and discover charity work, which takes them to the Brazilian rainforest, where they notice that women have exceptionally soft, glossy hair and discover a native wonder oil, rahua. I have heard 100 variations on this theme, but two things set Rahua apart: activism and product efficacy. Everything is vegan and sustainable, and the brand has reinvigorated the local trade of rahua oil. Every organic, natural and petrochemical-, silicone- and sulphate-free product is lovely, but the original shampoo and conditioner are the holy grail for dry, thick, previously unmanageable hair."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2016/oct/09/call-me-a-racist-but-dont-say-im-a-buddhist-meet-the-alt-right","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-10-09T08:05:06Z","webTitle":"‘Call me a racist, but don’t say I’m a Buddhist’: America's alt right","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/09/call-me-a-racist-but-dont-say-im-a-buddhist-meet-the-alt-right","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/oct/09/call-me-a-racist-but-dont-say-im-a-buddhist-meet-the-alt-right","fields":{"headline":"‘Call me a racist, but don’t say I’m a Buddhist’: meet America's alt right","bodyText":"Every few weeks, William Johnson, the chairman of the white nationalist American Freedom Party (AFP), holds a lunch for members, the goal being to make America a white ethnostate, a project that begins with electing Donald Trump. This week, it’s at a grand old French restaurant called Taix, in Echo Park, Los Angeles – an odd choice on the face of it. Echo Park is a trendy hood. It’s hipster and heavily Hispanic. In fact, given the predominance of Latino kitchen staff in this city, it may be wise to hold off on the Trump talk until the food arrives. “About three months ago,” Johnson begins, “I was talking to Richard Spencer about how we need to plan for a Trump victory.” Spencer is another prominent white nationalist – he heads the generic-sounding National Policy Institute. “I said: ‘I want Jared Taylor [of American Renaissance] as UN Ambassador, and Kevin MacDonald [an evolutionary psychologist] as secretary of health and Ann Coulter as homeland security!’ And Spencer said: ‘Oh Johnson, that’s a pipe dream!’ But today, he’d no longer say that, because if Trump wins, all the establishment Republicans, they’re gone… They hate him! So who’s left? If we can lobby, we can put our people in there.” Around the table five young men, roughly half Johnson’s age (he’s 61), nod and lean in. They all wear suits and ties, address the waiter as “sir” and identify as the “alt right”, the much-discussed nouvelle vague of racism. “Are you guys familiar with the Plum Book?” Johnson asks. “It’s plum because of the colour, but also because of the plum positions – there are 20,000 jobs in that book that are open to a new administration.” “So we need to identify our top people!” says Eric, one of the men at the table. “Just anyone with a college degree!” Johnson says. “Right.” Eric is practically bouncing in his seat with excitement. “We need to get the word out. We are the new GOP!” It’s not every day that a brown journalist gets to sit in on a white-nationalist strategy meeting. But these are strange times. Racism is trending. Like Brexit, Trump has normalised views that were once beyond the pale, and groups like the AFP have grown bold. Their man’s stubby orange fingers are within reach of actual power, so maybe it’s time to emerge from the shadows at last. I first met Johnson in May after he signed up as a Trump delegate before being swiftly struck off by the campaign when the press found out. He’s a surprising figure. An avid environmentalist, fluent in Japanese and, in person, not the bitter old racist I’d expected but rather a jolly Mormon grandfather, bright eyed and chuckling, a Wind in the Willows character. Eric is even more unexpected. Tall and impassioned, he came to racism via hypnotherapy, of all things. He sells solar panels for a living and practises yoga. Together with his friends Matt and Nathan, who are also here at lunch, he runs an alt-right fraternity in Manhattan Beach – “a beer and barbecues thing”. They’re called the Beach Goys. “We’re starting a parody band,” he beams. “We’ve found a drummer!” Between them they represent two poles of a racist spectrum, young and old. And judging from this lunch, it’s the millennials who are the more extreme. Johnson wants white nationalists to appear less mean and he finds the “JQ”, the Jewish Question, archaic. But Eric loves the meanness of the alt right. “We’re the troll army!” he says. “We’re here to win. We’re savage!” And antisemitism is non-negotiable. In fact, he’d like to clear up a misnomer about the alt right, propagated by the Breitbart columnist Milo Yiannopoulos, who is often described, mistakenly, as the movement’s leader. Milo casts the alt right as principally a trolling enterprise, dedicated to attacking liberal shibboleths for the “lulz”– there’s precious little actual bigotry. But Eric insists otherwise. Yes, they like to joke, they have memes, they’re just as funny as liberals – have I heard of their satirical news podcasts, the Daily Shoah and Fash the Nation? But make no mistake, the racism is real. Eric especially enjoys The Daily Stormer, a leading alt-right news site, which is unashamedly pro-Hitler. What unites Johnson and Eric is what they describe as “the systematic browbeating of the white male” – namely all this talk of privilege, the Confederate flag, Black Lives Matter and mansplaining. But beyond that, it’s the “looming extinction of the white race”. This is the language they use. Also: “Diversity equals white genocide.” The alt right loves to evoke genocide while harbouring Holocaust deniers. Their point is that white people are melting away like the icecaps, and they have a primal drive to stop it. In 2044, non-Hispanic whites will drop below 50% of the US population. “The generation of the white minority has already been born,” Eric says. “Look at South Africa and Rhodesia. That’s where we’re headed. Total disenfranchisement.” I want to reassure him that his Brown Rulers will be gentle and that slavery isn’t so bad when you get used to it. But it’s not me they want to hear from, it’s white people. This is the white nationalist’s burden – the very people they’re trying to save are the ones who most fiercely oppose them. “The only group I cannot get along with is white people,” says Johnson. “Because white people hate white people who like white people.” A couple of days later, Johnson is at his cluttered desk in downtown LA, nattering merrily in Japanese to a woman in Tokyo. He gets lots of media requests these days, but especially from Japan. There’s an uncanny connection between Japan and white nationalism in America. Jared Taylor, white nationalism’s foremost intellectual, is another fluent speaker. “It’s an ethnostate and it’s deeply nationalist,” he says. “And they have resisted the pressure to admit refugees. I say: ‘God bless them!’” For his part, Johnson’s racism was shaped in Japan. He grew up in Eugene, Oregon, a state founded as a white utopia, in a modest Mormon home, back before the LDS church gave black people the priesthood in 1978. But it was his two-year mission to Tohoku, Japan, that turned him. As he went from door to door, locals would opine on the greatness of white America. “They had an inferiority complex after the war, so we were treated like celebrities,” he says. “Oh, it was just the funnest time!” A few years later, while working in Japan as an attorney, he wrote a book advocating the repatriation of all non-whites with appropriate reparations, because “I thought America was going to collapse unless I did something.” When he returned to LA, he sent a copy to every congressman. He was 32. Clearly things didn’t work out as planned. His forays into politics floundered and then his offices were bombed. So he retreated from activism for nearly 15 years, only returning in 2009 to form the AFP – just in time for the rise of the alt right. We head to his 67-acre ranch near Pasadena, a hilly lot backing on to a national forest. I asked to meet his family, but his wife refused, so we tour the farm instead – his persimmon orchard, his horses and ducks. And there on his pick-up truck is a stencil of Jimi Hendrix. “My daughter likes to paint,” he says proudly. None of his five children are white nationalists, though they have promised to marry within the race. “You’re a white supremacist with a black artist painted on your truck,” I tell him. And he flinches. “That’s the meanest, most hurtful swearword there is. Just because I say different races have different strengths doesn’t mean I think I’m superior.” He doesn’t like “racist” either. “It’s a pejorative. I prefer ‘race realist’.” “But it’s not my reality, Bill. I’m sticking with racist.” “Well, OK. But people who embrace ‘racist’ are mad at everybody. I get along with people. You cannot function in Los Angeles without encountering other races, so I look for areas of similarity and agreement. It’s important to treat everyone with the highest respect on a micro level.” On a macro level, however, darkness falls – multiculturalism is doomed, the different races will never get along, and our only hope is Balkanisation: separate territories for separate tribes. And whatever accelerates that transition is welcome, even racial strife. “I don’t think friction is a good thing,” he says, “but it would help facilitate the split that is necessary.” We stop to feed his alpacas. There’s a brown one, a black one and a white one, standing peacefully together against the chicken wire fence. “See Bill, they’re getting along.” He laughs. “I wish people were like alpacas.” I’m with Eric at a Mexican restaurant in Manhattan Beach where he lives, an upscale, white neighbourhood in the South Bay. He clears space on the table and grins. “OK, you ready? Your first tarot card reading with the Hitler Youth!” It’s been an odd afternoon. We walked along the beach and I asked about his gmail address which includes the number 1488, a potent number for white supremacists. The “14” stands for the 14 words coined by the late David Lane of the group The Order: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.” And the 88 refers to HH (H being eighth in the alphabet) – or Heil Hitler. Eric sighed. “OK, but this stuff’s hard to talk about,” he said. “It depends how red-pilled you are.” Alt-righters love talking about the red pill. It’s a reference to The Matrix – blue-pilled people bumble through a life of illusion, while the red-pilled have seen the truth and there’s no turning back. Like all conspiracy theorists they see the hidden hand that guides all things, but for the alt right that hand is Jewish. The red pill is classic antisemitism, rebooted for a younger generation. As we walked, he laid it out – the banking, the media, the globalism. We passed games of beach volleyball and family picnics, while he explained why the Holocaust was exaggerated and Hitler got a bad rap. “Have you noticed that kombucha isn’t as fizzy as it used to be?” he asks, along the way, because Eric isn’t your average Nazi. He trained as a spiritualist. He has taught meditation. He brought his tarot cards in case I wanted a reading. “Don’t tell me – it’s the Jews,” I tell him. He laughs. “You said it, not me!” In the late 70s, the Klansman David Duke swapped his hood and robes for a suit and tie, and took white supremacy out of the cross-burning fields and into the boardroom. Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center describes the alt right in similar terms, as Racism 2.0, “a rebranding for the digital generation”. It’s a trendy reboot – “alt right” makes white supremacy sound like an art collective. And Eric, the kombucha Nazi, just takes it a step further – into the aisles of Whole Foods. He’s a locally sourced, wild-caught bigot high in omega-3s and antisemitism. It makes him more sinister in some ways, and more harmless in others. As Nazis go. “Hmm, Nazi.” Like Johnson, he’s squeamish about terms. Warriors against political correctness can be awfully sensitive. “It’s such a slur,” he says. But come on – he’s a Hitler apologist. “OK, fine,” he says. “Just don’t say I’m a Buddhist, because I’m actually more into Norse and Celtic mysticism now.” It’ll come as no surprise that someone who’d rather be called a Nazi than a Buddhist has a strange story to tell. Originally from a well-off white suburb of Chicago, he moved to Las Vegas to pursue music. Then one day, in the gym of his condo building, he met a guru figure we’ll call Frank. A spiritualist and businessman, Frank introduced Eric to New Age mysticism and Japanese Buddhism. And it was under Frank’s guidance that Eric moved to LA to study hypnotherapy and began a career giving readings and tarot shows at a psychic bookshop. Frank, he says, was his “mentor and best friend”. But then Eric took a turn. He radicalised himself. He left the New Age life, finding it too feminine, and spiralled down a sinkhole of conspiracy theory. He and Frank have been estranged ever since. Frank is black. Today, Eric still meditates and practises yoga. His weeks are spent like David Brent, as a travelling salesman, driving around meeting his solar energy clients. His weekends, however, are all about the Beach Goys, which now has 15 members. Last week, they went on a hike to the Murphy Ranch in the Pacific Palisades, a decrepit old property that was originally built as a refuge for Hitler after the war. Next week is their first band rehearsal. Eric’s going to play guitar and sing. And this is the future he wants – not a plum job with the Trump administration. “I don’t see myself as a bureaucrat,” he says. “I want to take the Beach Goys national. I want to inspire people.” It could happen. Trump has unleashed something in America. Johnson won’t reveal the AFP’s membership numbers – “Maybe we want to appear bigger than we are?” – but Eric insists the alt right is on the march. “We’re growing with every hashtag, every BLM protest, every city that becomes a Detroit, or a London,” he says. “We’re everywhere! We’re the guy next to you at yoga, the barista at Starbucks...” It’s like Fight Club for supremacists, a deeply unsettling thought (which is why Eric loves it). But his delight in being a secret Nazi detracts from the seriousness of it all, the white genocide stuff. He’s having too much fun. And I wonder, as we finish our beers, if it will pass for Eric, this Nazi phase. He just doesn’t seem that threatening. Then he starts up about a race war, that old white-supremacist chestnut. Because behind the trolling veneer, the alt right is more traditional than alt. What Eric believes is vintage racism, the same old wine in a new ironic cask. And Tony Benn’s words ring as true as ever: “Every generation must fight the same battles again and again.” “Our civilisation is at war and we need to secure our people,” Eric says. “We must seize power and take control. And the idea that we can do this peacefully is probably not realistic.” We get along well enough, Eric and I, but he has the same micro/macro discrepancy as Johnson. And at a macro level, there is only despair and division. “I do not advocate violence, but I will give my life for my blood… and for the honour of my ancestors.” He thrums the tarot cards in his hands, his voice getting more animated. “We accept the game that’s being played. We accept that the lion and the gazelle are competition. But they don’t have to hate each other. That’s just how we view it.” He shrugs. “It’s scary. The world is scary. This is not a game for children.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2015/oct/27/inside-guardian-weekly-abby-deveney","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-27T16:38:47Z","webTitle":"Inside the 30 October edition","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/oct/27/inside-guardian-weekly-abby-deveney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2015/oct/27/inside-guardian-weekly-abby-deveney","fields":{"headline":"Inside the 30 October edition","bodyText":"Turkey is a pivotal sort of place. A bridge between continents and cultures. A western ally perched on the edges of war, and now a major transit point for those fleeing conflict and strife. As international events swirl, the political focus is also very much on domestic affairs: issues such as security, economy and human rights. So an election this coming weekend is not only crucial – for Turks and for the international community – it is equally fascinating. Our cover this week considers the many factors in play before the ballots are cast and counted. Internationally, it felt like an all-election weekend, as voters in Poland, Guatemala and Tanzania, among others, went to the polls. On our international news pages we capture some of the results, which we will fill out as more detailed analysis is written. Following up on a federal election in Canada, meanwhile, that saw Liberal Justin Trudeau elected prime minister, the Guardian’s executive editor of opinion, Jonathan Freedland, provides some interesting reflections on the nature of dynasties. We bring you a page of coverage on Libya, a failed state that’s been a departure point for many in Europe’s refugee crisis. Bringing stability is critical, and extremely difficult, as Guardian opinion writer Yasmina Khadra and our partner paper the Washington Post write. Meanwhile, on the shores of Greece, the race is on for the displaced as winter draws closer and the Mediterranean passages become more deadly. On the environment front, with a climate conference in Paris looming in late November, we give over two pages of coverage to solar energy in Morocco, the global “cold crunch” as cooling needs soar, and European greenhouse gas emissions. Not all of this is doom and gloom, I’m happy to say. Watch in the weeks ahead for beefed up environment coverage. Elsewhere, presidential contender Hillary Clinton shines in an upbeat October and the British prime minister David Cameron finds plans for tax credit cuts thwarted by the House of Lords. After Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s visit to Britain, we assess the economic value of the trip. We also take a look at the state of the Middle Kingdom’s economy after the People’s Bank of China lowered interest rates, yet again. The rise of technology is a theme throughout the edition. In our World roundup experts sound an alarm on stupid ‘AI’, on our UK pages a teenager is arrested in connection with a cyber-attack on UK telecom TalkTalk, and on the Comment pages Paul Mason warns of allowing tech giants to rule our emerging smart cities. The books pages rounds things off, reviewing a book that questions whether mobile technology is destroying our ability to communicate. Technology can’t be ignored. But can it be so readily, easily embraced? Something to consider. On our letters page, you shared views on trade, Middle East politics, North American divides and procrastination (something I can be rather good at!). Ready for a deeper read? Our Review opener takes aim at Silicon Valley in a super piece of writing about California’s boom (and possibly looming bust). We also take you to Iraq, Sweden and Uganda to look, variously, at the Green Zone, social tolerance and HIV therapies. Discovery delves into the brain, which is one of my favourite subjects. Food for thought. Is pride the road to ruin? I am sure many of you will want to consider this question, then chime in on our Notes &amp; Queries page. On a personal note, I’d like to send a thank you to June Walker, the reader profiled in this week’s Good to meet you, for her patience and her loyalty to the Weekly. Sport is not something I dwell on (unless it’s fencing, a family passion). But partner paper the Washington Post gives us a very nice read on the rise of American football in Brazil. Even if you aren’t fussed about F1, and you don’t rise to rugby, I think you’ll find this an interesting piece. As always, thank you for reading.

Change seems such a mild word for what’s going on. When we say that someone has “changed”, we usually mean that they’re drinking a bit more or less. We don’t mean that they’re lying stone dead under five miles of ocean on a rock that now hangs silently in the freezing vault of space. An initiative was announced for a network of 120 countries to form a solar power grid, but I don’t think Scotland qualified. I’m not sure how much solar energy we produce, all I know is it’s way less than it takes to light a sky. Clean energy is always described as expensive and inefficient, but I suppose that if the price of the alternatives is extinction, we might just be measuring expense and efficiency wrongly. The pope has said that Earth is nearing environmental “suicide”. Many leaders will question his right to speak on climate change – but to be fair, he’s the only one driving about in an electric van. Developing nations say that rich western countries aren’t doing enough to help them deal with the effects of climate change, but that’s not the case. We’re going to help them deal with drought by submerging them under the ocean. As the temperature increases some people say it will be like boiling a frog, but surely in that analogy the frog doesn’t know that the temperature is rising. Humanity is fully aware but possibly just too depressed to do anything. It’s more like boiling a recently divorced 45-year-old man. There could be a plus side to the ice caps melting. Think of the interesting things you find when you just defrost your freezer; we could discover the first ever entirely breadcrumbed mammoth. Pointing out that the Earth is our one home doesn’t seem to help. After all, a lot of us have got a room in our house that we gradually fill up with crap and can’t bear to go into. I suppose that’s just the developing world. There’s going to be a big rise in demand for electricity in the emergent nations. I guess spending 14 hours a day assembling our consumer goods was bound to put ideas in their heads. Many of you will be reading this on a tablet made by a Chinese teenager using rare metals that an African child has scraped off the side of a hill with a spoon, then sent halfway round the world to you so you can smugly talk about how little paper you now use. Recently, Richard Branson signed an “Earth Statement” the same week he launched a new Boeing. I would say, “How can he keep a straight face?” but his face has never been straight: he looks like someone cast a baboon in a movie about Rolf Harris. Maybe it’s time we started looking at being pro-business and pro-environment as opposites. They might pay someone to smile at the front desk, but corporations don’t care if we live or die. Perhaps it’s time to look at insentient blueprints for making money and wonder if they really have people’s best interests at heart. Can the market, a mechanism dedicated to increasing consumption, tackle a problem that is essentially down to excessive consumption? Why not – after all, we’ve all been down an actual market and heard those cries of: “Strawberries. Don’t buy these strawberries! You don’t really need them, you’ll throw most away when they go mouldy after you forget to eat them, don’t buy these strawberries!” Things will be terrible for the people who come after us. And they weren’t that great for the people who came before us either, as it was two degrees colder and there was no telly. Perhaps we’re all annoyed at climate change deniers because we know that the Earth is past the point of no return – we’re frustrated that they’re still at the denial stage of grief while we have moved on to bargaining. Things are so desperate that even our fictional dystopias may turn out to be fantasies. We imagine the Earth will sink gradually into chaos, but non-linear theories of global warming mean it might just be one afternoon of people screaming, then suddenly you disappear under a boiling, 100-mile-high wave of sewage flecked with famous landmarks from across the world; your mind finally silenced by the sudden arrival in the space previously occupied by your forehead of a shit-coloured Taj Mahal. In your final moments, you will probably feel cheated out of the many years you had hoped to spend watching a naked king in a leather crown as he staged mass hangings of poets in the echoing vaults of abandoned shopping malls. I dropped in to see my friend the other day, and her four-year-old daughter opened with: “The world is dying!” in a very sad voice. I said something soothing. I wish I could remember what it was now. Soon she’ll learn that, outside of the occasional Illuminati photo opportunity such as Paris, it’s not really the sort of thing we find polite to talk about."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2015/dec/01/new-generation-wave-energy-could-it-provide-one-third-of-australias-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-01T01:17:19Z","webTitle":"New generation wave energy: could it provide one third of Australia's electricity?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/01/new-generation-wave-energy-could-it-provide-one-third-of-australias-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/01/new-generation-wave-energy-could-it-provide-one-third-of-australias-electricity","fields":{"headline":"New generation wave energy: could it provide one third of Australia's electricity?","bodyText":"Alan Burns had an “epiphany” about the potential of ocean energy after being pummelled by the surf off Rottnest Island, near Perth. Two decades later and Burns’ company, Carnegie Wave Energy, appears to be finally on the verge of delivering on his dream. Wave energy – at least in theory – has the potential to provide one third of Australia’s electricity needs. The challenge has been to design a wave energy system that can resist the brutal power of the ocean, and to find a niche in the market in the face of plunging costs of solar energy and other renewables. Carnegie believes it may have found the answer. For the last six months, it has been operating the world’s first multi-machine wave energy installation (the CETO 5) – just a few kilometres from where Burns swam all those years ago. It’s been delivering zero emissions electricity and desalinated water to the facilities at Garden Island – Australia’s biggest naval base – and now plans to take that concept a crucial step further, to a renewable energy micro-grid based around wave energy. The first micro grid – also to be based at Garden Island – is a local energy grid that combines wave energy, solar (photovoltaic) energy, a desalination plant and energy storage. In this case it will use three of its commercial scale CETO wave energy machines, each with a capacity of 1MW, and add 2MW of solar and 500kW hours of battery storage. The micro grid can connect or disconnect from the electricity network and operate autonomously, and the idea is to enable Garden Island to be completely independent for its electricity and clean water requirements. The plan has already got the backing of the Commonwealth Bank, in the first major private sector financing transaction for a wave technology project. Carnegie believes this micro-grid concept can be applied elsewhere – in island communities off Australia and other areas in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans, as well as coastal communities in remote and fringe-of grid areas around the world. “This is seriously transformational, because it allows island, off grid and fringe grid communities to tap into the biggest advantage of wave energy, which is its consistency,” says chief executive Michael Ottaviano. “This is going to allow very high penetration of renewable energy into island networks. Up until now that has not been possible. Cheaper battery storage and solar helps, but the combination of wave with other renewables makes it easier to take higher penetration renewables into places it hasn’t been before, comfortably and cost effectively.” Renewable-focused micro-grids are expected to play an increasingly prominent role in the world’s electricity systems. In Australia, the Byron Bay shire is considering an approach from Siemens and Brookfield to create a renewable focused micro-grid, while smaller towns such as Tyalgum are considering doing the same. Developers of new housing divisions – such as KLW for its Huntlee development near Newcastle, are looking for renewable-based micro-grids rather than connecting to the main grid, while a new company chaired by Professor Ross Garnaut is looking for similar projects in South Australia. Carnegie’s plan, however, is to establish its own micro-grid business, targeting those islands and communities that may be too small for competitors. By adding solar, wind and storage, these communities will be able to reduce significant amounts of diesel, and the later addition of wave energy could take the renewable energy penetration to 100%, and provide desalinated water. “Its lack of onshore footprint is also a major advantage for islands, as is its lack of aesthetic impact,” Ottaviano says. “Its inherent synergies with seawater desalination also help.” Indeed the technology is having minimal impact on the environment, he says. The only part in contact with the sea floor is a standard pile foundations used for years in the marine space. “The CETO units themselves have been designed to avoid being a trap for marine life and we constantly monitor potential impacts such as acoustic or fouling,” he says, noting that the current project has over 350 measuring devices collecting data and feeding back in real time. And because the system is completely submerged, there is no visual impact. Carnegie is now emerging as one of the leading wave energy developers in the world. Others have come and gone, with prototypes generating publicity rather than electrons when mishaps saw the machines sink to the bottom of the ocean, in the case of Oceanlinx, or projects abandoned, in the case of OPT. Ottaviano says technology “attrition” is to be expected. The same thing occurred in other technologies, such as solar thermal, where industry standards – and the best way to capture the energy - have been slow to develop. But he points out that Carnegie has only been doing “serious” technology development since 2009, and has spent “just” $118m in that time. “That is just a blink of the eye compared to the amount of time invested in solar, nuclear, gas, or coal,” he says. “And the money invested is just a drop in the ocean compared to the hundreds of billions that have been spent on nuclear, and is still being spent, and the billions being spent on offshore wind. “Wave is one of the last renewable technologies to be commercialised. And if Carnegie is able to commercialise its wave energy technology for, say, $160m, that is exceptionally good value for money. “And we will have commercialised a power technology quicker and more cheaplythan any other technology that came before it.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"travel/2015/aug/02/travel-tips-noirmoutier-vendee-france","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-02T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"Travel tips: the magical island of Noirmoutier, plus bargains of the week | Joanne O’Connor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/02/travel-tips-noirmoutier-vendee-france","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2015/aug/02/travel-tips-noirmoutier-vendee-france","fields":{"headline":"Travel tips: the magical island of Noirmoutier, plus bargains of the week","bodyText":"Take me there: Noirmoutier, Vendée Why go? Crossing Le Gois, the ancient causeway on the west coast of France that links the Vendée with Noirmoutier, feels a bit like leaving the 21st century behind. The island holds a special place in the hearts of the French, who associate it with carefree seaside holidays. Less self-consciously cool than the Île de Ré, it maintains the air of a well-kept secret – though it’s anything but that in August. Sandy beaches backed by pines, dazzling salt pans and whitewashed buildings with blue shutters lend a Mediterranean air, despite the bracing Atlantic location. The food, as you’d expect, is fabulous. What to do Most people come here to indulge in the simple seaside pastimes of rock pooling, digging for clams and bobbing around in dinghies. Plage des Dames is a glorious sweep of powder-soft sand with a promenade, wooden pier and pretty beach huts. Stroll through the Bois de la Chaize, a shady forest of oak, pine and eucalyptus trees. The terrain is flat so most people get around by bike, or you can catch the little tourist train that runs around the island. Where to stay L’ Île Ô Château is a smart family-run hotel with 23 bedrooms which have recently been kitted out with driftwood headboards, seagrass flooring and a black-and-white colour scheme. There’s a small pool and bike hire is available. Doubles are priced from £60 (ileochateau.com). Where to eat Le Velo Noir is a tiny side-street bistro which makes good use of the local seafood – oysters, sea bream ceviche and fried cuttlefish with olives – and the island’s famed potatoes which even pop up on the dessert menu in the unexpected form of a potato cake with salted caramel sauce (levelonoir.fr). Insider tip Claire Osterburg of Wake Up in France (wakeupinfrance.co.uk) which offers accommodation in the Vendée, recommends taking a trip round the island on O’Abandonado, a Portuguese tall ship (oabandonado.com). “It’s a little piece of sailing history, and you can even hoist the sails yourself.” Give me a break Home: bedding down in the aisle Go bat hunting before bedding down for the night in the aisle of a 13th-century church. Inspired by the success of its ‘champing’ breaks (camping in a church) the Churches Conservation Trust has put together a weekend of bat-themed action at the church of St John the Baptist in Cambridgeshire on 28 August. Packages from £45 (£25 for under-16s) including B&amp;B in the church (visitchurches.org.uk). Away: Eco holidays in Lanzarote The online accommodation site only-apartments.com has added a handful of funky eco homes in the Canary Island of Lanzarote to its collection of self-catering properties. Prices start from £22 per night for the one-bedroom Eco Finca de los Frailes – a lava-built house which is powered by solar energy and situated on an organic farm near the National Park of Timanfaya ."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2016/jan/20/slump-in-oil-prices-drives-green-energy-take-up-in-top-exporting-nations","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-20T11:34:14Z","webTitle":"Slump in oil prices drives green energy takeup in top exporting nations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/20/slump-in-oil-prices-drives-green-energy-take-up-in-top-exporting-nations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jan/20/slump-in-oil-prices-drives-green-energy-take-up-in-top-exporting-nations","fields":{"headline":"Slump in oil prices drives green energy takeup in top exporting nations","bodyText":"The oil price slump below $30 barrel is spurring some of the world’s biggest oil exporters to curb domestic consumption of fossil fuels and invest in wind and solar power, according to government officials meeting in Abu Dhabi. A month after the historic climate agreement in Paris, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and other oil exporters are in the midst of overhauling domestic energy policies and seeking alternatives to oil and gas for electricity. The main motive is not reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but cutting back on domestic energy demand that is taking up a rising share of production. Oil exporters would rather sell their fossil fuels abroad than burn them at home, government officials attending meetings of the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) said. Since oil prices began their precipitous slide, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, the UAE and other big oil producers have cut electricity and water subsidies, imposed energy conservation measures, and encouraged homeowners to install solar panels in an effort to cut back on domestic consumption. Speaking on the sidelines of Irena’s annual meetings and Abu Dhabi’s sustainability week, officials said the slide in prices offered further incentive to get off oil – at least as a source of electricity. “It is just common sense in my opinion,” said Saad Salem Al Jandel, a research scientist at the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research and a delegate to the Irena meeting. “We are spending so much, something like $8bn (£5.6bn) to $10bn on fuel and power stations, so we want to replace part of it with renewables, and we can also do better with energy conservation and energy efficiency.” Al Jandel went on: “Instead of using oil in power generation we might sell it and get hard currency.” Iranian officials have arrived at a similar conclusion. With the lifting of sanctions, Iran was looking to free up more oil and gas for export by cutting domestic demand, Jafar Mohammadnejad Sigaroudi, deputy planning and development in Iran’s ministry of energy, told the Guardian. “We hope to use our gas for other uses, such as exporting,” he said. Draft regulations, due to be adopted by the Iranian parliament in the coming weeks, set a new energy conservation target and realigned prices for wind and solar energy, imposing a social cost for carbon that will help bring the cost of renewables almost at a par with fossil fuels – even with oil below $30 a barrel. “Renewables can be the same as fossil fuel because the price of oil is decreasing but the cost of transmission is very high,” he said. The initiatives confound the conventional wisdom that low oil prices discourage the transition to renewable energy, a view reiterated by the head of the International Energy Agency in Davos on Wednesday, but are born of harsh necessity. Since 2000, energy demand among the Middle Eastern oil producers has grown at 5% a year, outstripping China and India. Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, is now the seventh largest consumer of fossil fuels, according to a report from Irena published on Wednesday. The United Nations agency, which was founded to promote renewable energy and is based in Abu Dhabi, warned the rise in domestic energy risked eating into exports. Across the oil-producing region, countries are taking measures to cut domestic demand. Saudi Arabia, which faces a $98bn budget deficit and is considering listing the state-owned Aramco oil company on the stock exchange, has set a goal of cutting electricity demand 8% by 2021. The UAE, which diverts about a quarter of its production for domestic energy use, this month began charging households for water and electricity. “The whole mentality of our people will have to change,” said Thani Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, the director of energy and climate change. “I think in the upcoming 10 years we will see a major shift in the whole region.” Kuwait set a target of sourcing 15% of its electricity from wind and solar by 2030, and making buildings 10% more energy efficient, Al Jandel said. Qatar planned to get 20% of its electricity from renewables and reduce water consumption by 35%, according to Irena’s report. Egypt set a renewables target of 30% by 2030, Mohamed Shaker El-Markabi, the country’s electricity and renewable energy minister, told the Irena meeting. Jordan, which imports virtually all of its oil and gas, installed solar panels on the royal household and set a target of sourcing 20% of its electricity from solar and wind power by 2025. The king imported Tesla electric cars for himself and senior ministers, and the authorities waived the country’s prohibitive car import duties on hybrids and plug-ins. The reforms just made sense, said Ibrahim Saif, the country’s energy minister. “We had the kind of consumption patterns that were detached or disconnected from international reality,” he told the Guardian. “It was not that we were using the energy to produce commodities or goods. We were using it for transportation. We were using it for cooling down.” Beyond the Middle East, Russia, the world’s second largest oil exporter, is also scaling up its use of renewables, targeting remote regions such as the far east and northern territories. Alexey Teksler, the first deputy minister of energy, told the Irena meeting that Russia planned to source about 10% of its electricity from renewable sources over the next 20 years. Al Jandel said the shift suggested that the old assumption about competition between renewables and fossil fuels no longer held. “The world is really witnessing that there is a distinction between the price of renewables and oil. Oil is going down at the same time as renewables are going down,” he said. “That means they are separate technologies, separate concepts and they do not affect each other.” It’s unclear what effect the energy overhaul will have on climate pollution in a region with some of the world’s highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions. Countries in the region, while breaking their reliance on oil, are not necessarily embracing renewable energy sources. The UAE, which committed to diversifying its energy supply several years ago, plans to source 24% of its electricity from non-fossil sources by 2021 – but about 20% of that would be nuclear, with the first of four reactors at a site near the Saudi border scheduled to come on line in late 2017 or 2018. Last October, the UAE signed off on a new $1.8bn coal-fired power plant. Even so, Anthony Hobley, chief executive of the Carbon Tracker Initiative, said the moves indicate the beginning of the end for the dominance of fossil fuels. “The writing is clearly on the wall that we are facing the end of the fossil fuel era, and if your economy depends on that it would be prudent in the extreme to plan for that transition while you still have respectable revenue,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2015/jun/16/australians-optimism-fades-with-isis-seen-as-biggest-threat-survey-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T21:09:37Z","webTitle":"Australians' optimism fades with Isis seen as biggest threat, survey finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jun/16/australians-optimism-fades-with-isis-seen-as-biggest-threat-survey-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2015/jun/16/australians-optimism-fades-with-isis-seen-as-biggest-threat-survey-finds","fields":{"headline":"Australians' optimism fades with Isis seen as biggest threat, survey finds","bodyText":"Australians’ sunny optimism is dimming, according to an annual snapshot of the country’s attitude, which recorded the lowest feelings of safety and gloomiest economic outlook in the poll’s 11-year history. Concern for climate change rose again, Indonesia was on the nose, and Islamic State dominated Australians’ fears, according to the 2015 Lowy Institute poll. Fewer than one in four (24%) of the 1,200 people surveyed said they felt “very safe”, down 20% from 2009. The emergence of Isis – described last week by Tony Abbott as “coming if it can for every person and every government” – ranked as the highest threat. Comparatively fewer (20%) saw a military conflict between the US and China as “high risk”, while 77% saw China as “more of an economic partner to Australia” than a “military threat”. Warming sentiments towards the Asian giant had limits, however, with seven in 10 agreeing the government allowed “too much” Chinese investment in residential real estate. Economic optimism fell 13%, the largest drop in the poll’s history. It came off a high base: 63% of Australians remain at least optimistic about Australia’s economic performance over the next five years. With a UN climate change conference looming, 63% also said the country should “commit to significant reductions” in carbon emissions. A plurality, 43%, believed solar energy would be Australia’s primary source of energy in 10 years. The next highest was coal, with 17%. Tension over the executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran saw feelings towards Indonesia cool to 46/100, in the doldrums with Egypt (48) and Russia (45). Vladimir Putin was the least admired world leader, followed by Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo. Jokowi shouldn’t take it personally: 42% of Australians didn’t know who he was, and only about a third knew Indonesia was a democracy, a consistent finding across the past decade. As in past years, young Australians (aged 18-29) are sour on democracy, favoured only by 49%, though substantially fewer (23%) than in past years agreed “in some circumstances, a non-democratic government can be preferable”.

He found his further calling in the Anglican priesthood. Robert's career as a teacher was marked by his enthusiasm for his subject, his determination to give young people the widest possible opportunities and his abilities as a team leader. Within 12 years, he went from being a newly qualified teacher to a deputy head, a post that he held in three schools in Cambridgeshire, Nottingham and Humberside. In 1986, he became head of Twyford Church of England high school. As one of his deputy heads, I saw at first hand that much of the school's successful development was due not only to Robert's vision but to his commitment to effective teamwork and administration. Robert was born in Manchester to Joseph, a teacher, and Mildred Buckley. He read applied physics at Durham University, gaining a PhD in photovoltaics, a method of harnessing solar energy. While at Durham, he married Helen Sapherson, a fellow physics PhD student. It was a source of great pride to them when Susan, their daughter, gained her own physics PhD in 2005, through her radiography research work with the NHS. Robert was ordained an Anglican priest in St Paul's Cathedral in 1987. In 1995 he went into the stipendiary ministry, moving with Helen to the Church of the Ascension, Wembley Park, where, in 2000, he also became area dean of Brent. In 2003, they moved back to Manchester. He was appointed rector in a team ministry, the United Benefice of Atherton and Hindsford with Howe Bridge, becoming area dean of Leigh in 2008 and, in 2010, a canon of Manchester Cathedral. At the same time, he chaired the governing body that led to the establishment of the Atherton community school in 2012. The school's new sixth-form block is named after him. I have particular reason to be grateful to Robert, because in 2001 he saved my life. Dropping by to visit one day, he used a spare set of keys to enter the house, found me unconscious with what turned out to be bacterial meningitis and called an ambulance. Robert was an enthusiast in many different areas of life – trains, solar energy, stamps, football and the music of the Seekers. He was treasurer of the Society of Ordained Scientists until his death. He was a man with a warm heart and a sharp intelligence. He is survived by Helen and Susan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"public-leaders-network/2015/sep/10/renewable-energy-politicians-community-fracking","type":"article","sectionId":"public-leaders-network","sectionName":"Public Leaders Network","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-10T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"People love renewable energy, so why don't politicians get it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/sep/10/renewable-energy-politicians-community-fracking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/public-leaders-network/2015/sep/10/renewable-energy-politicians-community-fracking","fields":{"headline":"People love renewable energy, so why don't politicians get it?","bodyText":"Robin Hood: one of Britain’s best-loved folk heroes. He speaks to our national love of subverting the rules. Fighting against institutional injustice, he protected the most vulnerable from the predatory practices of a corrupt establishment. Nottingham city council’s new not-for-profit energy supply company, Robin Hood Energy, is not only the first of its kind, but the perfect contemporary manifestation of this spirit of righteous derring-do. Aware that the most vulnerable households – those on prepayment meters – were getting the worst deal from our current set up of the big six energy suppliers, and frustrated with the agonisingly slow progress from the government, Nottingham city council decided to take matters into its own hands and become a fully licensed energy supplier. This bold plan had three aims: tackle local fuel poverty, return profits to customers via reduced tariffs and support community energy projects to get local renewable generation off the ground. As Nottingham’s project lead Gail Scholes told me in May, navigating the onerous and painful regulation minefield this entailed was not for the faint-hearted. The UK’s energy market rules are sclerotic and abstruse, designed and written by their incumbent beneficiaries, the big six, in a way that seems calculated to freeze out new competitors. But Nottingham bravely battled through and a little over two years later has, rather serendipitously, finally launched Robin Hood Energy at the start of Britain’s annual Community Energy Fortnight. Nottingham’s project is just a part of a fast-growing national movement to take back power – both literally and figuratively – for the people. From Cornwall to the Highlands, the past five years have seen local community renewable energy schemes mushrooming. Many of them are opening their doors over Community Energy Fortnight, when the public will be able to see community solar in action at Palmers Green Mosque in London, community hydro at Osney Lock in Oxfordshire and community wind at Marshill Farm in Lanarkshire, Scotland. Surveys of public attitudes to different energy sources consistently show that British people like renewable energy a lot and want to see more of it. But throw community ownership into the mix and like turns to love – a recent Co-Op Energy poll showed that even Conservative voters would overwhelmingly support a local wind farm if it was owned and controlled by the community. Nearly four-fifths of those surveyed want the government to do more to help communities generate their own power and keep the profits. Unfortunately, the government seems to have little interest in what the public wants from the UK’s energy system, pushing ahead with fracking in the teeth of intense and growing public hostility while launching a savage surprise attack on the nation’s favourite source of renewable energy, solar power. The story of Balcombe in West Sussex perhaps best embodies the mismatch between public preferences and current energy policy. Two years after Cuadrilla packed up and left following huge protests against its plans to frack there, the residents of Balcombe are on the cusp of realising their mission to generate enough locally owned solar energy to meet the electricity needs of every home in the village. Later this month, if all goes according to plan, the people of Balcombe will gain planning permission for a 5MW solar farm and begin a scramble to raise the £5m necessary to get the facility built before next April – when solar farm support will come to an abrupt end. If the government goes through with its plans, there will be no new community solar farms after Balcombe’s, no more community wind or hydro schemes and one million fewer solar roofs installed nationwide over the next five years. There will be an awful lot of fracking going on though.

A Chinese reactor at Bradwell would be the fourth different new power reactor design in England. Commercial and security issues may be soluble at nominal cost. But can the UK muster sufficient indigenous expertise to master the details of the technology and design of so many types in order to become an expert customer and subsequently operate the reactors safely and economically for their expected life? Even if the necessary expertise and industrial capacity were available it would represent a continuing cost throughout the life of the reactor and well into subsequent decommissioning. Some careful strategic thinking is needed before the government enters into an agreement with China in addition to current plans for Hinkley Point, Wylfa and Moorside. Tim Chittenden Workington, Cumbria • A few more questions for George Osborne about his French/Chinese nuclear reactor (Letters, 22 September). Why the constant references to hard-pressed bill payers when renewable energy is already cheaper and plummeting in price, and when the planned cuts to solar energy will save households no more than £1.20 a year (Report, 19 October)? Does he think “hard-pressed” people can’t afford to worry about safety? If it’s not to save money or carbon, then what is the huge nuclear subsidy for? The civil nuclear industry is known to provide key expertise and a skills pool for the UK to remain part of the military nuclear club; Sussex University’s science policy research unit suggests that this might explain the government’s unshakeable commitment to this form of energy (Report, 7 August). Consumers are entitled to a full accounting. Exactly what is it that we are expected to contribute to through our bills? Ruth London Fuel Poverty Action • Once the UK solar panel industry has gone the way of the steel industry (Solar subsidy cut attacked as obscene, 19 October), we shall presumably be buying our panels in the future from China, much to George Osborne’s satisfaction. Geoffrey Rider Ripon • Along with a lot of people, I do not hold much faith in our government, sadly. However, I hold even less faith in the governments of countries such as China. So, another nuclear power station is to be built in Suffolk. Did anybody ask local people how they felt about this and if they would be happy that its security would be in the hands of another country? How dare the government hand over things of such vital importance and concern to unknown entities. P Ward Saxmundham, Suffolk • Timothy Garton Ash (If US relations with China turn sour, there will probably be war, 16 October) echoes repeated predictions that, rather than implode politically, an expansionist China is destined to lock horns in war with the US for world superpower primacy. By then China will own the commanding heights of little Britain’s economy: nuclear power generation; water and sewerage; high-speed rail. Yet the prevailing Westminster view is that it is strategically desirable to renew “our own independent” Trident nuclear deterrent – which I understand is only usable with US assent. David Higdon Ryton, Tyne and Wear • Ma Jian (The howls of political prisoners, 19 October) asks whether the UK government would “have had the gall to invite President Botha on a state visit while the world was clamouring for Nelson Mandela’s release”. Mrs Thatcher had the gall, all right, and I have the “No to Botha” badge I wore to the Hyde Park protest rally of 50,000 people in June 1984 to prove it. Susan Seager London • As a member of the Christian Peoples’ Alliance I disagree with many of Jeremy Corbyn’s policies. However, as regards his concern about the poor human rights record of Saudi Arabia and China we are at one. He should take the opportunity of this week’s visit of President Xi Jinping to speak out about issues such as the occupation of Tibet, the discrimination against Christians in many regions, the denial of a free press, treatment of dissidents, and failing to take serious measures to stop the import of animal body parts from endangered species. John Wainwright Potters Bar, Hertfordshire • Ten years ago, when I last visited China, virtually everybody I met raised the issue of human rights. No, they didn’t want to talk about Tibet or political prisoners. They wanted to know how Britain could justify the invasion of Iraq and the abuse of human rights there.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk described the potential of a world entirely powered by batteries charged with renewable energy. The media lapped it up, as did consumers, who preordered Tesla’s home battery solution, Powerwall, in droves. But energy storage experts remain unconvinced. Even Panasonic – supplier of the lithium-ion cells that form the foundation of Tesla’s batteries, and partner on the company’s forthcoming battery factory – calls Musk’s claims hyperbole. “We are at the very beginning in energy storage in general,” says Phil Hermann, chief energy engineer at Panasonic Eco Solutions. “Most of the projects currently going on are either demo projects or learning experiences for the utilities. There is very little direct commercial stuff going on. “Elon Musk is out there saying you can do things now that the rest of us are hearing and going, ‘really?’ We wish we could but it’s not really possible yet.” Musk’s optimism might in part be driven by necessity. The Nevada-based battery factory, called the “Gigafactory”, once completed will have a production capacity that far outstrips the demand produced by Tesla’s vehicles. What to do with all those extra batteries? Sell them in the residential and commercial markets. It also solves another Tesla problem. The majority of the company’s automotive customers want to be able to rapidly charge their cars at home, but the systems that enable that sort of charging are a major energy suck. Utilities don’t like them, and in many cases won’t allow them. Solution? Charge a Powerwall, then run your electric-vehicle charger off the stored energy. “It’s a smart business move, and it might be a commercial success, but as a scientist I don’t think what Tesla’s proposing is a good solution,” says Tom Milnes, energy storage expert and CEO of Open Water Power, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology spin-off commercializing a fuel cell for use in naval drones. It’s not a Tesla competitor. Lithium-ion batteries just won’t store the amount of energy required to be as useful as Musk promises, says Milnes: “Personally I think the Tesla factory producing hundreds of thousands more lithium-ion batteries is really short sighted because those batteries are just never going to hold the amount of energy we need them to.” Despite all the talk about batteries storing solar energy, renewable energy storage is currently not the primary function of Tesla’s pilot program. Jackson Family Wines (JFW), a family owned and operated company with vineyards and wineries worldwide, hosted the largest installment of Tesla commercial energy storage units during the company’s testing period. While JFW has invested heavily in solar in California, it did not use the Tesla unit to store solar energy. “We’ll eventually use it for solar; we’re excited to test that,” says Julien Gervreau, senior sustainability manager at JFW. “Right now it’s designed for peak saving, so we charge them at night when the grid is stable and electricity is cheap and discharge during the day.” John Jung, CEO of Greensmith, a supplier of turnkey energy storage systems, says this application is the most common in energy storage, with the majority of large-scale customers being more interested in reliability and cost reductions. The ability to make renewable energy more viable is typically a secondary benefit. “The renewables aspect is still incredibly important, though,” he says. “Even if it’s a secondary thing, it can make a huge difference in terms of a project being [return on investment] positive or negative.” But even as Tesla’s batteries promise to reduce tailpipe emissions, more direct environmental concerns surround the current boom in lithium-ion batteries. As hundreds of thousands more of these batteries hit the market, the problems that come with lithium mining, battery lifecycles and recycling loom large. In a 2013 report, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Design for the Environment program concluded that batteries using nickel and cobalt, like lithium-ion batteries, have the “highest potential for environmental impacts”. It cited negative consequences like mining, global warming, environmental pollution and human health impacts. While Tesla declines to comment on the particular chemistry it uses, representative Khobi Brooklyn did list nickel as one of the components of the company’s batteries, and lithium is also obviously a component. Jung says Tesla’s under-construction Gigafactory and other new battery factories have led to a rapid decline in prices for lithium-ion batteries over the past two years. “Because the electric vehicle market did not consume as much of that capacity as [original equipment manufacturers] had hoped, we’re seeing prices drop dramatically,” he says. That means exponentially more batteries entering the environment over the next few years. Although some utilities and corporate customers are concerned about the ecological impact of large-scale energy storage systems, Jung says there’s still work to be done. “This is a market that’s going to be measured in the trillions really soon – that’s a lot of components, a lot of batteries, inverters and converters to deal with.” According to Tesla’s Brooklyn, the company will conduct onsite recycling of lithium ion batteries at the Gigafactory, capturing nickel, aluminum and lithium for use in new battery cells. And Panasonic’s Herman says he expects to ultimately see recycling rates at close to 100% for lithium-ion batteries. “There’s an economic benefit to do it,” Herman says. “It’s not like we’re left with a heap of nothing at the end – the recyclable content of lithium-ion batteries is valuable.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2015/nov/23/how-africas-fastest-solar-power-project-is-lighting-up-rwanda","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-23T10:20:33Z","webTitle":"How Africa's fastest solar power project is lighting up Rwanda","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/23/how-africas-fastest-solar-power-project-is-lighting-up-rwanda","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/23/how-africas-fastest-solar-power-project-is-lighting-up-rwanda","fields":{"headline":"How Africa's fastest solar power project is lighting up Rwanda","bodyText":"“Arise, shine for your light has come,” reads a sign at the entrance to the first major solar power farm in east Africa. The 8.5 megawatt (MW) power plant in Rwanda is designed so that, from a bird’s-eye view, it resembles the shape of the African continent. “Right now we’re in Somalia,” jokes Twaha Twagirimana, the plant supervisor, during a walkabout of the 17-hectare site. The plant is also evidence, not only of renewable energy’s increasing affordability, but how nimble it can be. The $23.7m (£15.6m) solar field went from contract signing to construction to connection in just a year, defying sceptics of Africa’s ability to realise projects fast. The setting is magnificent amid Rwanda’s famed green hills, within view of Lake Mugesera, 60km east of the capital, Kigali. Some 28,360 solar panels sit in neat rows above wild grass where inhabitants include puff adders. Tony Blair and Bono have recently taken the tour. From dawn till dusk the computer-controlled photovoltaic panels, each 1.9 sq metres, tilt to track the sun from east to west, improving efficiency by 20% compared to stationary panels. The panels are from China while the inverters and transformers are from Germany. The plant’s construction has created 350 local jobs and increased Rwanda’s generation capacity by 6%, powering more than 15,000 homes. All this is crucial in an economy that, 21 years after the genocide, is expanding fast and aims to give half its population access to electricity by 2017. Twagirimana, one of five full-time staff on-site, said: “The Rwandan government is in desperate need of energy. In 2013 they only had 110 megawatts. They wanted solar to increase capacity.” The government agreed to a joint bid by Gigawatt Global, Norfund and Scatec Solar, backed by Barack Obama’s Power Africa initiative. Construction began in February 2014 and was finished by July. “It’s the fastest project in Africa.” Its first year produced an estimated 15 million kilowatt hours, sending power to a substation 9km away, which has prompted mixed views in local communities. Twagirimana, 32, explained: “The neighbours say they want energy direct from here because they think it would be cheaper. It’s not true. We sell to the utility. Even our building gets power from the grid.” The solar field is linked to a central server in Oslo and can be monitored remotely via the internet. Twagirimana believes it could be a template for the continent. “We have plenty of sun. Some are living in remote areas where there is no energy. Solar will be the way forward for African countries.” The project is built on land owned by the Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village, whose mission is to care for Rwanda’s most vulnerable children orphaned before and after the genocide. This lease provides the biggest source of income to the six-year-old village, currently home to 512 young people who are offered schooling and extracurricular activities. Jean-Claude Nkulikiyimfura, director of the village, said: “The project is probably the fastest: in less than a year it was up and going. It’s bringing a lot of visits from anyone interested in project development, and it brings some visibility for us. It’s something quite unique and we’re proud to be partners in it.” Some of the village’s young people have received training at the solar site and one worked on the project. Other spin-offs have included a partnership to make solar panels for 250,000 homes. Nkulikiyimfura, 40, added: “Renewable energy is the way to go and we’re really proud to have it here. It shows what’s really possible when government works with the public and private sectors.” One village member, 18-year-old Bella Kabatesi, who lost her parents to illness when she was four, has used solar power to design a night light at a memorial to the village’s late founder. “The big solar plant is going to help the people and the country because it’s cheaper than main electrical power,” she said. Rwanda has been both criticised for trampling on human rights and praised for its unswerving focus on development and getting things done. Chaim Motzen, Gigawatt Global’s co-founder and managing director, and a solar industry pioneer in Israel, said: “Rwanda had 110 megawatts on the grid for a population of 12 million people; Israel has 13,000 megawatts for 8 million people. There was a desperate need for more energy. “Rwanda has an excellent business environment – no corruption – and that played a role. I also think they were serious about wanting to move quickly. We had good partners on the ground. It’s now being used as a model: you can do energy deals quickly and get things done. It’s a catalyst for future projects in Rwanda and hopefully not just in Rwanda to inspire others to do what we’re doing.” Solar energy is a key element in Africa’s future, Motzen believes. “Is it the only solution? No, because solar is intermittent. But will it be a major part of the solution? I believe it will.” Yosef Abramowitz, president of Gigawatt Global, told a US government delegation and Bono at a site visit in August: “We have decoupled GDP growth from emissions growth. What you have heard is that we are 6% of a country’s generation capacity without adding any emissions. It is a false choice in Paris [the climate summit] and this is the proof test to be able to break that deadlock so that the world can go solar.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/sep/24/renewable-energy-outstrips-coal-for-first-time-in-uk-electricity-mix","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-24T14:25:13Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy outstrips coal for first time in UK electricity mix","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/24/renewable-energy-outstrips-coal-for-first-time-in-uk-electricity-mix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/sep/24/renewable-energy-outstrips-coal-for-first-time-in-uk-electricity-mix","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy outstrips coal for first time in UK electricity mix","bodyText":"Renewable energy has for the first time surpassed coal in supplying the UK’s electricity for a whole quarter, according to government statistics released on Thursday. The revelation of the surge in wind, solar and bioenergy to a record 25% comes in a week when the government has been heavily criticised by business leaders and Al Gore for cutting support for clean energy. The high performance of renewable electricity between April and June, the latest period data is available for, was due to both more wind and sun and more turbines and solar panels having been installed, compared to the same period the year before, when renewables contributed 16.4% of electricity. Gas-fired power stations provided the most electricity - 30% - with renewables second. Nuclear power was third with 21.5% and coal - the most polluting fuel - fell back to fourth, with 20.5%. Ageing coal and nuclear plants have been closing in recent years, while renewable energy has been rapidly rolling out. Since May’s general election, Conservative ministers have argued that the subsidies given to renewable energy were rising too fast and announced plans to cut them, including an 87% reduction for solar power and an end to support for onshore wind farms. Industry figures said the government was slashing support too heavily and would strangle renewable energy just as it was taking off. “The new statistics show that the UK is relying increasingly on dependable renewable sources to keep the country powered up, with onshore and offshore wind playing the leading roles in our clean energy mix,” said RenewableUK’s chief executive Maria McCaffery. “We’ve had a series of disappointing announcements from ministers since May which unfortunately betray a lack of positive ambition at the heart of government. If ministers want to see good statistics like we’ve had today continuing into the years ahead, they have to knuckle down, listen to the high level of public support we enjoy, and start making positive announcements.” The renewable surge was led by solar energy, which more than doubled between the second quarters of 2014 and 2015. Electricity from wind rose by 65%, helped by the expansion of several large-scale offshore wind farms, while electricity from biomass rose 26%, mainly due to a switch from coal to wood chips at a unit of Drax power station. “Government support has driven down the cost of renewable energy significantly and these statistics show that has successfully enabled renewables to compete with other technologies,” said a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change. “Our priority is now to move towards a low-carbon economy whilst ensuring subsidies are used where they are needed most, which provides the best value for money for hardworking bill payers.” However, John Cridland, director general of the CBI, the UK’s leading business organisation delivered a scathing attack on Tuesday on the government moves that have weakened green policies. “These changes send a worrying signal about the UK as a place for low-carbon investment,” he said. “Over many years, the UK has built up real credibility on climate leadership and low-carbon investment. This is hard won, but easily lost.” Former US vice president Al Gore also attacked the UK government, listing a long series of reversals on green policies and saying he could not understand the rationale, with climate change presenting a clear danger to the UK and the rest of the world. Energy secretary Amber Rudd, visiting China with George Osborne this week, announced a £2bn loan guarantee for the proposed new Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset, saying the plant was “value for money” for low-carbon, baseload electricity. But critics attacked the £24.5bn price tag and history of nuclear cost overruns and delays, with a former Tory energy minister calling it “one of the worst deals ever” for British consumers and industry. Energy minister Andrea Leadsom spoke out in favour of shale gas exploration on Wednesday, which ministers have pledged to fast-track, saying it was “an inconvenient truth” for the anti-fracking lobby that shale gas could have economic and environmental benefits. “We need to meet the UK’s rising demand for energy, using clean and low carbon energy sources if we are to continue to combat climate change and grow the economy,” she said. However, the government’s energy statistics released on Thursday said demand “fell by 2% continuing the recent downward trend”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/07/lighting-up-africa-the-uks-plan-to-expand-access-to-energy-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-07T10:52:16Z","webTitle":"Lighting up Africa: the UK's plan to expand access to energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/07/lighting-up-africa-the-uks-plan-to-expand-access-to-energy-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/jan/07/lighting-up-africa-the-uks-plan-to-expand-access-to-energy-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"Lighting up Africa: the UK's plan to expand access to energy","bodyText":"For a man who has only recently started his job, international development minister Nick Hurd seems sure of his priorities. “Energy Africa makes perfect sense to me,” he says. “In the next few weeks and months we’re going to be shaping what DfID [the Department for International Development] does in the next five, arguably 10 years. But improving access to energy in Africa is my particular focus at the moment.” After spending four years as minister for civil society under the coalition government, Hurd has been parachuted into the job at DfID to replace Grant Shapps, who resigned in the midst of allegations that bullying in the Tory party had led to the death of one of its activists. Although his new portfolio covers a range of issues including water, climate change, sanitation, education and health, his immediate priority is to “keep up the momentum” of the Energy Africa campaign launched by Shapps in October. Hurd has his sights set on the seventh sustainable development goal: universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030. But sub-Saharan Africa is currently 50 years behind, the only region in the world where the number of people denied access to modern forms of energy is set to rise and, based on current trends, predicted to hit the goal by 2080. Inspired by Barack Obama’s flagship Power Africa programme, Hurd hopes that Energy Africa can make a key difference. Last month the US and UK projects came together to create a new partnership to address specific issues such as the need for shared power across borders, resources for geothermal power, and to boost the number of women participating in Africa’s solar industry. But unlike Power Africa, which has been catalysing a wide range of renewable energy projects that will connect to the national grid – from a vast solar farm in Rwanda to the first wind power project in Senegal – Energy Africa has a very specific objective: to accelerate off-grid solar power for households using private investment. Grid investment will only reach 40% of the population and leave more than 500 million people still without electricity access in 2030, according to the Overseas Development Institute. Critics say that the impact of DfID’s campaign will be only “incremental” because the continent needs large-scale infrastructure and while NGOs push decentralisation, Africans want a grid connection. But it is well known that these incremental changes can create significant new possibilities in the lives of individuals and communities, from lanterns that enable pupils to study at night, to mobile phone chargers, to lights for huts that keep animals safe from predators. Hurd is adamant about the need and value of off-grid investment. “The question is: what can we do for the 60% now?” he asks. “It strikes a chord with ministers wrestling with energy access in their countries. On-grid is massively important but most of the projections suggest that’s going to take a long time and won’t reach all the population. That’s why Energy Africa is focused on household solar energy. We think there is huge potential in off-grid particularly, because we see this market developing which we think we, with partners, can turbo charge.” A host of factors have coalesced to create what Hurd describes as a “pivotal moment” for household solar in Africa. In the past six years, the price of panels has dropped by around 70%, making it as cheap as fossil fuels in some areas. The price and quality of battery technologies is also improving fast while the spread of mobile money systems on the continent is making solar an increasingly feasible prospect for the individual householder. Six countries have signed up to DfID’s Energy Africa campaign. Ministers from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Somalia were the first to complete an agreement, followed by Ghana, Malawi and Rwanda. Eight other countries have been identified as potential targets, including Zimbabwe, Ethiopia and Uganda. The countries were chosen because they were “biting our hand off” says Hurd. “We are responding to demand.” Working in fragile states is one of DfID’s explicit objectives, partly driven by national security interests. More than half its budget is committed to work in such regions, but implementing clean energy is a challenge in states grappling with terrorism and conflict, such as Nigeria and Somalia. Problems vary from country to country, but the industry has been held back by a lack of legal and tax structures. The International Finance Corporation is currently working to establish a new set of product standards. DfID say it is its role to work out how to streamline the bureaucracy, and the specific challenges in each country are still being identified. Providing electricity at the household level comes with additional challenges. For rural communities miles from a grid connection, energy poverty is entrenched by lack of access to financial systems. Pay-as-you-go schemes offered by mobile phones are changing this, but penetration fluctuates from country to country. DfID hopes that the campaign will be able to support non-bank financial providers to create mobile payment systems. In places where regulation makes it unfeasible, alternatives such as scratch cards will make up the difference. The campaign is not a “traditional aid programme” says Hurd. Its aim is to galvanise private investment in countries where DfID has formed a partnership with the government. “It’s a different model,” he says. “It’s not about a huge chunk of public money; it’s not a DfID programme as such. It’s a private-sector solution to this challenge.” But in a debate where creating clean energy is often pitted against economic development, it does not yet seem to be clear how foreign investment galvanised by the campaign will provide substantial jobs for Africans on the ground. Although DfID has previously given seed funding to mobile money solar companies in the UK and Africa – such as Azuri Technologies and Persistent Energy Ghana – the majority of investors involved in the campaign will be foreign, with many British companies involved. “We’re not nationalistic about this. We know it’s going to be private-sector led and we want to support entrepreneurs. At the moment most of the businesses are foreign, but over time my hope and expectation is that this will evolve. There is a hell of a lot going on in trying to increase energy access in Africa. My overriding instinct is to keep asking the question: how does this join up?” Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians. Follow @GuardianGDP on Twitter.

Start at a household level Millions of homes across Africa spend $0.50 per day on kerosene for lighting. If that can be channeled towards purchase of a solar home system that works for year, that is sustainable to our customer. We must provide a solution for individual families before scaling up to country level. Pauline Vaughn, director of operations for M-Kopa, Solar Kenya Limited, Nairobi, Kenya @mkopasolar 2. Remove extra costs For grid access, tariffs and connection charges are the main barriers to customers. Senegal has encouraged private investment by licensing concessions and paying by results (number of new connections). Monthly bills include a charge that allows their up-front connection and wiring costs to be repaid over time. South Africa has introduced a free basic tariff for the poorest. Andrew Scott, research fellow, Overseas Development Institute, London, UK @Andrew_W_Scott @ODIdev 3. Remember there’s no one energy solution There is no reason that off-grid and grid energy have to compete. In many developing countries demand for electricity is outstripping supply so there is scope for a variety of solutions and a diverse energy mix is better for national energy security. Robert Towers, senior energy economist, Department for International Development, London, UK @DFID_UK 4. Use off-grid in fragile states A country like Somalia that is just getting out of along civil war will not catch up with its neighbours for years if it goes the grid way. At the moment communities here are enjoying the simplicity of off-grid solar systems to light up towns, power health centres, boreholes and schools. Aidarus Abubakar, managing director, Solargen Technologies Ltd, Mogadishu, Somalia @SolarGenTech 5. Be careful when setting prices for new products We find that many customers do not know what they are willing to pay for power as they have never had it. It is very difficult to assess affordability levels before you provide a product. Often, once a reliable power source is available people will pay far more than originally thought. The key is to move away from unsustainable solutions that require large amounts of grant funding and provide energy solutions in a way that is sustainable for the providers of that energy. Adam Molleson, programme director of SolarNigeria, Adam Smith International, Abuja, Nigeria @AdamSmithInt 6. Ensure quality control There is currently not an adequate legal structure related to renewable products (especially individual-use solar systems). African countries need to create mandatory testing regimes/standards for such imported products, as we don’t want the market destroyed by a few bad products. Jacqueline Musiitwa, founder, Hoja Law Group, Kigali, Rwanda @nubiancounsel 7. Discuss alternative financing models for solar energy Finance is one of the key constraints that is preventing energy companies from scaling up. Finance for solar companies and for consumer credit particularly. In terms of banks, the sector definitely needs more local currency lending. What’s the best way to scale this up? Andrew Scott 8. Make local manufacturing cost effective The cost of production of renewables in Africa is very high compared to India or China. Unless there is financing to help local companies get off their feet, a renewable energy manufacturing industry in Africa will remain a wish. Chandirekera Mutubuki-Makuyana, sector leader, renewable energy, SNV World, Harare, Zimbabwe @ChandiMutubuki 9. Push governments to prioritise energy for all There is the need for off-grid, distributed renewable energy to be integrated into national electrification and development plans. National governments are critical and key to the scale of off-grid solutions. Political will, institutional and sustained capacity, market understanding, solid business operating environments, quality standards and reduced fuel subsidies are a must for sector growth. DfID’s Energy Africa programme, as well as the US Power Africa programme will support countries across these dimensions. Christine Eibs Singer, director of global advocacy, Power for All, New Jersey, USA @Power4All2025 10. Support the infrastructure for pay-as-you-go energy For this type of renewable energy model to thrive it is essential for mobile money penetration to be high. Ethiopia is an interesting example of a country with a huge off-grid and remote population but it is difficult to serve effectively due to a lack of mobile money. Pauline Vaughn 11. Collect evidence that connects energy to better quality of life The integration of distributed renewable energy into income generation and improved quality of life is actually what we all want to achieve. As access expands, we need to provide the evidence to further support distribution. Practical Action’s Total Energy Access Standards is one approach, as is the SE4All Global Tracking Framework.

A lot of those ‘quick’ fixes have never been upgraded,” says Jemma Knowles, part of the low-carbon team at Plymouth city council. Knowles, her colleagues and more than 850 local members run Plymouth Energy Community (PEC), a big-thinking, multifaceted project that aims to create a greener city and save residents money on their energy bills. Established in 2013, PEC has grown from a council initiative into a large community-led operation offering many different services to help the people of Plymouth. “Our volunteer-training programme means we now have a whole team that goes out to people’s houses to give advice on how to become more energy efficient,” says Knowles. PEC offers grants for home insulation, accessible information on switching energy providers and a free fuel debt advice service, in partnership with various other organisations. One of PEC’s biggest achievements to date is the installation of solar panels on 21 schools and public buildings through its sister organisation, PEC Renewables. The solar panels are funded by the sale of community shares as well as a loan from the council. “People who are passionate about solar energy but can’t put solar panels on their own house can invest in the community shares that we offer,” says Knowles. “Roughly half of our investors are from the Plymouth area and we allow a minimum investment of £50. We wanted as many people as possible to be part of it, even if they didn’t have a lot of money to invest.” The first call for investors in the scheme in February 2014 was a great success, with more than £600,000 raised through share sales. Predicted returns for investors are around 6% – better than many high-street savings accounts. This year’s effort raised a grand total of £850,000, which will pay for a second wave of solar-roof installations, including on top of the Plymouth Life Centre. “It’s one of the busiest leisure centres in the country. This will be our biggest installation yet,” says Knowles. “Plymouth Life Centre looks out over the city; once the solar panels are installed, it will show community energy in action to the whole city.” And there are even bigger plans in store. In five years the organisation wants to have enough locally owned renewable energy to power more than 1,100 homes, and to continue to address fuel poverty and carbon emissions, making Plymouth one of the greenest cities in the country.

Torrid heat tends to slightly reduce solar panels’ generating capacities, and with fresher conditions forecast across much of the UK, the amount of solar in the electricity mix could reach a new peak at 2pm tomorrow. “It is hard to say if a record will be set but given that more and more solar is installed every day, it is likely that a new record is set every time we have good conditions now - and this week we are certainly having them,” said a spokeswoman for the Solar Trade Association (STA), which made the prediction. A new clean energy record would be a boost for the solar industry which celebrates its annual ‘solar independence day’ tomorrow with open house events across the UK. Energy minister Andrea Leadsom will be visiting one solar farm at a leisure centre in Brackley, Northamptonshire. Solar photovoltaic installations have soared recently in the UK, partly due to developers rushing to meet a change in subsidy regime in April. There are now around 700,000 small-scale installations now on the grid, enough to power over 655,000 households, according to government figures. Britain is currently installing solar capacity more quickly than any other European country. The supermarket giant Waitrose today announced that it had installed enough solar panels on the roof of one of its dairy farms in Leckford to power the lighting and milking equipment. Globally, another solar milestone was passed today with installed solar capacity of 200GW now available to meet global demand, according to BSW, the German solar trade association. “Through technological breakthroughs in mass production the prices for solar electricity could be decreased by 90%,” said David Wedepohl, a BSW spokesman. “In around 30 countries worldwide electricity from your own roof now costs less than what your local provider will charge you per kilowatt hour.” With a 36% annual growth rate, the solar photovoltaic industry is mushrooming so fast at the moment that some analysts expect that half the current global total will be being installed every year by 2020. The cumulative market at that point would be around 700GW, roughly equivalent to the size of all the electrical generating capacity in Europe today, if the predictions by Greentechmedia prove correct. The biggest cloud on the horizon for solar energy is how to store the tremendous amounts of energy it can instantaneously produce for later use – or dispatch it via interconnectors to meet demand across Europe.

Research from commercial law firm EMW shows that 20,655 green energy patents were filed globally in 2014, for solar power, wind energy, biofuels and waste-generated energy – down from 35,590 in 2012. EMW said this sharp decline has been mainly caused by oversupply in the solar panel market, with Chinese mass production hitting profit margins of other companies. Solar-related patents accounted for 65% of the total (13,551 patents) last year. This has been exacerbated by subsidy cuts for renewables in many countries, including the UK, as well as the dramatic fall in oil prices that has widened the price gap between low carbon and conventional energy. James Geary, head of EMW’s waste, renewables and energy team, warned this could well hamper efforts by governments around the world to meet their carbon reduction targets. Geary said: “These figures show that the boom in green energy innovation that we have witnessed in recent years has peaked for now, suggesting that investment in R&amp;D is tailing off across the renewables sector. “In terms of solar energy, falling costs of solar panels fuelled by Chinese manufacturers flooding the market have hurt profitability, disincentivising costly research and development activity.” Geary added: “The net result is that, despite international efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and cut carbon emissions by focusing on renewables, the impetus to fund innovation in green energy has taken a knock.” In the UK, the current subsidy scheme, called renewable obligation, is being replaced by a new system, in which subsidies will be capped at £200m. Spain and Germany have also scaled back their renewable energy subsidies in the past few years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/nov/10/renewable-energy-made-up-half-of-worlds-new-power-plants-in-2014-iea","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-10T09:48:10Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy made up half of world's new power plants in 2014: IEA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/10/renewable-energy-made-up-half-of-worlds-new-power-plants-in-2014-iea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/10/renewable-energy-made-up-half-of-worlds-new-power-plants-in-2014-iea","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy made up half of world's new power plants in 2014: IEA","bodyText":"Renewable energy accounted for almost half of all new power plants in 2014, representing a “clear sign that an energy transition is underway”, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Green energy is now the second-largest generator of electricity in the world, after coal, and is set to overtake the dirtiest fossil fuel in the early 2030s, said the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2015 report, published on Tuesday. “The biggest story is in the case of renewables,” said IEA executive director, Fatih Birol. “It is no longer a niche. Renewable energy has become a mainstream fuel, as of now.” He said 60% of all new investment was going into renewables but warned that the $490bn of fossil fuel subsidies in 2014 meant there was not a “fair competition”. Amid the energy transition, the IEA said the price of oil, currently under $50 a barrel, was likely to recover only to $80 by 2020 and see modest growth beyond. The IEA said investment in oil exploration and production was set to fall by 20% in 2015, as high cost projects in the US, Canada, Russia and Brazil continue to be shelved. But it said US shale oil producers could move back into profit with prices of $60-$70 a barrel. The IEA, which was founded in response to the oil shocks of the 1970s, also warned that if the oil price remained at $50 for a decade or more, cheaper oil from the Middle East would come to dominate exports, with 75% market share. Birol said that the scenario was “unlikely”, but that if it came to pass, “reliance on a very few number of countries in a region that is in turmoil may not be the best news for oil security.” “Now is not the time to relax,” he said. “Quite the opposite: a period of low oil prices is the moment to reinforce our capacity to deal with future energy security threats.” The rapid rise of renewables charted in the new IEA report will lead to a dramatic slowdown in the growth of carbon emissions, the agency said. But, just weeks ahead of a crunch UN climate change summit in Paris, the IEA calculated that the world was still on course for 2.7C of global warming, significantly above the 2C considered to be the threshold of dangerous warming. “A major course correction is still required,” said the report. “World leaders meeting in Paris must set a clear direction for the accelerated transformation of the global energy sector,” said Birol. “The difference between 2.7C and 2C is not something meaning you can take your jacket off and adapt to life - it will have major implications for all of us.” The IEA projects “turbulent times” ahead for coal: “Coal has increased its share of the global energy mix from 23% in 2000 to 29% today, but the momentum behind coal’s surge is ebbing away and the fuel faces a reversal of fortune.” It projects a 15% share by 2040. Huge changes in China are a major factor in coal’s decline, said Birol: “The era of the China boom in terms of energy demand growth is coming to an end. This is a major story and has implications for the entire world.” He said China had the biggest energy efficiency programme in the world and that “China is the champion of renewables”, as well having a major nuclear programme and likely growth in unconventional gas. But the IEA expects coal demand is set to triple in India and in south-east Asia by 2040. “South-east Asia is amazingly important and not getting much attention,” said Birol. “It is the only region in the world where the coal demand is increasing its share.” He said, in the absence of climate policies, cheap coal and renewables would squeeze out gas in the region. “India is moving to the centre stage of energy,” said Birol, becoming the main global driver of coal consumption and oil demand in the world by 2040 as well as accounting for 20% of the globe’s solar power installations. “The choices India makes will be important for all of us, and therefore there is a need for supporting India’s push for clean and efficient technologies.” Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association, said: “This IEA report is a reminder of the continuing role of coal and the need to ensure it is used as cleanly as possible through the use of low-emission coal technologies.” The IEA has been criticised in the past for underestimating the speed of solar energy deployment. “The global breakthrough of renewable energy has happened much faster than anticipated,” said Emily Rochon, global energy strategist at Greenpeace International. “The IEA is catching up on renewable energy trends, but it is still failing to see the full potential of change. We believe that with the right level of policy support, the world can deliver 100% renewable energy for all by 2050.” Birol said the IEA’s previous forecasts for hydropower and wind power had been correct and that solar projections were based on the government support existing at the time. “If the policies change, the numbers will change as well,” he said. “They may need to be revised [upwards] next year. I hope so.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2015/oct/22/solar-power-energy-africa-low-carbon-campaign-kofi-annan-bob-geldof-richard-branson","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-22T13:38:14Z","webTitle":"Solar power to light the way for Africa as low-carbon campaign launches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/oct/22/solar-power-energy-africa-low-carbon-campaign-kofi-annan-bob-geldof-richard-branson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/oct/22/solar-power-energy-africa-low-carbon-campaign-kofi-annan-bob-geldof-richard-branson","fields":{"headline":"Solar power to light the way for Africa as low-carbon campaign launches","bodyText":"Kofi Annan, Bob Geldof, Richard Branson and international business leaders have joined politicians from 14 African countries to launch a global campaign to bring solar power to the 620 million people on the continent who must still use kerosene, candles and wood to light their homes and cook. A dramatic fall in the cost of solar power, combined with growing access to mobile phones, has given Africa the chance to leapfrog richer countries’ polluting energy sources and to kickstart business, said Annan, chairman of the Africa progress panel and former UN secretary general. “[Lack of access to electricity] is an injustice that robs millions of our fellow citizens of the dignity, opportunity and freedom that comes with access to modern energy. At present rates of progress, 300 million people in Africa will still lack electricity by 2040. This is intolerable, avoidable and profoundly unfair,” said Annan. “It leaves the world’s poorest people to pay the world’s highest prices for power. Households are losing out as a result of higher prices, investors are losing out on market opportunities and countries are losing out from failure to harness productive technologies and broaden their development base.” Annan said that Africa did not have to follow the carbon-intensive pathway and energy practices of the rich countries and emerging countries that have brought the world to the brink of catastrophe. “The UN climate change conference in Paris must draw a line in the sand. Major emitting countries should seize the opportunity to put in place credible carbon pricing and taxation systems and to stop wasting billions on fossil fuel subsidies … we must now come together to break the deadly interaction between poverty and unsustainable energy systems.” On Wednesday, Nigeria and Sierra Leone signed agreements with Britain to fast-track off-grid solar power to households. A further 12 countries, including Malawi, Senegal and Tanzania, are expected to join the Energy Africa alliance shortly. “Ten years ago this was not possible. Now it can be turned round easily. The lower costs of solar power have made this possible. Nigeria has 96 million people without access to electricity. Most use kerosene. The default energy source should be solar. That was not available 10 years ago. Now it is,” said the Nigerian vice-president Yemi Osinbajo. Geldof said that mobile phones allowed people even in remote communities to pay for solar electricity as and when they required it. “We needed technologies to exist before you could electrify a continent and with the advent of this thing we all have in our pocket it makes this doable. This is the moment when Africa switches on, powers up and goes for it.” Without contributing money at this stage, Britain has pledged to use its offices throughout Africa to help cut red tape, unlock new sources of finance and promote policies to expand household-level solar electricity. It plans to work with donors, investors and lenders, industry and NGO groups, said the international development minister Grant Shapps. “Energy Africa is a new way of delivering aid. It is about using our influence, getting the commercial markets to work for some of the poorest people in the world. This is about more than switching on lights. It means that the day doesn’t end when the sun goes down … it means not having to walk to town when you want to charge your phone … it means saving money because kerosene is one of the most expensive fuels in the world … It means not giving birth by candlelight,” said Shapps. Branson, who has worked to develop solar power in Caribbean countries and is planning to invest in a number of solar projects in Africa, said: “Energy poverty and economic poverty are two sides of the same coin. Access to sustainable energy like solar can change all that. It fuels entrepreneurship, it boosts educational opportunities and it’s an incredible source of women’s empowerment. “Solar is also good for business, and is set to take off around the world. As a businessman I view this transition not as a burden but as a historic opportunity, and I feel strongly that universal access to clean, renewable sources of energy can be achieved in our lifetime – even in this generation.” Kevin Watkins, director of the Overseas Development Institute, added: “Just a few weeks ago governments adopted a new set of development goals, including a pledge to deliver universal access to energy by 2030. Yet on current trends there will still be some 500 million people in Africa without access to modern energy. “Africa’s energy access crisis is holding back growth and keeping people in poverty. It is also one of the greatest market failures of our day. Renewable energy technologies are affordable and accessible – and Africa has some of the world’s richest and least tapped sources of solar energy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/feb/03/measuring-ocean-heating-is-fundamentally-important-to-track-global-warming","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-03T11:00:03Z","webTitle":"Measuring ocean heating is key to tracking global warming | John Abraham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/feb/03/measuring-ocean-heating-is-fundamentally-important-to-track-global-warming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/feb/03/measuring-ocean-heating-is-fundamentally-important-to-track-global-warming","fields":{"headline":"Measuring ocean heating is key to tracking global warming","bodyText":"Human emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are causing the Earth to warm. We know this, and we have known about the heat-trapping nature of these gases for over 100 years. But scientists want to know how fast the Earth is warming and how much extra energy is being added to the climate because of human activities. If you want to know about global warming and its future effects, you really need to answer these questions. Whether this year was hotter than last year or whether next year breaks a new record are merely one symptom of a warming world. Sure, we expect records to be broken, but they are not the most compelling evidence. The most compelling evidence we have that global warming is happening is that we can measure how much extra heat comes in to the Earth’s climate system each year. Think of it like a bank account. Money comes in and money goes out each month. At the end of the month, do you have more funds than at the beginning? That is the global warming analogy. Each year, do we have more or less energy in the system compared to the prior year? The answer to this question is clear, unassailable and unequivocal: the Earth is warming because the energy is increasing. We know this because the heat shows up in our measurements, mainly in the oceans. Indeed the oceans take up more than 92% of the extra heat. The rest goes into melting Arctic sea ice, land ice, and warming the land and atmosphere. Accordingly, to measure global warming, we have to measure ocean warming. Results for 2015 were recently published by Noaa and are available here. A recent paper by Karina von Schuckmann and her colleagues appeared in Nature Climate Change, and provides an excellent summary of our knowledge of the energy balance of the Earth and recent advances that have been made. The article describes the complexity of the situation. The Earth is continuously gaining energy from greenhouse gases, but there are also natural fluctuations that cause both increases and decreases to the energy flows. For instance, volcanic eruptions may temporarily reflect some solar energy back to space. Natural variability like the El Niño/La Niña cycle can change heat flows and how deep the heat is buried in the ocean. The energy from the sun isn’t constant either; it varies on an 11-year cycle, but by less than 0.01%. With all of this and more happening, how do we know if an energy imbalance is natural or human caused? How do we separate these effects? The effort to separate human from natural effects is seen to be possible when one considers how the imbalance is measured in the first place. There are multiple complementary ways to make these measurements. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages and they have to be considered together. One way is through satellites that orbit the Earth. These satellites can measure the heat entering the atmosphere and the heat leaving the system. The difference between them is the imbalance. Currently, the longest operating satellite measurement for this is from Nasa and is named Ceres (Clouds and Earth’s Radiation Energy System). The difficulty is that the energy imbalance is only about 0.1% of the actual energy flows in and out, and while the changes can be tracked, their exact values are uncertain. Another way to measure the imbalance is to actually take the ocean’s temperature. Temperature tells us how much heat a system has. If the temperature is increasing, it means the energy within the system is increasing as well – the system is out of balance. Not only do we have to measure the ocean temperatures accurately, but there is a need to measure the temperatures year after year after year exceedingly accurately to much better than a 0.1°C margin. What really matters is how the temperature is changing over long periods of time. While it may sound easy to measure the oceans, it is actually quite challenging. The oceans are huge (and deep) and difficult to access. The need is for enough measurement locations at enough depths and with enough precision to get an accurate temperature. In recent years, we have relied upon a system of automated ocean measurement devices called the Argo fleet. These devices are scattered across the globe and they autonomously rise and sink (down to 2,000 meters) and record temperatures and salinity during their travels. Because of the Argo fleet, we know a lot more about our oceans, and this new knowledge helps us ask better questions. But the fleet could be made even better. They do not measure the bottom half of the ocean (below 2,000m depth) and they do not fully cover regions near or under ice or near shores. Furthermore, a 10-year trend is much too short to make long-term climate conclusions. We have to stitch Argo temperatures to other instruments, which have been measuring the oceans for decades. That stitching process has to be done carefully so that a false cooling or warming trend is not introduced. Another way is through ocean levels. As the oceans warm, the water expands and sea levels rise. So, just by measuring the changing water levels, it is possible to assess how much heat the oceans are absorbing. The drawback to this method is that oceans are also rising because ice around with world is melting, particularly in Greenland and Antarctica. As this melted ice water flows into the oceans, it too causes sea levels to rise. So, it’s important to separate how much of ocean level rise is from heat-expansion and how much is from ice melting. And another way is through the use of climate models, which are computer simulations of the environment. Very powerful computers are used to calculate the state of the climate at millions of locations across the globe, in both the oceans and in the atmosphere. The calculations use basic physics and thermodynamics equations to track the thermal energy at each of the locations. So, there are many ways to measure the Earth’s energy imbalance. While all methods are telling us the Earth has a fever, they differ in details and better synthesis of all the information is essential to improve the knowledge of what Earth’s energy imbalance is. Right now, the Earth is gaining perhaps as much as 1 Watt of heat (a Joule per second) for every square meter of surface area. Considering how large the Earth is, this is an incredible amount of heat being gained day and night year after year. This is over 1 zettaJoules (sextillion Joules) per year. What I like about this new paper is the recommendations for the future. Perhaps the most important recommendation is that we need to continue to make accurate measurements of the Earth’s temperatures, especially in the oceans. We need to extend those temperate measurements to deeper locations (below 2,000 m) and make measurements near shores, in the Polar Regions, underneath ice, etc. This will require a sustained funding of our measurement systems and a long-term view of the Earth’s changing climate. Fully understanding where the excess heat is going in the Earth system is a first step to making good predictions as to what its consequences are for the future climate and the oceans. It is an essential activity to enable planning for the future. Dr von Schuckmann summarized her work nicely when she told me, Advancing our capability to monitor the Earth’s Energy Imbalance means increasing our knowledge on the status of global climate change - and the global ocean plays a crucial role. A concerted multi-disciplinary and international effort is needed to improve our ability to monitor this fundamental metric defining global warming."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2016/jan/31/google-uk-tax-deal-stretches-patience-osborne","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-31T09:00:04Z","webTitle":"Google’s low tax rate stretches our patience,  and Osborne’s crowing stretches credulity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/31/google-uk-tax-deal-stretches-patience-osborne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2016/jan/31/google-uk-tax-deal-stretches-patience-osborne","fields":{"headline":"Google’s low tax rate stretches our patience,  and Osborne’s crowing stretches credulity","bodyText":"First, the case for the defence. It is not true that Google pays UK corporation tax at a rate of only 3%. That is not possible. Corporation tax, currently 20%, is the same for all companies. Nor is it true that Google paid no tax at all before the settlement earlier this month with HM Revenue &amp; Customs. Google UK’s accounts show a £20m tax payment in 2013, for example. The bill for back taxes of £130m, covering the past 10 years, arises from an audit by HMRC that was started in 2009. And, finally, the company’s statement that it “complies with the law” is 100% accurate. It now has a stamp of approval from HMRC to demonstrate as much. So should we all just calm down? Absolutely not. What the Google affair reveals is the gaping holes in the tax system and the opportunities for companies, especially digital operators, to shift revenues and royalties – and thus profits – around the globe to their enormous advantage. The tax authorities are feeble policeman, using bicycles to pursue Ferraris. And HMRC’s own feebleness – or unwillingness – when it comes to testing the limits of tax principles conceived in another age is another factor. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, used a different analogy when announcing an inquiry into UK tax policy. He said: “The complexity of tax law is turning what should be a straightforward principle – that everybody should pay the correct amount of tax – in to a piece of elastic.” He’s right. Google’s elastic works this way. The company earns revenues from UK advertisers of about £4bn. If one applies a 25% profit margin – which is roughly what the company achieves globally – it makes a UK profit, as most people would think of the term, of about £1bn. But that’s before the adjustments. First, there is a payment to Google US for using the software that powers the search engine. Second, most of the revenue from UK advertisers is booked in Ireland because, you see, one of Google UK’s core activities is “the provision of marketing services to Google Ireland Limited”. In this way, a theoretical annual UK tax bill of about £200m magically drops to about £30m. That is why 3% – £30m from a notional profit of £1bn – is as good an estimate as any of Google’s effective tax rate. Transfers to the US parent are understandable, it should be said. The software was invented in the US and the UK expects royalties to flow homewards when a British company sells oversees. But the lack of transparency is infuriating. How can HMRC determine a fair rate for US payments? As for Google’s Irish manoeuvre, it looks like a contortion. Yes, the EU single market rules allow companies to structure themselves this way. And, yes, HMRC agreed that Google does not have a “permanent establishment” in the UK. But, come on, the tech giant has 2,300 employees in the UK, and they earned an average of £160,000 each last year. It has three shiny offices in London and is planning a new one, longer than the Shard is high, at King’s Cross. To the rest of the taxpaying public, that’s a permanent presence. Intriguingly, even HMRC, before it accepted the Irish shuffle, seems to have wrung one small concession from Google. It wanted a portion of the profit to be shifted to the UK to reflect the UK’s status as Google’s second-biggest market. But what was this sum, and how was it calculated? And what profit margin does HMRC judge fair when Google UK provides its “marketing services” to Google Ireland? All is clouded in the fog of “taxpayer confidentiality”. It is ridiculous, therefore, for George Osborne to claim “a major success” if he can’t provide the supporting arithmetic and the methodology. If the chancellor meant to say “this was the best we could do”, he should explain what he intends to do about the footloose digital companies, armed as they are with skilled tax advisers, who have the potential to undermine the UK’s tax base. Attempting to spin this out of a political hole – and from the rich men’s club in Davos, for heaven’s sake – insults the intelligence of other taxpayers. Green should be the new black That the government should step in with £250m to help ailing Aberdeen, the centre of Britain’s oil and gas industry, seems right given the billions in tax revenues ministers have extracted from the North Sea over several decades. And though it might seem counterintuitive to come to the rescue of a city built on fossil fuels – given the threat of global warming – it also makes sense for Britain to keep producing its own oil and gas until it can find ways of doing without them. But the reality is that the £250m “city deal” from David Cameron, topped up with £254m from Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon – will do little to stem the crisis that has left oil workers in the city using food banks. Around 70,000 redundancies have already been made across the British oil and gas industry, and more will follow, given that the price of oil has fallen from $115 a barrel to $30 in a little over 18 months. North Sea exploration and development drilling has dropped to a trickle, leaving rigs and other equipment laid up or moved elsewhere. The danger is that the North Sea becomes the Dead Sea, with business not returning even though there is plenty of oil and gas still under the waves. Some of the government cash will be used to find ways to extract small reserves profitably, before platforms and pipelines are abandoned. The oil price collapse has thrown Aberdeen into turmoil, but its decline has long been in sight. Ministers should have made the North Sea’s twilight years productive but transitional. A lot will depend on tax rates, which are already being cut. International companies make up the bulk of the North Sea operators, and they will stick around only if it is worth their while. This inevitably sticks in the craw of environmentalists, who see ministers rushing to the aid of Big Oil while slashing support for wind and solar energy, as well as ending carbon, capture and storage projects. Ultimately the future of Britain’s energy should be green, not black. We need to find a new Aberdeen where low-carbon technologies are celebrated – and financed properly. Overloaded at Sky? There is no doubt that Sky needs a strong deputy chairman after the reappointment of James Murdoch as chairman four years after he was forced to quit the job during the phone-hacking scandal. Investors who own the 41% of the shares not owned by 21st Century Fox, which Murdoch runs and which is 40% controlled by his father Rupert, will want to know their interests are being protected in the boardroom. Martin Gilbert, Sky’s choice for the job, has substantial experience and he is chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management, the fund management group that has in the past voted against Murdoch’s election to the BSkyB board. But herein lies a problem: Gilbert is under big pressure to improve things at his own company. Clients are withdrawing cash and its shares have fallen from 435p a year ago to 246p. Not an obviously good time to be taking on another company’s battles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/nov/25/paris-climate-talks-past-failures-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-25T12:00:01Z","webTitle":"US predicts Paris climate talks will benefit from lessons of past mistakes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/25/paris-climate-talks-past-failures-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/25/paris-climate-talks-past-failures-deal","fields":{"headline":"US predicts Paris climate talks will benefit from lessons of past mistakes","bodyText":"Lessons from past failures will help push nations towards a robust climate change agreement that will push down greenhouse gas emissions, the White House has predicted. The US has promised to take a leadership role during next week’s talks in Paris, with Barack Obama arriving on Sunday night for a number of high-level meetings designed to spur early momentum. The UN talks start on Monday and will run until 11 December, with 138 heads of state expected to attend. Obama will hold a bilateral meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping on Monday morning that will send a “strong message to the world of their shared commitment to combat climate change and see a strong agreement reached”, according to Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications at the White House. Following the meeting between the world’s two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, the US president will have one-on-one dialogues with French president François Hollande and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi. The following day, Obama will meet with leaders of low-lying island nations, such as the Marshall Islands and Kiribati, that are particularly vulnerable to climate change and are keen to see wealthy nations part with the $100bn in climate finance promised at the 2009 Copenhagen talks. He will then return to the US. White House officials said that the president was determined to show leadership on the issue of climate change as it posed a “clear and present threat” to US national security and an “existential challenge” to developing nations that will bear the brunt of extreme weather events and food insecurity caused by warming temperatures. Rhodes said the Paris talks will be approached differently to Copenhagen, which is widely viewed as a hastily patched-together failure. “By the time [Obama arrived in Copenhagen] things had already unravelled and then had to be put back together,” he said. “The goal here is to give a push with heads of state at the beginning of the process and then allow [secretary of state John] Kerry and others to finalise the details.” The White House anticipates the talks will help meet an internationally agreed target of keeping global warming below a 2C compared with pre-industrial times, even though current emissions reduction pledges amount to warming of around 2.7C. Periodic reviews of emissions cuts beyond Paris will help meet this goal, officials said. “The stars are more aligned to reach agreement than I have ever seen before,” said Todd Stern, the US chief negotiator. “There is no comparison between Paris and Copenhagen in 2009. We have this opportunity, this moment. Countries are going to have to be willing to depart from some of their fixed positions to seek common good. We can get this done. We will get his done.” Stern, the US’s long-standing special envoy on climate change, said that he envisaged “normal” problems over striking a deal in Paris that was fair to all countries and which reflected different countries’ abilities to make emissions cuts. “We have a situation where 60-65% of emissions come from developing countries,” he said. “That’s a good thing. It means that developing countries are developing. But you cannot solve climate change on the back of the 35%. “You cannot ask countries to act in ways that are inconsistent with their growth imperatives. Countries need to act in a way that they think they can manage. We can’t just say to developed countries that ‘this is your burden’.” White House officials said they are consulting members of the Republican-controlled US Congress over the talks but would not be drawn on whether the Paris agreement will need approval from the Senate, as treaties normally do. Kerry has said that the mix of binding and non-binding elements of the deal – emissions cuts will require “transparency and accountability” but will not be legally binding according to the White House – means it doesn’t fit the standard definition of a treaty. In a bid to generate further momentum for the Paris talks, the White House announced on Monday that federal agencies will further slash their own output of greenhouse gases. The US government, one of the largest emitters in the country, now has an emissions reduction target of 41.8% from 2008 levels by 2025. This target, a slight upgrade on targets first announced in March, will encompass the 360,000 buildings and 650,000 fleet vehicles operated by US government agencies. Nasa will invest in renewable energy and will cut energy consumption at the Johnson Space Center in Houston by 17% through a new heat and power system. Other actions include a cut in petrol use by the Department of Homeland Security and an expanded solar energy array for the Department of Energy. However, Obama’s Republican opponents in Congress continue to oppose key elements of the US’s plan to tackle climate change, as well as providing climate finance for developing countries. A senior Republican figure has also launched a campaign against the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the federal agency that tracks the weather and climate. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House science committee, has demanded internal correspondence from Noaa in a bid to reveal what he believes is a conspiracy to alter climate data to support Obama’s agenda. Smith has focused upon a study published in the journal Science, authored by Noaa scientists, that challenges the theory among some climate science sceptics that there has been a “pause” in the rise in global temperatures. Kathryn Sullivan, Noaa’s administrator, has refused to hand over the correspondence and has written to Smith to state: “I have not or will not allow anyone to manipulate the science or coerce the scientists who work for me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2016/jan/29/uae-banks-on-rainmakers-to-secure-future-water-supply","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-29T07:00:08Z","webTitle":"UAE banks on 'rainmakers' to secure future water supply","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/29/uae-banks-on-rainmakers-to-secure-future-water-supply","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2016/jan/29/uae-banks-on-rainmakers-to-secure-future-water-supply","fields":{"headline":"UAE banks on 'rainmakers' to secure future water supply","bodyText":"On a winter morning in one of the world’s driest and most water-stressed countries, meteorologist Sufian Khaled Farrah watched on the Doppler radar screen as a cold, wet front scudded across the Gulf – and quickly called air traffic controllers. Over the next 15 hours, six twin-engine planes took off from an airfield in Al Ain, on the eastern edge of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and flew repeatedly into the clouds, firing off 162 flares loaded with tiny particles of potassium chloride and sodium chloride – table salt. By the end of Farrah’s shift at the National Centre of Meteorology and Seismology, a light drizzle was falling across much of the UAE. Farrah had made it rain. With the Gulf region confronting an even hotter, drier future under climate change – potentially testing the limits of human endurance – the UAE’s leadership is hoping to secure the country’s water supply by wringing more moisture out of the clouds. The UAE this month launched an international research prize for weather modification, awarding a first tranche of $5m to researchers from Germany, Japan and the UAE. “There are many techniques to secure water resources,” said Masataka Murakami, of Nagoya University’s Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, who will lead one of the research teams. “But only precipitation enhancement can produce a lot of water for industrial use, irrigation etc cheaply.” Such claims hold a lot of promise for the UAE. The country receives less than 100mm rainfall a year, and much of that is lost to evaporation because of extreme heat. Winter rains, like the one Farrah was involved with, are especially rare. But the country – despite having such natural scarcity – is also one of the world’s biggest per capita consumers of water. Farmers still rely on flood irrigation, pumping out so much water the ground is sinking in some parts of the country. An expanding urban population with a taste for water parks, golf courses, and lush green landscaping is also rapidly draining groundwater reserves. Over the next three years, Murakami’s team will deploy sensors and algorithms to identify the most promising clouds. A German team, led by Professor Volker Wulfmeyer of the University of Hohenheim, will study how winds and topography affect cloud formation and movement. Linda Zou will lead a team of researchers from the UAE’s Masdar Institute of Science and Technology using nanotechnology to increase water condensation within the cloud. Other options under consideration by a water-strapped government include boosting the efficiency of the desalination plants that produce fresh water from the sea, importing icebergs and water trading. But weather modification historically has been the favoured course. Since the 1990s, the UAE has invested heavily in weather modification operations, working with Nasa and private US companies to try to boost rainfall and replenish dwindling groundwater supplies. On good days, the cloud-busting operations manage to squeeze an extra 15% of rainfall out of the clouds, Farrah said. The country’s record was 35% above the expected rainfall, he said. “It is expensive but compared to desalination plants it is very, very cheap,” Farrah said. However, those numbers could not be independently verified and are much higher than those recorded by scientists engaged in weather modification operations elsewhere. Murakami said that with additional research such operations could prove even more productive. “The work we do today isn’t like the old cloud seeding. This is more advanced, and more involved in finding solutions in the way that nature works,” he said. But water experts remain unconvinced. In the 60 years governments and private companies around the world have been trying to alter the weather, it is still impossible to conjure clouds from a clear blue sky. And there is no reliable way to gauge the effectiveness of their operations – since those clouds might have produced rain anyway, scientists said. “Weather modification is a pretty sketchy option anywhere but it is really hard to wring moisture out of the atmosphere when it isn’t even there,” said Peter Gleick, a US water scientist and founder of Pacific Institute in California, who was invited by the royal family to deliver a lecture in Abu Dhabi in 2011. The UAE poses its own particular challenges, said Roelof Bruintjes, a weather modification expert at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Colorado. Bruintjes spent four years trying to increase the rain potential of the UAE in the early 1990s, using radar and aircraft. But researchers found that the clouds were to some extent already being artificially stimulated by dust from the surrounding desert, and pollution from the oil industry. As the researchers soon discovered, there was little more moisture to be wrung from the clouds. “One of the things that we found was that, in general, it’s hard to modify those clouds,” he said. “It’s already being seeded naturally.” Bruintjes said he was “doubtful” that a new generation of researchers would be able to crack open the clouds. But he added: “let the science take its course. Maybe they will find something we didn’t.” And he went on, the UAE does not have a lot of options. By mid-century, the country will be desperately short of water, and the costs of running the desalination plants to secure its supply are already prohibitively expensive. The plants, powered by fossil fuels, suck up huge amounts of sea water and energy, accounting for about 20% of the country’s entire electricity supply. With oil prices below $30 a barrel, and the UAE reduced to a net importer of gas because of rising domestic use, the authorities acknowledge dependence on desalination plants is a luxury even oil-rich Gulf countries can no longer afford. “Our arid climate makes us dependent on energy-intensive desalination,” Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, the UAE special envoy for energy and climate change, said in announcing the award. “This is not sustainable nor is it desirable.” The country is building six desalination plants including a pilot project at Ghantoot that will seek to cut electricity use by 25%. Masdar, the state-owned renewable energy company that owns the Ghantoot project, is looking at powering the plant with solar energy, instead of oil and gas. Such energy-saving moves are critical to an increasingly water-stressed future, said Dr Nawal Al-Hosany, Masdar’s director of sustainability. “When it comes to desalination it is a very expensive exercise,” she said. “We are trying to work with our partners to find innovative ways to improve the efficiency of our desalination plants.” The UAE is also moving – slowly – towards conservation. Abu Dhabi this month for the first time began charging Emirati households for water use, and raised fees on expatriates. A number of hotels have began reusing water for flushing toilets and landscaping. There are plans to expand water reuse. But it would take a lot more than some some fat rain clouds and the sporadic embrace of water conservation to guarantee the UAE’s water security, Gleick said. “They have very little water. They can make as much as they want from the Gulf – but that’s at a high cost,” he said. It was time, he said, for the UAE to have a “serious conversation” about what they were really using their limited water for. “They are in a really tough spot.” Suzanne Goldenberg’s trip to the UAE was funded by the International Renewable Energy Agency"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2014/oct/25/what-im-really-thinking-the-fracker","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2014-10-25T05:00:19Z","webTitle":"What I’m really thinking: the fracker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/25/what-im-really-thinking-the-fracker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/25/what-im-really-thinking-the-fracker","fields":{"headline":"What I’m really thinking: the fracker","bodyText":"I’m reluctant to say what I do when I’m introduced at parties.

No 9: UN Development Programme","bodyText":"Alongside its better-known sister agencies, the UNDP may seem a dull workhorse, lacking the star quality of Unicef or the World Food Programme. Perhaps that’s because its remit – supporting democratic governance, poverty reduction, crisis prevention, improving resilience and strengthening earnings – is too all-encompassing to lend itself to the kind of catchy slogans that might capture the public’s imagination. The UNDP prides itself on its “thought leadership” – not a particularly poster-friendly concept. The UNDP has an annual budget of about $5bn and works in about 170 countries. Its programmes are diverse to say the least: solar energy projects in Mali; helping Liberia prepare for the the election of Africa’s first woman president in 2005; empowering women in Somalia; employing young people in the Central African Republic to repair roads in an attempt to end the vicious sectarian violence that has claimed thousands of lives since 2013; and making sure staff battling Ebola in west Africa this year were paid. Last year, the UNDP says it created nearly 1m jobs in low-income communities. It says it helped to register 18 million new voters worldwide. It helped ensure that antiviral medication was provided to 1.4 million people infected with HIV/Aids. It is also big on data – again, not a crowd pleaser but ever more important as the world embarks on a new development agenda that will be worth little if the indicators to measure progress do not work. The UNDP’s annual human development report, and the accompanying index, are baseline tools for those working in development. While you may not be familiar with the UNDP, you will perhaps recognise its administrator, Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand who has been tipped as a successor to secretary general Ban Ki-moon when he steps down in 2016. She is the UN’s third highest ranking official. Clark, who has argued that the UN “has to be made to work” and suggests that the 70th anniversary of the body’s creation this year might be a good time to think about change, has also trimmed the UNDP. Staff positions at the New York headquarters are being reduced by around 30%, with more staff moving out to regional hubs. The agency has around 6,500 employees. The UNDP also coordinates international and national efforts to achieve the millennium development goals, which expire this year. So it will need to be lean and mean if it is to do the same with the more ambitious post-2015 development agenda, comprising 17 goals and 169 targets.

Frustrated at the poor wages and insecurity, he paid a human resources agent a hefty sum to travel to the United Arab Emirates to work. But when he reached Dubai, he didn’t get the carpenter job he was promised. Detained for working illegally and deported back to Nepal, Karki was faced with more troubles: no job, a family of six to take care of, and the social stigma of returning from abroad without having earned any money. “I was almost depressed,” he says. The Micro-Enterprise Development Programme (MEDEP), a poverty reduction project run by the government of Nepal and the UNDP, helped him set up a small business. Karki now employs five people at his furniture factory in Namdu, some 100 miles from the capital, and his products have found markets as far away as Kathmandu. “I had carpentry skills but had no idea about entrepreneurship, loan facilities and market linkages. MEDEP helped me realise the potential of starting up an enterprise in which I could work, as well as own an enterprise,” Karki said. Now we want to hear from you.

The plan, to be unveiled on Tuesday in Baltimore, follows dozens of new initiatives rolled out by the White House since the start of the year to signal Barack Obama’s commitment to act on climate change – even in the face of Republican opposition. America is in the midst of a rooftop solar boom – with installation up 139,000% in the last decade, because of falling costs. But only about 1% of the electricity moving along America’s grid comes from solar, and nearly half of all US households are shut out of solar, because they are renters or their properties are too small to install panels, White House officials told a conference call with reporters. “We think it’s important for everybody to have access to solar energy,” Brian Deese, a senior White House adviser, told reporters. In the new solar initiative, the White House said it wanted to make rooftop solar panels more affordable and open up new jobs in inner-city neighbourhoods. Officials said they would work with housing authorities and solar companies in 20 states to improve financing packages. The new initiative – the second move by Obama to expand solar since April – aimed to install 300 megawatts of solar power in subsidised housing by 2020, officials told the call. That’s just over half as much energy as generated by the big solar farm in the Mojave desert – one of the first big solar projects backed by Obama, which went into operation earlier this year. But it represents a tripling of Obama’s initial target to install 100 megawatts of rooftop solar in subsidised housing by 2020 – a goal that has already been reached thanks to falling prices for solar panels. “The curve is really spiking up because the costs are coming down,” Deese said. Obama last April announced plans to train up to 75,000 new solar industry workers. Tuesday’s initiative is the latest in a growing series of actions intended to demonstrate to the international community that Obama remains focused on climate change, ahead of a critical set of negotiations for a global warming deal in Paris at the end of the year. Those efforts are going to take a hit as a Republican-controlled Congress returns to work after the Fourth of July holiday, with hearings in the House and Senate challenging the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to cut carbon pollution from power plants and the Obama administration’s focus on climate change as a security issue. The move also suggests a pivot for Obama from large-scale solar farms to rooftop solar. When Obama entered the White House in 2009, there were no large-scale solar farms. Now there are 17, funded by Department of Energy loan guarantees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"cities/2016/feb/25/blackout-blues-the-lagos-nigeria-suburbs-that-have-been-in-darkness-for-five-years","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-25T16:28:41Z","webTitle":"Lagos's blackout nightmare: the suburb that's been in darkness for five years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/feb/25/blackout-blues-the-lagos-nigeria-suburbs-that-have-been-in-darkness-for-five-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2016/feb/25/blackout-blues-the-lagos-nigeria-suburbs-that-have-been-in-darkness-for-five-years","fields":{"headline":"Lagos's blackout nightmare: the suburb that's been in darkness for five years","bodyText":"When the electric transformer in his neighbourhood was vandalised five years ago, Akinnuoye Olagunju, then 21, didn’t think they would never have power again. Officials from the energy utility demanded that his father, as well as each of the 2,000 or so people in Oreta, pay a communal bribe to repair the damage: 2,000 naira ($10) each, a lot of money in this sleepy and impoverished fishing village. They refused. Five years later, the power is still off. Olagunju eventually moved out of his family house. “The heat was too much,” he says, now 27, and an official of the Lagos State Traffic Management Agency. “Everyone was having rashes and the NEPA people [energy officials] refused to come and fix anther one for free.” Oreta sits off the lagoon in Ikorodu, a suburb of Lagos. Distant from the city centre, it receives little government attention or policing. Residents rely on mini generators, rechargeable torches and the lights from their mobile phones. What’s worse is at night, under cover of darkness, “land grabbers” – young men who use physical intimidation to muscle into construction projects, extort scared residents and even sell land they don’t own – move in to squat and vandalise properties. Olagunju is one of the millions of people in Lagos whose collective power needs have effectively overwhelmed the grid – despite the fact that Nigeria is, by far, the largest oil producer in Africa. Even in parts of the city that are connected to the grid, power outages are regular and random. Many middle class families own an inverter; poorer Lagosians, like many of those in Ikorodu, resort to minuscule “I-pass-my-neighbour generators”, so called because they give the owners an illusion of superiority over their fellow residents, though a single tank can power a small household for only about three hours. Some neighbourhoods have never even been on the grid – including parts of Ibeju Lekki, a suburb to the east of the posh island districts that is home to some 117,481 people, according to the 2006 census. It’s a working class commuter district, with some farming and fishing, and where the constant droning of generators is a familiar sound. And if the generator breaks, or you run out of money to power it? Olawale Adetula, a 30-year-old media strategist who lives in Yaba, once slept the whole night in his car with the air conditioning on. “What do you do when it’s 30C at 11pm, you haven’t had power for days … and your generator decides to pack up?” Adetula asks. “Oh and you have a career-defining meeting at 8am the next morning? Your car becomes your bedroom for the night.” Things got so bad that the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) was nicknamed “Never Expect Power Always, Please Light Candle” by frustrated citizens. The government tackled this problem by renaming it the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), as a first step towards unbundling and privatising it. In 2013, the PHCN’s distribution and generation arms were privatised. Babatunde Fashola, the former governor of Lagos who is now the federal minister of works, power and housing, also commissioned five power plants in six years, and Lagos state is also home to Egbin power plant, Nigeria’s largest. Yet the power still goes out daily. Some blame the deteriorating infrastructure, which wasn’t privatised. Others such as Eyo Ekpo, a former commissioner with the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), say it’s a matter of demand outstripping supply. “Privatisation was never sold as, nor is it meant to be, some kind of silver bullet that solves all problems overnight,” Ekpo says. “Unfortunately, very few are willing to appreciate the time it takes both to go through any reform process and to build heavy engineering infrastructure such as gas pipelines, power plants, transmission lines, towers and substations. It is part of a reform programme that, as with all infrastructure sector reform programmes, requires time, competent execution, private sector finance and strong, properly focused political will to ensure success.” But many argue that perverse government regulations restrict new entrants into Nigeria’s cosy energy market. A source at a transparency organisation with knowledge of the energy industry says: “The electricity regulations make it difficult for new entrants to set up large power plants. If the highest they can generate is, for example, 10MW, then it must all be bought by one [industrial] customer. For example, if Unilever and PZ are in the same area and each require 5MW daily, you can’t build one power station of 10MW and sell to both of them.” The stated aim is to prevent “proliferation”, but it is likely that the regulators are simply aiming to ensure that only their cronies get licenses and profit. Either way, the gaps don’t get plugged. The consequences for the health, income and livelihood of Lagosians are far-reaching. “I have had to spend a lot of money in getting an inverter to reduce what I spend on fuel for my generator,” says Osikhena Dirisu, a radio personality at the popular Beat FM, who lives in one of the estates next to the headquarters of Chevron. “The inverter is noiseless and cost effective, because I was spending an average of 8,000 to 10,000 naira monthly on fuel.” The Beat FM joined telecommunications giant MTN in shutting down entirely for several hours during a fuel drought in May 2015. MTN, which boasts 62 million subscribers, spends a shocking 70% of its operating expenditure on diesel, more than 10m litres a month. The situation is also frustrating for young entrepreneurs, says Kelechi Ibekwe, a 22-year-old animator. “Light is a crucial part of my work and basically my house is my workspace. There’s this new policy of light from 7pm to 7am in my area, and that puts a strain on me – because from 7am to 7pm, my most productive hours, I’ll have to do something else. My work involves about 30-plus hours of non-stop computer activity. There isn’t light for 12 so we have to run our generator for six-plus hours a day.” Necessity breeds innovation. Boluwatife Soloye, a 22-year-old model, recalls one day in secondary school. “I always left things until the last minute, and so I assumed I’d be able to iron in the morning – but when I woke up, there was no electricity. I panicked and started brainstorming. Eventually, I took an old iron in the house, placed it on the gas cooker and used it to iron. I had to wipe, iron, replace on cooker, repeat.” The new governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, has vowed to fix the problem. His Light Up Lagos project aims to ensure 24-hour uninterrupted power supply to the whole city within two years. He also promised street lighting for all the city’s roads by December 2015. Although some roads remain unlit, there has been real progress, including the illumination of the Third Mainland Bridge, the most travelled in the country. But the 67 communities of Ibeju Lekki that have been in darkness for five years have yet to be connected to the national grid – though plans by Aliko Dangote, Africa’s richest man, to build a $9bn refinery nearby should encourage the effort. In the vacuum, private corporations have seen an opportunity. Mobile phone manufacturer Tecno installed a series of solar energy-powered streetlights in Computer Village, the IT hub on the mainland district; American rapper Akon has been the public face of a solar-powered football pitch project, sponsored by Shell. There is skepticism, however, that these initiatives are anything more than publicity stunts. Neither businesses nor individuals care who provides the power, as long as someone eventually does. Motunrayo Gomez, a communications employee, describes how her brother decided to splurge on solar panels the day after mistakenly spicing his soup with kerosene while cooking by torch during a blackout. “It was one of those periods of fuel scarcity, where a bachelor’s hungry stomach cannot wait for light to return,” Gomez says. “It was funny and sad at the time, but this is Lagos.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/dec/20/dark-christmas-mark-group-1000-axed-staff-solar-panel-company-leicester","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-20T17:34:44Z","webTitle":"Dark Christmas ahead for nearly 1,000 axed staff of solar panel company","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/20/dark-christmas-mark-group-1000-axed-staff-solar-panel-company-leicester","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/dec/20/dark-christmas-mark-group-1000-axed-staff-solar-panel-company-leicester","fields":{"headline":"Dark Christmas ahead for nearly 1,000 axed staff of solar panel company","bodyText":"The Christmas tree in the reception of what used to be Mark Group, an energy company with more than 1,000 staff, looks jaunty enough but underneath it there are barely a handful of presents. “They’re fake,” confides one of the few remaining staff. It is a grim reminder of the hardship being faced by hundreds of people who lost their jobs when the company went into administration in October. George Baker, 27, a thermographer, was part of a team analysing thermal images of homes to see how much energy they were wasting. The cost of Christmas presents for his two daughters, aged three and six, will come from his jobseeker’s allowance and his partner’s part-time wage, with support from friends and family. “We’ve tried to the best of our ability not to let this affect them and we’ve kept their routine the same, as far as possible,” Baker explained after the weekly trip to collect his dole money. “Christmas is just around the corner so that’s one of the main struggles at the moment.” George was one of nearly 1,000 workers who were informed by administrators from Deloitte that their services were no longer required at the Leicester-based business. “There was a lot of emotion, crying from the ladies and anger from the men, but there was nothing we could do. I had to drive home and tell my other half in a company car I had, because I lived far away. About a week after, someone turned up at 8.30am knocking on the door saying they were here for the car. I can’t buy another one, so that affects everything from going to the shops to dropping the little ones off at nursery.” Prior to Mark Group’s failure, George had been in full-time employment for seven years. Now he cannot find work because there is little demand for his niche skill in his home town of Doncaster. “The first few weeks were full, just sorting out our finances. After that it got very empty and boring. I just didn’t know what to do with myself and I wasn’t sleeping because I haven’t been doing as much during the day. I suppose it’s practice for when I retire,” he said. Before its demise, Mark Group was a sizeable operation with two main divisions – one installing insulation to improve energy efficiency in homes and the other fitting solar panels for both the commercial and residential markets. The insulation business had already suffered due to the government’s decision in 2014 to axe the green deal, which helped fund energy efficiency measures such as cavity wall insulation. The company had been thrown a lifeline when this year the US firm SunEdison decided to buy Mark Group to use as a beachhead for investing in the UK’s growing solar industry. Eight weeks later, however, the energy secretary, Amber Rudd, announced plans for an 87% cut to the feed-in tariff – a scheme under which the government paid people with solar panels for the energy they produced. The proposal demolished the financial rationale for people and businesses to install solar, signing Mark Group’s death warrant in the process. Like many of his former colleagues, George blames the government for his current situation. “The changes they make in parliament have an impact all over the country,” he said. The company’s former chief commercial officer, Bill Rumble, who has formed an insulation company called BillsaveUK out of the ashes of Mark Group, agrees. Sitting a few feet away from a trophy for Leicestershire’s business of the year, awarded to Mark Group in 2009, he recounts the sequence of events that killed off the firm. Although the end of the green deal hurt Mark Group’s business model, SunEdison’s arrival offered a glimpse of a bright future backed by an overseas investors with deep pockets. Mark Group had recently installed the largest roof-mounted photovoltaic array in the UK, at a Marks &amp; Spencer distribution centre, and expected to win more big-ticket contracts with its newfound backer. But the decision to take the axe to subsidies dealt a crippling blow to the investment case for solar. “SunEdison acquired the business understanding that the environment was supportive,” Rumble said. “As soon as the feed-in tariff was removed, that position looked very different.” What’s more, Rumble believes that solar energy was just a few years away from being cheap enough not to require government support to grow. He said: “We understood the industry couldn’t depend on subsidies forever. But in four or five years it could have been an energy source that was subsidy-free. It seems short-sighted.” The day the administrators came in was “undoubtedly one of the worst days of my life”, he recalled. “Helping people carry personal belongings to their cars brings it home to you. You’re not sure what to say when they close the boot. It all feels very cold. “There will still be people out there facing a miserable Christmas. We were a large company and our job losses were very visible but I’m sure that story will be repeated many times over in small businesses around the country.” Even the government agrees with that view. Last week, Rudd rowed back on the subsidy cut, reducing it to 65%. But her department’s own impact assessment estimates that even this milder cut could cost up to 18,700 jobs. Even those who have managed to find work after Mark Group’s demise have been left scarred by the experience. Vanessa Reading, 43, Rumble’s personal assistant, found that the stress of redundancies had created resentment among former friends. “A lot of people have got jobs with Billsave but there are people who haven’t who now hate the company and the directors,” she explained. “Some people have turned against me, friends, because I’ve got a job here, but I’ve got bills to pay. I’m a single mum with a son and I need to put food on the table.” Liz Kendall, Labour’s MP in Leicester West, helped to organise a jobs fair for former Mark Group employees, 50 of whom found work as a result. “I was really devastated for everyone who lost their job at Mark Group and I know that being unemployed is particularly difficult at this time of year,” Kendall said. She told the Guardian she had written to the business secretary, Sajid Javid, about the impact of government policy in her constituency and been referred to Rudd, who Kendall says has so far refused to meet to discuss the matter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/sep/04/solar-industry-criticises-queensland-government-for-delay-in-tackling-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-03T23:19:44Z","webTitle":"Solar industry criticises Queensland government for delay in tackling prices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/04/solar-industry-criticises-queensland-government-for-delay-in-tackling-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/sep/04/solar-industry-criticises-queensland-government-for-delay-in-tackling-prices","fields":{"headline":"Solar industry criticises Queensland government for delay in tackling prices","bodyText":"The body for the Australian solar industry has criticised the Queensland government for an “unacceptable” delay in tackling prices for solar energy amid a dramatic slump in new rooftop solar customers. The Palaszczuk government, which aims to lift the number of homes with solar panels in the “sunshine state” to 1m by 2020, has tasked the state productivity commission with reviewing prices that were cut dramatically by the previous Liberal National government. But it will not make a ruling on prices until the outcome of the commission’s inquiry, which will assess “public and consumer benefits” of solar power, in mid-2016. Consumer group Solar Citizens welcomed the inquiry, saying it delivered on Labor’s promise to investigate fair prices after “solar owners were facing attacks by the then Newman government”. Solar Citizens campaign director Dan Scaysbrook said: “Queensland’s 422,923 solar households have done the right thing by investing in clean energy and making a growing contribution to the state’s electricity grid. It’s now time for this public inquiry to ensure they’re given a fair go.” But John Grimes, chief executive of the Australian Solar Council, said the government was needlessly prolonging uncertainty around prices and warding off prospective solar customers by waiting until mid-2016. “The government seems to have good intentions … but they’ve got to understand there are commercial realities and at the end of the day a leisurely review process taking 18 months or more after they were elected is simply unacceptable,” Grimes said. “I think we’ve just seen too many governments use the review process to kick the can down the road.” The cut under the Newman government, which saw prices paid by utilities for solar power fed back into the grid drop from 44c a kilowatt hour to 8c, has seen the weekly sales of new panel systems this month sink to a third of the level in 2012. Queensland, which boasts sites with among the highest sun irradiation levels in the country, also has more solar panels than any state, about a third of Australia’s 1.44m home systems. But the former government claimed the original 44c rate was too generous because the cost of utilities meeting solar power payments pushed up electricity prices for those without systems. Grimes said numerous studies and inquiries had previously shown this to be false and utilities were now making large profits by selling solar power back to their customers at retail prices. Grimes said the industry had taken a “big hit” from price cuts, and prolonged uncertainty was warding off customers. He welcomed the idea of a “properly resourced” inquiry but said it should report back by the end of the year, with a government moving on prices early in the new year. Grimes said while the solar council “don’t advocate for a windfall profit for solar customers”, surplus power was being sold to neighbours at full retail rates. “The power company might have paid 6 to 8c for that power and they’re selling it at 28, 32, 40c,” he said. “That is simply not fair and it doesn’t take a 12 to 18 month government inquiry to figure that out.” Grimes said the argument used by the former government that old solar prices meant “poor people were paying for rich people’s solar panels” had been “smashed” most recently by the Warburton inquiry. A report for that inquiry by ACIL Allen consulting concluded “the more renewables we have on the network, the cheaper electricity prices become”, he said. The contribution of solar took the load off power infrastructure, delayed or eliminated the need for network upgrades, and pushed down power prices for all network customers at times of peak demand, Grimes said. He said where the wholesale price of power during the Black Saturday bushfires of 2009 reached $5,000 a megawatt hour, the price during similar climatic conditions in January 2014 peaked at $500/mw hr. “The one big difference between those events was you had several hundred thousands solar PV systems pushing excess electricity into the grid precisely when electricity prices were the highest,” Grimes said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2016/mar/19/follow-the-money-recap-episodes-one-and-two-scandi-noirs-slow-burn","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2016-03-19T23:00:23Z","webTitle":"Follow the Money recap: episodes one and two – Scandi-noirs are all about the slow burn, aren't they?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/19/follow-the-money-recap-episodes-one-and-two-scandi-noirs-slow-burn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/19/follow-the-money-recap-episodes-one-and-two-scandi-noirs-slow-burn","fields":{"headline":"Follow the Money recap: episodes one and two – Scandi-noirs are all about the slow burn, aren't they?","bodyText":"Welcome to the Follow the Money series blog. I will be recapping each Saturday night’s double bill and doing my best to keep up with the “front-running”, subsidy redistributing and wiretapping of this new Danish drama about economic crime. (Would now be a good time to admit to knowing little more about economics than I did the day I opened my first account, depositing my £3 in exchange for a ceramic pig in a safety-pinned nappy?) These first two episodes were a slick start to an intriguing story of offshore windfarms, dodgy dealings and slippery fish. But, I have to be honest, I’m yet to be hooked. The series, created by Jeppe Gjervig Gram (co-writer of Borgen), feels a little more well-oiled than it does hearty, but let’s give it time – perhaps it’s because I’m yet to warm to police detective Mads (played by Thomas Bo Larsen of The Hunt fame), with his penchant for rule-breaking and tighty whities. He, at least so far, is certainly no Saga or Lund or Andri; and his relationship with fraud squad Alf is, as of yet, a bit bland: perhaps it just needs a little longer to pickle. In any case, I’m more than willing to hold my breath and wait for the magic to happen – Scandi-noirs are, after all, all about the slow burn. And, to be fair to Mads, he is under a lot of pressure – his wife has MS and is just coming out of a much longer-than-usual episode, so he’s had to make the kids packed lunches that they think are vile, remember their swimming lessons and take his wife her ample meds. Let’s see if having his wife back and fit enough to cook the family curries calms him down. His boss, Preben, clearly hopes so: you used to be the nice guy, he says, but “this is the third or fourth time you’ve become so obsessed with a case that you’re about to drop the ball …” Does anyone else have a feeling we might be about to see a fair bit of ball-dropping? We open with an outwardly charming, inwardly rotten, green energy company CEO, Sander (played by Nikolaj Lie Kaas, Sarah Lund’s season three sidekick and long-lost love Mathias Borch), leaving the Intercontinental hotel on Park Lane and riding, by bike – “I’m from Copenhagen”, he says by way of explanation – along what looks like Boris’s superhighway, to be interviewed on breakfast TV about how his company became a key player on the world energy market. Cut to a streaky pink Scandi sky, where the sun is rising on another day at his company, Energreen’s, offshore windfarm. A body is pulled from the water and Mads is called to take a look. So begins his journey of connecting the body with unpalatable goings-on in the world of green energy. Mads, we learn early on – when he strips down to his briefs and dives in the Baltic water to fish something out, rather than waiting for the boat to arrive – is not one for patience. Used, in Alf’s words, to dealing with idiot thugs, he’s going to have to learn instead to chase the bottom line and (you guessed it) follow the money. But following the money can take years and Mads is in a hurry. And so he brings his bullish ways to the world of finance and spreadsheets and, it has to be said, gets some results pretty sharpish. Next up we’re introduced to Claudia (played by Natalie Madueño). A young, clever, ambitious walking Cos advert, she is a lawyer at Energreen who is no stranger to the midnight oil. She’s told by slimy – “aren’t you getting enough attention, Claudia?” – boss Mogens that there’s some fraudulent activity in the upper echelons of Energreen. Someone’s tipping a company called East Manchester Investments off about business deals with Germany, allowing them to pre-empt trade. But it’s not long before she’s sussed out who’s responsible, dobbed Mogens in for suspecting Sander of involvement, given Mogens a blank USB rather than one filled with incriminating evidence for him to hand to police, been promoted to head lawyer and bought a new power-suit. Quick work all round. Then there’s car mechanic Nicky (played by Esben Smed Jensen) AKA Denmark’s answer to Drive, who has a young baby – there’s a sweet scene where he dresses up as a clown for his baby’s birthday, only to be met with tears – and not enough cash to afford the flat his partner so desperately wants. She doesn’t like it where they currently live – “I grew up in Jutland. That’s worse,” he says. (Jutland looks pleasant from Google, lots of peat bogs, but I’m guessing it’s meant to represent the wrong side of the tracks.) Under pressure, he gives in to his buffoonish mate and agrees to start stealing BMWs for “the Serbs” for a bit of extra cash. This is going to get him in a whopper of a pickle, have no doubt. What else do we know so far? The body floating in the water belongs to Mikhayil Husenko, a young Ukrainian who died while working on Energreen turbines in unsafe conditions. He lived with fellow workers in shoddy conditions down by the harbour, but when Mads asks around, everyone pretends not to have heard of him. His father at first gives pat answers about the circumstances of Mikhayil’s death, until Mads convinces him that he won’t lose his job or be thrown out of the country if he comes forward: “That won’t happen. This is Denmark.” Sure enough, the workers are fired en masse and Mads finds Mr Husenko hanging in his bathroom. This is not the first time Energreen has skipped on safety in a bid to maintain its position as the biggest giant on the energy scene. Once rumbled as the ones passing tips to Sebastian Kruger of East Manchester Invest, smarmy Energreen insiders Peter Søndergaard and Mark Nyager are forced out with standard severance packages – to look official – then a cheeky €2m extra each (Sander has known about the dodgy dealings all along, authorised them in fact, but “turned a blind eye”). Their generous packages don’t come cheap, though, and they promise to leave the country and not bring to light whatever is on the USB grotbag Peter gives to Claudia. What could it possibly be?! It remains unclear precisely what murky secrets it holds, but it certainly spooks Sander and brings his beardy henchman to question, ominously, whether he should take matters into his own hands. Having been treated like crap by Søndergaard when he went to fix his Mustang, Nicky vows to steal his BMW for the Serbs. After an aborted earlier effort – you had one job, Bimse – he manages it. But without realising it, he has the big bucks in the boot – bound to be a poison chalice, no? Still, Bimse and Nicky are ecstatic when they find the stash, but still pretend to the Serbs to be fuming when they try and pay them less than agreed. “We’re car thieves so we behave like fucking car thieves …” Nicky’s not just a hat rack. Sander is already up to some pretty dirty tricks – while the rest of the industry, led by Hans AKA “Denmark’s brand is wind … we’re the wind country”, is petrified of the government’s threats to redistribute subsidies into solar energy, he sneakily buys up a load of stock in solar, tricking others to follow suit, then selling it all in the half-hour before the government announce that the subsidies bill was not backed. As I say, I’m no Keynes, but this sounds like a pretty … bad/good/illegal idea (delete as appropriate). The episode finishes with Alf and Mads hearing via the wiretap a supremely ruffled Peter calling Mark and telling him about the stolen money, car and iPad. He’s after a lift over the border, stat. Thoughts and observations I quite liked Mads’ wife Kristina’s reaction to being told he wasn’t in fact going to take any time off: “You’re an idiot, do you know that?” So far I’d tend to agree. For all of her increasingly dodgy ethics, did anyone else quite relish Claudia being able to say she was, in fact, head lawyer having been told by Peter and Mark to fetch “him” and bring some coffee (even if the exchange didn’t end wholly rosily for her). I’m suspicious that the father of Claudia’s Fifa-loving son has been fired, with a generous severance packet but outlawed from working in the country for a few years. Seems too coincidental, what with all this other kerfuffle going on. Hands up who misses Andri."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/sep/17/jeremy-corbyn-lib-dems-politics-centre-ground","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-17T19:34:00Z","webTitle":"For Lib Dems, everything has changed | Tim Farron","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/17/jeremy-corbyn-lib-dems-politics-centre-ground","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/17/jeremy-corbyn-lib-dems-politics-centre-ground","fields":{"headline":"For Lib Dems, everything has changed","bodyText":"In a world in which metaphors are cheap and superlatives often superfluous, I hope I am not overstating the case by suggesting that Jeremy Corbyn’s election to the leadership of the Labour party has sent shockwaves throughout Westminster and politics in general. And for my party, the Liberal Democrats, it potentially changes everything. Over the past few days I have received a number of messages and calls from friends within the Labour party distressed by the direction that their party is taking. To the right, I have talked to a new Conservative MP taken aback by the attitudes that they have encountered within their own party. Meanwhile, the Conservatives are rolling back the policies that the Lib Dems championed in government – from solar energy to free school meals to the pupil premium – with unseemly haste. Together, the result is the opening up of a massive space in the centre ground of British politics, for sensible, moderate progressives who are opposed to what the Conservatives are doing, but cannot bring themselves to support a party of the hard left. There are lessons, however; lessons to be drawn from Corbynmania. His campaign plugged into a mood – also exemplified by Donald Trump in the United States, Syriza in Greece or indeed by the tens of thousands with whom I marched on Saturday in support of refugees – which is deeply distrustful of the establishment and old style Punch-and-Judy politics. The challenge for politicians, therefore, who want to speak for moderate, progressive voters is to talk about their own party’s values and policies, to define ourselves and leave others to define themselves too. So, as we approach our party conference, I have no interest in engaging in the old knockabout routines. I want to take the opportunity to talk about what it means to be a liberal, where we stand, and why those who share our values need to join us. For the past 200 years we have relied on the nation state as the core unit of power to direct and shape our lives. And yet, the limitations of individual states when it comes to the challenges presented by multinational businesses and internationalised markets, by non-state-driven terror organisations, by climate change and by mass migration are becoming increasingly apparent. And the pace of change is only just beginning to heat up. As individuals, the internet has opened up new, previously unimaginable opportunities – as consumers, as entrepreneurs and as citizens – but rendered the regulatory procedures on which we have previously relied entirely redundant. How do we respond to and take advantage of a world in which homeowners can not only buy but sell energy; hotel companies can exist and thrive without hotels; alternative banks allow us to borrow and save money without bankers? The structures and models we have come to expect are changing before our very eyes. As government loses the power to manage and regulate traditional activities it can respond in a number of ways: it can become isolationist and seek to withdraw from the modern world, going it alone; it can turn in on itself and its citizens, spying on their emails and interfering in their private lives; or it can embrace the change and empower its citizens to be the very best they can be. It can see its role as an enabler, working alone and with others, pooling power with others where necessary through supranational institutions such as the European Union or simply increasing the opportunities for individuals at home. This vision of government – as an enabler, a creator of opportunity, a guarantor of freedoms, a voice for the powerless – is a liberal vision. It is what has prompted my call for Britain to opt into the EU scheme providing homes for the refugees currently stranded across our continent. It is what drives our party’s wholehearted commitment to the EU in the referendum. But it is also what places housing at the very top of my agenda, as a secure home is the entry ticket to a job, a community, and individual and collective economic prosperity. This is the liberal vision that I believe is shared by millions in Britain, not only within the Liberal Democrats, but across all parties and none. A vision which, as other party leaders set out their stall for our country’s future – whether through words or deed – will more clearly be seen as the centre ground of British politics. And perhaps a vision which we alone can offer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/15/five-developing-countries-ditching-fossil-fuels-china-india-costa-rica-afghanistan-albania","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-15T08:00:12Z","webTitle":"Race to renewable: five developing countries ditching fossil fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/15/five-developing-countries-ditching-fossil-fuels-china-india-costa-rica-afghanistan-albania","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/15/five-developing-countries-ditching-fossil-fuels-china-india-costa-rica-afghanistan-albania","fields":{"headline":"Race to renewable: five developing countries ditching fossil fuels","bodyText":"Costa Rica Costa Rica is well on its way to becoming the first developing country to have 100% renewable electricity. Thanks to our hydro, wind and geothermal resources, 98% of our power is already renewable according to official data (Spanish website). This year, Costa Rica had 100% renewable power for 94 consecutive days. This achievement took several decades to build and the next milestone is to ensure that our electricity system is 100% renewable the whole year. This will require us to replace distributed diesel generators – that are used as a back-up source – with distributed, renewable energy resources. The state-owned Costa Rican Institute of Electricity (ICE) plans to add more hydro, wind and geothermal power plants and retirie the heavy fuel oil-powered Moin plant in 2017. ICE also plan to improve the efficiency of existing plants that run on fossil fuels. For example, by using German technology to increase efficiency at the Garabito plant, it will go from producing 200MW to 280MW. With Costa Rican citizens and entrepreneurs excited about solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and bioenergy, the country is now on track to have a fossil-free power system by 2025 – probably earlier. This precedent builds confidence that we could become be the first developing country to have not only 100% renewable electricity but also a 100% renewable energy matrix. How can we tap into our agro-residues to replace imported fossil fuels for industrial uses? Why not replace petroleum-powered cars with electric cars? We have seen a new wave of societal pressure to fix public transportation and the government has pledged to deliver an electric train. Getting this done will accelerate our ongoing transition to becoming a 100% renewable energy country. Monica Araya is founder and director of Nivela and Costa Rica Limpia, a citizen observatory.

The fragmented nature of the country – geographically and politically – means that it will always be a big ask to build and maintain the sort of large-scale electricity grid typically powered by coal or gas. Such things depend on good governance and a central authority – not much in evidence in Afghanistan. So decentralised power generation – owned and controlled by local people – which can harness local sources of energy, is more favourable. Secondly, Afghanistan has renewable energy sources in abundance. Much of the country enjoys high levels of sunshine; its upland areas have decent wind potential, and its rivers can be harvested by small-scale hydro plants. These don’t involve large, damaging dams, but small diversions of enough water to drive turbines producing electricity for a few villages. That may all sound a little optimistic, but there’s practical work underway. In the northern provinces of Badakhshan and Takhar, 11,500 homes, schools, markets, local businesses and hospitals are currently being supplied with power by a mix of hydro and solar plants. These were installed by the German development agency, GiZ, in close collaboration with both the government and, more importantly, local people, who are trained to operate and run them as semi-independent enterprises. The scheme won an Ashden Award for sustainable energy. There’s a realistic chance that such schemes could be replicated across swathes of the country. With little in the way of large-scale industry, Afghanistan’s power needs are relatively modest, making renewables even more relevant. And with ongoing political turbulence, rooting such plants in local communities gives them the best chance of delivering power for years to come.

China China has emerged as the world’s renewables superpower in less than a decade of highly focused development – the country is the world’s largest producer and user of renewable energy technologies. The official target of the Chinese government is for non-fossil fuels to grow to 20% of total energy consumption by 2030, rising from the current level of 11%. Meanwhile coal consumption is to be capped at 4.2bn tons by 2020. China is also committed to a significant increase of the electricity generating capacity based on renewable sources, doubling wind and quadrupling solar by 2020. Those targets are likely to be achieved, given China’s track record to date. In fact consumption of coal has already started to decline, a Great Reversal of the trend for the past decade. As a result, revenues, profit, and stock prices of coal and oil companies have all fallen sharply. There are divergent views in China over the future for renewables beyond 2030. A recent study by the Energy Research Institute within China’s central planning body has made a strong case for renewables to account for 60% of the total energy consumption and 85% of electricity by 2050; while the China Academy of Engineering projects that renewables will account for just over 40% of total energy consumption by 2050 (Chinese article). One conclusion is clear across many studies, though, that it is both technically and economically feasible for China to phase out fossil fuels with cleaner energy sources such as solar and wind. The trajectory of China’s future energy system is determined by competitive dynamics between the old and the new. China’s coal-fired power stations, currently of about 900GW of capacity, need to be decommissioned over the next decades. China is also building projects such as pipelines that transport oil and gas from all over the world, and the lock-in effect will be a challenge for renewables to overcome. On the other hand, China continues to invest in renewables at a scale that dwarfs that of other countries. China invested nearly $90bn in clean energy in 2014, or 73% more than the US, building large solar parks in Qinghai and wind farms in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, just to name a few. China also leads the world in some key areas of infrastructure, such as high speed railways and smart grid technologies, which will facilitate a new model of energy consumption and supply, and one that makes a break with the system based on fossil fuels.

India With more than 20% of India’s population currently coping without access to electricity, the government has promised to provide all households with constant power supply before the next national election in 2019. Meanwhile, the Make in India campaign seeks an expansion of manufacturing capabilities in the country, which will also depend heavily on – and increase the demand for – access to power. Development for all is dependent on electricity for all, which will simply not be possible without decentralised solutions, best served by renewable energy sources. Earlier this year, the central government announced an ambitious target of 175GW of renewable energy of which 100GW would come from solar alone, by 2022. But growth in the sector has been relatively slow, considering the immense potential: according to the Indian ministry of renewable energy, the total installed solar capacity crossed over 3GW for the first time in December last year, adding only 886MW in 2014 - in contrast, Tata Solar Power, in a report released in 2014, estimated that India could reach 145GW of solar by 2024. This good news has further positive implications: as solar power rapidly becomes a mainstream energy option, the industry could create over 670,000 new, clean-energy jobs in India. These positives however, would be impossible to achieve without a paradigm shift in policies that boost the rapidly improving business of renewables. It will be important to ensure that this shift from polluting power to clean renewables is done in a way where citizens are in greater control over their own power supply, as virtually infinite potential from wind and solar energy can truly democratise the generation of, and access to, power.

Albania Albania, a small country of 2.77 million inhabitants, has big potential and an exciting future for renewable energy. Driven by a desire to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels and promote a secure supply of energy, the government of Albania has been very eager to encourage increased investment in renewable energy and in 2013 a law was passed to promote renewable energy. The new renewable energy law sets a nationally binding target for renewable energy (non-hydro) of 38% by the year 2020. In addition, it provides for priority grid access for renewable energy projects, for streamlined licensing procedures, for the ability to sign sale and purchase agreements for renewable energy for up to 15 years and for preferential feed-in-tariffs, to be established by the regulator. This package of measures should provide greater confidence to investors that their investments in renewable energy in Albania offer an attractive rate of return in a country that, for its size, has abundant renewable energy resources. Water is Albania’s most important natural resource. At least eight large rivers run through the country, fed by hundreds of smaller streams and total hydropower resources are estimated at 4500MW. In addition, solar energy potential (for both photovoltaics and solar hot-water heaters) is excellent as the country has among the highest number of sunshine hours per year in Europe (an average of 2,400). Wind energy potential for Albania is also very good along the Adriatic coast. The law on renewable energy was passed two years ago but investment in non-hydro renewable energy in the country is yet to take off. Partly this is because secondary legislation is not yet in place and partly because of lack of private sector awareness of the possibilities available. Over the longer term, the potential for increased investment in renewable energy in Albania is excellent as the country becomes an energy exporter. Albania plans to spend over $200m to build power cables to Italy, a country with excess energy demand. This should help drive additional investment in renewable energy.

The letter, seen by the Guardian, calls for new EU financing mechanisms for nuclear as a low carbon technology, and research and innovation initiatives to deal with the costly and unresolved issues of nuclear waste and decommissioning. New state aid guidelines are also needed, it says, and these should be based on past EU decisions, including the approval of the UK’s planned Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset. “It is vital that the forthcoming communication on an Energy Union reaffirms the important role that nuclear power, together with renewables, other low carbon technologies, and energy efficiency improvements, can potentially play in Europe,” the message says. The letter to the commission’s vice president Sefkovic and climate commissioner Miguel Cañete was signed by the Romanian energy minister, Andrei Gerea, on behalf of ministers in seven other countries including the UK, France, Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Slovenia and Slovakia. The ministers’ core argument is that many countries would not be able to cost-effectively meet EU climate targets and energy security objectives, without bloc support for new nuclear plant builds and the maintenance of existing reactors. The cost-effectiveness argument is key, as minutes of a commissioner’s discussion seen by the Guardian indicate that the UK’s planned £17.6bn subsidy for Hinkley was cleared by Brussels partly on the basis that it would have been too expensive to organise a competitive tendering process. The competition commissioner of the time, Joaquín Almunia, told other commissioners that “the specificities of nuclear technology made it impossible to achieve full competition between operators, at least at the time of the HPC project. For a project like the present one, the costs of preparing a project bid are so considerable that it would seem almost impossible to organise an open and transparent bidding process with several bidders.” The minutes show that the EU decision largely rested on the imputed common interest in advancing nuclear power outlined in the Euratom treaty. But Hinkley’s approval was resisted by the commission’s environment and climate directorates who argued that it called into question the bloc’s ‘technology neutrality’ and would create market distortions. “This is really about state aid which is supposed to be for new technologies that haven’t proved themselves viable yet. But nuclear energy has had 70 years and still has not been able to prove itself viable, even when the public pays for its waste disposal and decommissioning. It should not be eligible for subsidies,” said Molly Scott Cato, the Green MEP for South West England and Gibraltar. New research to be published on Thursday by the Resilience Centre finds that the government’s plans for a new reactor at Hinkley Point C has had what Cato calls “a chilling effect” on investment in renewable energy in Somerset. In 2010, Somerset set a relatively low target of 63MW for solar energy capacity by 2020, which it looks likely to exceed. By comparison, neighbouring Devon has a solar energy target of 440MW while Gloucestershire has a goal of 920MW. But the centre, says that when the lower capacity factors of renewable energy are taken into account, renewables have the potential to generate more than three times the equivalent energy of Hinkley. Two tidal lagoons off the Somerset coast would be likely to generate 640MW, or 10% of the equivalent energy generated by Hinkley. The Resilience Centre, which comprises technical renewable energy experts and environmental engineers, pegs Somerset’s onshore and marine generating capacity from renewables at 5.4GW – around 60% of Hinkley’s output. But the joint ministerial letter insists that nuclear power should be allowed to play a role alongside renewables and energy efficiency in a decarbonised, secure and competitive energy market. “As of December 2014, nuclear provided 53% of the EU’s carbon-free electricity,” it says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/feb/17/ministers-claims-that-solar-panels-harm-uk-food-security-are-false","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-17T17:09:08Z","webTitle":"Minister's claims that solar panels harm UK food security are false","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/17/ministers-claims-that-solar-panels-harm-uk-food-security-are-false","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/feb/17/ministers-claims-that-solar-panels-harm-uk-food-security-are-false","fields":{"headline":"Minister's claims that solar panels harm UK food security are false","bodyText":"British food security is not being harmed by the spread of solar panels in the countryside as claimed by the UK’s environment secretary, documents from her own department reveal. Liz Truss told farmers last October that they would no longer receive agricultural subsidies for land that had solar power on, saying the “ugly” panels were “a blight on the countryside and villages” and were pushing production of meat and produce overseas. “I am committed to food production in this country and it makes my heart sink to see row upon row of solar panels where once there was a field of wheat or grassland for livestock to graze,” she was quoted as saying at the time. But environment department officials have admitted in private correspondence and documents released under freedom of information rules that they hold no data on the land covered in England by solar panels; they have no idea how much they will save in agricultural subsidies through the change; and the claim that solar power is harming food production does not stack up. “Given the small areas of land covered currently, it is not possible to argue that, at the national level, there is yet a serious impact on agricultural output,” they write in a document outlining the evidence for the policy. The documents reveal officials trying to guess how much farmland is affected by extrapolating from the total amount of solar installed across the country and the total amount of farmland nationally because detailed data for the crossover of solar and agricultural land does not exist. They also show the National Farmers Union opposed the change, with the farming body saying it believed solar panels could coexist with agricultural activity such as livestock grazing and even some arable crops. The officials speculate on how much farmers with solar panels are receiving by way of payments under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), but admit “we have no hard evidence to back these figures up”. Just two weeks before Truss made her announcement, one Defra official emailed colleagues saying they had no idea where to start looking for information on which large solar farms are also receiving agricultural payments. “Can either of you help with identifying some large scale solar farms in receipt of SPS subsidy? I don’t know where to begin with this!” the official wrote on 9 October 2014. Submissions from solar power developers argued that solar farms complement rather than compete with agriculture. “35GW of solar farms generating 10% of the UK’s electricity demand [nearly nine times the amount the UK has installed now] could be built on less than 1% of permanent pasture land without displacing any grazing sheep,” says a slide by British solar company AEE Renewables, now known as Green Hedge. Truss’s rhetoric in October was in line with her focus on championing British food since taking office last summer in which she has praised English and Welsh wine exports and penned comment articles lauding British apples. The sudden policy shift by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) added to the solar industry’s woes, coming just months after the Department of Energy and Climate Change had made drastic changes to the subsidy scheme for large solar farms. Sources in the solar industry said the Defra policy change appeared designed to woo Ukip voters. Leonie Greene, a spokeswoman for the Solar Trade Association, said: “What we want is an evidence-based approach to policy. The impact of solar farms is negligible in terms of land take, many times smaller than golf courses. We’ve taken great care as an industry to avoid conflict with food production, and the co-existence of farming for grazing or poultry on low grade land is clear.” Tess Sundelin, managing director at Green Hedge, told the Guardian: “These changes to CAP income are actually quite marginal for farmers. Our over-riding concern, given the significant income security and diversification that solar projects provide for the farming community, is the misconception amongst some policy makers about the land that solar farms cover.” A Defra spokeswoman did not address the contradiction between Truss’s public statements and her officials in private, but said: “The government believes that the country’s highest quality land should be used for food and crop production. That is why we have taken the decision to remove Common Agricultural Policy payment from land used to generate energy through solar panels. This further protects our land, farmers and food security through redistributing payments to those farming the land and who are committed to agriculture.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/sep/16/the-guardian-view-on-the-paris-summit-outlook-fair-but-storms-still-possible","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-16T18:35:22Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the Paris summit: outlook fair, but storms still possible | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/16/the-guardian-view-on-the-paris-summit-outlook-fair-but-storms-still-possible","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/16/the-guardian-view-on-the-paris-summit-outlook-fair-but-storms-still-possible","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the Paris summit: outlook fair, but storms still possible","bodyText":"The chances of a deal at the Paris climate change summit that starts on 30 November look better than anyone might have thought possible even a year ago. But if success seems more likely than failure, failure – as President François Hollande warned last week – is still possible. The negotiations on the text that have been going on in Bonn were supposed to be nearly complete, but progress has been slow and possibly insufficient. Only this morning the UN’s climate chief, Christiana Figueres, warned that the targets for carbon emission reduction that 62 nations which account for 70% of emissions have so far submitted for agreement in Paris are not good enough to keep global warming below 2C. All the same, the mere fact of nationally rather than globally agreed targets marks an important innovation. In total, targets covering 85% of emissions are expected. That would be enough to prevent global warming reaching catastrophic levels. It is the start of a process, and that is one of the things that makes the framework for a deal very different from the failed attempts at Copenhagen six years ago. Then, the developed world was being asked to bear the costs both of moving to a low-carbon economy and of mitigating the impacts of climate change; the US still lacked a climate change policy; and the fastest-growing polluters, China and India, did not take part. But the ragged nature of progress is writ large in the UK’s own uncertain steps towards a green economy. Under Lib Dem influence in the coalition years, a raft of measures, from subsidies for wind and solar energy to improvements in domestic insulation and a green investment bank, were pushed through, while the Lib Dem energy secretary, Ed Davey, played a big part in securing an EU climate deal at the end of last year. Since the election, nine different policies, from onshore wind subsidies to incentives for greener motoring, have been axed or weakened. Even the eye-catching pre-election promise for funding for Swansea’s power-generating tidal lagoon has yet to be realised. Defenders of these changes argue that this is a new and fast-changing environment and, because renewables have been more efficient than anyone anticipated, the subsidies have become victims of their own success. But in the latest quarterly rankings from Ernst &amp; Young, published on Wednesday, the UK has fallen out of the international top 10 of countries for investment in renewables for the first time in more than a decade. According to an EY analyst, investors are scratching their heads about the government’s direction of travel. This cooling attitude to green investment may encourage resistance to carbon reduction in Poland, the last country in the EU to depend heavily on coal-fired energy. It was a reluctant signatory to the EU deal to cut emissions by 40% over 1990 levels, and the details have still to be finalised. It could still unravel. Yet there are good reasons to be cheerful. The political support for a deal is broader and deeper than ever before. It embraces President Barack Obama, who has made action on climate change a legacy issue, and as importantly China’s President Xi Jinping. Aware that the cost of not getting an agreement by making its own contribution to carbon reduction would be greater than the cost of greening its economy, China is now fully engaged in the process. Angela Merkel, who was Germany’s environment minister when the first climate change conference was held in Berlin in 1995, has been playing a critical role in bilateral negotiations off stage. The two unknowns are Russia and India. They are both countries with huge fossil fuel reserves that have been slow to invest in carbon reduction, but hopes are high for India, whose prime minister, Narendra Modi, is keen to be seen as a moderniser and without China as an ally is surrounded by countries that all want action on global warming. Next week, the UN general assembly gathers in New York. The pope will be there to deliver his message about the moral necessity of tackling climate change. There will be a dinner, and no doubt bilaterals to tackle outstanding problems. The sustainable development goals, which could be part of the underpinning of the Paris deal, are due to be considered. But the real crunch comes in October, when the IMF and the World Bank Group meet in Peru to assess progress towards the $100bn of climate aid. This is the money that will grease the wheels of the deal. It sounds like an unfathomably large amount. But compared with the cost of not reaching a deal, to rich and poor country alike, it is cheap at the price."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/oct/22/outrage-steel-solar-power-david-cameron-environmental","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-22T19:15:45Z","webTitle":"There’s outrage over steel, but we should be furious over solar power | Ian Birrell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/22/outrage-steel-solar-power-david-cameron-environmental","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/22/outrage-steel-solar-power-david-cameron-environmental","fields":{"headline":"There’s outrage over steel, but we should be furious over solar power","bodyText":"The former Tory party chairman Grant Shapps is promoting renewable energy in his new role as minister for Africa. Launching a bid to exploit British prowess in the booming solar sector and aid the poor, he insisted governments should be attracted by an energy source that is “so much cleaner” than traditional supplies, and more “attractive”. “Lots of people think that it doesn’t compare favourably with other forms of electricity,” he said. “They haven’t put it all together and it’s hard to know why.” Quite right. The world is moving away from fossil fuels towards increased reliance on cleaner energies, which account for almost a quarter of global electricity generation. Fast-developing nations such as China, India, Ghana and Kenya are investing heavily in renewables, with Beijing predicting they will provide almost two-thirds of energy by 2050 and Singapore revealing plans for a giant floating solar farm. In the United States, Barack Obama recently announced a $1bn drive to boost the number of homes with solar panels, while firms such as Apple and Google are ramping up investments to reduce greenhouse gases. Britain has not been left behind, with a thriving green energy industry and rapidly rising reliance on renewables under a prime minister who once famously put a wind turbine on his home. Our islands have the finest clean energy resources in Europe. The climate may not be perfect for harnessing the sun’s power, but even the solar sector is soaring: cells stuck on roofs and in fields now generate twice the electricity of the biggest power station. So, given this admirable desire for low-carbon energy on both a domestic and global scale, what on earth is the government doing savaging a successful sector? The Tory manifesto promised to boost renewables and hold down bills. Yet instead came plans to withdraw subsidies for new onshore wind farms earlier than planned and give local nimbys power to stop such projects. Since new figures reveal this to be the cheapest source of British energy, it seems bizarre to make such regressive moves: major investments worth billions have already been scrapped. And it gets worse. Sums paid to homeowners who install solar panels have been slashed more than two-thirds since the Conservatives regained office five years ago as part of the coalition’s self-proclaimed “greenest government ever”. Despite this, the panels rose in popularity with more installed by homeowners in Britain than anywhere else in the EU last year. Solar energy generation is rising faster than other forms of renewables. But now subsidies are to be shredded by another 87%, making them almost meaningless. This has been driven by a panicked Treasury, applauded by climate-change deniers on the right and defended by an energy secretary telling the sector to “stand on its own two feet”. Yet for all the fuss over recent steel cutbacks, there seems minimal concern over the solar industry, although it employs more people and was expanding. Already four major players are going out of business, with about 1,000 jobs lost; the trade body warns 25,000 more could go, pouring down the drain public money spent on new technologies. This is daft, even if you put aside the disconcerting politics of a prime minister who sold himself as a green crusader and once pushed the concept of feed-in tariffs. The cost of such subsidies is minimal, adding just £7 to average annual household bills – especially when compared with huge sums being staked on building a Chinese-backed nuclear plant. Those involved in solar power say they could deliver the same amount of power for half the price and none of the risk. And that they’re only three years from avoiding the need for any subsidies, with new batteries arriving that can store energy generated while the sun shines for use at night when people want power. Wind and solar power was once the domain of hippies, but renewable energy is now a cutting-edge industry, so these moves cause as much concern in City circles as among Greenpeace activists. One report found the green economy employed 357,000 people in 2012, while £40bn has gone into green investment in the past four years. “The government’s attack on renewables is like the White House deciding in 1995 that it wanted to restrict and badmouth Silicon Valley,” says James Murray, of the website BusinessGreen. “Clean tech entrepreneurs have built a thriving industry and are now seeing it torpedoed.” The shame of this short-sighted stance is that, for all the talk of “green crap”, David Cameron often stood firm on environmental issues, introducing tough targets to halve carbon emissions by 2025. Sometimes it was by stealth, yet on the global stage he resisted sceptics to push climate change causes. Next month’s key Paris summit presents another test of his commitment. Ministers talk of clean energy having a bright future. Certainly, while costs of new nuclear and gas-fired power stations rise, solar and wind costs fall. Energy firms still make over-inflated profits. So why cripple a thriving renewables sector, especially amid a global boom? There is nothing Conservative about undermining entrepreneurs and homeowners, especially those seeking to preserve the planet’s resources."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2015/dec/14/australian-newspaper-cartoon-depicting-indians-eating-solar-panels-attacked-racist","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-14T04:31:10Z","webTitle":"Australian newspaper cartoon depicting Indians eating solar panels attacked as racist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/14/australian-newspaper-cartoon-depicting-indians-eating-solar-panels-attacked-racist","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/dec/14/australian-newspaper-cartoon-depicting-indians-eating-solar-panels-attacked-racist","fields":{"headline":"Australian newspaper cartoon depicting Indians eating solar panels attacked as racist","bodyText":"A cartoon in the Australian depicting starving Indians chopping up and eating solar panels sent to the developing nation in an attempt to curb carbon emissions has been condemned as “unequivocally racist”. Drawn by the veteran cartoonist Bill Leak, Monday’s cartoon was his response to the climate deal signed in Paris at the weekend. India is the world’s fourth-largest greenhouse emitter. Amanda Wise, an associate professor of sociology at Macquarie University, said in her view the cartoon was shocking and would be unacceptable in the UK, the US or Canada. “This cartoon is unequivocally racist and draws on very base stereotypes of third world, underdeveloped people who don’t know what to do with technology,” Wise told Guardian Australia. “India is the technology centre of the world right now and has some of the most high-tech industries on the planet in that part of the world. The underlying message is that people in developing countries don’t need all these technologies to do with climate change – they need food. “But actually it is people living in poverty that will suffer the most through food security, sea level rises, dropping of the water table.” The editor of the Australian, Clive Mathieson, confirmed he edited Monday’s paper but declined to comment on the Leak cartoon. The Australian’s long-serving editor-in-chief Chris Mitchell left the company last week and Paul Whittaker is installed as editor-in-chief, with Michelle Gunn staying on as editor of the Weekend Australian. Wise said: “I don’t know too many places in the world where you would get away with that to be honest. In the UK and the US there would be an incredible outcry. It is appalling. “This is really old imagery he has drawn on. Thin, starving people wearing turbans, who are so starving they are going to chop up solar panels. That is 1950s symbolism. We have moved on. The rest of the world has moved on. “In Australia people from India are the second largest migrant group and they are coming here on skilled visas.” The Australian’s cartoon has provoked anger in India. “This only demonstrates the … provincial ignorance of both the journalist, cartoonist and publication,” said Shoma Chaudhury, editor of Catch News and a well-known local journalist. “India has not only been a sophisticated negotiator on climate change, insisting ‘developed’ nations pay their dues for destroying the planet, it has also voluntarily started adopting renewables like solar energy in hundreds of villages. It has not needed to be browbeaten into climate intelligence or consciousness, unlike many developed nations. “In truth, the bewildered farmers in Leak’s cartoon could probably teach him a thing or two about solar panels, while treating him to the indisputable pleasures of mango chutney.” Leak’s cartoon was widely condemned on Twitter, with many users drawing attention to India’s rapidly developing sustainable energy sector. Deakin University Prof Yin Paradies, whose research includes the economic effects of racism, also took the view the cartoon’s message was clearly racist. “The message ... is that India is too stupid to handle renewable energy and should stick to coal,” Paradies told Guardian Australia. “Suggesting that ‘developing nations are stupid’ is racist given that such nations are invariably associated with specific racial groups (ie non-whites).” Leak, who joined the Australian from the Sydney Morning Herald in 1994, has been accused of becoming more conservative in recent years. He has addressed this criticism head-on, saying it had nothing to do with a serious accident after falling from a balcony. “While trawling through a number of popular leftwing blogs recently, I realised I had to accept a painful reality: I have become a rabid right winger and a Murdoch toady,” Leak wrote in 2012. “It seems widely accepted that this terrible turn of events is attributable to the fact that I recently had an accident, after which I had to undergo brain surgery. “Freedom of speech is the freedom to offend, and that means the freedom to offend anyone. “Neither cartoonists nor journalists should be required to exempt certain groups within society from this general rule when expressing their views. I don’t want to be protected from anybody’s views, especially not from those I find personally repugnant, because it’s often when finding yourself in violent disagreement with certain ideas that you’re best able to clarify your own.” Leak declined to comment on the criticism of Monday’s cartoon. India took one of the hardest public lines at the climate change talks in Paris, and in the lead-up to them. Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, has publicly argued that it would be “morally wrong” to let rich countries off the hook for their historical emissions. The country has also stood by its decision to use massive quantities of highly polluting coal to power growth over coming decades, all while increasing the proportion of renewable energy. With many of its cities enveloped in toxic smog for weeks and a series of extreme weather events in recent years, the environmental problems in India are clear and the deal in Paris has received a cautious welcome in the world’s biggest democracy. “India has reasons to be satisfied with the Paris agreement on climate change that was finalised on Saturday night,” said the IndianExpress newspaper. However the newspaper noted concerns about the “inclusion of one line which might prove to be a big irritant in [Indian] plans to build coal-fired power plants.” A cartoon in the New York Times published during the negotiations also prompted strong reactions in India. It showed India as an elephant blocking the forward progress of the “climate talks train”. Last year Fairfax Media was forced to apologise after an outcry over a cartoon by Glen Le Lievre in the Sydney Morning Herald, which was criticised by many, including the Australian, as racist and antisemitic. A columnist, Gerard Henderson, writing under the heading SMH gives antisemitism a chance, condemned the cartoon as a depiction of a “stereotypical Jew of recent memory” with a hook nose, kippah and star of David. Another columnist for the Australian, Michael Gawenda, said it “recycled the sort of cartoon image of Jews that was standard fare in Nazi publications”. Fairfax apologised a week later, saying it was wrong to publish the cartoon in its original form."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/nov/27/unilever-to-stop-using-coal-for-energy-within-five-years","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-27T00:01:05Z","webTitle":"Unilever to stop using coal for energy within five years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/27/unilever-to-stop-using-coal-for-energy-within-five-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/27/unilever-to-stop-using-coal-for-energy-within-five-years","fields":{"headline":"Unilever to stop using coal for energy within five years","bodyText":"Unilever, the consumer goods giant, has pledged to eliminate coal from its energy usage within five years, and derive all of its energy worldwide solely from renewable sources by 2030. The company will become “carbon positive” by 2030, through its own use of renewables, and by investing in generating more renewable energy than it needs, selling the surplus on the markets and making it available to local communities in areas where it operates. About 40% of the company’s energy use currently comes from green sources. Unilever made the commitment ahead of the crunch UN climate change conference in Paris, which begins this weekend. Paul Polman, chairman of the company, told the Guardian the target was “do-able, really do-able”. He cited a new factory in China which is powered by wind and solar energy, and an office in Paris which is “carbon positive”, contributing green electricity to the power grid. He hoped other businesses would come forward with carbon-cutting plans at the conference, known as COP21. “We obviously want Paris to be ambitious and successful,” he told the Guardian in an interview. “[It will be] if the agreement has the right things in there, like a zero goal, a decarbonisation goal. I’m for 2050. Perhaps if we’re lucky they will say by the end of this century, but that’s a starting point.” He said progress had been made towards an agreement by countries coming forward with targets on cutting or curbing their emissions, and he also called for a Paris deal to include a process of five-yearly reviews of emissions goals, with a provision for “no backsliding” – that countries can strengthen their targets in future but not row back on them. He said he would also like to see a price put on carbon dioxide emissions, to encourage companies to cut them, but conceded that this was unlikely to be an outcome from the two weeks of talks. Polman will attend the Paris conference along with business leaders from the World Business Council on Sustainable Development and other business groupings such as “the B team”, spearheaded by Sir Richard Branson, which call for stronger action on global warming. The heavy presence of businesses at the conference has been criticised by some climate activists, but Polman said their presence, and commitments they make there, would encourage world leaders to be able to take a stronger stance. “We’re trying to keep the pressure up to get all these things from Paris.” Much of the financing for climate change projects comes from companies, he noted – “they really do more of the financing than the governments” in some areas, he said. He also called for a strong focus on forestry at the talks, including pledges from rich nations to help the poor to protect their existing forests. “We want a moratorium on deforestation,” he said. One of the leading causes of deforestation is to make way for palm oil plantations. Unilever was criticised recently by the Rainforest Action Network. Polman defended the company’s stance, which includes membership of the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil, a body that attempts to increase the supply of the oil grown in environmentally friendly conditions. “The reality of palm oil, it’s in many of the products we use today, from candles to food. And it’s actually a high-yield, very effective product. So if you look at alternatives, which are available, and we use them also in our products, then you need to actually use much more land surface to cultivate them. And the effects, some people would argue, would be worse. The issue with any crop that you grow, the beef from Argentina or Brazil, is that you grow it sustainably without deforestation.” He said the main problem with unsustainable palm oil was now coming from smallholder farms “which are not in our supply chain as far as we can see”. He called for “an international effort by the whole community to ‘produce and protect’ schemes because the smallholder farmers need training, they need access to financing, they need land rights”. This would require providing financial assistance to the farmers, and would encourage small farmers to sign up to sustainable practices, because they would get higher yields. Polman’s pledge to make Unilever “carbon positive” and remove coal from its operations has been accompanied by personal action, in that he has ensured that his own investments are not in fossil fuels. “My wife has made sure of that,” he said. Unilever’s pension funds are also committed to “responsible investing”, though it is not clear whether this means a full disinvestment from all fossil fuels and carbon-intensive businesses. Polman said the funds are operated at arms’ length from the company. Subsidies for fossil fuels are still far outstripping those for renewable energy, he noted, even though the plummeting price of solar and wind are “exciting” for companies. “We barely subsidise green energy – one tenth of what we spend on fossil fuel subsidies goes to green energy,” he said. More people would move to the “sharing economy”, he predicted, which would help to change the current model of capitalism. The growth of sharing, including web sites such as Airbnb and Gumtree, has been one of the recent surprises of the internet. Polman predicted that the changes that have happened in the music industry because of online sales – whereby the vinyl records of his youth gave way to CDs, which gave way to downloading – would be replicated in other areas. He gave the example of a power drill, of which many people in the affluent world may own several. “The average time in our lifetime that we use a drill is less than two minutes, because you go jup and the hole is there. Then after six months you need to hang another picture, jup, another second. So there is an abundance of drills. So that becomes sharing economy.” This would change the way economies grow, he said. “A hundred things that were made with stuff are now provided for in non-stuff, but it has the same service, and you are willing to pay for it.” Critics might point out that most of Unilever’s products – from ice-cream to shower gel – are consumed once and cannot be shared after consumption."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2015/dec/09/nominet-trust-100-awards-technology-used-for-social-good","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-09T08:00:50Z","webTitle":"Winning tech inventions that help people live better | Anna Bawden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/09/nominet-trust-100-awards-technology-used-for-social-good","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2015/dec/09/nominet-trust-100-awards-technology-used-for-social-good","fields":{"headline":"Winning tech inventions that help people live better","bodyText":"When Georgina Coulson’s son was five months old, he had a violent seizure. It took paramedics over an hour to stop him shaking. John Joseph ended up in intensive care where he was diagnosed with Dravet syndrome, a neurological condition causing severe seizures, often while sleeping, and a heightened risk of sudden death during epilepsy. Once discharged, Coulson bought a mattress sensor which triggered an alarm if her son moved in the night. But as babies wriggle a lot, the alarm would go off constantly. “He’d be awake from 1am until 6am,” says Coulson, a single mother. “We were exhausted.” Desperate to find a better way to monitor John Joseph, Coulson did some internet research and came across PulseGuard – a heartbeat sensor that triggers an alarm on an iPad. PulseGuard is the brainchild of Adrian and Sue Perry, whose son Tom also has Dravet syndrome. They realised that increased heart rate was often a trigger for Tom’s seizures. The monitor they developed did not miss a single seizure over two years and so the Perrys set up a family-run community-interest company, Adris Technologies, to develop PulseGuard commercially. Although it is not cheap – Coulson had to raise just under £1,000 from family and friends – she says the sensor is well worth the price. “It’s been a godsend. It’s changed my life,” she says. “Now I put the sensor on his ankle at 8pm, knowing the alarm on my iPad will go off if John Joseph has a seizure. I’ve only had PulseGuard for six weeks and for the last three he hasn’t had any status seizures, because I’ve been able to prevent symptoms turning into full-blown fits by administering his medication straight away. And because we can both sleep, we can do things during the day. We’ve got a new lease of life.” The technology is also suitable for the one in 100 peoplein the UK who have epilepsy. Karen Ridley’s daughter Poppy was diagnosed with epilepsy at 18 months. Now 7, Poppy often has her seizures during the night, so until recently, Ridley has slept in her daughter’s bedroom. “I would wake up in the night and check if Poppy was still warm, if she was still alive. Can you imagine how awful it is to have to do that?” But for the last seven months, Ridley and her husband Chris have been monitoring Poppy with PulseGuard. “It’s kept her alive,” says Ridley. “And we’ve been able to put her to bed on her own without worrying she is going to have a fatal seizure. We don’t have to go to bed at 7pm with her like we used to.”Its ability to save lives and bring peace of mind made PulseGuard one of the stand-out entries for this year’s Nominet Trust 100, which identifies inspiring examples of technology used for social good, and is published on Wednesday. As one of the judges of the top 100 list, it was clear to me that innovations in physical and mental health were dominant in 2015, accounting for one third of the projects. Some are still in the early stages of development. GyroGlove uses gyroscopes built into a glove to help control hand tremors. Entering into the final stage of testing and patent applications, the glove is due to be launched in mid-2016. Early trials of prototypes show it stablises the hand, allowing Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor patients to regain control over a much wider range of hand movements. Around 10 million people globally and 127,000 in the UKhave Parkinson’s. Sarah Webb was diagnosed with Parkinson’s at the age of 39. Now 45, Webb, a mother of two from Kingston says the disease is “taking over” her life a lot more. Webber has tried an early prototype of the glove. “The whole idea is amazing,” she says. “I can see it’s going to work. I want it to be ready now. “After a time with Parkinson’s, you are taking more and more medication, whereas with this, it’s a completely different way of thinking: accessories to help us manage the symptoms in our day-to-day lives.” Another project seeks to improve the monitoring of rare diseases in children. Aparito uses wearable technology to monitor young patients who have Niemann-Pick C and neuronopathic Gaucher disease. These are rare incurable genetic disorders in which the body does not break down certain molecules properly, causing severe health problems, including difficulty in motor skills and coordination. Aparito uses a pedometer-style wristband to track patients’ movements, in conjunction with an app in which medication adherence, seizures and falls, and hospital visits can be entered. This information is passed onto the clinicians, giving doctors a more holistic view of their patient’s condition. The technology is being trialled at Great Ormond Street hospital from January. Mental health projects are also prominent in the top 100. Flowy is a mobile game used by around 40,000 people to manage panic attacks. Another, Talklife, is a peer-to-peer support network used by 200,000 young people globally, and 35,000 in the UK. Users can download the free app for both Android and iPhone to share their experiences safely and to help support others going through similar things. The network has multiple layers of moderation to root out any problematic users or trolls. TalkLifeConnect, which launches in three weeks, will provide instant connection to British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) accredited clinicians, so users can seek help from a qualified therapist in real time. “I started TalkLife out of my own battles,” says its developer, Jamie Druitt. “I needed to speak to people who really understood, people who had gone through similar experiences. I knew that if we could connect people around the world in a safe and moderated environment it could be a powerful first step to reach those who are not currently using mental health services. Peer support can also give people the confidence to take that next step. It’s the group of friends we all need during those darker moments in the early hours of the morning.” Four projects aim to help refugees. Refunite is a global database of more than 405,000 profiles allowing users to search for missing friends and family members. Refugees on Rails teaches refugees to code using recycled laptops. Refugees Welcome is a German non-profit organisation that matches refugees around Europe with people who have spare rooms in their homes, while Techfugees brings together IT engineers, entrepreneurs and startups with NGOs in order to use technology to help refugees. Anti-poaching tracking devices featured in the Top 100 list, as well as projects harnessing solar energy and those using technology to make women safer, from India to Idaho. It is a truly international list, with 43% of the technologies developed in Europe, 31% in the US, 13% in Asia and 8% in Africa.

It has 400 megawatts (MW) of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation under construction – more than any other nation in the region. For comparison 400MW is nearly half the capacity of an average nuclear reactor. Unlike wealthier nations, Chile is building large solar projects without subsidies, and is breaking ground with new business models. The nation is also building a number of landmark solar thermal projects, which may pave the way for broader deployment in Latin America. Solar developers have flocked to the hot, barren lands of northern Chile to take advantage of some of the best natural conditions for solar in the world. The high horizontal solar radiation in areas in and around the Atacama Desert make solar technologies more productive in these regions, translating into lower costs per unit of electricity generated. With excellent natural conditions and rising electricity demand, particularly in parts of the north, there is a sound economic rationale for building solar PV plants in Chile. However, the long-term financial advantages of solar generation do not guarantee a strong PV market in the country, or anywhere else in the world. The nations that have widely deployed solar – including Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan – did so while initially paying high prices for solar PV. Chile has not set the price of electricity from solar PV through policy the way that these nations have. What it has done to help move projects forward, is to offer a higher degree of financial security than most Latin American nations and an easier regulatory environment. Yet the growth in Chile's solar market did not happen in the way that many in the industry had anticipated. As early as 2011, European developers were pursuing solar projects on Chile's Northern (SING) grid, with the intention of selling power to mining companies. Mining is big business in Chile, and represents a large portion of the nation's electricity demand. However, mining companies have been reluctant to sign long-term agreements for a resource that could not yet guarantee a consistent supply of energy. Years passed and the number of proposed projects grew, but few if any were able to sell their power or obtain financing. This has all changed in the last nine months. More than a dozen large solar PV projects have started construction, almost all of them in northern Chile, on the nation's central grid. Most of these projects sell power to utilities, not to mining companies. And while mining companies represent much of the region's electricity demand, this means that solar PV will help to feed the growing demand for power in northern Chile and Santiago. There has been a rush of projects, including Latin America's largest solar PV plant and SunEdison's Amanecer Solar CAP, which was completed in early 2014. Even in relatively financially stable Chile, the support of development banks for these initial projects has played a role. San Andres and at least four other large Chilean solar PV projects have received loans from the World Bank's International Finance Corporation, and projects by American developers such as SunEdison and SunPower have been supported by the US Government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation. In addition to its solar PV market, Chile leads Latin America in the deployment of solar thermal technologies, including solar thermal for electricity generation (also known as concentrating solar power or CSP). Recently, with the backing of the Chilean government Spain's Abengoa began work on plant in Chile that will be the first full-scale CSP plant in Latin America and one of the largest in the world. Even more significant, the Cerro Dominador plant will be able to provide electricity on demand 24 hours per day, due to the use of thermal energy storage. This concept of round-the-clock solar electricity has been proven before with a CSP plant in Spain. Chile's Cerro Dominador however will be five times as large as Spain's Gemasolar. While what Chile is doing with solar is already impressive, it is likely to be just the beginning for the region. Mexico is not far behind, and at the end of 2013 had over 200 MW of solar PV under construction. As has been proven in other nations, large-scale deployment of solar inevitably spurs greater market adoption, which brings down costs for communities. And while no one can predict what will happen next, the future looks promising for solar in Chile and Latin America.

Open Oct-April; 8 hours trekking time The Grand Canyon, US Phantom Ranch There is only one lodging facility at the bottom of the Grand Canyon and it’s so popular that it can often be booked up more than a year in advance (note: new reservations become available 13 months out). The Phantom Ranch is a Historic Hotel of America with a nearly 100-year history welcoming visitors into the bowels of the wild west’s most iconic landmark. Built of rough-hewn wood and native stone, the ranch’s rustic cabins blend into the natural surroundings along the north side of the Colorado river near its confluence with Bright Angel and Phantom creeks. Getting here There are two approaches to Phantom Ranch. The 12km South Kaibab Trail is shorter but lacks sun-shelters and drinking water. The 16.5km Bright Angel Trail, meanwhile, is longer but safer with more facilities. You can get to Grand Canyon national park by bus from nearby cities such as Flagstaff, Phoenix or Las Vegas and use the park’s free shuttle bus system to reach either trailhead, as needed. • Cabins from $142, dorms from $49, grandcanyonlodges.com.

UN climate change summits are the opposite: they sit and discuss the risks of being first movers by transforming our energy systems to reduce emissions and protect our planet, but only the proverbial second mouse gets the cheese. Silicon Valley treasures those who take risks, fail fast and iterate – at this year’s Paris climate change summit we need to adopt more of this approach. The stance developing nations often take at international climate negotiations is that the rich got rich burning coal and oil, so why should poorer countries sacrifice their economic development for the good of future generations? Better to get rich via fossil fuels now even if we roast later, the logic seems to go, despite UN envoy on climate change Mary Robinson recently making the case for developing countries skipping straight to renewable power. Meanwhile, coal companies have successfully persuaded some developing countries’ governments to buy into the notion that fossil fuels are essential to tackle energy poverty and US Republicans have long argued the US doesn’t need to tackle its polluters until developing countries cut their own emissions.But the whole debate rests on a falsehood. The reality is that acting to protect the climate does not impose a financial penalty. Being one of the first countries drastically reducing its emissions is not a disadvantage. Both developed and developing nations are moving rapidly to renewable energy sources, not because it is morally the right thing to do, but because it’s the route to prosperity. The numbers show that there is a strong first mover advantage. South Africa is using solar and wind to meet its capacity shortfalls faster and more cheaply than new coal or nuclear facilities could. This already saved the country $69m (£63m) in 2014, created jobs and local industrial capacity. With proposed coal plants on hold because of their soaring costs, South Africa commissioned 79 renewable energy projects, totalling more than 1GW. That is roughly a nuclear power plant-sized chunk of capacity, but a new nuclear plant would take 10 years to build and cost $6 per watt according to one recent estimate. Coal, long thought of as dirt cheap, comes at $2.30 per watt. In contrast, the Chinese will be selling solar panels for $0.42 per watt this year. South Africa’s renewable capacity will hit 5.24GW within a year, up from nothing in 2012, with another 6.3GW to be commissioned in 2015. No fossil fuel technology can scale this quickly. Across the Atlantic, Brazil’s commitment to biofuels and hydroelectricity made it independent of imported oil in 2006. Since 2009, Brazil has been adding solar and wind energy, contracting 14GW of wind power at prices below any other option. In 2014, at prices only a bit higher, Brazil also brought on almost 1GW of solar energy. As the severe drought drives Brazil’s electricity prices higher, industries eager to have access to reliable and affordable power are turning to renewables. The biggest user of energy, China, is also becoming the world’s renewable energy powerhouse. Growing its installed solar capacity by two orders of magnitude within only four years, China went from a capacity of 0.3GW in 2009 to 13GW by 2013 and is now preparing to install 17.8GW of new solar energy for 2015. China burns a lot of coal, but its Green Horizons program has committed to clean the air in its cities and cut carbon intensity by 40 to 45% from 2005 levels within the next five years. So far in 2015, China’s coal imports already fell by 42% compared to 2014. As hundreds of entrepreneurs around the world bring renewable electricity to the poorest people on the planet, at prices less than they had been paying for kerosene or other fuels, the renewable power future is inevitable. Juan Rodriquez’ company, Quetsol, sells solar electric light to thousands of Guatemalan villagers beyond the reach of the electricity grid. He bundles solar panels, light, and phone charging into a mobile money system that connects poor villagers to modern finance, empowering and enriching their lives. Practical Action, founded by the author of Small is Beautiful, E F Schumacher, has done similar work for years, enabling villagers to preserve food 10 times longer through evaporative cooling, providing irrigation and renewable energy technologies, and locally-developed finance programs. Similarly, SELCO India, a solar electric light company, is delivering a renewable future today, not as aid, but as a $3m a year business with no government subsidies. With 25 centres across India, SELCO has brought to 35,000 homes and businesses inexpensive lighting, communication technology, water pumping, water heating, refrigeration, computing and power for clinics as well as for entertainment. With the ability to light even one bulb, villagers can provide light for silk worms which are needed for silk production, looms, and moveable lights that can go from room to room as needed, providing villagers with an income. Imagine a world in which no family needs to burn smoky dung or wood or oil lamps for light, where wireless digital communications are available to everyone, and where women and young people have illumination to become literate, and businesses have abundant, affordable power. Imagine societies that not only save money by investing into renewable energy production, but in doing so decrease their political dependency from oil and coal rich neighbours and improve the physical health of their citizens. This is the real first mover advantage for developing countries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/nov/13/narendra-modi-cheers-wembley-reception-india","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-13T19:30:44Z","webTitle":"Narendra Modi greeted by cheers and chants at Wembley reception","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/13/narendra-modi-cheers-wembley-reception-india","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/nov/13/narendra-modi-cheers-wembley-reception-india","fields":{"headline":"Narendra Modi greeted by cheers and chants at Wembley reception","bodyText":"“Namaste Wembley!” When a young David Cameron, shut up in his student digs listening to Supertramp, dreamed of taking Britain’s most famous stage to address a crowd of tens of thousands, this was perhaps not what he had in mind. On Friday the prime minister had that opportunity, roared on to the stage by almost 60,000 people in a reception surely unlike anything a British politician has experienced before. Unfortunately, the cheers were not for him but for his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, for whom Cameron was the brief warmup act. It heralded the conclusion of a spectacular musical and artistic reception laid on by members of the British-Indian community for a man who, while highly controversial in some quarters, is seen by many of them as a hero. Wild cheers and chants of “Modi! Modi! Modi!” echoed around the stadium as the Indian prime minister took to the stage to the pinprick lights of thousands of camera phones. Modi, who arrived in London on Thursday on his first visit to the UK since his landslide election 18 months ago, spoke to the crowd in Hindi about his plans to develop his country into an economic superpower, winning huge cheers for a pledge to make India “a country on the same level as any other”. He said: “We don’t just want charity from others. What we are looking for is equality.” He pledged to turn India into “a solar energy country”. He told the crowd: “India can take the lead in this regard. If the sun is so kind to us, then we can take the rest of the world along with us in this direction.” To mark the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi’s birth in 2019 he had two goals, he said: to deliver a country “clean” from corruption and with 24-hour electricity. Cameron lavished praise on Modi and the relationship between the two nations in his introduction, and won ecstatic applause when he called for a permanent seat for India at the UN security council. He even broke into a few phrases of Hindi, saying he was adapting Modi’s election slogan “Good days are coming” to read “Good days are definitely coming!” The government has spared little effort since Modi’s arrival in assuring him quite how welcome he is in the UK, honouring him with an invitation to address parliament, an overnight stay at Chequers and lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace on Friday. But the Wembley reception, thought to be the largest ever staged in Britain for a foreign leader, was an event of another order. This was not an official event but, in a sign of the growing confidence and muscle of the British-Indian community, a private party initiated by the multimillionaire industrialist Nat Puri and supported by corporate sponsors including the Tata group, Indian owners of Jaguar Land Rover and what was formerly Corus Steel. Organisers had promised an “Olympic-style” ceremony celebrating the best of the two nations’ cultures, and had covered the famous Wembley turf with an enormous white banner bearing traditional folk art motifs in British and Indian colours. The event even had its own theme song, performed, according to organisers, in “Hinglish, which artfully fuses the two cultures and languages together”. Cameron has made no secret of his eagerness to forge closer trade partnerships between Britain and one of the world’s fastest growing economies, making three trips to India since his election. (Modi, by contrast, visited 28 other foreign destinations before he finally felt the urge to come to London.) It was easy to forget, as streams of early arrivals battled through driving hail and wind to reach the stadium, that the man they were flocking to see was barred from Britain for a decade until 2012, following riots in Gujarat in which 2,000 Muslims died. The Hindu nationalist Modi was chief minister of Gujarat at the time and has been accused, at the least, of doing little to stop the riots. He denies any involvement. Modi’s visit has been accompanied by small but outspoken protests over his history in Gujarat and allegations of wider human rights abuses and restrictions of free speech. Small groups of protesters numbering a few hundred in total awaited those departing the stadium on Friday night, attended by a heavy police presence. Labour’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is expected to meet Modi privately on Saturday and has promised to raise the question of human rights, having called on Cameron to include the issue on his agenda before the Indian delegation arrived. But inside Wembley there was no hint of criticism among the thousands taking their seats, pausing to pose for innumerable selfies with lifesize cardboard cutouts of the Indian leader placed around the stadium. “What Modi is trying to do for India, from the economic point of view, opening it up to business, to me that is really important,” said Ketan Shah, a north London resident of 30 years who was born in Kenya into an Indian family. He said the Wembley rally showed “the substantial power of our community, how we are progressing in this country. We are a powerhouse.” Like many others present, Shah mentioned Modi’s remarkable personal ascent from humble chai-wallah, or tea seller, to prime minister as a reason for his support and, perhaps, an embodiment of what they hope Modi can do for India. Shila Morjaria had travelled from Leicester for the event, and bought a programme for her toddler grandson “so he can say when he is older: ‘My grandmama was there.’” Like almost everyone the Guardian spoke to at the event, she was dismissive of the criticisms of Modi’s human rights record. “I don’t think there’s any justice in that. People will always find a fault no matter what you do,” she said. Others admitted Modi himself was not the major draw. “For us it’s the entertainment and just being with our Indian community,” said Shamin Merali, a Muslim Londoner. Some criticisms of Modi were “also true”, she said, “but we don’t get involved in the politics. I don’t think you will find many Muslims here because of what happened in India. But you have to move on from the past.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/dec/01/cop21-the-best-climate-metaphors-from-paris","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-12-01T17:37:13Z","webTitle":"COP21: the best metaphors from the Paris climate talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/01/cop21-the-best-climate-metaphors-from-paris","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/dec/01/cop21-the-best-climate-metaphors-from-paris","fields":{"headline":"COP21: the best metaphors from the Paris climate talks","bodyText":"World leaders gathered in Paris on Monday for the crucial UN summit on climate change to negotiate a treaty to limit global warming to 2C, the widely accepted temperature threshold to avert catastrophic disasters. But in case the landmark conference was an insufficient reason to make you aware of this, then 147 heads of state and government were present to convey the weight of history with the power of language alone. While we might like them to compete with their climate change targets, first we had to be patient and let them compete with their rhetoric. Here are the best of the bunch from a day of competing metaphors. “The eyes of the world are upon us” Laurent Fabius, French foreign minister and president of COP21, got the speeches off to a promising start with the most overused metaphor of the day; happily wrung dry by politicians and activists alike. The eyes of the world are upon and there are great hopes, it is therefore for us to meet our responsibilities head on so that on 11 December we can say the world the four words the world is waiting to hear: our mission is accomplished. Chinese president Xi Jinping took up the mantle too: “Tackling climate change is a shared mission for mankind. All eyes are now on Paris.” Obama warned that it is not just eyes alive today that are watching but those from the future too. “Let there be no doubt. The next generation is watching what we do.” But head of the UN’s climate change body Christiana Figueres had to step in to remind the conference that this particular metaphor is so much more than a metaphor. “The eyes of millions of people are on you, not just figuratively but literally,” she said. Goodness knows how they would have coped had they known that extra-terrestrial eyes were upon them too. It rests on their shoulders Not to be outdone, French president Francois Hollande wanted to make sure we realise that the politicians are not only feeling the pressure in their eyes, but upon their shoulders too. Ladies and gentlemen, the hope of all humanity rests on your shoulders. The greatest danger is not that we aim too high and we miss but that we aim too low and we hit it. Here in Paris we will decide on the very future of the planet. And in their hands Figures meanwhile was more concerned about hands than shoulders. “Never before has a responsibility so great been in the hands of so few,” she worried. But Prince Charles warned delegates that they should be concerned about some very particular hands: those of French cheesemakers. Accepting that others might think it “silly” he revealed his fears: “In a microbe-free, progressive and genetically engineered future, what hope is there for the old-fashioned Fourme d’Ambert, the mal-formed Gruyere de Comte or the odorous Pont L’Eveque?” An observer on Reddit attempted to return some calm to the situation: With their hands, shoulder and eyes so weighed down, it’s a wonder any of them made it up to the podium. The planet is a patient An old un’ is a good un’. Prince Charles, back for more, chose to draw less attention to his feelings and more attention to how the the planet might be feeling. Downright ill, by any measure. “The whole of nature cries out at our mistreatment of her,” he lamented. “If the planet were a patient, we would have treated her long ago. You, ladies and gentlemen, have the power to put her on life support, and you must surely start the emergency procedures without further procrastination!” The Prince of Wales would likely have taken the top prize for rhetorical flourishes had it not been a second-hand metaphor, a shadow of its former self which appeared in a speech he made back in February when he warned that “failure to write the prescription, however, might leave us contemplating the death certificate instead.” “I have a [recurring] dream” You’ll be sad to learn it wasn’t as good as Martin Luther King’s. But it is one that keeps haunting Hungary’s president. János Áder recalled the conservation he keeps having with his unborn grandchild, who repeatedly asks with consternation: Grandpa, I grew up to be an adult in a period when the impacts of climate change posed a direct threat to human civilisation. I still have this nagging question however. Could you have stopped in your own time all that has happened by today? Why didn’t you listen to scientists? Why did you disregard scientific evidence? Unfortunately for the unborn child, Áder seems to be more of a listener than a speaker. Ader is yet to offer an answer to the persistent questions. “It was all too difficult” David Cameron’s speech seemed to be less of a speech and more of a rehearsal. Taking inspiration from Áder, the UK prime minister seemed to adhere to the rule that the magnitude of your metaphors is inversely proportional to the extent of your policies. “Let’s just imagine for a moment what we’d have to say to our grandchildren if we failed,” he pondered aloud. “We’d have to say it was all too difficult. They’d reply – well what was so difficult? Presumably we might have to say – well it was difficult to reach a binding agreement.” The grandchildren duly replied: “Why is it difficult to reach a binding agreement when in 2015 there were 75 countries across most of the continents of our world that already have legally binding climate change agreement – countries like Britain?” The dialogue continued, although the grandchildren in question did not appear to wonder why in 2015 subsides for solar energy and onshore wind were dramatically cut, why the flagship green homes scheme was given the axe or why much of the green investment bank was sold off, not forgetting the cancellation of a £1bn carbon capture and storage competition last week. Perhaps it was all too difficult. Back in the UK, the speech was not greeted with delight. “That husky must be turning in its grave,” quipped Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, in wistful remembrance of the prime minister’s iconic embrace with the dogs on Svalbard almost a decade ago. But perhaps the wisest words of the day came from the end of Barack Obama’s speech. “Let’s get to work,” he said. Yes please, let’s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2013/aug/13/solar-panels-far-right","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2013-08-13T04:10:00Z","webTitle":"How the far right developed an unlikely interest in solar energy | Giles Parkinson ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/13/solar-panels-far-right","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/13/solar-panels-far-right","fields":{"headline":"How the far right developed an unlikely interest in solar energy","bodyText":"From the day in 1986 when president Ronald Reagan pulled down the solar array that had sat briefly atop the White House, conservative politicians in the US and elsewhere have had a growing antipathy towards renewables. Many conservatives, particularly those on the far right, simply refuse to believe solar can play a useful role in modern energy systems, and paint it as an unwarranted extension of government regulation. It has frustrated many in the solar industry. “Let’s make sure that before anyone paints me as some San Franciscan, solar-company-running, ultra-left-wing-fruitcake, please know that I am assuredly not,” David Lorens, the founder of solar company One Block Off The Grid, wrote last year.“I’m a fiscal conservative, I own a gun, and capitalism is the blood that runs through my veins. So back off.” Now, in the state of Georgia, there has been a dramatic split in conservative attitudes. The local branch of the Tea Party has aligned itself with solar interests and environmental NGOs to force the monopoly utility Georgia Power to open its network to more solar power. Ironically, it has little to do with the need to with climate goals. It is being fought – as Lorens suggests – as a property rights issue, pitting private citizens against utilities, regulators and fixed rates of return. This push to elevate solar energy as an individual right is being carried by the new economic case for solar power: the plunging cost of solar modules – they have fallen 80% in the last four years – means households can install rooftop systems and lower their electricity bills. The emergence of these “prosumers” is challenging the revenue and the profit pool for network operators and fossil fuel generators. Even analysts at major investment banks describe the proliferation of solar as unstoppable. The Edison Electric Institute, a trade group that represents most investor owned utilities in the US, says solar is a direct threat to the centralised utility model, and could cause “irreparable damages to revenues and growth prospects.” This explains why lobby groups are dead set against the Georgia solar decision. Americans for Prosperity, which like the Tea Party have been nurtured and sponsored by the Koch brothers oil billionaires, is dismissing the Georgia faction as an aberration, or even more damming, as a “green Tea Party.” It has sought to turn the issue of rights on its head by arguing that rooftop solar will “infringe upon the territorial rights to the distribution grids” of the network operators. It sets the stage for an intriguing clash of two strands of conservative thought – one that remains true to its ideology of individual rights against centralised control, and the other where ideology is cherry-picked and co-opted for the protection of vested and incumbent interests. In Australia, the party divide between left and right over support for renewables has pretty much gone in lockstep with the US. Carbon pricing is opposed by conservative parties, and there is lukewarm support for renewables targets. Ultra conservative think tanks argue against them. But in Western Australia, a move by the conservative state government to tear up contracts written by its state-owned network operator Synergy, and slash the tariffs that it had agreed to pay 75,000 households, was met with a revolt by its own backbenchers and was reversed within days after an uproar from households. The decision was designed to save just $12m a year, and appears to be an attempt to shore up a deficit caused by the $300m wasted on a failed attempt to upgrade two generation units from the ageing and highly polluting Muja power stations. But a more profound issue is the rate of solar adoption by households, even without subsidies. In recent weeks, the conservative energy ministers of NSW and Western Australia – who have criticised the cost of renewable subsidies and sought to have renewable energy targets diluted or abandoned – have expressed surprise at the rate of take-up. For doctor Mike Nahan, the WA energy minister who once headed the Institute of Public Affairs, the ultra-conservative think tank which still contends that solar is expensive waste of money, this is a particular challenge. Last month, Nahan was quoted as saying some 2,000 households in WA were taking up rooftop solar each week – many in the mortgage belt, in which the conservatives see their electoral base. “People are using less power and generating electricity by themselves rather than buying it,” he said. As in Georgia, this will come down as an issue that pits individual rights against those of a state-owned monopoly. Solar has already eaten a large chunk out of day-time demand across Australia, causing a retaliation by network operators (which some governments are trying to sell), and generators. Banning or restricting solar, or changing tariffs that penalises self consumption, as Nahan and other state bodies have canvassed, would risk an electoral backlash.That message has been delivered loud and clear by the turn of events in WA."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2015/nov/28/paris-climate-summit-world-leaders-talks-france","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-28T07:01:01Z","webTitle":"Paris climate summit: world leaders told to iron out differences before talks end","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/28/paris-climate-summit-world-leaders-talks-france","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/nov/28/paris-climate-summit-world-leaders-talks-france","fields":{"headline":"Paris climate summit: world leaders told to iron out differences before talks end","bodyText":"Negotiators at key UN climate talks in Paris that open next week are being told by the French government they must iron out their main differences six days before the end of the talks, according to the foreign minister, Laurent Fabius. World leaders including Barack Obama, Xi Jinping, Angela Merkel and David Cameron are preparing to fly to the French capital to open the COP 21 negotiations, which begin on Monday and aim to produce an international deal to reduce carbon emissions that will kick in from 2020. The highly unusual demand by the French hosts is a sign of their confidence that they believe a deal is within sight and that the huge diplomatic push they have made to ensure the talks succeed has not been knocked off course by the terrorist attacks two weeks ago. But Fabius’s request to have the final version of the negotiating text signed off by next Saturday will be met with scepticism among some observers of the talks. Frequently, previous incarnations of the UN talks have finished one or even two days after deadline. Fabius vowed in an interview to forge an agreement that would be “universal, legally binding, durable and dynamic”. In the wake of the attacks, Fabius confirmed that security would be tightened around the conference centre, which is on the outskirts of Paris, near the airport where a planned attack was foiled and not far from the St-Denis district where the attacks were planned. There will be a total lockdown on the area of Paris surrounding the conference centre on Sunday afternoon, when many of the heads of state and government are expected to arrive, in time for the first official day of talks on Monday. Fabius praised the climate activists who had agreed to call off their planned march through Paris as a result of the attacks. “I have to salute the responsibility of the organisations who would have liked to demonstrate but who understand that if they demonstrate in a public place there is a security risk, or even a risk of panic.” He said: “The first week [of the fortnight-long talks] will be devoted to reducing the number of options in the text,” in which delegates have suggested multiple alternatives in wording on certain issues. “I will ask that by [next] Saturday midday the text will be transmitted to me, the president of the COP, and at that moment everyone will know where we are and the procedure to follow. Obviously, I hope a maximum number of options will have been lifted but I will have to take into account the situation at that moment.” In a veiled reference to the situation at the last climate summit in Copenhagen, when negotiations were thrown into chaos by rumours of a draft text that had been circulated to some governments, he added: “I don’t have a text in my pocket that I can pull out. I have found with the delegations that there is a real willingness to move forward, a willingness to be transparent. “If there is no agreement by Saturday, of course I will take the initiative. I will see the different groups with the facilitators,” he said. “Success is at our door, but it is not yet won.” Fabius, speaking in his resplendent office in France’s foreign ministry, was in ebullient mood. Amply gilded and frescoed, with French windows looking out on to ornamental gardens on the banks of the Seine, the ministry was built with the intention of impressing France’s many allies, and potential enemies. The French are hoping that the discord that has marked previous talks, preventing a legal agreement at the last climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009, will be averted by meticulous planning. Fabius, despite his punishing schedule since the atrocities in Paris, has been habitually squeezing questions on climate change into every meeting with his foreign counterparts and heads of state, as has the French president, François Hollande. Before the talks, governments responsible for more than 90% of global emissions – including all major developed economies and most of the biggest developing nations, such as China and India – have laid out plans for cuts or curbs to their emissions. These will form the centrepiece of any deal, and even if a deal is not reached, these commitments will be hard for governments to renege on. Fabius said the COP 21 talks were “a success in terms of numbers and actions” pledged by countries on emissions reductions. “If we add together all these contributions, we avoid catastrophe, in the form of the consequences of inaction, a world four, five or six degrees [warmer]. But we are still not at 2C or 1.5C, which is the goal of Paris.” Scientists estimate that if the world warms by more than 2C on average above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century, the effects of climate change will become catastrophic and irreversible. A 2C limit has long been the goal of UN climate conferences, and current pledges from all countries are estimated to lead to warming of 2.7C to 3C, although the proposed deal has a provision for increased emissions cuts in future. Fabius urged governments to move beyond the entrenched positions of the past. “We must do our utmost to avoid the blocking of an agreement because of irreconcilable principles. A good approach is to take this issue subject by subject.” On financing, for instance, he said there was general agreement that rich countries would ensure the funds promised to poor nations to help them cut emissions and adapt to global warming would be forthcoming. In a pointed reference to one of the countries that may hold out on an agreement, Fabius said: “I was talking to the prime minister of India and he said for the moment my resource is coal, so he is approaching this on how he can make coal more clean.” But he said that generally the world was moving towards decarbonised energy. “We must not, it seems to me, present this climate question as a constraint, but an opportunity. China is a big leader in the world on solar energy. There are lots of opportunities in different countries,” he went on. “For instance, programmes suggested for Africa – we have to help this development, it can give direct employment, and in the case of Africa can be a factor for growth.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/mar/28/georgetown-texas-renewable-green-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-28T21:02:03Z","webTitle":"Texas city opts for 100% renewable energy – to save cash, not the planet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/28/georgetown-texas-renewable-green-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/mar/28/georgetown-texas-renewable-green-energy","fields":{"headline":"Texas city opts for 100% renewable energy – to save cash, not the planet","bodyText":"News that a Texas city is to be powered by 100% renewable energy sparked surprise in an oil-obsessed, Republican-dominated state where fossil fuels are king and climate change activists were described as “the equivalent of the flat-earthers” by US senator and GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz. “I was called an Al Gore clone, a tree-hugger,” says Jim Briggs, interim city manager of Georgetown, a community of about 50,000 people some 25 miles north of Austin. Briggs, who was a key player in Georgetown’s decision to become the first city in the Lone Star State to be powered by 100% renewable energy, has worked for the city for 30 years. He wears a belt with shiny silver decorations and a gold ring with a lone star motif, and is keen to point out that he is not some kind of California-style eco-warrior with a liberal agenda. In fact, he is a staunchly Texan pragmatist. “I’m probably the furthest thing from an Al Gore clone you could find,” he says. “We didn’t do this to save the world – we did this to get a competitive rate and reduce the risk for our consumers.” In many Texas cities the electricity market is deregulated, meaning that customers choose from a dizzying variety of providers and plans. In Houston, for example, there are more than 70 plans that offer energy from entirely renewable sources. That makes it easy to switch, so in a dynamic marketplace, providers tend to focus on the immediate future. This discourages the creation of renewable energy facilities, which require long-term investment to be viable. But in Georgetown, the city utility company has a monopoly. When its staff examined their options last year, they discovered something that seemed remarkable, especially in Texas: renewable energy was cheaper than non-renewable. And so last month city officials finalised a deal with SunEdison, a giant multinational solar energy company. It means that by January 2017, all electricity within the city’s service area will come from wind and solar power. In 2014, the city signed a 20-year agreement with EDF for wind power from a forthcoming project near Amarillo. Taking the renewable elements up to 100%, SunEdison will build plants in west Texas that will provide Georgetown with 150 megawatts of solar power in a deal running from 2016 or 2017 to 2041. With consistent and reliable production the goal, the combination takes into account that wind farms generate most of their energy in the evenings, after the sun has set. Despite its proximity to the left-leaning Austin, Georgetown is not instinctively progressive. Its main selling point is the old-school charm of its historic core, which credibly bills itself as the Most Beautiful Town Square In Texas. It is not a natural political companion to Burlington, a similar-sized city in liberal Vermont that last year reportedly became the first in the US to use 100% renewable energy. Though Georgetown is home to Southwestern University, a liberal arts college, Briggs said that more than 40% of residents are over 50. The area is conservative and much of the positive reaction to the announcement has come less because the citizens are desperate to help the planet than because they are getting the security of a fixed rate plan that will be similar to the current cost of about 9.6 cents per kilowatt-hour and will protect them against the impact of fluctuations in the price of fossil fuels. Chris Foster, Georgetown’s manager of resource planning and integration, said that since the announcement he had “gotten calls from businesses as far away as California and Maryland wanting to know: what does it cost to move over here? [They say:] ‘We’re out here trying to be renewable; it’s cheaper over there to be renewable’.” He said that for manufacturing companies conscious of their carbon footprint, basing themselves in a place that offers 100% wind and solar energy would be an easy way to boost their green credentials. In a state that loves to bash Washington, what little criticism there has been, Briggs said, has stemmed from the federal tax breaks handed out to encourage renewable energy. “Well then, we should never have mass transit and quit farming … that argument, while it’s there, is really pretty shallow,” he says. Fearing an imminent end to the government’s generosity, private green energy companies have scrambled to build facilities. At the same time, in recent years a glut of Chinese-made panels has made solar power more cost-effective. And while west Texas is an oil driller’s paradise, it is also sunny and gusty, making it a perfect corridor for renewable energy. The region bordering New Mexico is one of the prime solar resource sites in the US and the wind whistles across the plains to such an extent that, as Scientific American pointed out last year, the state is America’s largest wind power producer – as well as leading the nation in the production of crude oil and the emission of greenhouse gases. Renewable energy also uses much less water than traditional power generation – a bonus in a state where half the land and more than nine million people are affected by drought conditions, though Briggs said that for Georgetown, water conservation was only a “side benefit”. Greg Abbott, formerly Texas attorney general and now governor, repeatedly sued the federal government over its attempts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Last year, the chairman of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, Bryan Shaw, said there is a “lack of links between greenhouse gases and the climate”. Shaw was appointed by former governor Rick Perry, a notorious climate-change sceptic and a prospective Republican White House candidate for 2016. Yet amid the rhetoric, denial and promotion of corporate interests and economic prosperity ahead of environmental concerns, over the past decade Texas lawmakers authorised the spending of $7bn of taxpayers’ money on the Competitive Renewable Energy Zone, a vast infrastructure project to connect west Texas wind power to major urban areas. So Texas has the weather, the infrastructure and – certainly in small places such as Georgetown – the current market conditions to be greener. But a state report last September cast a cloud over the future of renewable energy in Texas, saying it was not reliable or extensive enough to meet peak demand. “Renewables need conventional power backup,” it said. Fred Beach, assistant director for policy studies at the University of Texas at Austin’s Energy Institute, said that “at the moment, unfortunately, the legislature is pretty clueless when it comes to renewables” and is failing to get the most out of their investment. Beach suspects that Big Oil will fret that Georgetown’s pioneering move is the start of a trend, and polluting, inefficient coal power plants will be pushed out of service by more deployment of wind and solar energy. But he believes that would likely prove good news for natural gas generators, who will be relied upon in the scorching summer months when demand is highest. Ultimately, he said, in a practical-minded place like Texas, the best way to encourage the use of green energy is to appeal to heads rather than hearts and make a strong business case, as happened in Georgetown. Russ Dickson, co-owner of an antiques shop on the main square, said he was delighted at the move. “This is a pretty conservative community and to see a conservative community step up [and do this] makes me feel good about the future,” the 61-year-old said. Outside, Jon Klopf, a barber, sat on a bench enjoying a splendidly sunny Thursday afternoon. “They were just looking out for the cheapest deal. That’s just business,” the 50-year-old said. “I don’t really think we should be relying too much on oil, even though they have to right now. That don’t last forever. “Sun will, though. Long as the sun comes up, the wind will blow.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2015/nov/25/world-bank-africa-climate-business-plan-16-billion","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-25T16:35:09Z","webTitle":"World Bank calls for $16bn to help Africa weather the effects of climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/nov/25/world-bank-africa-climate-business-plan-16-billion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2015/nov/25/world-bank-africa-climate-business-plan-16-billion","fields":{"headline":"World Bank calls for $16bn to help Africa weather the effects of climate change","bodyText":"The World Bank has devised a $16bn (£10.6bn) strategy designed to help Africa adapt to climate change and prevent millions of people from sliding into poverty. By fast-tracking clean energy, efficient farming and urban protection, the measures promise to greatly increase renewable energy across the continent, bolster food production and lead to the planting of billions of trees. It is also hoped that the scheme will improve life in cities and reduce poverty, migration and conflict. The continent of nearly 1 billion people, which emits just 3% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, will be affected more than anywhere else by even the smallest rise in global temperatures, said Jim Yong Kim, the bank’s president, who will launch the Africa climate business plan at the UN climate talks in Paris next week. According to the bank, Africa needs to spend $5-$10bn a year immediately to adapt to a 2C warming, rising to $20-$50bn by 2050, and close to $100bn if temperatures increase by 4C. “Sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to climate shocks, and our research shows that could have far-ranging impact on everything from child stunting and malaria to food price increases and droughts,” said Kim. Even if warming does not exceed 2C, sub-Saharan Africa can expect large increases in poverty and malnutrition, the bank said in its report. But if temperatures rise 3-4C, which they are on course to do by the end of the century if no action is taken, heat extremes could affect 70%–80% of Africa’s land area in the summer months, and much of southern and central Africa would be at risk of severe drought. African cities are expected to be disproportionately affected. “The problem will affect a growing number of people, as the urban population of Africa is estimated to rise from its current level of 472 million to 659 million by 2025 and 1 billion by 2040. The poor will be especially hard hit,” said the bank. “Dakar experiences recurrent flooding; the 2009 floods affected almost 360,000 people and caused $100m in damages and losses. Recurrent floods in Bangui, the capital of Central African Republic, cause on average $7m in damages and losses a year. By 2025, about 66 new cities will be added to the 81 cities currently in the medium-city range. This group of cities needs support to enhance their capacity to manage climate-related risks.” The bank proposes that $500m be spent on projects to reduce deforestation and increase wildlife protection in 14 countries. It also aims to restore up to 100m hectares (247m acres) of degraded and deforested land by 2030. Much of the money needed would come from carbon funds and initiatives expected to be finalised at the Paris talks. Another $2.5bn should be spent in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Nigeria on irrigation, dams, and large-scale flood protection projects, the bank proposes. This, it hopes, could protect and provide electricity to 3 million people. In the Zambesi basin, countries like Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe would share $3.6bn in investments in hydropower, water transfers, irrigation and flood control. A further $2bn is earmarked for 20 unnamed cities to improve transport and protection against natural disasters. Nearly $8bn would be spent on solar energy by 2024, both for cities connected to the grid and off-grid communities, under the terms of the plan. It could include funds to build concentrated solar power stations, as well as money to expand the growth of mini grids and wind power. At present, 600 million people and 10 million small and medium-size enterprises in sub-Saharan Africa still do not have a connection to the electricity grid. Once one of the world’s largest investors in coal power, the bank now says it plans to develop renewable energy urgently in Africa, with dams planned in Cameroon and west Africa. “Hydropower currently provides 24% of sub-Saharan Africa’s power needs, and there is potential to increase this share to 40% over the coming years. Some 50GW of hydropower could be developed immediately, at costs of $0.01–$0.08/kWh. These prices make hydropower the lowest cost, largest scale renewable energy resource currently available to the region – with potential for transformative, growth-inducing developmental impacts,” says the report. The bank will also back and extend existing plans to increase food production. “More efficient livestock systems would increase protein availability while reducing emissions per kilogramme of meat or dairy produced. Conservation agriculture techniques would protect soils from wind and water erosion. Weather information and early warning systems would enable farmers to take better decisions, reducing risk and protecting yields in uncertain climate and weather conditions.” Because millions of people depend on rain-fed agriculture or live in drought-prone zones in urban areas in sub-Saharan Africa, climate change is intimately linked to poverty levels, said the report. “Climate variability is already exacting a heavy toll on development; future change may have catastrophic impacts, as drought, floods, and storm surges could push millions of people into poverty and prevent millions of others from emerging from it,” it says. The new funds will go some way to compensate for the fact that Africa has largely missed out on receiving funds from the UN’s Clean Development Mechanism: only about 2% of the 7,000 projects funded by the CDM were on the continent. Of the $16.1bn that the bank wants to raise, roughly $5.7bn is expected to come from the International Development Association (IDA), the arm of the World Bank Group that supports the poorest countries. About $2.2bn is expected from climate finance instruments including Climate Investment Funds, the Green Climate Fund and the Global Environment Facility. A further $2bn will be delivered through bilateral and multilateral sources, while $3.5bn is anticipated from the private sector. An estimated $0.7bn will come from domestic sources. An additional $2bn is still to be sourced. Makhtar Diop, the bank’s vice president for Africa, said the plan set out a clear path for investment in the continent’s urgent climate needs, and to fast-track the required finance. “While adapting to climate change and mobilising the necessary resources remain an enormous challenge, the plan represents a critical opportunity to support a priority set of climate-resilient initiatives in Africa.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jun/16/obama-administration-clean-energy-investment-initiative","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-16T10:00:04Z","webTitle":"Obama commits $4bn to form clean-energy investment clearinghouse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/16/obama-administration-clean-energy-investment-initiative","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jun/16/obama-administration-clean-energy-investment-initiative","fields":{"headline":"Obama commits $4bn to form clean-energy investment clearinghouse","bodyText":"With $4bn and a new government office, the White House has unveiled its latest clean energy initiative and cast a subtle new role for the federal government: not only is it a funder of new research, of the latest solar converter or biofuel source, but it is also a market builder. “One of the real challenges is the gap in financing clean energy,” said Ernest Moniz, US secretary of energy, at a press conference on Monday. “There is a continuing need for new capital investment.” The new initiative follows on a White House pledge in February to organize mission-driven renewable energy investors, concentrating their impacts and providing information to would-be investors daunted by an unfamiliar clean-energy landscape. At the press conference on Monday, Moniz and senior advisor Brian Deese fleshed out the details: $4bn in commitments from pension funds, family foundations and other so-called impact investors, and a newly unveiled office of technology transitions that will serve as an all-purpose informational resource for clean-energy investment. “We will not make investment decisions, or directly engage in them,” said Moniz, but rather provide information to help guide discussions of people not already steeped in the field. While providing information sounds nebulous, it’s arguably what renewable energy needs most now: not new breakthroughs, but something to catalyze investments that can make existing breakthroughs go mainstream. The initiative represents the latest stage in the Obama administration’s clean-energy policies. In some quarters, these are still synonymous with Solyndra, the California-based solar cell manufacturer that went bankrupt after receiving $535m from the US department of energy. Yet that reputation is mostly unfair – and not just because the loan program responsible for the Solyndra deal is expected to turn a $5bn profit. The US now leads the world in wind energy production; the price of solar energy has plummeted, and adoption jumped. The administration’s policies “made a tremendous difference in driving the cost of these technologies down”, said Nathanael Greene, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s renewable energy policy program. The challenges now, he said, are not so much technical as logistical. These range from solar-panel zoning standards to helping investors understand the clean energy investment space. It can be confusing, said Greene, particularly for investors unfamiliar with both the technology and the sorts of financial arrangements used in impact investments seeking both profit and social good. “The program will help explain the technology, the stages of investment. It will pave the research landscape,” said Greene. “This is about helping the private sector understand and invest in clean energy.” The announcement also comes just more than a year after the Obama administration announced its plan to cut carbon pollution from power plants by 30%, and with Congress having recently found rare bipartisan agreement on energy efficiency. At the press conference, several reporters pressed Moniz for details on what the new investment landscape would look like. How would the $4bn in investments differ if made independently, rather than under the auspices of the new initiative? “I can’t give you an example yet,” said Moniz, “but check back in a year. I hope I’ll have a bunch.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2015/nov/22/paris-climate-change-conference-zero-emissions-planet","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2015-11-22T17:00:09Z","webTitle":"Yes, the Paris climate change conference can save the planet | Ed Miliband","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/22/paris-climate-change-conference-zero-emissions-planet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/22/paris-climate-change-conference-zero-emissions-planet","fields":{"headline":"Yes, the Paris climate change conference can save the planet","bodyText":"“The deal’s dead.” These were the words of my chief negotiator, approximately six years ago, in the middle of the night in the final hours of the sleep-deprived Copenhagen summit. I was standing in my bedroom as I took his call, about to go to bed for the first time in 36 hours. Thanks to the efforts of a number of countries into the night and the next day, it turned out the deal wasn’t quite dead, and something did survive. But in truth, it is what has happened in the years after Copenhagen that made it not quite the disaster it appeared at the time. Slowly, steadily, the unwieldy, spatchcock UN process has rumbled on. Lessons have been learned from that chaotic episode. The idea that we should build an agreement bottom-up with countries making individual pledges, first conceived at Copenhagen, has become more serious, and every big emitter has put one forward. And now we approach next week’s Paris climate talks, the most important summit since Copenhagen, in a significantly better place than we feared back in 2009. However, we are not where we need to be. The science is even more unequivocal than it was six years ago. Just to take one example, 2015 looks like being the hottest year on record by some distance. We sometimes talk about the need to avoid dangerous warming of the planet as if it is a theoretical idea, but its effects are already here, with approaching 1 degree of warming so far. On the other side of the ledger, technology has thrown us a lifeline. The costs of wind and solar energy have come down far quicker than anyone dreamed of. The constructive side of human ingenuity is holding its own in the fight against its destructive side. And it is now demonstrably the case that the fight against climate change can be job-creating, not destroying, according to the Confederation of British Industry and many others. And what about political will? Climate change seems less politically fashionable as an issue. But China and the United States have moved forward a long way from where they were at Copenhagen. We have moved from a world where everyone said it was someone else’s problem, to one where everyone knows this can be only be solved collectively. We are not in a world of business as usual. That’s the good news. And in many senses the Paris summit looks set to represent success: every major country taking real action to reduce emissions, a substantially different path from where we would be without that action. Paris will also repeat the international commitment made at Copenhagen to limit warming to 2 degrees. But the bad news is that the pledges will still be short of what is needed. In reality, the commitments for 2030 would take us towards something like a 3-degree world. That would mean higher temperatures than at any time in the last three million years, with potentially dramatic effects of intense heatwaves, flooding and climate refugees across the world. So what can be done? Just like at Copenhagen, what matters as much as Paris is what happens afterwards. That is why countries are rightly seeking to build an upwards ratchet mechanism into the agreement. If these pledges are the start, not the final word – a prelude to greater ambition – then we can still avoid the most dangerous effects of global warming. What does this mean for Britain? The last Labour government introduced the Climate Change Act, with all-party support for an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 – the first country in the world to legislate for such deep, long-term cuts. It is essential we remain on track for this goal, including making the right decisions about the period to 2030 which will face the government in the coming months. But what the science now tells us is that we will need to go further and see a complete end to the accumulation of additional greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. The world will need to move to zero emissions at some time in the second half of the century, as President Obama and the other G7 leaders, including David Cameron, have rightly acknowledged. A point will come when the total carbon budget for the world will simply be used up. And here is the relevance as far as Paris is concerned: every excess tonne of carbon we emit between now and 2030 brings the date when we need to get to “net zero” emissions forward – the point at which any remaining emissions are balanced out by the capturing of carbon. Is zero emissions even practical, and can it be done without closing down our economy? The answer to both questions is a strong yes. Indeed, top business leaders such as Ratan Tata as well as Paul Polman of Unilever have recently called on world leaders to adopt a zero emissions goal in Paris. So how can it be done in the UK? It is about a 100% clean energy supply. It is about making our energy system more efficient and productive. It is about the right infrastructure. And, to cancel out residual emissions from agriculture and industry, it is about capturing carbon from the atmosphere, for example through reforestation and by the use of carbon capture and storage technology. Already cities and companies are adopting the zero emissions goal. The right step now would be for Britain to become the first major country to enshrine net zero emissions in law, with the date determined by advice from the independent Committee on Climate Change. This would be consistent with the government’s support for zero emissions at G7 level and would show our determination to face up to this existential challenge. It will provide an essential framework for business and government so that we make the right decisions now on key energy and infrastructure issues. And it will inspire the inventors, engineers and businesses that can deliver on this challenge. From my conversations with people across the House of Commons, including the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, Caroline Lucas of the Greens and Conservatives such as Nick Hurd and Graham Stuart (chair of Globe, the international parliamentarians group on climate change), it is clear there is cross-party support. Paris must be the start of a journey of the whole world towards this goal. And far from this commitment holding Britain back, we can be a leader again on climate change. Leadership which does not mean harm to our economy, but will put us ahead in the race for the new jobs, businesses and advantages of this new world. I hope the government will support this initiative. We can build an alliance, put aside our party differences as we have before, and seize this moment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2016/jan/22/austerity-saudi-style-cheap-oil-nudges-riyadh-toward-economic-reform","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2016-01-22T14:51:09Z","webTitle":"Austerity, Saudi-style: cheap oil nudges Riyadh toward economic reform","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/22/austerity-saudi-style-cheap-oil-nudges-riyadh-toward-economic-reform","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2016/jan/22/austerity-saudi-style-cheap-oil-nudges-riyadh-toward-economic-reform","fields":{"headline":"Austerity, Saudi-style: cheap oil nudges Riyadh toward economic reform","bodyText":"In the Faisaliyah mall in central Riyadh, the call to midday prayers brings down the shutters on shops selling luxurious global brands and the basement mosque fills up. Customers are routinely searched at the entrance – a woman guard in a niqab, black abaya and white gloves sits by the metal detector. Cafes and restaurants have mixed “family sections” to ensure privacy. Harvey Nichols is having a holiday sale. Business seems slow, though visitors look in vain for any serious sign of Saudi Arabia’s gathering economic crisis, born of the lowest oil revenues in decades and subsidy cuts to reduce a $98bn budget deficit – 15% of the country’s GDP. The price of petrol has just gone up by 60%, though it is still dirt cheap, and VAT and other taxes are planned – significant novelties in a country where most people have not known such things in their lifetimes. “There isn’t much economic pressure here because we deal with rich people,” laughs Tamer, an affable Egyptian who lost his clerical job with a Saudi construction company and now sells timeshares in Dubai. Beyond the Faisaliyah’s marbled halls, however, many government projects have stopped, expenditure has been slashed and rents have risen sharply. The housing shortage is a major preoccupation. Khaled, a taxi driver touting for custom at Riyadh’s international airport, manages to keep his family comfortable with the help of an army pension, but he worries what will happen when all subsidies end in five years. Mohammed, a fifty-something from Medina who has 10 children, moonlights on top of his undemanding government job, and his wife also works in an effort make ends meet. “Look,” he says. “There’s a war in Yemen. Of course it causes economic problems, but it’s not so bad.” For some, however, it is. Just a few miles from the city centre, near walled royal estates, mothers and children huddle outside over makeshift fires to save electricity and take the chill off a winter’s evening. Poor Saudis, badly educated and ill-equipped to compete with foreign workers, are not a contradiction in terms. An estimated 2 to 4 million of King Salman’s 21 million subjects live beneath the poverty line – a challenge to every cliché about the oil-rich kingdom, and to prospects for future reform. Salman’s first year on the throne saw oil prices drop to below $35 a barrel, and even if they recover longterm, demand is shifting. The growing scale of shale oil production in the US is a major factor. Iran’s re-entry into the market after the lifting of sanctions related to its suspected nuclear weapons programme will also boost an existing supply glut. Mohammed is right. The conflict in Yemen is reportedly costing $6bn a month and shows no sign of ending any time soon. By any reasonable assessment, leaner times lie ahead. “It was OK when you could throw money at a problem,” muses Hisham Alhegelan, the CEO of a solar energy company. “But when you have to start counting the pennies, the pennies matter.” Austerity, Saudi-style, means the wealthy are talking about emptying their swimming pools, swapping gas-guzzling SUVs for something greener and even turning off the air conditioning when they travel abroad. Change is being driven by the king’s ambitious and powerful son, the deputy crown prince and defence minister, Mohammed bin Salman. The idea is to raise non-oil revenue without hindering competitiveness and causing unrest. “Everyone used to say subsidies were a political taboo and that if you increased the price of water, gasoline and electricity there would be revolution,” says John Sfakianakis, a Greek economist who has advised the Saudi government. “Well, people are not out in the streets, but that doesn’t mean the government will be complacent and forget about the average citizen.” After years of over-spending, the 2016 budget bears the stamp of Bin Salman’s quest for innovation. There is also rare transparency, including the revelation that military and security expenditure makes up 25% of the total. Talk is rife of improved governance and the use of key performance indicators to monitor a multi-year strategy of the kind employed by Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Ministers have come and gone with unusual speed, generating wry jokes about brisker management style. News that even the state oil behemoth Saudi Aramco may be sold off has underlined the scale of an effort that will include an increase in the private provision of healthcare and education. The word khaskhasa, Arabic for privatisation, is being bandied around. Vast tracts of land could be up for grabs, along with lucrative untapped mineral resources. Tackling corruption and job creation are also being highlighted. None of these ideas are new. Subsidy reform has been discussed for years and VAT came up in 2012, but Salman’s predecessor, King Abdullah, then still raking in healthy oil revenues, vetoed it. Now a sales tax is on the way, by agreement with the other five members of the Gulf Cooperation Council. So are “sin” taxes on fizzy drinks, which may help to tackle the country’s obesity problem. Further subsidy cuts seem certain. Key details are expected with the publication of a heavily flagged “national transformation plan”, drawn up with the help of McKinsey and other blue-chip consultants. “With some tweaking they can do a lot to raise revenue from non-oil sources and use it to invest and pay salaries,” says Sfakianakis. “They can’t let themselves believe that one day oil prices will rise again and the Saudi economy will recuperate. They don’t want to let luck or Allah decide their future.” Saudis recognise the universal truth that economic reform will have political consequences. “People will expect something in return,” says the historian Mohammed Al Zulfa, a veteran of the appointed Majlis al-Shura or consultative council. “The government takes all the oil revenue, and there is huge government expenditure. But if Aramco does go to the private sector and you introduce taxes, people will ask ‘what’s in it for me?’ “If the king says the Majlis al-Shura has the authority to question ministers or check the budget, then maybe things will be different. But unfortunately our society is not ready for that. Saudi education does not promote the right to participate. We need more time.” The view that change needs to be slow and cautious appears to be widely shared. “No one talks about income tax so the representation-taxation equation is inapplicable in the Saudi case,” argues Saud al-Tamamy, a political scientist at King Saud University. “And the word representation has a different meaning here.” If there is to be greater public participation in decision-making it is likely to be incremental, agrees Haifa al-Hababi, a Riyadh architect who stood in the recent municipal elections – the first time Saudi women were allowed to vote. Failure to win a seat has not deterred her, and she is already demanding more accountability from her local council. “In Saudi Arabia and the Gulf we are selfish,” she said. “It’s all about what people get from the government. We treat the government as a father who must look after us. Prince Mohammed is doing what Thatcher did in Britain. That is a part of the solution, though it is not just an economic problem but a political one too.” Saudi dissidents, some of them Muslim Brotherhood sympathisers who call for constitutional monarchy, are behind bars, intimidated into silence or in exile, so it is hard to gauge the level of support for far-reaching change. Democracy is not discussed on the street, and the elite appear to have no interest in it. The maximum that seems likely is “the habit-forming effect” of limited political participation rather than any “grand departures”, in the words of one academic expert. “Why would you want representation if you have a good standard of living and the government is responsive?” asks Alhegelan. “If we were a democracy I don’t think I’d live here because it would be dominated by fundamentalists. Look around the countries that were autocracies and tried to be democracies and are now in ruins. That was the Arab spring. And this is Saudi Arabia.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2017/jul/27/watching-ice-melt-inside-nasas-mission-to-the-north-pole","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-07-27T05:00:40Z","webTitle":"Where global warming gets real: inside Nasa’s mission to the north pole","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/27/watching-ice-melt-inside-nasas-mission-to-the-north-pole","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2017/jul/27/watching-ice-melt-inside-nasas-mission-to-the-north-pole","fields":{"headline":"Where global warming gets real: inside Nasa’s mission to the north pole","bodyText":"From the window of a Nasa aircraft flying over the Arctic, looking down on the ice sheet that covers most of Greenland, it’s easy to see why it is so hard to describe climate change. The scale of polar ice, so dramatic and so clear from a plane flying at 450 metres (1,500ft) – high enough to appreciate the scope of the ice and low enough to sense its mass – is nearly impossible to fathom when you aren’t sitting at that particular vantage point. But it’s different when you are there, cruising over the ice for hours, with Nasa’s monitors all over the cabin streaming data output, documenting in real time – dramatising, in a sense – the depth of the ice beneath. You get it, because you can see it all there in front of you, in three dimensions. Imagine a thousand centuries of heavy snowfall, piled up and compacted into stone-like ice atop the bedrock of Greenland, an Arctic island almost a quarter the size of the US. Imagine all of modern human history, from the Neolithic revolution 12,000 years ago – when humans moved from hunting and gathering to agriculture, and from there, eventually, to urban societies – until today. All of the snow that fell on the Arctic during that entire history is gathered up in just the top layers of the ice sheet. Imagine the dimensions of that ice: 1.71m sq km (656,000 sq miles), three times the size of Texas. At its belly – from the top layer, yesterday’s snowfall, to the bottom layer, which is made of snow that fell out of the sky 115,000-130,000 years ago – it reaches 3,200 metres (10,500ft) thick, nearly four times taller than the world’s highest skyscraper. Imagine the weight of this thing: at the centre of Greenland, the ice is so heavy that it warps the land itself, pushing bedrock 359 metres (1,180ft) below sea level. Under its own immense weight, the ice comes alive, folding and rolling in solid streams, in glaciers that slowly push outward. This is a head-spinningly dynamic system that we still don’t fully understand – and that we really ought to learn far more about, and quickly. In theory, if this massive thing were fully drained, and melted into the sea, the water contained in it would make the world’s oceans rise by 7 metres (23ft). When you fly over entire mountain ranges whose tips barely peek out from under the ice – and these are just the visible ones – it’s possible to imagine what would happen if even a fraction of this quantity of pent-up freshwater were unleashed. You can plainly see how this thing would flood the coasts of the world, from Brooklyn to Bangladesh. The crew of Nasa’s Operation IceBridge have seen this ice from every imaginable angle. IceBridge is an aerial survey of the polar regions that has been underway for nearly a decade – the most ambitious of its kind to date. It has yielded a growing dataset that helps researchers document, among other things, how much, and at what rate, ice is disappearing from the poles, contributing to global sea-level rises, and to a variety of other phenomena related to climate change. Alternating seasonally between the north and south poles, Operation Icebridge mounts months-long campaigns in which it operates eight- to 12-hour daily flights, as often as weather permits. This past spring season, when I joined them in the Arctic, they launched 40 flights, but had 63 detailed flight plans prepared. Operation IceBridge seeks to create a continuous data record of the constantly shifting ice by bridging – hence the name – data retrieved from a Nasa satellite that ended its service in 2009, called ICESat, and its successor, ICESat-2, which is due to launch next year. The Nasa dataset, which offers a broad overview of the state of polar ice, is publicly available to any researcher anywhere in the world. In April, I travelled to Kangerlussuaq, in south-west Greenland, and joined the IceBridge field crew – a group of about 30 laser, radar, digital mapping, IT and GPS engineers, glaciologists, pilots and mechanics. What I saw there were specialists who have, over the course of almost 10 years on this mission, mastered the art and science of polar data hunting while, at the same time, watching as the very concept of data, of fact-based discourse, has crumbled in their culture at home. On each flight, I witnessed a remarkable tableau. Even as Arctic glaciers were losing mass right below the speeding plane, and even as raw data gleaned directly from those glaciers was pouring in on their monitors, the Nasa engineers sat next to their fact-recording instruments, sighing and wondering aloud if Americans had lost the eyes to see what they were seeing, to see the facts. What they told me revealed something about what it means to be a US federally funded climate researcher in 2017 – and what they didn’t, or couldn’t, tell me revealed even more. * * * On my first morning in Greenland, I dropped in on a weather meeting with John Sonntag, mission scientist and de facto field captain for Nasa’s Operation IceBridge. I stood inside the cosy weather office at Kangerlussuaq airport, surrounded by old Danish-language topographical maps of Greenland, as Sonntag explained to me that the ice sheet, because of its shape, can generate unique weather patterns (“the ice isn’t flat, it’s curved,” he said, making a little mound shape with his hands). The fate of the polar ice has occupied the last decade of his life (“I’m away from home so much – it’s probably why I’m not married”). But at pre-flight weather meetings, polar ice is mostly of concern to him for the quirky way it might affect that day’s weather. The figure in Sonntag’s mind this morning isn’t metres of sea rise, but dollars in flight time. The estimated price tag for a flight on Operation IceBridge is about $100,000; a single hour of flight time is said to cost $10-15,000. If Sonntag misreads the weather and the plane has to turn back, he loses flight time, a lot of taxpayers’ money, and precious data. I would come to view Sonntag as something of a Zen sage of atmospheric conditions. He checks the weather the moment he wakes in the morning, before he eats or even uses the bathroom. He told me that it wasn’t simply about knowing “what the weather is”. With weather, there is no “is”. What’s needed is the ability to grasp constant dynamic change. “What I’m doing,” he said, “is correcting my current reading against my previous one” – which he had made the last possible moment the night before, just before falling asleep. “Basically, I’m calibrating.” The machine that he is calibrating, of course, is himself. This, as I would learn, was a pretty good summary of Sonntag’s modus operandi as a leader: constantly and carefully adjusting his readings in order to better navigate his expedition’s shifting conditions. Nevertheless, despite the metaphorical implications of his weather-watching, Sonntag was ever focused on the literal. At the weather meeting, I asked him about his concern over some low cloud cover that was developing – a situation that could result in scrubbing the flight. Was his concern for the functionality of the aircraft’s science equipment, its ice-penetrating radars, its lasers and cameras? On that day, as it turned out, Sonntag was more worried about pilot visibility. “You know, so we don’t fly into a mountain,” he explained, without taking his eyes off the blobs dancing across the monitors. “That kind of thing.” A few weeks before I met Sonntag, a reporter had asked him: “What makes this real to you?” The question had startled him, and he was evidently still thinking about it. “I honestly didn’t know what to say,” he told me. Sonntag cuts a trim, understated figure in his olive green Nasa flight suit, fleece jacket and baseball cap, and his enthusiasms and mellow ironies tend to soften his slow-burn, man-on-a-literal-mission intensity. I could imagine how a reporter might miss the underlying zeal; but get to know Sonntag and you’ll learn why, even three weeks later, that question was still rattling around his head. “I’m still kind of at a loss, to be honest,” he told me. “What makes it real? I mean, wow, where do I start?” It is indeed a strange question to ask someone who was once on a high-altitude flight when temperatures fell so low that the plane’s fuel turned solid, almost sending it straight down into Antarctica, directly on to the ice, in the middle of the darkest of nights. Each of the 63 flight plans for this season in the Arctic was the result of months of meticulous planning. A team of polar scientists from across the US sets the research priorities, in collaboration with flight crews, who make sure the routes are feasible; the mission is managed from Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Sonntag is there at every phase, including at the construction and installation of the scientific instruments, and he is the person in the field responsible for executing the mission. He is supposed to have a plan for every contingency: if the plane goes down on the ice, he’s got plans for that, too. He is responsible for making sure that his crew have adequately backed up and stored many terabytes of data, and that their own creature comforts are taken care of. On days off, he cooks gumbo for them. The reporter probably had something else in mind. The melting of ice, the rising waters, and all the boring-seeming charts that document the connections between the two – what makes that real? To Sonntag and his crew, it is as real as the data that they have personally helped fish out of the ice. Sea levels, which were more or less constant for the past 2,000 years, have climbed at a rate of roughly 1.7mm a year in the past century; in the past 25 years, that rate has doubled to 3.4mm a year, already enough to create adverse effects in coastal areas. A conservative estimate holds that waters will rise roughly 0.9 metres (3ft) by the year 2100, which will place hundreds of millions of people in jeopardy. Given the scale of sea- and ice-related questions, the vantage point that is needed is from the air and from space, and is best served through large, continuous, state-supported investments: hence Nasa. There is a lot we don’t know and a lot that the ice itself, which is a frozen archive of past climate changes, can tell us. But we need the eyes to see it. * * * First built during the cold war to track Russian submarines, the P-3 Orion aircraft, a four-engine turboprop, is designed for long, low-flying surveillance missions. IceBridge’s P-3, based at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, is armed with a suite of instruments mounted under the plane and operated by engineers sitting at stations in the cabin. A laser altimetry system – which bounces laser beams from the bottom of the aircraft to the top of the ice and back – determines the height and topography of the uppermost layer of ice; a digital mapping system takes high-resolution photos of the ice, helping us see the patterns in which it is changing shape; and a radar system sends electromagnetic pulses through the ice, thousands of feet – and a hundred thousand years – to the land beneath. This data shows us where the ice is growing and where it is shrinking, and helps researchers determine its current mass. The IceBridge data has also helped create a 3D map of an ice-locked land that no human eyes have ever seen: the territory of Greenland, its mountains, valleys, plains and canyons, and also a clear view of the layers of ice that have grown above it. Nasa repeats its IceBridge flights annually, to chart how the ice changes from year to year, and, by comparison with earlier satellite data, from decade to decade. For the integrity of the data, it is best to repeat the flights over exactly the same terrain. The path of each IceBridge flight must adhere to a line so narrow that they had to invent a new flight navigation system, which Sonntag cannot help but describe with boyish glee (“We basically trick the plane into thinking it’s landing!”). In trying to grasp how the ice works, it’s necessary to know the shape of the underlying terrain: in places where the land slopes up, for instance, we know that ice will flow slower. IceBridge data helped discover and chart a canyon in northern Greenland the size of the Grand Canyon. In addition to being a wondrous discovery in its own right, this was useful in understanding where, and how, the ice is moving. One effect of this giant canyon system can be seen at the coast, where sea water can seep into cavities, potentially melting lower layers of ice. Other aerial data has shown how glacier fronts, which served as corks holding back the ice flow behind them, have diminished and unleashed the flow, causing more ice to flush into the sea at increasingly rapid paces. Fantastic 3D maps of the ice sheet created with IceBridge data have also helped researchers locate rare, invaluable Eemian ice, from more than 100,000 years ago. This was an era when the Earth was warm – similar to today – and in which the seas were many feet higher, which resembles the world to which we are headed. By drilling deep into the ice, glaciologists can excavate ice cores containing specks of materials such as volcanic ash, or frozen bubbles that preserve precious pockets of ancient air that hold chemical samples of long-departed climates. Because of IceBridge data, researchers know where to look for these data-rich ice layers. These are among the reasons that John Sonntag’s head hurts, and why he doesn’t know where to begin or what to think when people ask him what makes this real for him. Behind even well-meaning questions is a culture of ignorance, or self-interested indifference, that has made it easy for a Republican-led, corporation-owned US government to renege on the Paris climate agreement, to gut the Environmental Protection Agency, and to slash billions of dollars of climate change-related funds from the federal budget this year. When the White House recently proposed cuts to Nasa’s climate-change research divisions, the media helped them along by burying the story under speciously positive headlines: “Trump’s Nasa budget supports deep space travel,” crowed CBS News. The world’s coasts are facing catastrophic sea rise, but at least Americans can look forward to watching their countrymen grill hot dogs on Mars. * * * The US built Kangerlussuaq’s airfield in the early 1940s, and they still maintain a small airbase there. In 1951, America built a giant fortress on the ice, Thule Air Base, in north-west Greenland – strategically equidistant from Russia and the US –where it secretly kept armed nuclear weapons. In one of naval history’s most ambitious armadas, the Americans cut through the ice, created a port, and effected a conquest second in scope only to the D-day invasion. And all they had to do was uproot an Inuit settlement. The US’s history in Greenland gives the lie to the notion that ice research is inherently peaceful, much less apolitical. Glaciology advanced as a field partly through the work of US scientists serving the needs of their country’s rapidly growing nuclear war machine in the 1960s, helping to build Camp Century, a fabled “city under ice” in northern Greenland – and designing Project Iceworm, a top-secret system of under-ice tunnels nearby, which was intended as a launch site for hidden nuclear missiles. In 1968, at the height of the war in Vietnam, a nuclear-armed B-52 crashed near Thule. A fire, started when a crewman left a pillow over a heating vent, resulted in four atomic weapons – hydrogen bombs – plunging into the ice, and releasing plutonium into the environment. When our flight landed in Kangerlussuaq, we passed quickly through passport control, but our bags were nowhere to be found. For 40 minutes we could see the one and only commercial plane at this airfield’s one and only gate just sitting on the tarmac, with our bags still in it. This wasn’t a serious problem – Kangerlussuaq’s one hotel was just up a short flight of steps from the gate – but it did seem odd that the bags hadn’t come through customs. Another passenger, sensing my confusion, approached me. “Yankee?” he asked. “Yankee,” I replied. Customs, the man told me, was actually just one guy, who had a tendency to mysteriously disappear. “By the way,” he added conspiratorially. “You know customs here has a special arrangement with the Americans.” The customs guy, the stranger told me, turns a blind eye to liquor headed to the US Air Force bar on the other side of the airfield. Kangerlussuaq (population 500), or as the Yanks prefer to call it, Kanger, still feels like a frontier station. Most locals work either at the airport or at the hotel. Next to the airfield’s main hangar, local people house the huskies that pull their sledges. The roads of Kangerlussuaq can be dicey; there are no sidewalks. Once you leave the tiny settlement, there aren’t roads at all; and if you go north or east, of course, there’s only ice. Decommissioned US air force Jato bottles – jet boosters that, to the untrained eye, resemble small warheads – are ubiquitous around Kangerlussuaq, usually as receptacles for discarded cigarette butts. In the hotel cafeteria you can see American and European glaciologists, greeting each other with surprise and hugs, because the last time they met was a year or two ago, when they ran into each other at the other pole. When I finally got my bag, I made my way down to the 664 barracks, where the crew was staying. But before I met the crew, I met the data itself. In a small, slouchy barracks bedroom, near the front door, I encountered two Nasa servers. IT engineers could, and often would, sit on the bed as they worked. The window was cracked open, to cool the room and soothe the crackling servers, whose constant low hum, like a shaman’s chant, was accompanied by the pleasant aroma of gently baking wires – one of the more visceral stages of the daily ritual of storing, transferring, copying and processing data captured on the most recent flight. After years of listening to Americans “debate” the existence of data demonstrating climate change, it was comforting to come in here and smell it. When I first arrived, I found one of the IT crew, dressed in jeans, T-shirt and slippers, and with big, sad, sleepy, beagle eyes, reclining next to the server, his feet up on a desk, chowing on a Nutella snack pack. He explained the irony of his struggle to keep the servers happy in the far north. A week earlier, when IceBridge was operating its northern flights from Thule Air Base, they couldn’t seem to find any way of getting the server room’s temperature down: “We’re in the Arctic, but our problem is finding cold air.” For a moment he paused to consider the sheer oddness of life, but then he shrugged, and polished off his Nutella snack. “But we just chug on, you know?” he said. This attitude captured something essential about IceBridge: it’s scrappy. It’s the kind of operation in which the engineers are expected to bring their own off-the-shelf hardware back-ups from home. (As one radar tech told me: “if your keyboard breaks in the Arctic, you can’t just go to Walmart and buy a new one.”) More than one crew member described IceBridge’s major piece of hardware, its P-3 aircraft, as “a hand-me-down”. When the Nasa crew talked about their P-3 they sometimes sounded as though they were talking about a beloved, oversized, elderly pet dog, who can act dopey but, when pressed, is surprisingly agile. IceBridge’s P-3 is 50 years old, but as one of the navy pilots told me, “they baby the hell out of it”. It just got a new pair of wings. I got the strong sense that this climate data gathering operation was something of an underdog enterprise – the moodier sibling of Nasa’s more celebrated deep-space projects. But these unsung flights are not without their own brand of Nasa drama. The IceBridge crew would tell me, with dark humour, the story of the time a plane was in such dire straits that everyone aboard was panicking. One man was staring at a photo of his children on his phone, and in his other hand, was clutching a crucifix. Another man was pinned to the ceiling. Someone actually yelled “We’re gonna die!”, like in the movies. John Sonntag, on the other hand, sat there, serenely assessing the situation. During my time in Greenland in April this year, I didn’t witness Sonntag manage a distressed aircraft, but I did watch him carefully navigate a Nasa crew through a turbulent political season. In the week I was there, the group was preparing for two anxiety-provoking scenarios, courtesy of Washington, DC. One was an imminent visit from several members of Congress. As one engineer put it to me, “We just get nervous, honestly, because we don’t know what these politicians’ agenda is: are they friend or foe?” The other was an impending shutdown of the entire US federal government: if Congress didn’t make a decision about the budget by Friday that week, the government would close all operations indefinitely. (The sticking point was budgetary questions related to Trump’s proposed border wall.) If the government shut down, Operation IceBridge was done for the season; the Nasa crew would be sent home that day. This had happened before, in 2013, just as IceBridge was en route to Antarctica. Congressional Republicans shut down the government in their effort to thwart Obama’s diabolical plot to offer medical care to millions of uninsured Americans. Much of the 2013 mission was cancelled, with millions of dollars, many hundreds of hours of preparation, and, most importantly, critical data, lost. “I still can’t really talk about that without feeling those emotions again,” Sonntag told me. “It was kind of traumatic for us.” The crew of IceBridge was facing an absurd scenario: living in fear of a shutdown of their work by Congress one day and, shortly thereafter, having to smile and impress members of that same Congress. * * * Conditioned by the tribulations of modern commercial airline travel, I was unprepared for the casualness of my first Nasa launch. The feeling in the hangar before the flight, and as the crew prepared to launch, was of shift workers who are hyper-attentive to their particular tasks and not the least concerned with gratuitous formalities. The flights were long and the deployments were long; the key to not burning out was to pace oneself and to not linger over anything that wasn’t essential. Everyone was a trusted pro and nobody was out to prove anything to anyone else. Shortly before our 9am takeoff, I asked Sonntag what the plane should feel like when everything was going well – what should I be looking for? He smiled sheepishly. “To be honest, if you see people sleeping, that’s a good sign.” On the eight-hour flights, seeing engineers asleep at their stations meant the instruments below their feet were happily collecting data. For some stretches, there wasn’t even data to collect: hours were spent flying between data target sites. (Over the intercom, a pilot would occasionally ask, “Hey, we sciencing now or just flying?”) Flight crew, who attend to the plane but are not directly connected to the data operation, occupied the cabin like cats, curled up proprietarily, high up on fluffy, folded-up engine covers. This pervasive somnolence – the hypnotic hum of the propellers, the occasional scene of crewmen horsing around in their flight suits, which gave them the look of boys in pajamas – coupled with the low-altitude sweeps through fantastic mountains of ice, gave the whole situation a dreamlike quality. From the windows of the P-3, at 450 metres, you don’t need to have read anything about glaciers to know what they are. At that low altitude, you can see the deep textures and the crevasses of the ice, and just how far the glacier extends across the land. The eye immediately grasps that the ice is a creature on the move, positively bursting ahead, while also not appearing to move at all, like a still photo of a rushing river. Seeing the polar ice from above, you get a very different view from that seen by writers in past centuries, who saw this landscape, if at all, by boat or, more likely, from a drawing. But the vision, to them, was clear enough: it was the End, the annihilating whiteness of death and extinction. Herman Melville described this colour as the “dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows – a colorless all-color of atheism from which we shrink”. This is where so many of those old stories terminated. The Arctic is where the monster in Frankenstein leaps off a ship on to the ice, never to be seen again. Polar settings spell doom for Poe’s sailors, and Captain Nemo, who are pulled into the icy maelstrom. And celebrated real-life travellers did, in fact, die gruesomely on the ice, in search of the Northwest Passage, or the north pole. But, from the window of Nasa’s P-3, that old narrative seems inaccurate. Consider that whiteness, which so terrified Melville and Poe, who ends his Antarctic saga The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym with a horrifying italicised refrain on the word “white”. But polar snow and ice, precisely because it is white, with a quality known as high albedo, deflects solar energy back into space and helps keep earth’s climate cool; the loss of all this white material means more heat is absorbed and the earth warms faster. In a variety of other ways, including moderating weather patterns, the ice helps makes life on earth more livable. The extreme conditions of the poles, so useful for instilling fear in 19th-century readers, actually make the world more habitable. Our bias against the poles can be detected even in that typical term of praise for this icy landscape, “otherworldly”. This description is exactly incorrect: the Arctic is intimately connected with every other part of the planet. This, too, is something you can see. Flying over it, at a low altitude, I was struck by the familiarity of the thing, how much of Greenland was a visual echo of my northern homelands. In the muscular frozen ripples of its glaciers, created by an intensely pressured flow, I saw the same strong hand that deeply etched those giant scratches into the big boulders of Central Park in New York City. This isn’t an analogy: those marks in Manhattan were made by shifting ice, the very same ice layers that still have a foothold in Greenland. I grew up, and have spent most of my life, in Ohio and New England, places that were carved out by that ice: ponds originally made of meltwater from the last great ice age, low hills smoothed over by retreating glaciers. That old ice gave shape and signature to almost every important place in my life, and in the lives of so many others. And, in the future, this ice will continue to shape the places we’re from, right before our eyes. It is only our ignorance that makes us call it otherworldly. * * * But even as we passed through this landscape, even as the lasers and radars took their deep gulps of data from the ice, I could hear expressions of anxiety from the data hunters. “At the same time that we’re getting better at gathering this data, we seem to be losing the ability to communicate its importance to the public,” one engineer told me four hours into a flight, during a transit between glaciers. You can hear this anxiety surface in the humour floating around the crew. I heard one engineer joke that it might be easier to just rig up a data randomising machine, since many people out there seem to think that’s what their data is anyway. “I mean, it’d be much easier, and cheaper, to do maintenance on that,” he pointed out. In another conversation, about how to increase public awareness about climate change in the US, I asked one of the senior crew members whether they would welcome a writer from Breitbart aboard one of these flights. “Oh, absolutely,” he said. “I’d love for them to see what we’re doing here. I think sitting on this plane, seeing the ice, and watching the data come in would be incredibly eye-opening for them.” His optimism was inspiring and worrisome to me. The mantra of the crew is “no politics”. I heard it said over and over again: just stick to the job, don’t speak above your pay grade. But, of course, you don’t need to have a no-politics policy unless your work is already steeped in politics. Speaking with one of the scientific researchers mid-flight, I got a very revealing reply. When I asked this researcher about the anthropogenesis of climate change, the tone changed. What had been a comfortable chat became stilted and deliberate. There was a little eye-roll toward my audio recorder. Suddenly my interlocutor, a specialist in ice, got pedantic, telling me that there were others “more qualified to speak” about rising sea levels. I offered to turn off my recorder. As soon as it was off, the researcher spoke freely and with the confidence of a leading expert in the field. The off-the-record view expressed wasn’t simply one of sober agreement with the scientific consensus, but of passionate outrage. Of course climate change is related to human activity! We’ve all seen the graphs! The tonal difference between this off-the-record answer and the taped answer – that I should consult someone else – told me all I needed to know. Or so I thought – the researcher then asked me to turn my recorder back on: there was one addendum, for the record. “Richard Nixon,” the researcher said, looking down at the red “recording” light. “Nixon established some good climate policy. There’s a tradition in both parties of doing this work. And, I mean, if Nixon … ” The researcher laughed a bit, realising how this was sounding. “Well, that’s what I’m hanging my hopes on, anyway.” Over the plane’s open intercom, there was suddenly, and uncharacteristically, talk of the day’s headlines. While we were in flight, people around the world were marking Earth Day by demonstrating in support of climate rationality and against the current US regime. On Twitter, #MarchForScience was trending at the exact moment Nasa’s P-3 was out flying for science. There was even a local protest: American and European scientists took to the street of Kangerlussuaq for a small but high-profile demonstration. While it was happening, one of the engineers piped up on the P-3’s intercom. “Anyone else sorry to be missing the march?” But the earnest question was only met with silence and a few jokes. Among the Nasa crew, there had been some talk about trying to do a flyover of the Kangerlussuaq march, to take an aerial photo of it, but the plan was nixed for logistical reasons. The timing was off. The senior crew seemed relieved that it was out of the question. * * * Later that week, after my second and final flight – making a total of 16 hours in the air with Nasa – the crew retreated to the barracks for a quick “science meeting”, beers in hand, followed by a family-style dinner. “We don’t seem to get enough of each other here,” one of the engineers told me, as he poured a glass of wine over ice that the crew had harvested from the front of a glacier the day before. One of the engineers asked a glaciologist about the age of this block of ice, and frowned at the disappointing reply: it probably wasn’t more than a few hundred years old. “Well, that’s still older than America, right?” he said. Outside, the sky wasn’t dark, though it was past 10pm. In a couple of months, there would be sunlight all night. After dinner, one of the crew’s laser technicians lounged on a couch, playing an acoustic version of the song Angie over and over again, creating a pleasantly mesmerising effect. Two crew members talked of killer methane gas. But most sat around, drinking and telling stories. One of the pilots tried to convince someone he had seen a polar bear from the cockpit that day. “These deployments are tiring,” someone told me. “Bullshitting is critical.” One of the crew spent his off-days on excursions with a camera-equipped drone, and had made spectacular videos of his explorations, which he edited and set to moody Bush tunes. I joined the crew as they gathered around his laptop to watch his latest. There was something moving in seeing these people – who had spent all day, and indeed many months and years, flying over ice and obsessing over ice-related data – now spending their free time relaxing by watching videos of yet more ice. As usual, politics soon crept into the picture. The next video that popped up was footage recently shot at the Thule base. The video showed some of this same Nasa crew hiking through an abandoned concrete bunker, a former storage site for US Nike anti-aircraft missiles. Today it’s just an eerie, rusted, shadow-filled underground space, its floor covered in thick ice. When these images came on the screen, the crew fell quiet, watching themselves, only a week ago, putting on ice skates and doing figure-eights over the ruins of their country’s cold war weapons systems. An engineer chipped a shard off the frozen block harvested the day before. Perhaps sensing my mood, he dropped it into a glass and poured me some whiskey – over ice older than America – and said: “Well anyway, maybe this’ll cheer you up.” Early the next morning, before the crew boarded the P-3 for another eight-hour flight over polar ice, a rare political debate broke out. Four of the crew were discussing the imminent Congressional visit, which prompted one of the veteran pilots to recite, once again, the mission mantra: “Stick to science: no politics.” But because that approach felt increasingly less plausible in 2017, one of the ice specialists, feeling frustrated, launched into a small speech about how Americans don’t take data seriously, and how it’s going to kill us all. Nobody disagreed. Someone jokingly said: “Maybe it’s best if you don’t fly today.” To which another added, “Yeah, you should stay on the ground and just do push-ups all day.” Finally, John Sonntag – who had been too busy reviewing flight plans to hear the chatter – stood up and tapped his watch. “OK guys,” he said. “Let’s go. It’s time to fly.” Main image: Nasa/Joe MacGregor • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/jun/23/weak-sun-could-offset-some-global-warming-europe-us-study","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T15:00:08Z","webTitle":"Weak sun could offset some global warming in Europe and US – study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/23/weak-sun-could-offset-some-global-warming-europe-us-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/jun/23/weak-sun-could-offset-some-global-warming-europe-us-study","fields":{"headline":"Weak sun could offset some global warming in Europe and US – study","bodyText":"Global warming in northern Europe and the eastern US could be partially offset in future winters because of the sun entering a weaker cycle similar to the one which enabled frost fairs to take place on the river Thames in the 17th and 18th century, according to new research. However, the study said any potential weakening in solar activity would have only a small effect on temperature rises at a worldwide level, delaying the warming caused by emissions from cars, factories and power plants by around two years. The sun has been in a period of high activity for the past few decades. But scientists believe there is now as much as a 20% chance of a weaker period of activity, known as a grand solar minimum, occurring in the next 40 years. “Even if you do go into Maunder minimum conditions it’s not going to combat global warming, the sun’s not going to save us,” said lead author Sarah Ineson at the Met Office. The Maunder minimum is the name for the sun’s weak period during 1645-1715, when the Thames froze solidly enough for eyewitnesses to report horse-driven carriages crossing it. Climate change means such sights in the second half of the century would not occur, since the sun’s cooling effect would only reduce manmade temperature rises in northern Europe and the eastern US by 0.4-0.8C. Such offsetting was not a “large signal”, Ineson said, although the study found there would be more frosty days in those regions than there would be without the weaker solar activity. Northern Europe and the eastern US would experience a much stronger cooling effect from a weaker period of the sun’s activity than other areas because less ultraviolet solar energy at the top of the stratosphere would cause a chain reaction which would affect the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO is a climate phenomenon which plays a key role in influencing winter weather on both sides of the Atlantic. Another consequence of a changing NAO would be to make storms more southerly, bringing more rainfall to southern Europe and slightly lessening the drying trend the region is set to experience because of climate change. However, the effect is expected to be relatively small. Globally, a grand solar minimum would reduce temperatures by just 0.1C between 2050 and 2099. Manmade climate change, by contrast, is expected to bring temperature rises of around 3.75C in the same period if drastic action is not taken to cut carbon emissions. Such a high level of warming would bring grave consequences as seas rise, drought threatens water supplies and food production suffers, scientists have warned previously. “This research shows that the regional impacts of a grand solar minimum are likely to be larger than the global effect, but it’s still nowhere near big enough to override the expected global warming trend due to man-made change,” said Ineson. Asked if the findings of her study gave European and US political leaders an excuse for weaker action on cutting emissions, Ineson said the reaction should be exactly the opposite, as it did not change the bigger picture on climate change. The paper, Regional Climate Impacts of a Possible Future Grand Solar Minimum, is by a UK and US team based at Cambridge, Oxford and Reading universities, as well as the Met Office and the University of Colorado in Boulder, and published in the journal Nature Communications."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2015/may/01/tesla-announces-low-cost-solar-batteries-elon-musk","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-01T08:21:30Z","webTitle":"Tesla announces low-cost batteries for homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/01/tesla-announces-low-cost-solar-batteries-elon-musk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2015/may/01/tesla-announces-low-cost-solar-batteries-elon-musk","fields":{"headline":"Tesla announces low-cost batteries for homes","bodyText":"The electric car company Tesla has announced its entry into the energy market, unveiling a suite of low-cost solar batteries for homes, businesses and utilities, “the missing piece”, it said, in the transition to a sustainable energy world. The batteries, which will retail at $3,500 in the US, were launched on Thursday at a Tesla facility in California by the company’s ambitious founder, Elon Musk, who heralded the technology as “a fundamental transformation [in] how energy is delivered across the Earth”. Wall-mounted, with a sleek design, the lithium-ion batteries are designed to capture and store up to 10kWh of energy from wind or solar panel. The reserves can be drawn on when sunlight is low, during power cuts or at peak demand times, when electricity costs are highest. The smallest “Powerwall” is 1.3m by 68cm, small enough to be hung inside a garage on or an outside wall. Up to eight batteries could be “stacked” in a home, Musk said, to applause from investors and journalists at the much-anticipated event. The batteries will initially be manufactured at the electric car company’s factory in California, but will move production to its planned “gigafactory” in Nevada when it opens in 2017. The Nevada facility will be the largest producer of lithium-ion batteries in the world, and it is hoped its mass-production scale will help to bring down costs even further. It is not the only battery storage system on the market, but the Powerwall boasts a relatively high storage capacity, a competitive price, and the heft of investment and excitement generated by Musk’s vision. The entrepreneur, who helped to invent the online payment system PayPal, has also founded a private space company, Space X, and is experimenting with a high-speed public transport system called Hyperloop. Musk also unveiled a larger “Powerpack”, a 100kWh battery block to help utilities smooth out their supply of wind and solar energy - which is generated intermittently - or to pump energy into the grid when demand soars. He said on Thursday about two billion Powerpacks could store enough electricity to meet the entire world’s needs. “That may seem like an insane number,” he said. “But this is actually within the power of humanity to do.” Deutsche Bank estimates sales of battery storage systems for homes and businesses could yield as much as $4.5bn in revenue for Tesla. The energy storage industry is expected to grow to $19bn by 2017, according to research firm IHS CERA. Tesla is currently taking orders for the systems, with the first units expected to shift in August."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2015/feb/25/plantwatch-snowdrops-flowers-bulbs-galantamine","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-02-25T21:30:00Z","webTitle":"Paul Simons on a popular spring flower and where to find it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/feb/25/plantwatch-snowdrops-flowers-bulbs-galantamine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2015/feb/25/plantwatch-snowdrops-flowers-bulbs-galantamine","fields":{"headline":"Plantwatch: Snowdrops are in their element","bodyText":"The cold weather hasn’t helped bring on spring flowers, but lesser celandines are coming into bloom, especially in southern England. These relatives of buttercups have glossy yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves, and the flowers also have the uncanny knack of swivelling round to track the sun like little solar energy dishes, trapping the sun’s warmth to entice early insects into the flower; but when skies turn overcast and rain threatens the petals close shut. Snowdrops are now at their best and most widespread in many damp places, especially in wet woods and on the banks of streams, their drooping white bell flowers nodding and swaying in the wind and smelling sweet of vanilla or honey. They are able to survive the cold of winter and flower so early because they grow from bulbs, and most colonies of snowdrops in Britain reproduce by their bulbs dividing, rather than being pollinated by insects. They aren’t native to Britain and were only recorded growing in the wild in the 1770s, probably after escaping from gardens. They became fashionable in the mid 19th century and in recent years something of a snowdrop mania has developed with record prices paid for the bulbs. Snowdrops, and their relatives the daffodils, are also grown for a drug called galantamine, named after Galanthus nivalis, the scientific name for snowdrop. The drug is used for the treatment of early stages of Alzheimer’s disease and works by boosting the levels of a nerve-transmitter involved in sending signals between nerve cells in the brain.

Nearly the same number took part in similar events in 161 countries across the globe. For 24 hours, the sun did not set on the largest climate protest in history. These grassroots activists are part of a powerful global movement for change that has continued to grow as crucial UN climate talks in Paris in December have drawn nearer, bolstered by interventions from other important global voices – Pope Francis, Graça Machel, Desmond Tutu and Mary Robinson, to name a few. The pope last week repeated his message of climate justice and change to world leaders at the UN. Crucially, that change is now beginning to take hold, with clean energy on the march and the low-carbon economy becoming a reality on the ground, rather than just a PowerPoint aspiration. It is against this backdrop that the Guardian is launching the next stage of its climate change campaign as our team of environment correspondents around the world champion a rare commodity in the climate change debate – hope. There is hope in the many voices who are now calling for action from their leaders. There is hope in the rapidly falling cost of renewable energy that is starting to transform our dirty energy system. There is hope in the pledge by G7 countries to phase out coal power. There is hope in the communities and innovators around the world who are getting on with the job rather than waiting for the politicians. In short, the world is beginning to get to grips with the biggest problem it faces, but has arrived at a crossroads. Powerful forces are still at work against a meaningful agreement in Paris. So those who believe that climate change needs urgent solutions cannot let up the pressure. More of that later. First a recap. Six months ago, the Guardian took a stand on climate change with an editorial push and campaign. The intention was to highlight the uncomfortable fact that a large proportion of the oil, coal and gas reserves that states and companies already hold have to stay untapped in order to avoid dangerous climate change. It is estimated that the world can afford to burn between one-fifth and one-third of proven reserves before there is a reasonable chance of tipping the planet over the 2C danger threshold of warming. Uncomfortable is putting it mildly. As our reporting has sought to demonstrate, the implications of this analysis are huge for our economies, the stability of our financial system and the way we live our everyday lives. The project has also sought new and better ways to cover the biggest and most important issue of the age – one that affects so much else that the Guardian’s journalists around the world report on every day. Extreme weather, food and water shortages, conflict, migration, energy bills, technology and many other issues are influenced by the steady march of climate change. Aside from making a big investment in investigative journalism and reportage from locations as diverse as the Arctic, China, Brazil, Australia and South Africa, the Guardian also launched a campaign in partnership with the NGO 350.org to persuade the world’s two largest health charities – the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust – to move their investments out of fossil fuel-producing companies. The Guardian’s own commercial board took the decision to divest its £800m fund from coal, oil and gas. There was always a broader context, however – the Paris climate talks. In December, governments will attempt to thrash out a deal that many hope will chart a course to transforming the world’s dirty energy system and so keep at bay the worst consequences of climate change. Keep it in the ground phase one began to turn up the heat on politicians in advance of those talks by highlighting the stratospheric growth of the fossil fuel divestment movement. In 43 countries, more than 400 organisations with a collective worth of $2.6tn – including Stanford University, the Church of England, the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund and the Australian city with the largest coal port on the planet – have made commitments to move their investments out of fossil fuels. This is civil society putting serious money where its mouth is – something those involved in the talks have noticed. With just over two months to go until the talks it is right that we shift the focus of the campaign. We will continue to highlight the message that the majority of fossil fuels must be kept under the ground and to make the divestment case to the Wellcome Trust and Gates Foundation. But it is time for a new direction. Naturally, the journalistic focus now moves to the talks themselves. Which countries are the heroes and which the villains? Will the deal be fair to the poorest nations? Most importantly, can the agreement save the world? Despite a relentless diplomatic push by the French hosts to make the talks a success, an ambitious agreement is far from certain. Notwithstanding the importance of the UN process, focusing solely on Paris would be to tell only part of the story. One of the most significant features of the Keep it in the ground campaign so far has been the response from Guardian readers. More than 226,000 of you have signed up as supporters from more than 170 countries – and you have been central to what we and 350.org have done. You bombarded us with ideas for stories to cover. Hundreds of you wrote well-informed and often moving letters to the Wellcome Trust board requesting divestment. Many of you took part in a video appeal direct to Bill Gates. And numerous others in his home town of Seattle have joined the cause with their own campaign. Nearly 1,000 health professionals – including the editors of the British Medical Journal and the Lancet – signed a letter urging health organisations to “do no harm” and divest their assets on grounds of medical ethics. Thank you for your support so far. So when deciding where Keep it in the ground should go next it made sense for us to ask this global movement where they wanted us to shift the focus. Naturally, there was a range of ideas but one clear message kept coming through time and again. It can be summed up in one word – hope. Supporters told us they wanted to hear more about the positive climate stories – the new technologies that are capturing the sun’s energy even more efficiently; the rapid drops in the price of renewable energy; the currently off-grid communities in Africa that are developing clean power; the smart technology helping homeowners to use less energy. Another message that came through was a desire to hear about the other side of the divestment coin. If you take your money out of the problem, where should you put it to be part of the solution? We’ve heard about “divest”, now what about “invest”? Above all, you told us that even though the Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust have not yet chosen to move their investments, the Guardian must not give up on the climate issue. With global warming so high on the world agenda, it would be wrong to abandon the momentum that Keep it in the ground has created. So a major strand of our climate coverage up to Paris and beyond will be about climate change as a story of hope. That doesn’t mean wilfully ignoring the gravity of the situation we face. Far from it. The Guardian will continue to report on the science of climate change, visit the places around the globe that will experience the worst impacts and uncover bad corporate behaviour and misinformation where it happens. But we will also make a point of bringing positive stories to the fore. In particular, the next phase of Keep it in the ground will champion the amazing growth of solar power and its potential to transform the global energy supply. Since the disappointing outcome at the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, the cost of solar panels has dropped by about 70% and continues to fall, meaning that solar is now as cheap or cheaper than fossil fuels in some countries. In Queensland, Australia, last year, wholesale energy prices went negative during the day for the first time because of the expansion of solar installations to more than 350,000 rooftops across the state. There was so much power on the grid its price crashed. In the US, solar is the fastest-growing source of power with residential rooftop installations up 70% year on year. And politicians there have woken up. Last month, President Obama announced measures to encourage more take-up by home owners. He was speaking in a Las Vegas casino that has 20 acres of solar panels on its roof. Hillary Clinton has made solar a big part of her pitch for the presidency with a pledge for half a billion panels across the country. Republicans too – even those who don’t regard climate change as a problem – are seeing the potential of solar to give households energy independence and security. “Rooftop solar makes it harder for terrorists to render a devastating blow to our power grid,” says Debbie Dooley, who was one of 22 organisers of the first nationwide Tea Party protest in 2009. Around the world, far-sighted countries are helping investors to put serious money into solar. A few months ago, a deal was signed in conflict-riven Burundi for a solar field that will provide 15% of that country’s energy-generating capacity. Tanzania has a plan to give a million homes access to solar energy by the end of 2017. Bangladesh aims to expand solar power to every home by 2021. Morocco plans to build five big new solar plants by 2020 at a cost of $9bn (£6bn) and become a major energy exporter to Europe. Technology improvements can and will help drive this transition by making clean energy cheaper, but we are no longer waiting for some mythical breakthrough invention to solve climate change. Many of the tools already exist. With so much momentum behind clean energy around the world, it is all the more jarring that the British government is going in the opposite direction. With the opposition distracted, the Conservatives have moved to systematically remove support for renewable energy. The government is consulting on subsidy changes that will make it essentially uneconomic for people to install solar panels on their roofs. The Australian government too has acted as a brake on solar energy when we need an accelerator. In the coming weeks and months, the Guardian will increase its reporting all of these developments and more. We will look in detail at the potential for solar power and the obstacles it faces. And campaign supporters will continue to play a crucial role. The Guardian will ask readers what you want to see covered and we’ll bring you closer to the experts who can help answer your questions. We will be at the Global Climate March in Paris on 29 November and will give information on what individuals around the world can do to get behind the climate movement. So whether you are already a supporter of Keep it in the ground or whether you are seeing the Guardian’s campaign for the first time, please sign up to find out more. By doing so, you will receive regular updates on our coverage and the progress of the campaign, as well as an opportunity to participate and influence the direction we take. This is the most exciting and hopeful time for anyone interested in solving the biggest problem that humanity faces. As Pope Francis put it in his encyclical on the environment in June: “All is not lost. Human beings, while capable of the worst, are also capable of rising above themselves, choosing again what is good, and making a new start … to embark on new paths to authentic freedom.” That new start is already rising from the dirty energy system we inherited from the 19th and 20th centuries but for now it is just that – a start. It is only with unrelenting pressure from below that world leaders will continue with enough purpose on the right path. The time is now.

India has so far resisted calls for an ambitious target, citing the millions in the country who do not have access to energy and the need to pull those people out of poverty. Instead, it has suggested that it may make two climate pledges: one that can be achieved with domestic resources, and another that would be possible with financial and technological aid from the developed world. Christiana Figueres said India’s pledge was vital. “It is one of the very large developing countries and it will be very important to see what their trajectory on energy is going to be and, in particular, how they are planning to provide energy to 400 million un-electrified people in india.” India has promised to submit its own lower-carbon blueprint soon, but on Thursday ruled out setting a date for peaking its emissions – as China has done. Rather, the country’s pledge would be “much more ambitious” than the world expected, India’s environment minister, Prakash Javadekar said. So far, 44 countries have sent the UN their offers of emissions cuts, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), and that number is expected to double by the end of September, taking in 75-80% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Figueres praised China for its INDC which was announced last week. Beijing has promised to peak its emissions before 2030 – and curb carbon intensity by 60-65% from 2005 levels. “It shows the leadership that China has been taking for quite a while both individually in climate negotiations but also as part of a broader effort to work strategically with other countries, for example in collaboration with the US,” she said. Beijing was “pushing the envelope” on environmental measures – and the timing of its announcement during premier Li’s visit to Paris was particularly appreciated, she added. Per capita, China’s emissions at 20 tonnes are around 10 times higher than India’s. Figueres played down suggestions that the Paris deal might include measures to directly curb extraction of fossil fuels – such as an extraction cap on oil from Saudi Arabia. This would not be on the cards, she said, but pointed to statements from Ali al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, suggesting a shift to solar energy as soon as 2040 as signs for hope. “They fully understand that they shouldn’t be using their own oil to produce electricity as it is a waste of that resource, and they know that they don’t have an eternal timeline to be using that oil. They need to be moving to understand themselves as an energy exporting country, not just an oil exporting country.” More broadly, the global oil and gas business has been stepping up its lobby efforts ahead of the Paris summit. Earlier this month, Figueres posted a response to a call from the six big European oil and gas majors for more carbon pricing, that was seen by some as her issuing a coded warning to the oil industry not to lobby against a deal at Paris. But she stressed that decisions in Paris would be taken by governments, and not corporates. “You can’t blame the fossil fuel companies for trying to use their relationships with governments for the purposes of their industry. That’s what they’re expected to do. But with the information we now have on climate change – and the effect of fossil fuels on the world’s economic and social stability, it is certainly to be expected that they will want to be a part of the solution,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/2014/dec/09/we-want-the-black-hole-of-sunlight-solar-power-breaks-new-frontiers","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-09T16:54:41Z","webTitle":"'We want the black hole of sunlight': solar power breaks new frontiers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/dec/09/we-want-the-black-hole-of-sunlight-solar-power-breaks-new-frontiers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/2014/dec/09/we-want-the-black-hole-of-sunlight-solar-power-breaks-new-frontiers","fields":{"headline":"'We want the black hole of sunlight': solar power breaks new frontiers","bodyText":"Sunlight is the most abundant renewable energy source on earth and humans have found some ingenious ways to harvest it into food, warmth, and power. A recent report from the International Energy Agency found that by 2050 the sun could be the largest source of electricity, ahead of fossil fuels, wind, hydro and nuclear. The decreasing cost of photovoltaic cells has also made the prospect of solar electricity going mainstream more realistic. And recent innovations have fine-tuned solar technology, making it more efficient, cheap and eco-friendly. Along with a team in Australia which has developed solar ink cells that can be printed on to plastic, and Mercedes-Benz which has unveiled a car coated in solar paint, here are six innovations that show the range of possibilities for using sunlight. Cradle to cradle solar panels Solar panels are usually considered a clean way of generating power, and this development makes them even more sustainable. The world’s first and only Cradle to Cradle (C2C) certified solar panels were launched last month by the US-based SunPower Corporation. All panels produced at its plant in Mexicali, Mexico, have achieved the silver level award, which requires proof of a fully sustainable manufacturing process. C2C is a set of principles that measures product quality in terms of material health, material reuse, renewable energy, water stewardship and social fairness. SunPower does not use cadmium chloride or cadmium chemicals, which are known to be harmful and are used in some solar panels. The company has a reuse and recycling programme to deal with panels at the end of their life and ensure that parts that can’t be reused are handled by certified recyclers. “We wanted to help our customers make their homes as environmentally sustainable as possible. Our products are now fully recyclable and we use geothermal and other forms of renewable energy to make them. In order to get the award, we had to make sure all our suppliers use materials with a low risk of toxicity so they can be recycled safely,” says SunPower’s chief operating officer Marty Neese. Concentrated solar power A team at the University of California, San Diego, have developed a new nanoparticle paint that makes concentrated solar power (CSP) plants work more efficiently. CSP uses mirrors and heat to generate electricity within sunny regions. Hundreds of thousands of mirrors direct sunlight to a tower where molten salt gets so hot it produces steam, driving a turbine and generating electricity. Unlike photovoltaic technology, CSP works when it’s cloudy or dark. The nanoparticle paint absorbs and converts to heat more than 90% of the sunlight it captures and can withstand temperatures of over 700C. This addresses one of the main difficulties of CSP – the short lifespan of solar receivers in the tower due to heat damage. “We wanted to create a material that absorbs sunlight that doesn’t let any of it escape. We want the black hole of sunlight,” says Professor Sungho Jin from University of California San Diego’s Jacobs School of Engineering. SolarLeaf An apartment block in Hamburg is the world’s first to use sunlight to make heat and fuel using algae. The BIQ house has a photobioreactor façade known as SolarLeaf, developed by Colt International and SSC Ltd and designed by Arup engineers and Splitterwerk architects. The photobioreactor is a series of glass panels containing living micro-algae plants, which are supplied with nutrients, as well as CO2 which is produced on site. The algae absorbs daylight and CO2, photosynthesises, and generates heat of 40C that warms the building. The algae is later harvested and fermented to make biogas fuel to provide power and heat. As the algae expands in sunlight, it also shades the building during sunny periods. Dr Jan Wurm, Arup’s Europe research leader, explains: “The SolarLeaf biofacade is a way of storing solar energy to use as fuel later. It’s a pilot project with data being collected on energy production and usage until mid 2015.” Feedback from the residents of the 15 flats has been positive. Some have reported how calming it is to sit on the balcony and watch the bubbles rising. Solar restaurant A solar cooker works by concentrating the suns rays in a large metal parabola, creating a hotspot warm enough to cook food. The device is not new but Finnish chef Antto Melasniemi and Catalan designer Marti Guixe have taken it to a new level with an entire restaurant run on pure solar energy. For the past four years, they have taken their outdoor solar kitchen (with up to 12 solar cookers) across Europe, creating pop-up restaurants. The project finished in Leeds in September 2014 where Melasniemi picked up a British Street Food Award. Solar cooking is not just for hot countries in summer; Melasniemi produced meals in snow-bound Helsinki in temperatures of -15 celsius. “Traditional restaurants try to control and exploit nature. In our kitchen, nature is controlling the restaurant. The concept tests people’s flexibility” explains Melasniemi. Guixe adds: “We did it as an experiment, but it is completely realistic to have a restaurant based on the sun.” Solarbox Two London-based social entrepreneurs are turning some of London’s iconic red phone boxes into charging points for mobile phones. The first green phone box, known as a Solarbox, was launched last month in London’s busy Tottenham Court Road area, and 10 more will follow by April 2015. The project’s founders are London School of Economics 2014 graduates Harold Craston and Kirsty Kenney, who came second in the Mayor of London’s Low Carbon Entrepreneur of the Year Award. The solarbox has a 150W Solbian flexible solar panel mounted on its roof that connects to a USB phone charger inside. Phone charging is free to the public, funded by adverts that play while people wait. A month after it launched, the Solarbox is seeing an average of 80 users per day. Visitors generally spend between five and 10 minutes charging, suggesting a boost rather than a full charge. “The fact that solar panels have come down in price has helped make a project like this possible,” says Craston. “It’s also a great way of reclaiming public space.” The Current Table Designer Marjan van Aubel, a graduate of London’s Royal College of Art, has created an elegant piece of furniture that charges phones. During the day the orange glass Current Table turns indoor light into electricity, storing it in hidden batteries. When the batteries are full, phones are plugged into USB ports and they charge at the normal speed. The design was made possible by the development of dye-sensitised solar cells produced by Solaronix. They work by copying the process of photosynthesis in plants, using colour to harness the sun’s energy. The advantage is that they work indoors, unlike classic solar cells which require direct sunlight. “The bigger the surface you have the more efficient it is. It’s best to avoid piling stuff on top while the batteries are charging. So it encourages people to keep a clear and tidy surface, which is another benefit” van Aubel explains. The project is getting close to the production stage – so we may soon see Current Tables in boardrooms, restaurants and libraries. Solar water disinfection This is not strictly speaking a technological innovation but it is a brilliant way of saving lives. The sun’s ability to kill bacteria has been known about for more than 30 years. Solar water disinfection (SODIS) involves simply putting water into transparent plastic bottles and leaving them in the sun for up to 48 hours. The combination of heat and UV rays from the sun kill bacteria, so even if the water is still brown it is safe to drink. A team led by Professor McGuigan of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, and including Dr Jacent Asiimwe and Dr Rosemary Nalwanga, has been spreading knowledge about the process in the Lwengo district in south-west Uganda for the past four years. They have been researching the use of the SODIS method in schools, in the home and in the community. “SODIS really has proved to be a cost effective method of providing safe drinking water for communities in African countries,” says Professor Mcguigan. “The next step is to get wider buy-in from various communities in Uganda and other African countries where people do not have access to safe drinking water.” Alice Grahame is a freelance journalist with an interest in sustainability and innovation.

The proposed 5MW solar farm will provide enough electricity for all 760 homes in Balcombe and the 500 homes in nearbyWest Hoathly. Community energy advocacy group 10:10 is assisting Balcombe’s residents to make the project a reality. Leo Murray, a campaigner for the organisation, said the villagers had been on an unanticipated journey since energy company Cuadrilla arrived in 2013 with plans to drill for oil. The shale gas and oil explorers were met with a series of divisive protests that culminated in Green MP Caroline Lucas being arrested, and thrust the quiet hamlet to the centre of the UK’s fracking debate. “The community were forcibly engaged with UK energy politics. It wasn’t something they chose – it was just something that happened to them,” said Murray. “It opened up real fractures in the community which hadn’t been there before. It had been a fairly harmonious place up until then.” He said solar had played a part in reuniting the village. At a meeting in May the project was supported by 87.5% of attendees. Joe Nixon, a local spokesman for the solar project, said: “When we first started this project, we wanted to turn our so-called ‘fracking village’ 100% solar. Some people thought it was crazy. But now it looks like we could make that target comfortably, and have some electricity to spare for our neighbours too.” The plan follows smaller installations that had been funded entirely by the community. But the new £5m solar installation will require an entirely different level of finance. A local share offer will seek to raise as much of the total as possible, and Murray said a crowdfunding campaign would offer donors from across the country long-term returns in order to make up any shortfall. He believed the goodwill generated by Balcombe’s difficult recent history would spur the campaign. The entire cost averages out to under £5,000 per household This is less than the price of an average household solar installation but the quantity of electricity produced will be much greater. Community energy projects are disadvantaged by UK government legislation, Murray claimed. Households who want to buy in cannot apply for government-supported loan schemes, as they can with rooftop solar. More importantly, said Murray, solar installations are not allowed to sell directly to their neighbours. Even though the power they generate will be used in the local area, the electricity will have to be sold to national energy companies, which will then sell it back to locals at the standard mark-up. Murray said this situation was archaic compared to many other European countries and does not account for the savings in transmission costs that come from generating electricity close to where it is used rather than in large, far-away power stations. In another blow to the solar industry, the European court of justice decided on Thursday that the UK’s lower tax rate on energy-saving devices and solar panels was against EU rules. The ruling could force the UK government to raise the VAT on these items from 5% to 20% or face penalties from the EU. The Cameron government, which promised in the Queen’s speech last week to block any VAT increases, said it was considering its options."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2015/sep/08/canning-byelection-the-complete-and-completely-unofficial-guide-to-the-candidates","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-07T23:53:32Z","webTitle":"Canning byelection: the complete (and completely unofficial) guide to the candidates","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/08/canning-byelection-the-complete-and-completely-unofficial-guide-to-the-candidates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2015/sep/08/canning-byelection-the-complete-and-completely-unofficial-guide-to-the-candidates","fields":{"headline":"Canning byelection: the complete (and completely unofficial) guide to the candidates","bodyText":"The 19 September byelection, triggered by the sudden death in July of sitting MP Don Randall, has attracted a motley slate of candidates. We’ve compiled a handy form guide for those following at home, presented in ballot paper order. 1. Vimal Sharma, Palmer United party Clive Palmer is unlikely to have any loyalty concerns about Palmer United party candidate Vimal Sharma. The Canning candidate, who had a failed tilt at the Western Australian seat of Cowan in the 2013 general election, is a senior executive with Palmer’s flagship company, Mineralogy, who, the Australian suggested, “was once suspected [in a judgment of a closed-door inquiry leaked to the Australian] of feigning chest pains as a ruse to avoid being grilled under oath over claims of a major alleged fraud” when in fact he had mild anxiety. Palmer, on PUP’s website, described his lieutenant as “a family man who believes Western Australia is getting a raw deal,” who “has the guts to stand up for Western Australians”. Sharma, for his part, said he’ll fight to increase WA’s share of the GST. PUP is arguably stronger in Western Australia than in any other state, with the WA senator Dio Wang the lone person left in the party room alongside Palmer. Palmer says Sharma will be over in Canberra to interrupt Wang’s lonely cups of tea for one soon, but the polls say otherwise: PUP got 6.9% of the primary vote in Canning in 2013, but the latest Newspoll has it on 2% this time around. 2. Connor Whittle, Liberal Democrats Twenty-two-year-old libertarian Connor Whittle has been keeping a low profile. The party’s website describes him as a “guitar-playing, globe-trotting draftsman” who aims to raise the party’s profile in WA – and, presumably, advocate for its policy positions, which include relaxing gun laws, ceasing all foreign aid except humanitarian relief and legalising cannabis. Whittle is not on Twitter, but his Facebook profile, which doesn’t seem to be set up for campaigning, describes him as an “enthusiastic amateur”. (It also features a profile picture which prompted Helen Dale, senior adviser to the Liberal Democratic senator David Leyonhjelm, to comment: “There are women and gays in Canning who will vote for you on the strength of your dimples. Truth.”) 3. Michelle Allen, Pirate party Michelle Allen is a Perth-based software developer who has the advantage, which not all candidates share, of actually having lived in Canning. She is nominally campaigning on the party’s core policies of digital rights and civil liberties (her profile boasts “we know how to use the internet”), but her real pitch is an opportunity to stick it to the major parties. The Pirate party has been crowdfunding to pay for her campaign, which does not yet appear to have begun in earnest. Allen has pointed out that 19 September, the date of the byelection, also happens to be international Talk Like a Pirate Day, just in case that influences anyone’s vote. 4. Greg Smith, Australian Defence Veterans party Greg Smith worked as a journalist for almost two decades, starting as a copy boy at the Sydney’s Daily Mirror (since absorbed into the Daily Telegraph). He joined the Australian army as a public relations officer in 1986, switching to the army reserve after three years. In 2001 he began active service, serving in East Timor and rising to the rank of major before leaving the defence force in 2009. According to the ABC, Smith hadn’t heard of the Australian Defence Veterans party before the Canning byelection was announced. Which is fair enough: the party only formed after the 2013 federal election, making Smith its first candidate. His first media statement as a candidate was a release claiming the byelection was “unnecessary”, arguing the House of Representatives should apply the same rules as the Senate when a member retires or dies, which would see his opponent and fellow veteran, Andrew Hastie, summarily appointed to the seat. 5. Katrina Love, Animal Justice party Katrina Love is the coordinator of the animal rights group Stop Live Exports. She describes herself as a social progressive but says animal welfare is “the one issue that keeps me awake at night, the one issue that brings me to despair and often to tears”. The Animal Justice party was formed by a Sunshine Coast professor, Steve Garlick, and registered as a political party in 2011. It has one elected representative: Mark Pearson, who was elected to the New South Wales upper house on preferences in April. This is the second time Love has stood as a candidate for the party (she ran for the Senate in 2013) and her expectations are understandably low. On her Facebook page she says: “We won’t pretend we have any hope of winning this federal lower house seat, but you can send a strong message to the three major parties that animals matter and they aren’t doing enough, by placing AJP first.” 6. Andrew Hastie, Liberal party Until three weeks ago, the 32-year-old former Special Air Service Regiment captain Andrew Hastie lived in army housing in the Perth suburb of Shenton Park, 40km from the boundary of the Canning electorate, with his wife and newborn. The young family have since moved into a house in Mandurah’s Dudley Park. An Anglican and social conservative who opposes marriage equality, Hastie has relied on his military record to impress, nominating as relevant experience his time fighting the Taliban and other militant groups in his three tours of Afghanistan. And it’s working. The West Australian described him as “smart and well-spoken, fit and focused”. He is campaigning on a platform of law and order, promising to reduce methamphetamine or ice-related crime in the outer suburban seat; his national security expertise; and his ability to fill Randall’s shoes as a voice for the local community (which also helpfully distances him from the Abbott government’s national unpopularity). The guarantee he gives of success is, again, based on his military record, citing what has become his catchphrase: “Mission failure is not an option.” 7. Teresa van Lieshout, independent Serial campaigner Teresa van Lieshout is standing as an independent this time around (although she is describing herself as from the “voter rights party”). She was disendorsed by the Palmer United party just 12 days after being named its candidate for the seat of Fremantle in 2013. She lives in Mundijong, in the Canning electorate. Campaign strategies this time around have included an acrostic poem attacking a local Fairfax Regional paper, the Mandurah Mail, for being “Malicious Asshole Nutcases Dickheads” (it goes on, but we won’t). That was posted on Friday, after the Mandurah Mail published an article about Van Lieshout failing to appear on charges of breaching bail at the Fremantle magistrates court, then quoting her as saying: “They call it a trial, I call it a Nazi fascist process … I don’t care what they say, I want that magistrate jailed.” Van Lieshout also released a 12-minute video in the style of Bob Dylan’s Subterranean Homesick Blues (although Dylan may take offence to that comparison) that won her an interview on Sunrise. That video and other gems, including her bikini-clad pitch for the 2014 state byelection for Vasse, prompted by the resignation of the chair-sniffing former treasurer Troy Buswell, can be found on her regularly updated YouTube channel. 8. Matt Keogh, Labor party Matt Keogh is a commercial litigant and former prosecutor with the office of the commonwealth director of public prosecutions. He resigned from his role as president of the Law Society of WA to stand for preselection for Canning. The 33-year-old, as all his campaign material states, grew up in Kelmscott, a suburb in the electorate, but moved to the inner-city suburb of Mount Lawley in recent years. He moved back to Kelmscott after being preselected. Keogh, a practising Catholic, joined the ALP at the age of 16. He is campaigning on the bedrock Labor party platforms of health, education and jobs, is vocal in his support for marriage equality, and has promised funding to local road projects (doubling Armadale Road, fixing the Denny Road intersection) and $3.4m for local drug rehab and family violence programs – all contingent on the ALP winning the 2016 general election. He is also trying to pitch himself as the ideological, if not the political, successor to Randall, who was known for his commitment as a local member, saying: “I’ve grown up in this area and I’m really committed to this area and making it a better place.” That didn’t impress the deputy Liberal leader, Julie Bishop, who dismissively dubbed him: “The hipster Labor lawyer.” 9. Vanessa Rauland, Australian Greens The renewable energy campaigner Vanessa Rauland is a lecturer at the Curtin University Sustainable Policy Institute. She’s also the founder, along with fellow Curtin University academic Samantha Hall, of an organisation called Simply Carbon, which began a “low-carbon schools” pilot program to turn 10 schools in Fremantle carbon neutral. Rauland’s key campaign issue is solar energy. Canning has the highest solar energy uptake of any electorate in Australia – half of all homes have rooftop solar panels or solar hot water systems. She lives in Fremantle, about 30km outside the electorate, but is quoted in the West Australian as saying: “I feel very connected to them [Canning voters] on this issue of renewable energy.” In the same article, the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, pitched the byelection as a chance to send a message to the Abbott government on renewable energy, destabilise the leadership of Abbott himself and “influence the national landscape”. The Greens are not expected to do much better on 19 September than they did in 2013, when they got 7.4% of the primary vote. 10. Jim McCourt, Family First party Serial Family First candidate Jim McCourt ran for Family First in Fremantle in the 2013 election, netting just under 1% of the primary vote. He also ran in the WA electorate of Hasluck in 2010, where he managed 2.26% despite famously calling gay people a “diseased group”. McCourt later tried to clarify those comments with LGBTI press Out in Perth, saying: “I don’t hate gay people; I just see there is blindness in the community with what they are doing … They are the most demanding people in Australia.” He also claimed he wasn’t homophobic, because “a phobia means you’re scared of something.” McCourt is a former pastor who now lists his profession as a teacher. 11. Jamie Van Burgel, Australian Christians The byelection is the second tilt at the federal seat of Canning for the Australian Christians candidate Jamie Van Burgel, who ran for the seat for the Christian Democratic party in 2010 (he got about 3% of the vote). A Canning local, the 33-year-old father of four also ran for state parliament in the 2010 byelection for the seat of Armadale, triggered by the resignation of now federal MP Alannah MacTiernan, polling 20% of the primary vote behind Labor’s Tony Buti. He was also the lead Senate candidate for the Australian Christians in 2013. On the party’s website Van Burgel says he is a “viable conservative option” and also plays up his connection to Randall, saying: “Whenever I am out and about in the electorate I am reminded of his mantra of, ‘You talk, I’ll listen.’” 12. Angela Smith, Sustainable Population party Angela Smith is an environmental scientist who has lived in the Canning area for about 30 years. On the party’s website she describes herself as a carer and mature-age law student. She also volunteers at the Mandurah community museum and sings in a choir in her spare time. Smith said she’s campaigning for “a better, not bigger, Canning”, with key issues being paid work, education for all ages, infrastructure, affordable housing, renewable energy and healthcare."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2015/jul/15/ten-facts-new-horizon-mission-pluto","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-07-16T07:26:03Z","webTitle":"New Horizons: 10 facts about Nasa's astonishing Pluto mission and beyond","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/15/ten-facts-new-horizon-mission-pluto","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2015/jul/15/ten-facts-new-horizon-mission-pluto","fields":{"headline":"New Horizons: 10 facts about Nasa's astonishing Pluto mission and beyond","bodyText":"• New Horizons clocked the fastest launch ever recorded when it blasted off in January 2006, exceeding 36,000 miles per hour. The spacecraft passed the Moon after just nine hours and reached Jupiter the following year. It took just three minutes to cross the diameter of Pluto. • The first images beamed back show that, at 2,370km (1,473 miles) in diameter, Pluto is slightly larger than previously believed. This makes it undisputedly the largest dwarf planet in the solar system. For the past decade astronomers had been undecided about whether this title belonged to Pluto or Eris, another planetary object beyond Neptune, although Eris still has a bigger mass. The extra volume means that Pluto must be less dense than thought, meaning it probably contains more ice beneath the surface. • Sensors on New Horizons have detected a thin nitrogen atmosphere extending far out into space, and the surface colouring suggests it is a patchwork of different concentrations of frozen methane and nitrogen. These probably sublime into the atmosphere when the planet is closer to the sun and drift back to the ground as snowfall during colder periods. • Nasa mission scientists have started giving unofficial names to some of the features. A dark patch near the south pole, initially called the whale, is being referred to as Cthulhu, after the octopus-dragon hybrid deity featured in one of HP Lovecraft’s stories. Other patches have been named Meng-p’o, after the Buddhist goddess of forgetfulness, and Balrog – a menacing creature featured in JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. For the names to become official, though, they would need to be approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). • The mission is now speeding onwards into the Kuiper belt where it will examine one or two of the ancient icy objects in the vast region. Potential Kuiper belt objects that it might visit include Quaoar, Eris, Makemake, Haumea and Sedna. In coming months, scientists will decide the spacecraft’s next flyby target and send signals from Earth to New Horizons to thrust its rockets to tweak its trajectory. • Most spacecraft depend on solar energy to power their on-board systems, but at 4bn miles from the sun, the faint light reaching a spacecraft at Pluto makes this impractical. Instead, the mission is powered by nuclear fuel – aptly, plutonium – that gives off heat as it decays. The fuel is designed to last until the late 2020s or even beyond. • Pluto was downgraded to a “dwarf planet” just months after the launch of New Horizons, following a vote by astronomers at the IAU to change the definition of the word “planet”. The flyby has resurrected the debate, however, and Charles Bolden, Nasa’s chief administrator, said he hoped the official classification would be reconsidered. “I call it a planet, but I’m not the rule maker,” he said. • New Horizons has spent much of its journey in hibernation mode, but it made some closeup observations of Jupiter and its moons when it completed a slingshot flyby of the planet in 2007. These included a time-lapse video of a volcanic eruption on Jupiter’s moon Io, the first detailed recording of a volcanic event outside Earth. • When New Horizons was planned, astronomers thought it would just be observing Pluto and its largest moon, Charon. Seven months before launch, two other moons, Nix and Hydra, were discovered and then, once the mission was under way, astronomers spotted two more – Styx and Kerberos – increasing the number of objects that the spacecraft would be able to observe and need to avoid colliding with. • The mission is carrying the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered Pluto in 1930. Before dying in 1997, he requested that his ashes be sent to space. Nasa obliged, affixing a small container with his remains to the inside upper deck of the probe. It bears the inscription: “Interred herein are remains of American Clyde W. Tombaugh, discoverer of Pluto and the solar system’s ‘third zone’, Adelle and Muron’s boy, Patricia’s husband, Annette and Alden’s father, astronomer, teacher, punster, and friend: Clyde W. Tombaugh (1906-1997).”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2015/mar/22/solar-sails-set-course-for-a-new-journey-into-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-03-22T12:29:31Z","webTitle":"Solar sails set course for a new journey into renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/22/solar-sails-set-course-for-a-new-journey-into-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2015/mar/22/solar-sails-set-course-for-a-new-journey-into-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Solar sails set course for a new journey into renewable energy","bodyText":"It was as the moon hit the sails of his yacht in the Atlantic Ocean that the thought struck Perry Carroll. “You’ve got a sail and you have got some sun, you must be able to find a way to put those solar sails on that fabric,” he said. Little over a decade later and that idea – which first hit Carroll during a 635–mile race between Rhode Island and Bermuda – has developed into a business aiming to generate solar energy from awnings over car parks and on the tops of buildings where conventional rigid panels cannot go. Carroll’s Cambridge-based Solar Cloth Company makes lightweight, flexible solar panels which can be rolled and fitted onto curved and flexible structures such as domes or coverings for agricultural land, as well as on the roofs of buildings unable to sustain the weight of glass panels. “Solar is moving from being a hard, inflexible and one-colour product to being soft lightweight, flexible, and maybe even multicoloured,” he said. “In solar everybody only knows those glass panels going on roofs and on farmland, fields, solar farms. Why can’t solar be everywhere in all different types of aspects? Why can’t it be so that when you pull your car into your driveway that there is a canopy that charges the thing?” Carroll has been developing the panels since that lightbulb moment on the water, eventually bringing him to the bespoke products his company produces today. The company uses thin film photovoltaics (TFPV), which are viewed as the second generation of solar technology. TFPV is light enough to be placed on plastics and weighs substantially less than conventional glass panels. Carroll claims his panels are about 20% the weight of standard panels. There are drawbacks, however: they produce 15% less power than the current generation of panels and they cost twice as much. But the company hopes to open up new markets by emphasising the weight difference and the flexibility of the plastic roll, which open up new possibilities for siting solar cells. For instance, the cells can be bonded onto structural fabrics of buildings – which would make potential sites of the dome of the O2 arena in London or the Bird’s Nest National Stadium in Beijing. “I didn’t invent solar, I didn’t invent fabric but I found a way to put them together. That is what we are, we are integrators. We are the only people in the world who can successfully do that on a commercial level,” said Carroll. The rolls of TFPV can be fitted on top of a building over a few days, allowing for millions of square metres of space on structures to be converted to solar, said Carroll. In the UK, factories account for 13% of the UK’s energy consumption and most of them are potential sites for solar rolls, he said. The company also intends to concentrate on fitting the panels on awnings in car parks, where the energy can then be fed directly into an electric car parked underneath. “The government, the local authority, the general populace, the press, they all don’t want us to build [solar] in our countryside … so we have to use areas that we have,” said Carroll. “We have got millions and millions of car parking spaces in Great Britain. According to the DVLA [Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency], there are 30m cars on the road.” Carroll believes those car parking spaces – outside shopping centres, office complexes and airports – are a massive potential market for his awnings. Outside the Cambridge offices of the Solar Cloth Company is a vision of what the firm wants the future of solar to look like – 15 car parking spaces with canopies fitted with their solar panels. The power which is generated from the panels is fed into the adjoining building while there is also a plug to connect to an electric car. Each of the car parking space awnings cost £12,500 to build, according to Carroll. Another Solar Cloth Company product is the “solar sail” – a conventional sail covered with cloth panels – aimed at getting rid of the need for diesel generators on board yachts and powering the signage on petrol station forecourts. When Carroll went to banks and angel investors looking for funding to advance into new markets, he was met with a blank wall, due to what he describes as a lack of enthusiasm for the the technology. The company turned to crowdfunding, which brought in over £1m. So far the company has received £700,000 worth of orders for their products. The funding round gave the company a valuation of £7.5m, with Carroll remaining as the majority shareholder. The Solar Cloth Company hopes the price of its products will fall as they become more popular – a general rule for any manufacturer – but it believes more money should be poured into researching solar energy. “Solar in Great Britain and in general is the poor relation in R&amp;D. We have a video games industry in Great Britain which spends hundreds of millions of pounds on developing games,” said Carroll. “You can’t play a video game without power. If you haven’t got any power, you can’t do anything, so can we not get the power right? It is like choosing the curtains for the new house before you have built it or decided where you are going to put the plot. And that is the focus that we have got to change. People are quite happy to buy a TV for £2,000 and change it in 10 minutes’ time for another one because it has got a bendy screen. But they are not prepared to pay for guaranteed energy? It [solar] has got to stop being sold like a cheap commodity, it has got to be sold as a solution to what your lifestyle gives you.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/dec/11/technology-food-loss-farming-hunger","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2014-12-11T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"Food loss is the blindspot in our fight against hunger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/dec/11/technology-food-loss-farming-hunger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/dec/11/technology-food-loss-farming-hunger","fields":{"headline":"Food loss is the blindspot in our fight against hunger","bodyText":"In November the World Bank launched a report that detailed the catastrophic effects on agricultural productivity of the “new climate normal”: crop failures brought about by climate change are likely to bring about hunger on a massive scale appears, the report’s authors warn. President of the bank, Jim Yong King, called on leaders to “embrace carbon pricing and green policies.” But I think there is a more immediate way to prevent food insecurity and rid the world of hunger: tackle food loss. This should be at the very top of the global food agenda because slashing the number of calories and nutrients that go unconsumed would have clear benefits — for farmers and for hungry people around the world. The global food system already produces enough food for everyone. But 24% of all calories destined for human consumption never end up in tummies, according to the World Resources Institute. In the developing world 64% of food is lost before it is processed or transported to markets. In sub-Saharan Africa alone this costs farms $4bn a year. In a world where 800 million people are undernourished this is both tragic and unnecessary. Rich countries waste food, while poor countries lose it. In Africa politics, policies, and climate change all affect food production and availability, where periodic droughts and political upheavals have left millions hungry. These are long-term problems that will require long-term solutions. But there are concrete steps we can take right now to bolster Africa’s food security, starting with proven technological interventions. Basic solar-powered processing equipment can be transformative. Every day in markets across Africa fruits wilt and rots under the blazing sun. That same sun can power a cold room or a mango juice plant owned and staffed vendors. At Malo, a social enterprise founded to mill, fortify and market rice cultivated by local smallholder farmers in Mali, we are looking at proposals to use solar energy to power equipment which could reduce food loss. Elsewhere in Mali, cattle farmers are using solar energy to power refrigerators to store their milk. Given that the biggest food losses occur on farms, this is where we should begin to solve the problem. For subsistence farmers, support and advice from farmer education services and farming cooperatives improves their ability to withstand economic and climate shocks and maximize their potential. New and existing cooperatives need to make modern harvesting tools and robust crop disease and pest management systems standard offerings for their members. These improvements would bolster traditional benefits of cooperatives, such as reducing input costs, increasing market access, and obtaining more favorable credit terms. For commercial farms, regardless of size, putting trained and motivated employees on the team is essential. However, finding qualified workers is a challenge that needs to be overcome. Creating schools and incubators with curricula and programmes that educate farm workers, farm managers, and farm owners can both address the challenge of ensuring universal education while providing career opportunities for young people. A better educated farm workforce would be better able to prevent or mitigate food loss whether it is by identifying crop diseases early and knowing how to treat them or planning and executing appropriate logistics and distribution operations. To be sure, tackling the issue of food loss is costly, complex and requires more than just training farm workers and leveraging solar energy. With a growing middle class in Africa, it is essential that the food saved by modernising supply chains doesn’t end up in being thrown away by businesses and consumers, whose consumption habits often mimic those of the developed world. As soon as that begins to happen we must work to reduce grocery and household food waste. We should investigate the potential of Fenugreen’s Fresh Paper, a spice-infused paper said to increase the shelf life of produce. Taken together, small improvements at farms and in the kitchen can achieve real results and cut food waste and food loss across the developing world. Increasing yields and bringing more land under cultivation will remain important to feeding a growing population. But ensuring we eat everything we already grow could quickly reduce the burden we place on our planet as we figure out longer term strategies for coping with climate change and other food security threats. As 2015 approaches and world leaders begin to think about how to implement the sustainable development goals on hunger, they could do much worse than adopt this mantra: to feed the world tomorrow, let’s eat what we grow today.

When the Romans came, they called it Londinium. Kings and queens and dukes and other powerhouses flocked to this city by the river. Across the decades and the centuries, all these powerful kings and queens and dukes – and ever-bigger companies and banks and funds – rose and fell. They are all dead now. But the city where they lived is still alive, after 2,000 years of moving through history; looking forward with the will to live. And a legend arose that what kept the city alive through good times and bad was not the palaces but the neighbourhoods or the boroughs, as the old name has it. Most of the people in the city were not rich or powerful but they were good at making neighbourhoods – with lots of small shops, churches, theatres, and craftspeople working in metal and wood and many other materials. There was also a high street in each of these neighbourhoods. They weren’t high really, but they gave you a high – all those little shops and pubs; all those people going in and out. Each neighbourhood was different, but together they made a sort of urban tissue, a bit like coral reef. One day, a visitor arrived from a faraway city in China – Shanghai, on the Yangtze River. He spent a lot of time answering questions about how to pronounce Yangtze. He looked very grand. And in a very grave voice, he told the people of London a tale of strange happenings in Shanghai. At first these happenings sounded enchanting, magical. Shanghai had exploded into what looked like fireworks of buildings: all different, but all tall and grand. Then, however, it became a little scary: “We had lived for a very long time in dense, lively neighbourhoods. They were mostly poor, but still, life was not too bad in Shanghai.” The visitor continued: “It all changed when the destructions began. Some of our neighbourhoods were flattened with huge machines. ‘Why?’ we asked. We found out the hard way. It was to make room for more and more very tall buildings. As this went on, it meant that many of us had to leave our homes and neighbourhoods: millions of us were pushed to the faraway edges of the city. “From a distance,” said the man, “if you did not know that this had happened to so many of us, Shanghai looked beautiful and very impressive, with all those tall towers. But we, the people of Shanghai’s neighbourhoods, knew the other side of the story.” The visitor’s tale had familiar elements for the people of London, too. It had been fun to see some tall buildings go up, even if it meant destroying a few neighbourhoods. But the destructions had escalated, and the city began to feel very alien. In time, the people heard that the same thing was happening in other cities too. They were all beginning to look the same with their tall, identikit buildings. It was as if a monster had crawled into each city and was chomping away at it. Chomp, chomp, chomp. “You cannot have a city without neighbourhoods,” the people said. “That is where most of us live and shop and go to school.” Yet the monster carried on eating neighbourhoods to make room for its tall towers, making a weird kind of tissue for which the people did not quite have a name. The monster called it “urban”. This tissue wasn’t at all like the tissue of the neighbourhoods or even the old city centre. It was killing the people’s houses and small shops and little streets and squares. This was a bad time – there were not enough places to live any more. And as the monster kept coughing out tall towers everywhere, everywhere became nowhere. The people understood that the monster’s power was fed by liquid gold. It could go anywhere and set up a tower, even in the middle of an old neighbourhood where nobody had asked it to come. They were always anxious about where the hungry monster would appear next. The city, however, was not about to go down without a fight. After all, it had survived many a bad period across the centuries, and was still alive – unlike those kings and queens and powerful companies of old. The neighbourhoods could see they had to get together and fight this monster. After all, they were the city ... Then, one night, a child whose family had been thrown out of their little house in the neighbourhood had a dream. Perhaps it was a vision, or maybe it had been on the television news. The child, who was called Copernica, saw that what the monster had done in London was happening in many other cities – including some the child only knew from schoolbooks: New York, Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo, San Francisco. Her dream was turning into a nightmare. There was the monster, with its teeth wrapped around the child’s own bedroom window. But what happened next was almost funny. A little, unhappy voice came out of the monster, saying: “I’ve got nowhere else to go with my liquid gold, but it is still growing and growing. It is meant to shine in the sun, not just sit there in dark pools inside towers.” Now the child was no longer scared: she knew from the school playground that complainers were rarely fighters. What happened next was strange. “Do you have any advice for me?” asked the voice. “I am really used to having advisers, but now nobody wants to touch me with a barge pole … they do not want to deal with me because I give them a bad name.” The child did not understand all these words, especially “adviser”, but sensed this was an opening, a chance for something to change. But it had to be now, as the monster might snap out of this mood and become dangerous again at any moment. But no ideas were coming into the child’s mind. Then she remembered a recent geography lesson at school – on deserts, and how we have the technologies to gather solar power in vast quantities. “I can show you how to flow your liquid gold into the Sahara!” she told the monster. “You are rich enough to cover thousands of miles of desert with a dome of solar-energy cells. And below them could be garden cities containing many houses for people in need.” The child got very excited at the possibilities, even if it did mean using the nasty monster’s liquid gold. For its part, the monster looked a bit puzzled. “Wait!” it cried. “How will I grow if I spread myself thin on the desert?” But the child reassured it: “Every solar cell you lay down will produce a golden coin that you can use to build more.” And so the monster poured down from its towering dark pools, heading straight for the Sahara. And the people were delighted at the prospect of a solar lifeline spreading out across the desert, forming a new generation of “oasis cities” that could welcome people from every background – not merely tourists, businessmen and multi-millionaires. Suddenly, the child woke with a start. A feeling of dread spread over her like the monster’s tissue. Of course it was not going to use its liquid gold for the good of the people; it could only think of itself. “This monster is simply going to build another jungle of tall towers in the Sahara,” she cried, “and call it a smart city ...” Saskia Sassen is Robert S Lynd Professor of Sociology at Columbia University and co-chairs its Committee on Global Thought.

As she announced the cuts today, energy secretary Amber Rudd said: “We need to keep bills as low as possible for hardworking families and businesses while reducing our emissions in the most cost-effective way.” But director of the UK Energy Research Centre Jim Watson said the cuts could stall solar’s march towards parity with fossil fuels. “This decision risks affecting progress with deployment and cost reductions, delaying the point at which solar could be cost competitive, and damaging broader investor confidence,” he said. The current price of solar is roughly £80/MWhr (megawatt hour) and falling fast, but fossil fuels still sell to the grid cheaper at £50/MWhr. Tory rhetoric on the burden of renewable energy to bill payers has been relentless ever since David Cameron infamously referred to the levies as “green crap”. This has lead to a perception that renewable energy subsidies amount to a significant proportion of household energy costs. In fact, subsidies for solar energy cost the average bill payer about £10 per year. That is just 0.7% of their annual bill of £1,338. Rudd’s department said their modelling showed that this was the right time to cut large parts of the solar industry loose. But the industry is asking for support to continue until 2020 before it can stand alone. Solar arrays below 5MW (bigger solar farms had their support cut in April) will no longer receive renewable obligation certificates (ROCs) which force energy companies to buy from them at a set price. These have been the major mechanism to provide certainty for investment in nascent renewable technologies. The Solar Trade Association (STA) estimate that the proportion of the renewable obligation taken by solar amounts to just £3 per annual bill. The government will also change the rules for pre-accredited Feed-in-tariffs (FiTs) so that developers will no longer be guaranteed what they will be paid for the electricity they generate from a project before it is built. The changes, which will not affect homeowners who place panels on their roofs, will do nothing to appease one of the common arguments against “middle-class subsidies” for those who can afford small private arrays. Expect those changes later this year when the government conducts its FiT review. Instead, the cuts take aim at companies, communities and small landholders who want to invest in a medium array and become significant contributors to the grid. Rudd said the changes were “protecting existing investment”. But Leo Murray, from community renewable energy advocates 10:10, said the announcement amounted to a “full frontal attack on renewable energy in the UK”. Community-owned projects, which tend to be smaller than 5MW, will be hardest hit by the unexpectedly harsh changes. Murray said that erstwhile fracking village Balcombe’s bid to go 100% solar may just slip in before the April 2016 deadline for ROC changes. “But it won’t be possible for any other community energy groups to follow in their footsteps,” he said. The FiT changes will also undermine investor confidence in medium-size community schemes. Leonie Greene from the STA said: “The removal of the ability to pre-accredit a project and lock in at a set level of support, will make it harder to do both commercial rooftop and community solar schemes.” Observers roundly criticised the announcement, which continue the government’s cuts to support for the renewable energy sector. Former Shell chairman Lord Oxburgh of Liverpool said the government’s mercurial energy policy undermined investor confidence. “The changes that the Government is announcing in the name of affordability will have the perverse effect of increasing the cost of clean energy.” Michael Grubb, professor of international energy and climate change policy at University College London, said uncertainty driving up cost was “the major risk” for the energy industry. “The entire energy industry is now concerned about the risk of a capricious and politicised UK energy policy, driven more by Treasury intervention than by the department responsible,” he said. Chair of the parliamentary energy and climate change committee, SNP MP Angus MacNeil, said: “The latest changes remove the current certainty for the lowest cost renewable technologies whilst failing to provide any indication of the future investment landscape.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2015/may/22/brazil-climate-change-policy-china-obama","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-22T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"Brazil's ditching of climate change targets may not signal policy shift","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/22/brazil-climate-change-policy-china-obama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2015/may/22/brazil-climate-change-policy-china-obama","fields":{"headline":"Brazil's ditching of climate change targets may not signal policy shift","bodyText":"First it was there. Then it was gone. The long-awaited announcement of Brazil’s new climate target came and went with a sleight of hand that caused an uproar among environmentalists this week. But rather than signalling a shift in policy, as some had feared, the sudden appearance and disappearance of the country’s CO2 reduction goals appears to have more to do with diplomatic mistakes, realpolitik priorities and the greater importance of the US than China, the Guardian has learned. The plan to set a ceiling on carbon dioxide emissions first appeared in the draft of a joint climate statement from Brazil and China ahead of a meeting between Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff and Chinese premier Li Keqiang. That text included the much-anticipated goal: “Brazil has announced its intention to establish an upper limit to its emissions by 2030.” But these sentences had been dropped when the final version was posted on the Foreign Ministry website after the talks, prompting consternation among environmental campaigners because Brazil is expected to be an important player at climate talks in Paris later this year. Alfredo Sirkis, the chair until last year of the Joint Committee on Climate Change of the National Congress, claimed that Rousseff eliminated the target and watered down Chinese proposals for a partnership on solar energy. On the website of the Climate Observatory , a coalition of more than 20 NGOs, Sirkis argues these actions will hurt Brazil’s global standing. “Climate change is one of the few major areas where Rousseff still has the power to make a difference,” he wrote. “But she is idiosyncratically hostile to clean energy.” That may yet prove to be correct. Rousseff, who sat on the board of state oil company Petrobras during her time as energy minister, has made development of pre-salt oil and gas fields the key to the nation’s future development. By comparison, alternative energies such as wind and solar power have seemed far less of a government priority. But sources have told the Guardian there is another explanation why the target was removed from the statement: Rousseff wants it to be announced at a summit with US president Barack Obama in June. When the Guardian put this theory to the Brazilian foreign ministry, a spokesman said the change of texts was the result of a “technical problem” rather than a shift in stance. Either way, Brazil has yet to make its position clear for the upcoming Paris talks. This is unfortunate. South America’s largest economy played a prominent role in recent climate summits. For many years, it won kudos for impressively reducing emissions from deforestation as a result of policies put in place before Rousseff became president. It has also been a key advocate for emerging economies. As a member of the BASIC group, which includes China, South Africa and India, it opposed emission ceilings for developing nations at Copenhagen in 2009. China, which has invested heavily in renewable energies and suffered severely from coal pollution, has since changed tack. Last November, in a joint agreement with the United States, Beijing agreed that its emissions should peak by 2030 or earlier. But Brazil has dragged its heels. Rousseff’s overriding priority is economic growth, and her government – which includes climate sceptic Aldo Rebelo as science minister and agribusiness advocate Kátia Abreu as agriculture minister – says it is still in the process of deciding its targets. More likely, it seems, is that Rousseff has reasoned, ‘why announce a new climate policy to curry favour with China today, when it can be used to schmooze the United States tomorrow?’"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/05/akon-charities-africa-lighting-energy-access","type":"article","sectionId":"working-in-development","sectionName":"Working in development","webPublicationDate":"2015-10-05T08:42:15Z","webTitle":"Akon: ‘I don't think charities in Africa work’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/05/akon-charities-africa-lighting-energy-access","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/05/akon-charities-africa-lighting-energy-access","fields":{"headline":"Akon: ‘I don't think charities in Africa work’","bodyText":"As night falls across Africa bustling cities light up and neighbourhoods begin to buzz, fed by traffic from well-lit roads. In the countryside, meanwhile, villages are plunged into darkness, shutting down the night-time economies of rural communities as restaurants and shops close and children light candles to do their homework. For Akon, the US-based rap star, the realities of living without electricity are a vivid memory from his youth growing up in Kaolack, southern Senegal. Today, 600 million African people still live without access to electricity, and 3.5 million people die each year from inhaling toxic fuels or house fires caused while trying to light their homes. The project Akon Lighting Africa aims to tackle the problem using a different approach to the usual methods of NGOs in Africa. Akon and his two co-founders, Thione Niang, a Sengalese political activist and Samba Bathily, a Malian entrepreneur and CEO of the solar energy company Solektra International, believe that what rural African communities need is not overseas charity but affordable renewable energy delivered by fully trained African professionals managing for-profit projects that bring longevity, generate jobs and build new self-sustaining economies. They think this initiative could mark the beginning of an African energy renaissance in which the continent becomes the focal point of a global solar power industry. For Akon, this second venture into development (he also founded Konfidence, a health and education charity) has been an eye-opener. “There have been a lot of issues and challenges that I honestly wasn’t aware of until I got involved,” says the 42-year-old rapper, who has just completed a Canadian tour and spent the summer on a roadshow with Bathily and Niang that took him from the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Nairobi, through Rwanda, Congo-Brazzaville, Nigeria and Niger, culminating at the coastal city of Cotonou, Benin, where they inspected Akon Lighting Africa’s projects. “One thing I’ve realised about Africa is that only the organisations that involve Africans themselves are successful. A lot of corporations that come with their own policies and try and implement them in Africa fail horribly. The advantage we had is that all three founders are African, so we were able to navigate through each country a lot faster.” Niang and Bathily bring political and economic skills to the project, while Akon admits that his main contribution is his name and the marketing opportunities it brings. The founders have already made deals with the governments of 16 African states and aim to be operating in 25 by the end of next year. The deals are pre-financed using a $1bn credit line funded by international partners, including China Jiangsu International Group, and distributed by the pan-African bank Ecobank. A Chinese manufacturer supplies the solar panels but, crucially, the workers are predominantly African. The pre-financing set-up means that Solektra International can begin the engineering work straight away, giving villagers immediate electricity. Repayment plans are worked out with individual governments on a case-by-case basis. The deals are delivering three types of solutions for people without electricity: 100,000 street lamps are being installed in villages; 1,000 solar micro-generators will act as clean energy hubs for communities, replacing old generators that used fossil fuels; and 200,000 household solar electric systems - including devices that store energy to provide LED panel lighting at night and pocket-sized solar gadgets that charge phones and tablets - will be sold at affordable prices to families, subsidised by each African government or local authority. It is a for-profit business, with Solektra negotiating rates with each government to meet affordability targets and with payments structured to ease burdens on national budgets. “Personally, I don’t think that charities in Africa really work,” says Akon. “I think it just holds the people down longer than it should. I think the only way to build Africa is to build for-profit businesses that create opportunities and jobs for the people locally. That’s why with Akon Lighting Africa we decided to take a for-profit approach. Ultimately, it’s providing empowerment to local people so they can start developing their own economies.” To that end, the organisation is a month away from launching an academy in Bamako, Mali where young people will train in construction, engineering, clerical work and project management. “When we launched we sent 20 young people from 10 African countries to university in Marrakech with a scholarship fund to complete the engineering programme and then come back and work for us,” says Niang. “But we then realised this was bigger than that so we set up the academy in Mali.” However, the project is not entirely bypassing NGOs. Niang’s non-profit Give1Project specialises in mentoring social entrepreneurs and has been key in mobilising young, enthusiastic recruits who carry out the legwork and receive valuable training and employment in return. “What happens usually is that when people come to do business in Africa, they bring the expertise with them but they also bring the workers, and once they’re done they’re gone,” says Niang. “That’s why many cities in Africa have a lot of solar lights but after three years none of them work and nobody is there to maintain them. So we thought it was important to train the young Africans in the local areas. And it’s important to give jobs to young people.” Their efforts have been well received by governments seeking greater energy access but struggling to find reliable partners. Akon Lighting Africa holds direct meetings with the countries’ leaders, then with the energy ministers, then with finance ministers and then they set up pilot projects before discussions about increasing scale. Akon Lighting Africa focuses on rural areas because that’s where the need is greatest. “If you want to make an impact start there,” Akon says. “My thinking is if you want to build Africa, you start from the rural areas because that is the heartbeat of Africa.” Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

Barrelling through space at 120,000 kilometres per hour, the comet and orbiting Rosetta probe will streak past the sun at 3.03am BST on Thursday morning, before heading back out to the deeper reaches of the solar system. The moment represents a landmark in space exploration as the Rosetta mission becomes the first to shadow a comet as it stirs from its dormant state and starts to spew tonnes of gas and dust, sometimes in the form of spectacular, explosive blasts. The comet will not exactly graze the sun. It will tear past our home star at a distance of 186 million kilometres, which is farther away than the Earth’s orbit of 150 million kilometres. But even from that far away, the comet will be bathed in ten times more solar energy than it was last year, making its frigid surface billow with gas and dust. “It’s a huge milestone for the mission,” Andrea Accomazzo, Rosetta’s flight director, told the Guardian. “We are not flying that close to the sun, but for the comet, it’s a massive change.” Cameras on the spacecraft will take images more rapidly as the comet swings around the sun in the hope of capturing huge blasts that shower material into space. The most dramatic blast yet happened two weeks ago when a violent jet erupted from the comet’s neck for several minutes, sending up a bright plume of debris at ten metres per second. “It was impressive,” said Accomazzo. “We can expect to see more of these fireworks now.” Rosetta caught up with the 4.5km wide comet in August last year when it was still 500 million kilometres from the sun. As it sped closer, the sun’s radiation warmed ices on the comet, making them sublimate into gases that dislodged dust as they departed. In the past, underground ice has vaporised and punched through the comet’s crust in some regions, leaving the surface pocked with giant sinkholes. Flying Rosetta around the active comet has been a learning curve in itself. The gases that waft off the comet push the spacecraft around, and its trajectory needs constant adjustment to ensure Rosetta’s instruments are pointing at the comet. Then there is the dust. It blinds Rosetta’s star tracker, which tells the spacecraft how to orient itself to beam data back to Earth. To escape the worst of the dust clouds, Rosetta recently retreated to a safe distance of 300km. The closest approach to the sun, known as the perihelion, is when the comet receives the most sunlight during its 6.5 year orbit. But the comet will continue to warm for several weeks yet, just as the hottest days of summer follow the longest day of the year. The comet is already shedding a tonne of dust and 300kg of water vapour and other gases every second. If that amount was lost evenly from the whole surface of the comet, the ground would fall a metre every time it passed the sun. In reality, because of variations in the surface, some regions will lose more than others. The comet is unlikely to shed material more quickly over the next month, but it could erupt with more violent explosions. “We are hoping for more jets,” said Nicolas Altobelli, deputy project scientist on the Rosetta mission. “They are very spectacular and could be a way to get material from the interior of the comet to analyse.” Scientists on the team have their eyes on a 500 metre-long crack that runs around part of the comet’s neck. How it got there is unclear. It may be a join from when two hunks of dusty ice joined together to form the strange rubber duck-shaped comet in the first place. Or it may be a stress fracture that deepens when the comet becomes more active. Accomazzo says the odds of the comet breaking in two along the crack are minimal, but scientists cannot rule out the possibility. Altobelli finds the idea tantalising. “Maybe we will be lucky and the comet will split in half,” he said. “That would be a nightmare for some of my colleagues, but scientifically we’d get to see material from the inside of the comet.” Such dramatic events aside, researchers are keen to see how the surge in activity resculpts the comet’s surface. When the dust and gas calm down in February next year Rosetta is expected to fly closer in, for the first time revealing the aftermath of a comet’s closest encounter with the sun. The small Philae lander that became the first to touch down on a comet in November last year fell silent in July and has not called home since. Stuck at an angle, with one leg in the air, the ground beneath its remaining feet is slowly disappearing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/sep/30/no-long-term-future-in-tar-sands-alberta-rachel-notley","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-30T13:12:50Z","webTitle":"No long-term future in tar sands, says Alberta's premier","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/30/no-long-term-future-in-tar-sands-alberta-rachel-notley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/sep/30/no-long-term-future-in-tar-sands-alberta-rachel-notley","fields":{"headline":"No long-term future in tar sands, says Alberta's premier","bodyText":"The leader of Canada’s biggest oil-producing province has declared she sees no long-term future in fossil fuels, predicting Alberta would wean itself off dirty energy within a century. In an early reveal of her forthcoming new energy policy, Alberta’s Rachel Notley said she would fight climate change by cleaning up the tar sands, shutting down coal-fired power plants, and converting to wind and solar power. Notley also forecast an eventual future beyond fossil fuels – a dramatic change for Alberta - and a track that has put her on a collision course with Canada’s conservative prime minister, Stephen Harper. The Alberta leader is due to unveil the new policy ahead of the international UN climate conference in Paris this December. The province sits atop the world’s third-biggest known carbon reserves in the tar sands, and has rapidly ramped up production to some 2m barrels of crude a day. By 2020, the province will account for more than a third of Canada’s total carbon pollution, according to government figures. Notley, whose election last May broke the Conservatives’ 44-year lock on power in the province, said she intends that to change. “I don’t think we are defined by energy. Certainly in the short to medium term that is an asset that we have, so we have to look at how we develop it carefully and responsibly because of the obligation we have to the people employed in the industry,” she told the Guardian. She went on: “Do I see that as our reason for being 100 years from now? Well, I hope we will have learned a lesson of diversification by then.” Notley visited Montreal, New York, and Toronto this week to try to persuade investors that Alberta under her leadership was committed to cleaning up tar sands production and tackling climate change. The Alberta leader will try to make a similar case to the international community when she attends the Paris climate summit. Canada is regularly held up as a climate super villain at the international climate negotiations. Harper pulled Canada out of the Kyoto climate protocol, and launched a quest to become an energy super power, blowing through emissions reductions targets. Meanwhile, campaigners have targeted tar sands, together with coal, as particularly dirty forms of energy, because of its energy-intensive extraction and its widespread destruction of boreal forests. Notley admitted Alberta would be squeezed to fight climate change while protecting jobs in the oil patch at a time of low energy prices. “It’s a bit of a conundrum,” she said. “I want to change the direction, bend the curve and do it as effectively as we can while maintaining jobs that are important to Alberta. People deserve to see government both at the federal and provincial levels that are committed to very significantly changing the rate of greenhouse gas emissions coming out of both Alberta and Canada.” Such pronouncements have put Notley at odds with Harper. The free market conservative, who is up for re-election on 19 October, has called Notley a “disaster”. Over the last decade, Harper has championed his vision of Canada as an energy super power and lobbied aggressively in Washington and European capitals for more pipelines to get tar sands crude to market. Harper’s opponents say the hardball tactics backfired. In an election debate this week, Harper was repeatedly accused of alienating Barack Obama and other US officials with hard arm promotion of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline project. Notely has said in the past she is opposed to Keystone XL – but not other pipelines. Her main focus now was getting the oil industry to clean up its act, Notley told the Guardian. “We need to do much better with greenhouse gas emissions,” she said. “We need to take our environmental responsibilities seriously if we are going to have support for our products in other markets that have greater environmental concerns.” The Alberta leader is expected to unveil new targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions later this autumn, after hearing from an expert committee. Notley also committed to phasing out Alberta’s coal-fired power plants, which provide more than 40% of the province’s electricity, converting to renewable energy, and putting a meaningful price on carbon. The shift on energy and climate has won praise from environmental organisations – but Notley is facing a tough climb. “She is starting from basically a blank slate,” said Simon Dyer, regional director of the Pembina Institute. A poll released on Wednesday from the environmental think tank found a majority of Albertans favoured strong policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions, even if it meant higher production costs for oil sands companies. He noted that Alberta was one of the few regions in the US and Canada without programmes promoting wind and solar energy. “The premier is saying we are going to be a leader on this but obviously we are coming from very far behind in the pack,” he said. Mike Hudema, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace, was reserving judgment. “I don’t think we are going to see anything reducing the rampant emissions coming from the tar sands,” he said. “The big reason they want a stronger climate policy is to increase market access. I don’t think the government has come to grips with the scientific reality that three-fourths of all fossil fuels will need to remain in the ground.” The Alberta leader caused some unease this week when she said Alberta would not support the national cap-and-trade scheme put forward by Tom Mulcair, the federal New Democratic Party leader. However, Notley said the reluctance was due to the idea of funds leaving the province, not capping emissions. “Generally speaking cap and trade as one strategy is a bit problematic for us,” she said. “It would turn into a fairly major cash transfer from Alberta to other places ... We are going to be more focused on a strategy that allows us to take investment that goes into reducing emissions and keeping it in Alberta.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/may/22/saudi-arabias-solar-for-oil-plan-is-a-ray-of-hope","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-22T12:45:18Z","webTitle":"Saudi Arabia's solar-for-oil swap is a ray of hope | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/may/22/saudi-arabias-solar-for-oil-plan-is-a-ray-of-hope","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2015/may/22/saudi-arabias-solar-for-oil-plan-is-a-ray-of-hope","fields":{"headline":"Saudi Arabia's solar-for-oil plan is a ray of hope","bodyText":"So what to make of the statement by Saudi Arabia’s oil minister that the world’s biggest oil exporter could stop using fossil fuels as soon as 2040 and become a “global power” in solar and wind energy? Ali Al-Naimi’s statement is striking as Saudi Arabia’s wealth and influence is entirely founded on its huge oil wealth and the nation has been one of the strongest voices against climate change action at UN summits. “In Saudi Arabia, we recognise that eventually, one of these days, we’re not going to need fossil fuels,” said Naimi at a business and climate conference in Paris on Thursday. “I don’t know when - 2040, 2050 or thereafter. So we have embarked on a program to develop solar energy,” he said in comments reported by the Guardian, Bloomberg and the Financial Times. “Hopefully, one of these days, instead of exporting fossil fuels, we will be exporting gigawatts of electric power.” Naimi also said he did not think that continuing low crude oil prices would make solar power uneconomic: “I believe solar will be even more economic than fossil fuels.” Paris is the venue for a crunch UN climate change summit in December and Thursday’s conference was part of the French government’s preparations. The Saudi signal provides a ray of sunlight for those hoping for a strong deal to tackle global warming. “Saudi Arabia is sending a strong signal to all oil producers and companies they must plan for an energy transition,” said Mark Fulton, former head of climate research at Deutsche Bank and advisor to the Carbon Tracker Initiative (CTI). “If Saudi Arabia is starting to hedge its bets by developing solar capacity, this could change the fundamentals of the oil market,” said James Leaton, CTI head of research. But Naimi also said that the idea of keeping most fossil fuels in the ground, as scientists say is necessary to tame climate change, “may be a great objective but it is going to take a long time” and needed to be put “in the back of our heads for a while”. He said fossil fuels will still dominate the world’s energy supply up to 2050. Saudi Arabia had already said in 2012 it aimed to be powered by 100% renewable energy and later that year announced a $109bn solar plan. In January, that plan was delayed by eight years. So Ali Al-Naimi’s comments on Thursday need to be treated with a degree of scepticism. Furthermore, making the kingdom itself fossil-fuel free doesn’t rule out continuing to export oil for many years. And in the past, Saudi Arabia has suggested it should be compensated for keeping any of its oil in the ground. But the fact that the Saudi’s feel the pressure to make such statements at all feels politically significant in the year that the world has set itself the task of sealing a climate change deal. It also adds to the momentum being delivered by the fast-growing, UN-backed, divestment campaign which argues investors should sell their stocks in fossil fuel companies whose hunger for ever more coal, oil and gas are seen as endangering the climate. Axa, one of the world’s biggest asset managers, announced on Friday that it was selling €500m of coal company stocks, by far the biggest divestment so far. Maybe, just maybe, the dark clouds that have glowered over efforts to tackle global warming for years are starting to disperse and let the sunlight in."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2014/nov/04/water-and-land-shortages-middle-east-north-africa-renewable-energy-desalination","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2014-11-04T07:00:04Z","webTitle":"Beating water and land shortages in the Middle East and north Africa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/nov/04/water-and-land-shortages-middle-east-north-africa-renewable-energy-desalination","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/nov/04/water-and-land-shortages-middle-east-north-africa-renewable-energy-desalination","fields":{"headline":"Beating water and land shortages in the Middle East and north Africa","bodyText":"Water and arable land are more scarce in Middle East and North African (Mena) countries than in any other region. Growing demand, population growth, a shrinking resource base, and climate change are combining to rapidly increase pressure on these resources. Region-wide investment and collaboration in renewable energy systems could serve to address these issues, leading to a more secure future for the region’s 355 million inhabitants in terms of water, food and energy. Furthermore, regional collaboration has the potential to reduce conflict. The nexus between water and energy is among the most important inter-dependencies in Arab countries, where socio-economic development relies on the sustainable provision of these two resources. Together, water and energy are required for irrigation and separately, energy is vital to desalination, and water is critical for energy production. While water scarcity in the region increases, food price hikes and food access become grave concerns for many. Current solutions to water and energy problems are often too narrowly focused and have unwanted or unexpected side effects. For example, seawater desalination – which is energy intensive and increasingly widespread in the region, especially in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is almost exclusively based on fossil fuels. This not only contributes to climate change but also impacts on countries’ fossil-fuel export revenues. Desalination also requires heavy capital investment and high operation and maintenance costs, and takes a heavy toll on the marine environment. There is an urgent need for Arab countries to cooperate and invest in research and development into alternative desalination and treatment technologies. Acquiring and localising these technologies will help to reduce costs and increase its reliability as a water source, adding value to economies as well as reducing environmental impacts. Solar energy, with its nearly unlimited availability in the region, will be critical for powering desalination plants, as well as for meeting climate goals and the broader aim of sustainable development. But, like any solution, it has to be adapted to the regional context. Solar panels developed for a European context may not work well in the Mena region. Sand can cover or damage solar panel surfaces, the efficiency of power generation decreases with increasing temperature, and shallow coastal zones – common in the area – cannot sustain large amounts of brine discharge from desalination plants. At the moment these challenges are addressed only in a very fragmented way, within sectors and within countries. An integrated – or ‘nexus’ – approach is required for any strategy or technological solution for meeting the ambitious renewable energy targets many Mena countries have set, as well as solutions for food security via imports or foreign direct investment in agriculture, to which many countries in the region increasingly resort. A nexus approach can help countries use resources more efficiently, reduce the impacts of technologies such as desalination, and create synergies between sectors. There is also great potential to reduce pressure on resources by shifting agricultural policy towards multi-functionality (such as the non-trade benefits of agriculture, such as environmental protection and food security) and by the recycling and cascading use of resources. For example wastewater from cities can be used to generate energy and be re-used in agriculture. The Stockholm Environment Institute, Texas A&amp;M and Chatham House are the core partners in a new initiative, The Nexus in the Arab Region, which will act as a hub for knowledge and technology exchange, and for innovating, adapting and benchmarking solutions. The initiative will demonstrate the benefits and opportunities of a nexus approach, identify entry points for bringing this thinking into policy (such as national development plans and economic incentives), and will showcase innovations, best practices and solutions. Key to the success of this initiative is growing a network of experts and practitioners and its platform for dialogue and information sharing. This year has seen momentum building for the initiative through a series of conferences, workshops and other events, such as the nexus seminar for the Arab Region at Stockholm World Water Week. The Arab Water Forum in Cairo this December will also be key for building a broad network of partners among regional institutions. There is hardly any other region for which a nexus approach holds such great potential to reduce pressure on the environment and save on precious resources while at the same time accelerating socio‐economic development, reducing disparities across countries, contributing to cooperation and conflict resolution and ensuring the region’s wealth and heritage for future generations.

This is more than has ever been installed by any country in a single year and means that China installed three times more solar energy in 2013 than the total UK solar capacity. No country has ever added more than 8GW of solar power in one year before, according to an analysis by Li Shuo, a policy and energy analyst at Greenpeace East Asia. It is also more solar than China had installed in all the years prior to 2013 put together, according to Li. The preliminary solar figures are estimated by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) which tracks energy figures globally. According to BNEF, this figure may even rise to 14GW due to a rush to install solar energy towards the end of 2013 due to a feed-in tariff for large photovoltaic projects coming to an end by January 1. A final figure is expected by March. Other estimates have put the figure lower but these could also rise due to the end of year increase. The Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association (CREIA) put the figure at 10.7GW and Chinese media has quoted industry sources putting the figure at at least 9.5GW. Li explained that a lot of figures are based on the first ten or eleven months of the year with a projection for December. \"There was definitely a rush in the last two months of the year in ramping up solar installation capacity,\" he said because of the tariff ending by the end of the year \"a lot of solar developers were in a hurry\". \"The 2013 figures show the astonishing scale of the Chinese market, now the sleeping dragon has awoken\" said Jenny Chase, head of solar analysis at BNEF in a press release. \"PV is becoming ever cheaper and simpler to install, and China's government has been as surprised as European governments by how quickly it can be deployed in response to incentives.\" In total China added just over 100GW of new power generation capacity in 2013. According to figures from BNEF, this is larger than the entire electricity capacity of the UK or South Korea. Coal still remains China's main power source with 39.7GW coal-fired capacity installed last year. Hydro power saw the next largest increase last year with 30.5GW added while wind saw 14.1GW added. Increasing its solar capacity is part of China's plan to increase the amount of renewable energy it uses as it attempts to move away from coal as its primary power source. Li said that while coal still accounts for the major of China's power, it is reducing as the country's overall energy appetite reduces. The high levels of air pollution which plague many of China's cities is putting pressure on the government to reduce coal consumption and in some of the worst hit areas there is now a ban on new coal power plants. An issue in China with renewable energy is in relation to connection to the grid. It is particularly a problem with wind energy and some wind farms in remote areas of the country remain unconnected. According to a spokesperson for Bloomberg, approximately 30% of the solar power installed in 2013 is still waiting connection. However they added that most solar developers are not worried and it is a matter of time before connection occurs and not a question of it it will occur. Li said that the problem of connecting to the grid \"is being resolved in quite a big way over the past two years. The government is offering a financial incentive for the grid to expand their network\". Most of China's solar installations are large-scale projects, the majority of which are based in the sunny western provinces of Gansu, Xinjiang and Qinghai. However, the Chinese government is planning a push for next year to increase the number of rooftop installations. The Chinese government is targeting up to 14GW of additional solar capacity this year, 60% of which they are aiming to be from roop-top installations rather than large-scale projects. According to BNEF, this will bring \"additional legal and financial complications for developers\" and they predict that this target will not be met but that there will be higher growth in 2015."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/aug/17/fox-news-inner-struggle-with-climate-misinformation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-17T10:00:14Z","webTitle":"Fox News' inner struggle with climate misinformation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/aug/17/fox-news-inner-struggle-with-climate-misinformation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/aug/17/fox-news-inner-struggle-with-climate-misinformation","fields":{"headline":"Fox News' inner struggle with climate misinformation","bodyText":"Research has shown that Fox News is a major driving force behind climate denial, decreasing viewer trust in scientists and the existence of global warming. In 2013, only 28% of Fox News’ climate science segments were accurate, although that was an improvement over its 7% accuracy in 2012. Fox News anchor Shepard Smith has been one of the few voices on the network willing to accept the scientific reality of human-caused climate change. On the August 10 edition of Fox News’ Shepard Smith Reporting, Smith reported on biased industry-funded science by Coca Cola, and made the connection to fossil fuel-funded climate denial studies. Lisa Kennedy Montgomery: It’s actually very brilliant marketing on the part of Coca Cola, because they realize that if someone hears that there’s a scientific study behind a reported fact, then they take that, they internalize it and take it to be true … So, what Coca Cola has decided to do is use that “science” in their favor. And if only they could find a few scientists willing to report that it’s not the calories but the lack of exercise that’s making people obese, then they can use this as a sort of an underground marketing strategy. Shepard Smith: Well this reminds me of two things. The article in the New York Times this weekend pointed out, it reminds you of exactly what the tobacco industry did back in the day, and more recently it also reminds you of what the climate deniers, the climate change deniers are doing as well. In fact, just 2 days later, the Fox Business News show Varney &amp; Co. used that strategy in an interview with Roy Spencer. Spencer is one of the fewer than 3% of climate scientists whose research rejects or minimizes the human contribution to global warming, and who infamously made comments about “global warming Nazis.” The interview began not with a discussion of science, but rather with criticism of President Obama’s Clean Power Plan. Both host Stuart Varney and Roy Spencer claimed that the plan would increase energy bills for America’s poor. The Obama administration claims the opposite – that the plan will save the average American family nearly $85 on their annual energy bill in 2030. Although electricity prices are expected to rise, utility bills are projected to fall due to improvements in energy efficiency spurred by the rule, and hence reduced electricity consumption. Spencer also claimed that wind and solar energy are “much more expensive than fossil fuels,” which is simply false. In any case, if conservatives are really concerned about the possibility of rising energy bills for low-income families, they can replace these regulations with a revenue-neutral carbon fee whose rebates would offset any increase in electricity costs. Unfortunately the interview didn’t include any such constructive policy debate. Instead it shifted to science denial, with Spencer repeating the false claim of no global warming over the past 18 years. In reality, during that time the oceans, surface, and even the lower atmosphere have continued to warm. Unexpectedly, host Stuart Varney pushed back against this global warming denial, pointing out that 14 of the last 15 years have been the hottest on record, and Spencer was forced to admit that the planet has continued to warm. Consistent with his status as one of the fewer than 3% of climate contrarian researchers, Spencer also contested the human contribution to global warming in the interview, using the same strategies discussed on Shepard Smith’s show. Spencer claimed, We have published evidence and there’s getting to be more and more papers published in the scientific literature pointing out that about half of the warming we’ve seen since the 1950s has been natural rather than man-made. It’s because of more frequent El Niño activity. In reality, very few scientific papers have blamed global warming on El Niño. Spencer is one of the few to make this argument, specifically arguing that changes in El Niño have changed cloud cover on Earth, which in turn impacts global temperatures. However, his analysis has been shown to be flawed in subsequent research by prominent climate scientists like Kevin Trenberth and Andrew Dessler. Scientist Barry Bickmore described Spencer’s study as a “curve-fitting paper,” using an approach also described by climate scientist Ray Pierrehumbert as “How to cook a graph in three easy lessons.” The big problem with Spencer’s argument is that there have been a roughly equal number of El Niño and La Niña events since 1950, so the temporary surface temperature cooling effects of the latter have cancelled out the temporary surface warming effects of the former during that time. These short-term cycles can’t explain the rapid global warming we’ve observed over the past 65 years. In the latest IPCC report, the world’s top climate scientists stated with 95% confidence that humans are responsible for the majority of the global warming since 1950, and that we’re most likely responsible for all of it. Although there are a few outliers like Roy Spencer who publish flawed research arguing to the contrary, there is a 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. However, as noted on Shepard Smith’s show, it’s smart marketing to focus on the outlier studies that argue the contrarian position, because “if someone hears that there’s a scientific study behind a reported fact, then they take that, they internalize it and take it to be true.” That’s exactly how Fox News markets global warming denial on most of its programs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2016/apr/15/game-of-thrones-season-six-biggest-mysteries-solved","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2016-04-15T14:00:01Z","webTitle":"Encyclopaedia Westerosa: the biggest Game of Thrones mysteries, solved","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/15/game-of-thrones-season-six-biggest-mysteries-solved","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/15/game-of-thrones-season-six-biggest-mysteries-solved","fields":{"headline":"Encyclopaedia Westerosa: the biggest Game of Thrones mysteries, solved","bodyText":"Warning: this piece contains spoilers for seasons 1-5 of Game of Thrones. When George RR Martin’s stabby saga was adapted for TV in 2011, perhaps the biggest question surrounding it was: why would any self-respecting adult watch a fantasy series about dragons, zombies and magic? Well, six seasons in, the folly of that way of thinking has been exposed like a member of the Night’s Watch trapped north of the Wall. Game of Thrones is now a global obsession. Much of that success is down to the detailed world created by Martin and brought to vivid and sometimes visceral life on the show. From the frozen north to the intrigue-filled chambers of King’s Landing, Westeros is a place steeped in mythos and mystery, familiar yet so alien. Even now, there’s still so much we don’t know about the place, so many questions that need answering. But while you’ve already read 713 blogs about whether or not Jon Snow has carked it, there are deeper mysteries about Game of Thrones that have never been properly addressed. Ahead of the show’s season six premiere, we get to grips with Westeros’s biggest hows, whys and whats. Answers are coming ... Why is a White Walker able to walk? The blue-eyed ghouls in dire need of a dermatologist definitely have the appearance of being dead – all exposed skeletons and rotted bits – but are they? And, if so, how is it that they can move around and stab things in the face? “It is possible to stimulate nerve and muscle electrically and cause it to contract even when isolated from the body,” says Dr Matthew James Mason, university physiologist at Cambridge. “If the brain dies that doesn’t mean that all the other tissue of the body immediately dies, too.” But, despite their appearance, White Walkers aren’t mindless zombies, so brain death can’t have occurred. “My guess is that they aren’t dead at all,” says Mason. “If they look like they are decaying, perhaps their immune system is compromised.” Are they just freezing, scurvy-ridden wretches in need of a hug? “They probably need medical help and sympathy,” argues Mason. Poor sods. The next time you see one, then, maybe chuck it an orange and a coat and don’t be so quick to judge, yeah? LH How rich are the Lannisters? They fund wars, boast one hell of a property portfolio and own actual gold mines. If a Lannister always pays their debts, it can be safely assumed they’ve got a few quid in the kitty. Dr Charles Insley, senior lecturer in medieval history at the University of Manchester, thinks drawing a parallel with a real-life example may be the key to finding out how many. “Richard Neville [1428-1471] was the richest peer in England on his death,” says Insley. “Neville’s sister Cicely was also married to Richard, Duke of York, and it was the collective wealth – and therefore capacity to buy support – that made the Neville/York alliance so dangerous. The Nevilles were probably worth more than the crown.” All sounds very Lannisterian, right? But come on – how rich would the Nevilles/Lannisters be in today’s money? Billions? “$2bn doesn’t seem too little, I think.” So, the most influential family in Westeros is only half as wealthy as Donald Trump? That’s not worrying at all. LH Is it really possible for winter to last a generation? House Stark’s ominous catchphrase “winter is coming” is partly a callback to an extended cold snap 8,000 years ago when White Walkers had the run of Westeros. How could one winter last 100 years? Scientific theories include the planet wobbling on its axis or having an eccentric orbit; author George RR Martin himself says it’s just down to magic. In our world, there is a (relatively) recent precedent – a 70-year “Little Ice Age” spanning the 17th and 18th centuries that refrigerated western Europe. “It went on for several decades, crops failed, the Thames froze over,” explains Professor Jim Wild, space physicist at Lancaster University. “Research shows it also coincided with a period of unusually low sunspot activity. Less solar energy can have a major effect on weather patterns.” If winter is coming – again – the poor serfs of the north should start saving up for a package holiday to Dorne. “If I found myself in that situation, I’d start heading south,” says Wild. “It should be a bit warmer nearer the equator.” GV What is it with all the castrating? Daenerys Targaryen’s army of Unsullied soldiers are elite warriors who were castrated in infancy in order to make them more focused, loyal and fearless. But is this really what happens when your tackle is chopped off? Dr Shaun Tougher, reader in ancient history at Cardiff University, is sceptical. “We do see the idea that eunuchs are chaste and loyal, but we also see the inverse: that they’re tormented and frustrated. Eunuch soldiers aren’t at all common in history, but the idea of eunuch generals is quite prevalent – there’s a very famous Byzantine eunuch general called Narses in the 6th century AD.” Because of their status as “luxury objects”, many eunuchs who originated in the slave trade ended up serving at court, like wily manipulator Varys. “Varys is in some ways the archetypal court eunuch. Although I was quite surprised when it was revealed that his castration was done by a sorcerer.” Seems like the notion of using a man’s lunchbox for magic purposes is a pure cock-and-balls story. SR Could someone really become a dragon’s ‘mother’? From the ashes of a Dothraki funeral pyre, Daenerys Targaryen emerged with three fiercely loyal baby dragons hanging off her. In the real world, newborn lizards are genetically hardwired to be much more independent. “We’ve hatched dragon eggs here,” explains Matt Cook, lead keeper at Chester Zoo, currently home to six Komodo dragons. “But if you were to try and approach them, they would attack you rather than nuzzle your hair. They’re intelligent but they have to be selfish because it’s really the only way to survive.” They may never truly love you but it is possible to train your dragon. Daenerys shouts “Dracarys!” when she wants some barbecuing done but Cook prefers a system that involves a traffic cone, a sound clicker and a tiny meaty reward to wrangle his charges. “They tolerate humans, really,” he says. “Once they get to a certain size, they know they’re the top of the food chain so they can be quite arrogant; they think they’re untouchable. But they can also be very chilled.” Khaleesi does it. GV How long would it take to build the Wall? 482 kilometres long. 213 metres high. 91 metres thick. In reality, a wall of this size made entirely of ice would collapse under its own weight. But this is Westeros, a world where dragons roam and Little Finger’s accent is never questioned, so let’s crunch some numbers. It’s estimated that when building the Great Pyramid, a workforce of, on average, 14,567 people working 10-hour days laid around 180 blocks per hour. Now, if the ice bricks making up The Wall are a metre squared, it would contain in the region of 9,342,606,000 (that’s 213 x 91 x 482,000, maths fans). At a sensible-sounding 180 blocks laid per minute, it would take the same workforce 51,903,367 hours to build The Wall. That’s 5,921 years. So, we have to assume Brandon the Builder – who legend has it enlisted the help of giants – had a much larger workforce than this. Even with 100 times the pyramids’ workforce, 14,567,000 workers, it would take over 59 years to build. All sounds like a bit of a faff, really. LH Why is the Seven Kingdoms in debt? A costly five-way civil war has forced the Seven Kingdoms to go cap in hand to the Iron Bank Of Braavos. Dr James Davis, senior lecturer in medieval history at Queen’s University Belfast, sees a parallel with Edward III, “who borrowed heavily from Italian banks”. But he was a step ahead of the Lannister dynasty. “Edward III was quite canny: at the same as fighting a war he was developing parliament to extract more taxation without too much unrest. At the heart of every medieval king, whatever their ambitions, it was always about where you could get the money.” Davis suggests that the Seven Kingdoms needs to abandon its feudalist structures – and fast. “There isn’t much sign of development of trade and industry. It lacks stable laws that would allow entrepreneurism to emerge.” Otherwise a peasants’ revolt may be just around the corner: “In a real society, there’d be more riots.” SR What’s my best chance of beating The Mountain in a duel? Even in Westeros, a land not exactly lacking in murderous mercenaries, Gregor “The Mountain” Clegane is a lethal legend. So how would a layman go about tackling him in a trial by combat? Martin “Oz” Austwick is the founder of the English Martial Arts Academy, offering classes in historical European swordsmanship. His strategy? Like the Red Viper, choose a long weapon to try to match the range of the Mountain’s terrifying greatsword: “A spear would be good, although I’d personally prefer a quarterstaff.” Also, forgo armour to allow yourself greater mobility and focus on injuring Clegane’s massive hands: if he can’t wield his weapon, he can’t cleave you in twain with it. “One debate in our community is whether targeting hands is an acceptable technique,” says Austwick. “It might seem dishonourable but against the Mountain, doing the British thing and being polite would be your undoing. So my advice would be to fight as dirty as you can.” GV How big is Westeros? George RR Martin has stated that Westeros is roughly the size of South America, which would make sense for a continent with climates that range from the frozen wastes north of the Wall to the balmy water gardens of Dorne in the south. Using measurements given in the series, the width of Westeros is calculated to be around 3,000 miles – the distance from the tip of Norway to the Red Sea – and with a population of 20-40 million. “The topography makes sense for the most part,” reckons Simon Willcocks of Ordnance Survey’s consultancy and technical services team. “All kinds of stuff from deserts to river deltas, marshy bog, mountain passes, but nothing outlandish.” But if Westeros is so big, how come the main characters manage to keep bumping into each other? “It’s a very long and narrow continent with few roads and river crossings,” reasons Willcocks. As for Essos, a continent that Varys seems to traverse at will but that has taken Daenerys at least five series to cross… well, that’s for another day. SR What is wildfire? Joffrey’s victory at the Battle of Blackwater Bay – during which the king-you’d-love-to-slap’s forces defended King’s Landing from Stannis Baratheon – owed largely to Tyrion Lannister’s procurement of an explosive known as wildfire. The resultant blue-green flames tore through Stannis’s fleet like a longsword through the back of Ned Stark’s neck. But what the blazes is it? Dr Richard Henchman, senior lecturer in theoretical chemistry at the University of Manchester, draws comparisons to “the historical episode of Archimedes’s fire to destroy Roman ships”, which used mirrors to focus the sun’s rays into deadly beams. It is also similar to Greek fire, a Byzantine weapon able to burn on water, reminiscent of a crude form of napalm. From a compositional standpoint, though, wildfire’s colouring suggest a copper compound. Perhaps what we have is a copper oxide/magnesium thermite? “It looks like magic to me,” says Henchman. Oh. Never mind then. LH Game of Thrones Season 6 starts 2am, Sunday 24 April and repeats 9pm, Monday 25 April on Sky Atlantic This article was amended on the 15th April to state the workforce necessary to build the wall in 59 years is 100 times that used to build The Great Pyramid, not 10"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/live/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-paris-climate-agreement-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2017-06-02T06:47:01Z","webTitle":"Paris climate agreement: World reacts as Trump pulls out of global accord – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-paris-climate-agreement-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/live/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-paris-climate-agreement-live-news","fields":{"headline":"Paris climate agreement: World reacts as Trump pulls out of global accord – as it happened","bodyText":"Trump framed his decision to pull the US from the landmark Paris climate agreement as “a reassertion of America’s sovereignty”, adding he was “elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” He said the US could try to re-enter the deal under more favourable terms or work to establish “an entirely new transaction” – but indicated that it would hardly be of high priority. “If we can, great. If we can’t, that’s fine,” he said. As my colleague David Smith reported earlier, the White House says America will follow the lengthy exit process outlined in the deal, meaning it will remain in the agreement (at least formally) for another three-and-a-half years – taking us right up to the next presidential election in November 2020. Though the US will remain part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Trump declared: “As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris accord.” That includes contributions to the UN Green Climate Fund (to help poorer countries to adapt to climate change and expand clean energy) and reporting on carbon data (though that is required in the US by domestic regulations anyway). In a joint statement, the leaders of France, Germany and Italy responded to Trump’s decision “with regret”, but said the Paris agreement could not be renegotiated. The question now becomes what efforts, if any, the US will adopt towards tackling climate change on its own terms – and whether the nearly 200 countries that remain in the deal will amend their own obligations. The US is the world’s second-largest emitter of carbon, behind only China – which, along with India, was singled out by Trump as being favoured under the Paris deal. But both Beijing and New Delhi have reaffirmed their commitment to meeting their targets. Trump is currently reviewing major US regulations on power plants and car rules that are aimed at reducing carbon emissions. The US Conference of Mayors, which strongly opposed his decision, said its members would continue efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming at the city and state level. Speaking of full-page advertisements – one placed in the New York Times in December 2009 has been doing the rounds on Twitter today. It was signed by business leaders and liberal commentators, lobbying then-president Barack Obama, bound for Copenhagen to forge a global climate pact, to “lead the world by example. Among them – and the reason why it’s resurfaced – was Donald Trump and his three adult children. More here, from 2016, on Salon. Social media never forgets... In separate statements and messages on social media, leaders of Apple, Google, Twitter, Amazon, Facebook, Tesla, Microsoft and IBM declared climate change an “urgent” threat that required a global effort to combat. Microsoft was among more than two dozen companies to publish an open letter urging Trump to remain in the accord as an advertisement in several US newspapers as part of an 11th-hour push on Thursday morning. Trump’s decision signals the US’ intention to increase emissions, which are already fast approaching the 2C band considered crucial by scientists to prevent serious damage to the planet. This clock estimates how much greenhouse gas the world is emitting right now – and how much we have left to emit if we want to avoid catastrophic climate change. In just 24 hours, the world will pump out more than 112m tons (CO2-e). You can embed the clock on your own website as well by using the code from the embed button (that’s the purple one with as the symbol). The White House has declined to say whether Donald Trump believes human activity contributes to climate change as the president pulled America out of the Paris agreement. Administration officials were also unable to offer revised US carbon emission targets or say what changes to the global landmark accord would persuade Trump to re-enter it. But they did offer assurance that America will abide by the lengthy exit process outlined in the deal, waiting three-and-a-half years to formally withdraw. Here’s some Conservative reaction on social media to the US’ withdrawal from the Paris accord – it seems conviction in the unfairness of the deal has only been bolstered by condemnation of Trump’s decision. • Note added 24 November 2017: In November 2017, Twitter reported to the US Congress the account @TEN_GOP among 2752 accounts identified by Twitter as being associated with Russian trolling. Those last few tweets back up Politico’s Matthew Nussbaum’s observation: In Australia, there has been a lot of talk about Australia’s bipartisan commitment to the Paris Agreement, in the face of US withdrawal. But concretely, what does that mean? Australia currently has virtually no climate policies at the national level. The Coalition’s Direct Action policy involves paying polluters to pollute less, but that is fraught with problems, since any of those gains are often lost when other polluters pollute more. And according to the government’s own projections, the current set of policies will lead to Australia’s emissions rising all the way to 2030, and completely miss the targets set at Paris of 26-28% below 2005 levels. The chart below shows the government’s most recent emissions projections against the targets committed to in Paris. The government is poised to release a review of its Direct Action policy. And next week it will receive a review of the functioning of the National Electricity Market, known as the Finkel Review. Fiji’s prime minister Voreqe Bainimarama says he tried to persuade Trump to stick with the agreement, as nations tackle “the greatest challenge our planet has ever faced.” Bainimarama says the decision is a grave disappointment for citizens of places like his Pacific island nation and US coastal cities like New York and Miami that are vulnerable to climate change. He will chair an annual climate summit in Germany in November and says he will do all he can to continue to forge a grand coalition to accelerate the momentum built since the Paris agreement. Bainimarama says he’s convinced the US government will eventually rejoin the effort. Trump announced his decision to renege on the Paris agreement on Thursday, stating that it disadvantaged the US to benefit other countries – read his full speech here, and the annotated version from our environment correspondent here Condemnation of the US’ decision to pull out has come from all corners, ranging from Apple to the Vatican; Al Gore called it “reckless and indefensible” and Hillary Clinton said it was a “historic mistake” France, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, the UK and other world leaders have expressed disappointment with the US but reiterated their resolve to tackling climate change through the Paris accord and other initiatives – more on their reaction here Only the US, Syria and Nicaragua are now not part of the agreement (and Nicaragua resolved not to join because its commitments were not binding) Refugees International, the Elders and the ACLU have been among the groups to warn of the far-reaching impact of climate change on disadvantaged communities and humanitarian crises But some commentators have downplayed the significance or potential impact of the move, suggesting that if the US had no intention of reducing its emissions its commitment to the agreement would have been only symbolic anyway The Empire State building, World Trade Center and City Hall in New York, the Wilson Building in Washington, Boston City Hall, Montreal City Hall and Paris City Hall are among the buildings to have been lit up in green in a show of commitment to action on climate change One of the reasons Trump gave on Thursday for withdrawing from the Paris accord was that it imposed “no meaningful obligations on the world’s leading polluters”, and singled out India as evidence of the fundamental unfairness of the deal: “India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Think of it: India can double their coal production. We’re supposed to get rid of ours.” Ted Frank, the director of the Center for Classic Action Fairness, was one of many to divert criticism of Trump’s decision towards India: But as the Guardian’s South Asia correspondent Michael Safi explains, the comparison does not quite stack up: India’s carbon allowance under the Paris agreement is relatively generous in recognition of the more than 300m Indians still without access to electricity. The country will also need to develop its economy in a carbon-constrained environment, unlike in the west. But the world’s third-largest carbon pollution emitter is nonetheless on course to exceed the renewable energy targets it set in Paris in 2015 by nearly 50% – and three years ahead of schedule. Last month saw the wholesale price of wind and solar energy reach record lows in the country, further undercutting the price of coal and spurring international investment in Indian renewables. Also in May, around 13.7GW of coal projects were cancelled. India’s national energy agency has predicted no new coal plants, other than those already in the pipeline, may be required until at least 2027. Surveying the toll of fossil-fuelled economic development on its rivers, farmland and air, India has recognised that transitioning to a low-carbon economy is firmly in national interests, as well as those of the planet. Echoing the earlier points made by Refugees International, the American Civil Liberties Union has pointed out that “climate change doesn’t affect us all equally”. Though this has been derided in some (especially conservative) corners of Twitter, but the fact is that the impact of climate change on disadvantaged groups is well established. A 2014 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said being in poverty made the impacts worse and part of preparing for the future was addressing inequality in society: Climate-related hazards affect poor people’s lives directly through impacts on livelihoods, reductions in crop yields, or destruction of homes and indirectly through, for example, increased food prices and food insecurity. Observed positive effects for poor and marginalized people, which are limited and often indirect, include examples such as diversification of social networks and of agricultural practices. Meanwhile, in other Trump news: Republican Rick Santorum called on Trump to pull out of the Paris accord on CNN on Thursday morning, arguing against renewable energies as “not reliable, not consistent” on a panel with former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm. He was ridiculed for this on social media. Santorum explained that he was “sad to be criticized by the left for something as obvious” as solar energy being complicated by “clouds &amp; darkness”. This didn’t really serve to ease the ridicule. Santorum is a co-chair of Americans for Energy Security and Innovation, which seeks to reduce US dependence on foreign oil. As experts, environmentalists, business leaders and others condemn Trump’s announcement, others have argued the move is mostly symbolic. Luke Kemp, economist and political scientist at the Australian National University, recently wrote a paper in Nature Climate Change, arguing that the world is better off with the US out of the Paris Agreement. We discussed his comments here and here. In response to the move, Kemp has now added: “This is now a chance to forget about the US and for a critical mass of leaders to move ahead without them.” He continued: “The announcement today does not impact US emissions or climate financing. In practical terms, it simply means that the US doesn’t need to put forward a new pledge every five years. Trump’s decision to withdraw does not tangibly effect US emissions or action. It does signal that he wants the US to become a technological fossil.” Importantly, it could mean the US will not be able to act effectively to stifle international action: “...other countries are far less likely to accede to the demands of a withdrawing climate pariah.” John Quiggin, an economist at the University of Queensland, argued along similar lines. “The announcement itself is primarily symbolic, but other actions of the Trump administration mean that US emissions will decline more slowly than they should. “However, the preliminary evidence is that this action will not be taken as a signal for other countries to follow, but rather as a further indication that the US has abandoned its leadership role in the US economy. The impact will be further reduced by the commitment of California and other state governments to pursue ambitious policies for emissions reductions.” The Indian government has not yet responded to Trump’s announcement, which came shortly after 1am local time, but at a forum last month India’s energy minister reaffirmed the south Asian giant’s commitment to the global climate agreement. “The road from Paris to today has been somewhat bumpy,” Piyush Goyal said. “We will have to sort that out. But I’d like to reassure each one of you here today that India stands committed to its commitments made at Paris irrespective of what happens in the rest of the world.” An unnamed official also told Reuters this week the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, had assured German chancellor Angela Merkel on an official visit to Berlin that India would remain in the agreement regardless of Trump’s announcement. Robert Garcia, mayor of Long Beach City, has tweeted this map showing the three countries not part of the Paris agreement: the US, Syria and Nicaragua. “What a national embarrassment...” But the map alone doesn’t tell the full story: Nicaragua has not signed onto the agreement because it doesn’t go far enough. Slate reports that Paul Oquist, who represented the country at the Paris negotiations in 2015, believed that the agreement would fail because its commitments were not binding. “[We’re not going to submit because] voluntary responsibility is a path to failure,” Quist told a reporter from Climate Home in 2015. “We don’t want to be [an] accomplice to taking the world to 3 to 4 degrees and the death and destruction that represents.” Oquist also said countries with the most emissions should take greater responsibility for tackling climate change. The US ranks second, behind China; Nicaragua ranks 131. According to the World Bank, it is already on track towards having 90% renewable energy by 2020. As for the US, well... According to Vox, Trump has tweeted scepticism or denialism about climate change 115 times since 2011. They have compiled all of them in a list that, in other less impactful circumstances, might make for amusing reading (“Most of his tweets involve some kind of confusion between climate and weather”). California senator Kamala Harris tweeted the link with a wry observation care of Maya Angelou. An interesting perspective from Guardian Australia’s opinion team – Indigenous knowledges, compiled and refined over tens of thousands of years, have the greatest potential to sustain human life on this planet: “And yet, even while the planet continues to heat up, people still don’t connect the dots. Many people still completely undervalue Indigenous knowledges, in spite of people like award-winning scientist, broadcaster and environmentalist, Dr David Suzuki urging society and our institutions not to. On his last trip here, Suzuki said that ‘Australia could learn from its Indigenous peoples ... to me the paradigm shift is that we have to see the world as Indigenous people see it.’.” The Elders, the independent global group campaigning for human rights chaired by Kofi Annan, has condemned Trump’s decision in reiterating their commitment to moving away from fossil fuels. Annan said the Paris agreement was born out of a desire to find a cooperative solution to “the great existential threat of our time”: “While the US withdrawal weakens that international accord, it will not trigger its demise.” Mary Robinson, a former UN Special Envoy on Climate Change, said the US was a “rogue state on the international stage”, but action was ongoing at state level, in cities, in businesses and communities across the country. The Elders repeated their concern at the Trump administration’s decision not to provide climate finance to help developing countries. Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former UN Special Envoy on Climate Change, said it weakened “already frayed bonds of trust between developed and developing countries”: “It places an enormous burden on other industrialised countries to mobilise the $100 billion per year promised to support climate action in developing countries.” In a televised address, French president Emmanuel Macron said Trump’s pulling out of the Paris agreement was a mistake. He urged scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and anyone disappointed by the decision to see France as a “second homeland”, adding: “I call on them come and work here with us.” “The Paris agreement remain irreversible and will be implemented not just by France but by all the other nations. We will succeed because we are fully committed, because wherever we live, whoever we are, we all share the same responsibility: make our planet great again.” Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, said in a memo to employees that he tried on Tuesday to talk President Trump into seeing through the Paris deal but “it wasn’t enough”. CNN obtained the message: I want to reassure you that today’s developments will have no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment. We power nearly all of our operations with renewable energy, which we believe is an example of something that’s good for our planet and makes good business sense as well.” Earlier, Tesla’s Elon Musk and Disney’s Robert Iger announced their resignation from Trump’s council on principle. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai of Google have also expressed disappointment. Guardian Australia’s political editor, Katharine Murphy, has written on the impact of the US’ decision on Australia’s tortured climate change policy debate: The US president’s willingness to surrender global leadership on important issues is, from this distance, truly unfathomable. Even his withdrawal patter on Friday morning was pathetic. America was out, but would come back in if it could get a better deal. America was out, but possibly back in, because the citizens of Pittsburgh apparently don’t care about climate change. ... I know there’s a valid school of thought that says silly Trump doesn’t matter, that America’s recklessness will galvanise the public around the importance of climate change, that the trend towards decarbonisation is now hard-baked in to the system – but that’s not how things look if you sit on the Australian government’s perch. For prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and his government, Trump’s timing is deeply unhelpful, to put it mildly.” A senior official of the Vatican said it would see a US exit from the Paris agreement as a slap in the face, Reuters reported before Trump announced his decision. Pope Francis, who strongly backed the deal, gave Trump a signed copy of his 2015 encyclical letter calling for the environment to be protected from the effects of climate change at his meeting with the US president last month. In a separate meeting, the Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, urged not to quit the Paris accord. “If he really does [pull out], it would be a huge slap in the face for us,” Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, told the Rome newspaper La Repubblica and later confirmed to Reuters. “It will be a disaster for everyone.” Sorondo said he believed the US oil lobby was behind the decision and that the industry had “maneuvered” Trump. A withdrawal “would not only be a disaster but completely unscientific,” he said. “Saying that we need to rely on coal and oil is like saying that the earth is not round. It is an absurdity dictated by the need to make money.” After an Australian political scientist argued that benefits could emerge from the US’ decision to renege on Paris, Michael Liebreich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, has voiced similar on Twitter. It remains to be seen whether Liebreich’s predictions will come true, though as he says: “I’m wrong around 30% of the time”. At least on his fourth point, one could reasonably argue that threshold was passed long ago. Japan’s foreign ministry has described the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement as “regrettable”. “Climate change requires a concerted effort by the whole of the international community,” the ministry said in a statement on Friday morning. “Japan believes the leadership of the developed countries to be of great importance, and the steady implementation of the Paris agreement is critical in this regard. “As Japan was hoping to work with the United States within the framework of the Paris agreement, the recent announcement by the US administration on its withdrawal ... is regrettable.” The statement pointed out that the US was the world’s second largest emitter of the greenhouse gases, but possessed the technical knowhow to address climate change. “Japan hopes to explore ways in which it can cooperate with the United States so as to effectively address climate change issues.” Tokyo said it would work with other parties to the Paris agreement to ensure its “steady and full implementation. Through such efforts, Japan will vigorously tackle this important issue of climate change.” Refugees International has said in a statement it is “dismayed and deeply alarmed” by the decision to pull out of the Paris accord, given the impact of climate change on displacement and humanitarian crises. The hundreds of millions of people across the globe who live in low-lying coastal areas and river deltas are already exposed to floods, storms, and rising sea levels. In other parts of the world, more frequent and severe droughts are undermining food security. The US’ decision to renege on its commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions compounds the devastating impact of its severe cuts to humanitarian funding, says RI, meaning it is not only “doing less to prevent human suffering but to alleviate it as well”. RI’s climate displacement program manager, Alice Thomas, said Trump’s decision would be felt most keenly by people in “the poorest and least stable regions of the world”. “It means America walking away from its global leadership role and leaving the door open to irreversible and catastrophic effects that will touch every aspect of our lives at home and abroad.” Yesterday, just before Trump announced the US would withdraw, Australia’s The Climate Institute released polling on what Australians think the country should do in the case of the US withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. The majority – 61% – thought Australia should work harder with other countries to achieve the goals of Paris, if the US withdrew. Another 26% thought Australia should maintain its current position. There were, however, a full 12% of respondents who thought Australia should follow Trump’s lead. Acting CEO of The Climate Institute, Olivia Kember, said in a statement: “Along with the leaders of EU nations, China, India, major global businesses and investors, Australian citizens recognise that it’s in our own interest to stay in the Paris Agreement and make it work.” Following our earlier report on the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson’s upcoming visit to New Zealand, the prime minister has released a statement: “The Prime Minister and Secretary Tillerson will discuss a range of issues including trade, regional security, the fight against terror and, as the Prime Minister has said, he will register New Zealand’s disappointment at the US decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement. “New Zealand remains absolutely committed to meeting our own targets. The clear message from around the world is that the global community will press ahead with the Paris agenda and we will play our part.” Protests are planned for Tillerson’s visit to Wellington on Tuesday. My colleague, Guardian US’ environment reporter Oliver Milman, has sifted through the statements Trump made in his speech, noting on the rather casual caveat he slipped in: that the US will renegotiate this pact, or maybe some other pact, aimed at ensuring the future liveability of the planet. But if it doesn’t work out, that’s OK. Check out Ollie’s point-by-point analysis below: Media Matters has shared a clip from Thursday’s edition of Fox News’ The Five, in which Kimberly Guilfoyle says Trump called her for advice earlier that morning. Guilfoyle’s revelation that the president called her at 8am (“it said unknown. I thought it was Fox News”) took even her co-hosts by surprise, as the below transcript shows: KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE: I don’t think this is a deal that anybody should be crying about. Like we said, it’s non-binding, and the United States is already a clean energy, oil and gas leader. So, we can keep doing what we’re doing, we can keep reducing our emissions. Why would we in fact put ourselves at an economic disadvantage, giving and subsidising an economic windfall to other countries, in sort of a climate redistribution of wealth scheme? It makes no sense to me. I think he did the brave and courageous thing, and in fact, I told him that this morning at 8AM, when he called. And I spoke to him about it, and this was something very much so on his mind, but he seemed like... GREG GUTFELD: Wait a second, who called you? GUILFOYLE: The president. GUTFELD: Why? DANA PERINO: To ask about climate change? GUTFELD: Why did he call you? GUILFOYLE: Climate change, taxes. The Five. GUTFELD: I think that you buried the lede here. PERINO: You just tried to slip that in there, just like maybe it happens all the time. GUTFELD: I know: ‘yeah, the president called me at 8 in the morning’. GUILFOYLE: It said “unknown,” I thought it was Fox News. But then he said he loves The Five – “terrific show” – and said to say hello to all of you. A group of Filipino activists have protested the then-impending withdrawal of the US from the Paris agreement at the US Embassy in Manila. The Manila Climate Rebel Alliance called for a global stand to be made against “Trump the Hutt and his fellow fossil fuel gangsters”. Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has called on Trump to reconsider his decision to leave the Paris accord in a 2.5-minute video: “One man cannot destroy our progress. One man can’t stop our clean energy revolution. And one man can’t go back in time. Only I can do that. ... “Mr President, I know that it can be easier and more comfortable to look backwards. ... But some of us know what a clean energy future looks like and it isn’t scary. ... “The dirty energy future with asthma, emphysema and cancer is much, much more terrifying.” Republican politicians and representatives of the coal industry have cheered Trump’s action. “President Trump’s courageous decision to exit the Paris Accord recognises that the US is not legally bound to an Obama-era agreement that set unrealistic emissions targets at the expense of billions of American taxpayer dollars without the approval of Congress,” said Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, who joined nine other states in urging Trump to leave the agreement. Last week, 22 Republican senators had written to the president urging him to “make a clean break” from the Paris deal. The letter was drafted by Wyoming’s John Barrasso, chairman of the Senate committee on environment and public works, and Oklahoma’s Jim Inhofe, a longtime climate change denier and senior member of that committee. Tom McCarthy and Lauren Gambino of Guardian US have broken down the 22 signatories’ interests in the oil, gas and coal industries and found a sum total of nearly US $10.7m over the past three election cycles. Political scientist Luke Kemp from the Australian National University has argued that not only is the US’ decision to pull out of the Paris agreement not as catastrophic as reported, there could even be some benefits to emerge. One is the possibility for parties to the agreement to develop climate trade measures, such as border tax adjustments that institute a carbon tax on US imports. Similar measures were parts of other international agreements, including the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which successfully reduced the world’s reliance on ozone layer depleting substances. Kemp also expressed hope that the withdrawal of the US would motivate other large powers like the EU and China to show stronger leadership – as certainly looks possible from the response of world leaders to Trump’s announcement. But the risk of the US sabotaging action on climate change from outside the Paris agreement – for example, by cancelling climate financing for the developing world – certainly remains. Writing in The Conversation, Kemp concludes: Wanting the US to remain is a short-sighted, knee-jerk reaction. The international community should be much more worried about the real domestic actions of the US, rather than whether it is symbolically cooperating internationally... Policy, not participation, needs to be the focus of criticism. Otherwise Paris will prove itself to be nothing more than a diplomatic fig leaf “As president, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens. The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers – who I love – and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.” You can read Trump’s speech in full here. Amid all the doom and gloom, it’s worth noting not all environmentalists think Trump’s withdrawal from Paris is so bad for the world. It’s undoubtedly a hit for US credibility in future international agreements, but political scientist Luke Kemp from the Australian National University published an analysis in the journal Nature Climate Change just last week arguing the world is better off with a Trump-led US out of the agreement. In a nutshell, Kemp’s argument is that Trump can do more damage to international climate action from within the agreement than he can outside of it. The US was likely to increase its emissions regardless of whether it remained in the agreement, he says – especially now that Trump abandoned Obama’s Clean Power Plan. Paris may forfeit legitimacy due to the loss of a major emitter, but it is equally likely that its legitimacy would have been grievously injured by the US blatantly violating the spirit and purpose of the agreement. Echoing the earlier criticism of her husband, Hillary Clinton has tweeted her condemnation of Trump’s decision, calling it a “historic mistake ... [that] leaves American workers &amp; families behind”. Clinton has been increasingly vocal in her criticism of Trump as she ramps up her public appearances after several months of laying low following her bruising defeat in the presidential election last year. The former vice-president has released a scathing statement: Removing the United States from the Paris Agreement is a reckless and indefensible action. It undermines America’s standing in the world and threatens to damage humanity’s ability to solve the climate crisis in time. But make no mistake: if President Trump won’t lead, the American people will. “Civic leaders, mayors, governors, CEOs, investors and the majority of the business community will take up this challenge. We are in the middle of a clean energy revolution that no single person or group can stop. President Trump’s decision is profoundly in conflict with what the majority of Americans want from our president; but no matter what he does, we will ensure that our inevitable transition to a clean energy economy continues. Last week, Gore had said in Cannes there was an “excellent chance” that Trump would surprise many by deciding to stay in the Paris agreement – but even withdrawing would not slow the momentum of the climate movement. He pointed to Atlanta, Georgia’s recent commitment to 100% renewable energy by 2035. He did express concern that other nations might follow suit: “The Paris agreement has an historic significance of its own. And if the largest economy in the world were to withdraw, it would present a risk that some other countries might use that as an excuse. So it’s important that we stay in.” Gore’s new documentary, An Inconvenient Sequel, opened the Sundance festival at the start of this year. Thanks Sam – I’m taking over the reins of our rolling coverage of Trump’s Paris Agreement announcement from Australia, where Guardian Australia’s climate blogger Graham Readfearn has joined the global chorus of condemnation: Make no mistake here. The foundation for Trump’s dismissal of the Paris deal – and for the people who pushed him the hardest to do it – is the rejection of the science linking fossil-fuel burning to dangerous climate change. Or rather, Trump’s rejection of the Paris deal was built on the flimsy, cherry-picked and long-debunked talking points of an industry built to manufacture doubt about climate science. Once you fall for those arguments, making an economic case suddenly feels plausible. The view from some of the Guardian’s opinion writers: Dana Nuccitelli, environmental scientist and risk assessor, says it “now seems inevitable that the history books will view Trump as America’s worst-ever president”. “Given our culpability in creating an urgent world-wide environmental crisis, it was a moral duty to keep our commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. To walk away is supremely selfish,” writes Jill Abramson: And David Suzuki on the way Trump’s rationale for abandoning the Paris agreement is outdated and false: Mexico has stated its “unconditional support for the Paris accord,” saying it “will continue to meet its established goals” for reducing carbon emissions, the AP reports. The nation’s foreign relations department said in a statement: Efforts to slow climate change are a moral imperative, because we owe it to future generations.” Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto reiterated his commitment on Twitter: Protests are planned in New Zealand where US secretary of state Rex Tillerson has a Wellington visit scheduled next Tuesday. Niamh O’Flynn, executive director of 350 Aotearoa, a climate change group, said: Trump is out of step with the rest of the world, and we need to make sure he feels that when his Secretary of State lands in Wellington on Tuesday. People and governments around the world are backing the US into a corner where they the lonely outlier. [Prime minister] Bill English must denounce this move to show whose side we’re on.” Opposition leader Andrew Little said in a statement: We can’t now let the USA water down the Paris Accord. Mr Tillerson must be reminded that the world can only combat climate change together and that New Zealand stands shoulder-to-shoulder with other nations which have embraced the challenge. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner were not at Trump’s announcement, because, according to a White House official, the couple was attending a service at synagogue. Ivanka had met with Al Gore last year, sparking rumors that the president’s daughter, could influence her father on climate change, women’s health and other issues. Some hoped she would encourage the White House not to abandon the Paris agreement. Politico is now reporting that Ivanka seems to have “lost” on the Paris accord, but that she and Kushner, a senior advisor, “have taken the defeat in stride”: After she organized five weeks of meetings focused on the Paris agreement — including her own sit-down with EPA administrator Scott Pruitt and enlisting people like Apple CEO Tim Cook to speak to the president about climate — Ivanka Trump appeared to have lost on one of the issues where she at one point expected to hold some sway. Scenes of protests across the country this afternoon: Former president Bill Clinton has offered his criticism of the president’s decision: Earlier, Hillary Clinton slammed the possible exit from the agreement, calling it “incredibly foolish” and “really stupid”, adding: The president is a very impulsive, reactive personality. So, if we all like the Paris agreement, he may decide to get out of it, not even understanding one bit about what that means. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is not the only executive to step down from Trump’s council following the Paris Agreement withdrawal. Robert Iger, CEO of Disney, has also just announced his resignation “as a matter of principle”: Earlier in the day, General Motors CEO Mary Barra said she would remain on Trump’s strategy and policy forum, saying the group “provides GM a seat at an important table to contribute to a constructive dialogue about key policy issues”. The White House in a new statement says Trump had “frank, substantive discussions” about the Paris agreement with the leaders of Germany, France, Canada and Britain. The president also promised that during his administration, the US “will be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth”, adding that the world leaders “all agreed to continue dialogue and strengthen cooperation on environmental and other issues going forward”. Read more on the reactions from world leaders here. The central message from Emmanuel Macron, in large capital letters: The AP has released some helpful fact checks of Trump’s case for withdrawing the US from the climate agreement, noting that some of his claims are “shaky”: For one, the White House cites a study paid for by groups that profit from fossil fuels. Trump also claims 1m jobs have been created since the election. That’s basically right, but he earns no credit for jobs created in the months before he became president. The White House cited a study by NERA Consulting, claiming that meeting the Obama administration’s requirements in the Paris agreement would cost the US economy nearly $3tn over several decades. The US Chamber of Commerce and the American Council for Capital Formation paid for the research, according to the AP. Both groups have financial ties to people who profit from the burning of fossil fuels. The AP also noted that the president’s citation of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) study was questionable. The White House claimed that the research found that if all member nations met their obligations, the climate impact would be negligible, but the MIT author said the administration is citing an outdated version and was taking the information out of context. The Democratic governors of New York, California and Washington have announced a new US Climate Alliance, billed as a “coalition that will convene US states committed to upholding the Paris Climate Agreement and taking aggressive action on climate change”. The three states combined represent more than one-fifth of the US gross domestic product, roughly 68m people and at least 10% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Officials said they are committed to achieving the US goal of reducing emissions by 26-28% of 2005 levels. Jerry Brown, governor of California, which has positioned itself as a leader in fighting climate change, said: If the President is going to be AWOL in this profoundly important human endeavor, then California and other states will step up.” Sam Levin in San Francisco on the blog now, taking over for Tom McCarthy. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who insists he is not running for president, despite persistent rumors, has offered his criticisms of Trump’s announcement: Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children’s future at risk. For our part, we’ve committed that every new data center we build will be powered by 100% renewable energy. Stopping climate change is something we can only do as a global community, and we have to act together before it’s too late. Here’s Macron, speaking in English. “I do respect this decision, but I do think it is an actual mistake both for the US and for our planet. I just said President Trump in a few words a few minutes ago this assessment. “Tonight I wish to tell the United States, France believes in you. The world believes in you...” The Turnbull government has recommitted to Australia’s emissions targets in the Paris Agreement after Donald Trump’s withdrawal but faces internal division as conservative MPs celebrated the decision. Energy and environment minister Josh Frydenberg said he was disappointed with Trump’s decision but reiterated the Turnbull government’s full commitment to the Paris Accord. “We reiterate our full commitment to the Paris Accord,” Frydenberg told the ABC. “We believe that the targets we agreed to, the 26% to 28% reduction in emissions by 2030 on 2005 levels are reasonable, are achievable. “I do believe that it is still a very meaningful agreement. You have more than 190 countries that signed on and in record time, 146 countries have ratified. So even without the US, around 70% of the world’s emissions are covered by that agreement.” But Liberal MP and chair of the backbench environment committee, Craig Kelly, who was at the forefront of the campaign which forced Frydenberg to rule out any form of carbon trading, had “champagne on ice” waiting for the US withdrawal. Early on Friday morning, he posted “THEY’RE OUT”, welcoming the decision with a video of Whitney Houston singing the Star Spangled Banner. “There is a more efficient way to generate energy than using fossil fuels, it’s just that mankind hasn’t yet worked it out,” Kelly said. “But if our history tells us anything, we are more likely to discover that new technology by combining free market capitalism with the wealth created by fossil fuels - than we are through central planning and government imposed regulations that destroy wealth.” Angela Merkel called Donald Trump immediately after he delivered his announcement, expressing her regret during a phone call at his decision, her spokesman Steffen Seibert said on Twitter. During the conversation she stressed that Germany would stick to the agreement. He added in another tweet in English: “Chancellor Merkel disappointed w/Pres. Trump’s decision. Now more than ever we will work for global policies that save our planet,” he wrote. According to Seibert immediately after her call to Trump, Merkel telephoned with France’s president Emmanuel Macron, he said, and they were in agreement that “Germany and France will grasp at new initiatives in order to ensure the climate agreement is a success”. In a further tweet, he added that Germany, France and Italy were in agreement that the Paris agreement should not be renegotiated as it was of “vital importance for our planet”. New French president Emmanuel Macron isn’t going to bed until he’s had his say about Trump’s withdrawal, apparently. He was to have started speaking 10 minutes ago, we’ll report what we hear. Reaction from We Rate Dogs: House minority leader Nancy Pelosi: “abandoning America’s leadership”: Pulling out of the Paris Accord defies the overwhelming support for action from credible scientists, the governments of 194 different countries and many religious groups. Faith leaders from Pope Francis to the evangelical community have urged us to act to preserve the beauty of God’s creation. “By walking away from this pact, President Trump is abandoning America’s leadership position in the fight against the climate crisis and is sending a strong message to the rest of the world to create, design and manufacture clean energy solutions and create jobs elsewhere. If President Trump wants nations like China and India to take stronger and swifter action on climate, then he should do so through the accountability and enforcement provisions in the Paris Agreement, not by breaking our word and storming out of the room. Trump’s withdrawal announcement came in the late evening in Russia, and official commentary was not immediately available. But Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier on Thursday that Russia “attaches great importance” to the Paris climate accord, and a US withdrawal could complicate the agreement’s implementation. “Of course, the effectiveness and realisation of this convention will be hampered without key participants,” Peskov told journalists. “There is no alternative (to the accord) at this time.” The Russian television station Ren TV warned that climate change “could turn into a real catastrophe” after the US withdrawal. In a statement last year, the foreign ministry said Moscow signing the Paris accord “reaffirms Russia’s commitment to the joint objectives of the international community in global warming”. But in the past, climate change has often been seen as beneficial for Russia, which has been rushing to develop military bases, shipping routes and oil and gas fields in the Arctic as the region warms. Even though climate change has exacerbated forest fires and thawed permafrost in Russia, according to scientists, the issue has not been widely covered by state media here. Putin, who once joked that Russians would spend less on fur coats, said at an Arctic forum in March that climate change would “continue anyway and anyhow” and skeptics “may not be at all silly”. “Climate change brings in more favorable conditions and improves the economic potential of this region,” Putin said. Astronaut Scott Kelly: Obama’s official photographer: Florida Representative Charlie Crist: ‘heartbroken’ It looks like Trump’s plan to “renegotiate” the Paris deal may be a clown plan: The Berliner Kurier has a hot front page for Friday: “One of the most important contracts in the history of humanity saw 195 countries committing in 2015 to save the planet for our children. But now the man in the White House is putting the project at risk. Is he a danger for us all?” the paper asks in an editorial. Martin Schulz, leader of the Social Democrats and the party’s candidate for September’s elections tweeted: “You can withdraw from a climate agreement but not from climate change, Mr Trump. Reality isn’t just another statesman you shove away”. The opposition Green Party tweeted: “Trump leaves the Paris agreement. A hard defeat for climate protection. All the more decisively will we now fight for our planets.” Cem Özdemir, joint leader of the Greens tweeted: “Trump doesn’t know what he’s doing. We do!”, and went on to promote a joint climate union between the EU and US states and cities. “Let’s work on climate protection”, he said. But German climate experts were generally of the opinion that whether Trump’s government was in or out of the Paris agreement, the effect would be the same. “In any case the members of this government are for personal and political reasons not interested in making laws to protect the environment - of whatever kind - which they see as getting in the way of doing business,” said Matthias Ruth, a German professor at the Northeastern University in Boston. Lukas Hermwille, scientific researcher in the field of international climate policy at the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy, drew attention to the fact that the exit from the agreement would anyway only come into effect in around three years’ time “ironically,” he told Die Welt, “on the day after the next US presidential election”. But Trump could still spend the rest of his time in office torpedoing climate protection from the inside out, he added. “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” Trump said. The line has ticked off a lot of Pittsburghers. The Weather Channel responds: Here’s the CEO of General Electric: Democratic Pennsylvania senator Casey: Elon Musk: Republican senator Graham: The mayor of Pittsburgh: Here’s Guardian US environment reporter Oliver Milman: A future president can reverse this but America’s standing in the world will take a while to recover. Those renewable jobs will go OS &amp; emissions cuts will slow at a time when they must accelerate if we are to avoid the worst in sea level rise, heatwaves, loss of reefs etc The news was met with disbelief and anger in Brussels, where the EU and China are currently mid-way through a summit at the end of which they will announce their acceleration of efforts to combat climate change under the Paris agreement. The EU’s commissioner for climate action and energy, Miguel Arias Cañete, said the vacuum left by the US’s withdrawal would now be filled be new global leaders, and he vowed that the climate accord would endure. He said: “Today’s announcement has galvanised us rather than weakened us, and this vacuum will be filled by new broad committed leadership. Europe and its strong partners all around the world are ready to lead the way. We will work together to face one of the most compelling challenges of our time.” Cañete added: “Today is a sad day for the global community, as a key partner turns its back on the fight against climate change. The EU deeply regrets the unilateral decision by the Trump administration to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement. “The Paris Agreement is fit for purpose. Paris is ambitious yet not prescriptive. The Paris Agreement allows each Party to forge its own path to contributing to the goals of preventing dangerous climate change. So there is room for the US to chart its own course within the Paris Agreement. 195 countries have signed the Paris Agreement, 195 different paths to meeting the Paris goals.” Others, however, hit out at the US president’s move. The president of the European parliament, Antonio Tajani, said: “It is a matter of trust and leadership. This decision will hurt the US and the planet.” Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the liberal group in the European parliament tweeted a report on the impact of rising tides on Hawaii, adding: “MAKE AMERICA SMALL AGAIN”. The comments came shortly after Tusk, and the president of the European Commission president, Jean Claude Juncker, had an informal dinner with the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, in Brussels. Will Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate change agreement tip the world into fiery catastrophe? The extraordinary unity of the rest of the world’s nations in tackling global warming, allied with the booming green economy, driven by plummeting renewable energy costs, are strong reasons to think not. A much more likely casualty of Trump’s choice is the US economy he claims to be protecting: America’s brilliance at innovation, investment and building businesses will no longer have its government’s support. The prize of leadership in the 21st-century economy could be sacrificed in a doomed attempt to revive the fossil-fuelled economy of the 20th century. However much Trump “digs coal”, he cannot force companies to build coal-fired power stations if wind and solar are cheaper and executives are smart enough to realise that a billion-dollar bet on a new plant – likely to be closed by Trump’s successor – is not a winner. Instead, US states and cities will continue to pursue the green future that secures clean air, water and the promise of climate stability for their citizens. That is no small deal: combined together, California and New York City would be the fourth biggest economy in the world. Read further: Trump says withdrawing from the deal “represents a reassertion of America’s sovereignty.” Then he says it’s his “highest obligation and greatest honor” to protect the US constitution. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who long opposed the accord, praised Trump’s decision to withdraw, calling the treaty “simply a raw deal for America”: “Signed by President Obama without Senate ratification, it would have driven up the cost of energy, hitting middle-class and low-income Americans the hardest,” Ryan said in a statement. “In order to unleash the power of the American economy, our government must encourage production of American energy.” Trump says the tax reform bill “is moving along in Congress” and people will be “pleasantly surprised.” “It’s going very well,” Trump says. Then he says the Paris deal “handicaps the US economy in order to win praise from the very global activists and [who?] that have long sought to gain wealth at our expense...” In that section, Trump pointed to a shadowy global conspiracy that created the Paris deal to steal US treasure and insult her citizenry. This is the Bannon section. “You see what’s happening,” Trump says. “It’s pretty obvious to those who keep an open mind.” Then he warns that other countries are laughing at the USA: At what point does America get demeaned. At what point does America get laughed at as a country. “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” Trump says. The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States while empowering some of the world’s top polluting countries should expel any doubt as to why foreign lobbyists should wish to keep our beautiful country tied up and bound down... that’s not going to happen while I’m president, I’m sorry. – Donald Trump Tom Steyer, the environmental activist and Democratic mega-donor, vowed retribution for Trump’s action. “The Trump Administration has just committed assault and battery on the future of the American people,” Steyer, who serves as the president of the advocacy group NextGen Climate, said in a statement. “By pulling out of the Paris Agreement, Donald Trump is betraying the moral, political, and economic leadership position America has achieved over centuries at the cost of American lives. Yet the voice of the people remains the most powerful force in the land, and we will be heard.” Brian Deese, a former senior adviser to Barack Obama who led the previous administration’s efforts on climate, said Trump’s decision marked a retreat from “a total global consensus” on the need to combat global warming. “The diplomatic blowback will be significant,” he said, while pointing to the widespread support for the Paris accord among every one of America’s key allies. “Diplomacy is a give and take,” Deese added. “The next time the United States is looking for partnership, a lot of these countries will legitimately say when it came to an issue we cared about, you weren’t there for us.” And that’s a meaningful thing.” Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer described Trump’s decision as “a devastating failure of historic proportions.” “Future generations will look back on President Trump’s decision as one of the worst policy moves made in the 21st century because of the huge damage to our economy, our environment and our geopolitical standing,” Schumer said in a statement. “Pulling out of the Paris agreement doesn’t put America first, it puts America last in recognizing science, in being a world leader and protecting our own shore line, our economy and our planet,” he added. “It’s now crystal clear President Trump is comfortable both ceding the moral high ground and the economic upper hand to countries like China, and endangering the future of our planet.” Trump calls the Paris deal a “self-inflicted major economic wound.” There’s no indication that’s the case, but likewise nothing stopping him from saying it. Trump is making out the Paris deal, which hadn’t dug in in the US’ energy policy yet when he was elected, to be the source of a made-up US economic catastrophe and hemorrhaging of jobs and GDP. “The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries,” Trump says. Again, a wild claim, wildly unfounded from the president. He says “we’ll be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases” under the Paris deal. The Paris accord “is very unfair at the highest level to the United States,” Trump says. Trump says the agreement blocks the development of clean coal. “And the mines are starting to open up. We’re having a big opening,” he says. Then he says Paris would have outlawed US coal but allowed China and Indian coal. “In short the agreement doesn’t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of the United States.” Coal jobs, and the role of coal in US energy production, were long gone before the Paris deal. Trump says the Paris deal would cost the US economy $3tn in lost GDP. Then Trump says he’s backing out of the deal owing to his environmental conscience: As someone who cares deeply about the environment, as I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal which harms the United States, which it does. Trump says that “one-by-one” he’s keeping the promises he made in his presidential campaign. “Believe me, we’ve just begun,” he says. “The fruits of our labor will be seen very shortly.” “I don’t want anything to get in our way,” he says. “Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America... the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord.” Trump fans in the crowd clap. “Thank you,” he says. “But begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris accord or an entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States... “So we’re getting out but we’ll start to negotiate and we’ll see if we can make a deal that’s fair.’ Donald Trump arrives. He says he’s monitoring an attack at a casino in Manila. Then he says he made “a very very successful trip” abroad, “believe me.” He says he is creating American jobs. Pence: “The American people ... will see once again, our president is choosing to put American jobs and American consumers first... and choosing to put America’s forgotten men and women first.” Pence welcomes everyone. “You know it’s the greatest privilege of my life to serve as vice president to a president who is fighting every day to make America great again,” Pence says. “And this president has been rolling back excessive regulations and unfair trade practices that were stifling American jobs,” he says. “Thanks to president Donald Trump, America is back.” The live stream is active. Vice president Mike Pence has come out. Jacqueline Savitz, executive with Oceana: President Trump’s decision regarding the Paris Agreement on climate action spells trouble for the world’s oceans -- and for humanity. The oceans have already absorbed massive amounts of heat and carbon dioxide, causing ocean waters to become more acidic. This is bad news for corals, molluscs like clams and oysters, and arthropods like lobsters and crabs. That means not only ecological devastation but a hit to our seafood economy. Coastal communities and ecosystems around the world are threatened with seas that are rising because of the expansion of warmed waters and the melting of ancient ice caps. Disruption of ocean food chains could increase the risk of hunger for the millions of people around the world who depend on ocean fish for their food and livelihood. Kierán Suckling, executive director, Center for Biological Diversity: Trump just confirmed his total contempt for our planet’s future. With this reckless rejection of international climate cooperation, the administration took a giant step toward turning our country into a rogue nation. Most Americans want global action against global warming, but Trump’s foreign policy seems aimed strictly at appeasing coal companies and the oil industry.” No, Trump has not spoken yet, but the reactions are flooding in. Senator Bernie Sanders: ‘an international disgrace’ President Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement is an abdication of American leadership and an international disgrace. At this moment, when climate change is already causing devastating harm around the world, we do not have the moral right to turn our backs on efforts to preserve this planet for future generations. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse: ‘betraying the country’ Trump is betraying the country, in the service of Breitbart fake news, the shameless fossil fuel industry, and the Koch brothers’ climate denial operation. It’s sad. Erich Pica, president, Friends of the Earth US: Today, Donald Trump turned the fate of the planet into a reality T.V. show hosted live from the White House Rose Garden. Trump’s grand reveal surprised no one; once again, he elevated Big Oil over our environment and the well-being of humanity. History will harshly judge the Trump Administration’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement. By denying climate change and failing to act, Trump has put us on a path beset with increased famine, poverty, disease and death for millions of people in the U.S. and across the globe. Jason Grumet, president, Bipartisan Policy Center: Withdrawing from the Paris agreement will needlessly undermine U.S. relations with our allies and undercut international efforts to address climate change. Nearly 200 other nations will move forward with this agreement regardless of our participation. By exiting the process, President Trump forfeits America’s opportunity to shape the global economic transition that is already underway The American Civil Liberties Union calls today’s move by Trump “a massive step back for racial justice”: Here’s that live stream again. So you have it handy: Environmental groups have pointed out that the Trump administration’s executive orders setting aside Obama-era emissions caps and other environmental protections have represented an abandonment of the fight against climate change before today’s news. Which means that should the next US president be sympathetic to the idea of re-joining the Paris accord (assuming it still exists), he/she will have more work to do than simply signing back on to this one deal. Priebus in green. What can it mean? Only one thing. Covfefe. Today is a win for chief strategist Steve Bannon, who with Environmental Protection Administrator Scott Pruitt urged the president to jettison the Paris deal. While we wait... here’s more from the band: Politico has published a document it says is the White House talking points for pulling out of the Paris accord. The document squares with other reports about it. It reads: Paris Accord – TALKERS Topline: The Paris Accord is a BAD deal for Americans, and the President’s action today is keeping his campaign promise to put American workers first. The Accord was negotiated poorly by the Obama Administration and signed out of desperation. It frontloads costs on the American people to the detriment of our economy and job growth while extracting meaningless commitments from the world’s top global emitters, like China. The U.S. is already leading the world in energy production and doesn’t need a bad deal that will harm American workers. UNDERMINES U.S. Competitiveness and Jobs According to a study by NERA Consulting, meeting the Obama Administration’s requirements in the Paris Accord would cost the U.S. economy nearly $3 trillion over the next several decades. By 2040, our economy would lose 6.5 million industrial sector jobs – including 3.1 million manufacturing sector jobs It would effectively decapitate our coal industry, which now supplies about one-third of our electric power The deal was negotiated BADLY, and extracts meaningless commitments from the world’s top polluters The Obama-negotiated Accord imposes unrealistic targets on the U.S. for reducing our carbon emissions, while giving countries like China a free pass for years to come. Under the Accord, China will actually increase emissions until 2030 The U.S. is ALREADY a Clean Energy and Oil &amp; Gas Energy Leader; we can reduce our emissions and continue to produce American energy without the Paris Accord America has already reduced its carbon-dioxide emissions dramatically. Since 2006, CO2 emissions have declined by 12 percent, and are expected to continue to decline. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. is the leader in oil &amp; gas production. The agreement funds a UN Climate Slush Fund underwritten by American taxpayers President Obama committed $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund - which is about 30 percent of the initial funding – without authorization from Congress With $20 trillion in debt, the U.S. taxpayers should not be paying to subsidize other countries’ energy needs. The deal also accomplishes LITTLE for the climate According to researchers at MIT, if all member nations met their obligations, the impact on the climate would be negligible. The impacts have been estimated to be likely to reduce global temperature rise by less than .2 degrees Celsius in 2100. Via the White House on Youtube: White House talking points obtained by The Associated Press say that the Paris accord “is a BAD deal for Americans” and that the president’s action would keep “his campaign promise to put American workers first”: “The Accord,” the document goes on to say, “was negotiated poorly by the Obama Administration and signed out of desperation.” “The U.S. is already leading the world in energy production and doesn’t need a bad deal that will harm American workers,” it reads. The White House had signaled that withdrawal was likely, but Trump has been known to change his mind at the last minute on such major decisions. A former Obama senior adviser says the notion that the United States was cornered into making a bad deal in Paris is wrong: Guardian Washington correspondent David Smith is in the Rose Garden, where “a band is playing bouncy, upbeat jazz”: “I hear the unmistakable notes of ‘Summertime, and the livin’ is easy’ (orchestral only, no singer). Strangely apt for global warming.” Update: dig the bass: Reuters and the Washington Post are quoting from a document said to be Trump’s upcoming speech. They have this: Trump to say decision to withdraw ‘is keeping his campaign promise to put American workers first’ Trump to say Paris climate agreement ‘front loads costs on American people’ - document Trump to say that the accord was bad, negotiated poorly by Obama administration and signed out of desperation. The scene: The Associated Press now has it: Jon Ralston, the dean of Nevada politics journalists, makes this joke for the LAST TIME Please Follow Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org (and Guardian contributor): About right. The Daily Beast and CNN are carrying reports that Trump has told congressional staffers on a conference call that he’s withdrawing from the Paris accord. Here’s the Beast: On a conference call with Capitol Hill staffers ahead of the speech, White House energy policy adviser Michael Catanzaro confirmed that “the United States is getting out of the Paris agreement.” Trump, Catanzaro said, “will be open to and will immediately be looking for a better deal.” A source provided The Daily Beast with the call-in information. Here’s CNN’s Jake Tapper: World leaders, businesses, investors, scientists and development charities have joined in urging Donald Trump not to withdraw the US from the Paris climate change agreement. The US president is due to announce his decision at 3pm ET on Thursday and is expected to pull the world’s largest economy, and second greatest polluter, from the global accord agreed unanimously by almost 200 nations in 2015. The agreement to fight global warming is based on voluntary pledges to cut greenhouse emissions but Trump has argued this could damage the US economy. However, a huge range of US business leaders argue the opposite, saying the fast-growing green economy is an opportunity for the US.

Of all issues, is there any one more ill-suited to Trump’s reality TV production aesthetic, which prizes moments of grandiose revelation, than climate change? A generational issue that will be with us no matter what happens with this afternoon’s presidential curtain-drop. Jean Chemnick of E&amp;E News (Environment &amp; Energy publishing) says Myron Ebell, chairman of a group “focused on dispelling the myths of global warming,” will be in the crowd with Trump at the White House today: Assuming the US does, as expected, pull out of the historic Paris agreement on climate change, it will join a very small list of countries with which it has little else in common in terms of emissions. The only other UN members not signed up are Nicaragua and Syria, which both chose not to enter into the climate accord in the first place. Their reasons for doing so were very different from those that seem to be influencing Donald Trump, who has previously described climate change as a hoax. Nicaragua’ declined to sign up because it thought the accord did not go far enough. In November 2015, Paul Oquist, Nicaragua’s lead envoy to the Paris negotiations, told Climate Home: “We’re not going to submit because voluntary responsibility is a path to failure. We don’t want to be an accomplice to taking the world to 3 to 4 degrees and the death and destruction that represents.” Read further: Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of Donald Trump’s announcement of whether he will withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. The president is playing up his decision for maximum political theatrical effect, having teased it for a couple days now. The big reveal is scheduled for 3pm ET (8pm BST) in the White House rose garden. It must be said that Trump is expected to ditch the deal. Elected Republicans whom he needs to advance his domestic agenda want him to. His top political strategist reportedly wants him to. And a narrow majority of Republican voters favors erasing environmental regulations, according to Quinnipiac polling. What is the Paris agreement? It’s a climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015, which came into force on 4 November 2016. The agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2C (3.6F), seen as the threshold for safety by scientists, and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5C (2.7F). The carbon emission curbs put forward by countries under Paris are not legally binding but the framework of the accord, which includes a mechanism for periodically cranking those pledges up, is binding. The agreement also has a long-term goal for net zero emissions which would effectively phase out fossil fuels. What happens if the US withdraws? The Guardian’s Emma Graham-Harrison writes: The US is not bound to any targets by the Paris accord, and is already moving away from Barack Obama’s commitment to cut emissions. It will continue to do so regardless of whether it remains part of the global deal. There are fears that formal withdrawal could dent the soft-power impact of the agreement. But other major emitters including the European Union and China point out that the US would be as free to rejoin as it is to leave. The EU and China have vowed that their commitment to tackling climate change will not be affected by the US decision. While we wait for Trump, here’s a selection of our latest coverage of his decision: Thanks for reading and please join us in the comments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/04/climate-change-western-states-fail-to-fulfil-pledges-to-developing-countries","type":"article","sectionId":"working-in-development","sectionName":"Working in development","webPublicationDate":"2015-09-04T13:15:53Z","webTitle":"Climate change: western states fail to fulfil pledges to developing countries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/04/climate-change-western-states-fail-to-fulfil-pledges-to-developing-countries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/04/climate-change-western-states-fail-to-fulfil-pledges-to-developing-countries","fields":{"headline":"Climate change: western states fail to fulfil pledges to developing countries","bodyText":"The US and other countries need to pay up their $5.8bn of outstanding pledges to help developing countries to cope with climate change or risk derailing already fragile climate talks, the head of the UN’s Green Climate Fund has said. Dozens of NGOs, governments and development agencies were queuing up to put to work a total $10.2bn in promised finance, said GCF executive director Hela Cheikhrouhou. Already 20 organisations have passed through the fund’s accreditation process, meaning they will be able to pitch for funding for projects, such as transitions to solar energy or drought-resistant crops that would help the developing world adapt to climate change or reduce emissions. She said she expected the number of accredited organisations to hit 100 and for the first tranche of projects to be funded before the Paris climate talks in December. Cheikhrouhou said leaving 43% of pledges unfulfilled would damage developing countries’ trust that the rich world is serious about helping them adjust to the changing climate. “It certainly would erode the confidence because climate finance is one of the most difficult negotiation themes,” she said. “We need a stronger push from a high level.” The GCF is often considered the sole shining light from the dismal climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009. It was set up as the main mechanism to raise $100bn a year in climate finance from rich countries by 2020 to assist poor nations that contributed little to global emissions to move to greener economies and build resilience to the effects of climate change. The fund would not run the projects itself, but accredit NGOs, development banks and the governments of developing nations to receive the money. However governments have been reluctant to contribute money into the fund. During the lead-up to last year’s climate talks in Lima $10.2bn was eventually pledged, but even that is now proving difficult to secure. US president Barack Obama pledged $3bn, but it is unclear whether he will be able to pass the funding through a Republican congress France, Italy and Canada are also among the tardy. The governments of Sweden and the Marshall Islands and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) joined Cheikhrouhou in urging those countries to fulfil financial promises they made before the Lima climate talks in 2014. Sweden is currently the largest per capita donor to the fund at $60.50 per person – six times more for each citizen than the US has pledged. The Swedish minister for international development cooperation, Isabella Lövin, said: “I hope that the US will also live up to its commitments because the US and the entire world will be affected by climate change.” Marshall Islands foreign minister Tony de Brum said: “No issue is more central to trust in Paris than finance. Nobody should underestimate how critical it is for the most vulnerable to know that the $100bn a year by 2020 promised at the 11th hour in Copenhagen will be delivered. And right now, we have no understanding or assurance that even a fraction of that will be delivered. This is a big, gaping trust gap that needs to be filled before Paris.” “The fact that the United States – which originally put the $100bn target on the table – is yet to make its own initial contribution to the GCF is a cause for concern. We all know the difficulties President Obama faces, but hope the US will make good on its own $3bn promise as soon as the new fiscal year ticks over next month.” Cheikhrouhou described a “creeping sense of disappointment” because instead of building momentum for the GCF after a flurry of pledges in the lead-up to last year’s Lima talks, impetus appeared to be drifting away. “I’m disappointed that no more new contributors have come forward in 2015,” she said, adding that she felt the fund needed to reach $15bn by 2018 in order to remain on track for the 2020 target. “My worry is, when I see the text of the Paris Accord, and see that references to the future of the Green Climate Fund are dwindling and weakening over the months.” Fulfilling the pledges is also critical for the impetus for the climate talks in Paris, said Saleemul Huq, the director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development. “The UN talks on climate change have a history of financing pledges from developed countries which then are either not delivered or fudged. This seems to be happening again with the green climate fund pledges of $100bn a year from 2020 onwards, with current pledges only an insignificant fraction of that figure,” he said. A spokesman for the UNDP said it was important all countries converted their pledges as “vast amounts of capital” would eventually be needed to tackle climate change. However, the fund has achieved the 50% level of financing it needs to begin actively lending and Astrid Manroth, head of sustainable investment Europe at Deutsche Asset &amp; Wealth Management (another of the GCF’s accredited entities), said she thought the level of finance would increase once the fund began investing in projects. This is set to happen at the next board meeting of the fund in November. “If there’s no change to the current status it will of course impact speed and scale of implementation. On the other hand, for me the binding constraint is project development capacity and project preparation. We need to get that right, and then I am convinced that there will be sufficient financing,” she said. Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

The classrooms, which have no walls, are designed to help pupils feel more connected to their natural surroundings while studying a curriculum with an environmental twist. It has been hailed as the greenest school on Earth, but it is actually one of many adapting to the changing climate. Green school Bali is the brainchild of John and Cynthia Hardy, who moved from North America to the Indonesian paradise in the 1970s. They sold their successful jewellery business in 2007 and used the profits to start a school that would pioneer sustainability in education. The couple had the idea after searching for a school for their children but being put off by the unimaginatively designed spaces and curriculums on offer. Since first opening its doors in 2008 with just 98 students, the school has expanded to house more than 400 young people. Although it has been criticised for its high fees and lack of Indonesian students, the school has received international praise for its innovative approach to education. Last year, United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon called it the “most unique and impressive” school he’d ever visited. The curriculum is taught with an emphasis on project-based learning and includes traditional subjects such as maths, English and science, as well as mud-wrestling, surfing and graffiti. It sounds chaotic, but that’s the point: John Hardy wants the curriculum to be as fluid as possible. He explains that the open design of the classrooms means there are more distractions for students from the outside environment – a tropical downpour or a lizard crawling across the floor, for example – but teachers are encouraged to integrate these into lessons to make learning more exciting and engaging. “Everywhere in the world kids are learning how to be green but in completely unsustainable environments,” Hardy says. “Green school kids are learning about the same things, but they are living it instead. “The teacher’s job is to create experiences to make the world a better place for the kids. Children with causes are more engaged citizens of the planet.” He adds: “They are not in an air-conditioned climate, the school is off the grid [powered by solar energy], there is a vegetable plot next to the classroom and the animals eat the scraps from lunch. So it’s a learning-by-living concept rather than an intellectual chalk-and-talk.” Using sustainable design to enhance learning is a concept shared by German architect Anna Heringer, who was asked to design the METI Handmade school in Bangladesh in 2004. Working with her colleague Eike Roswag, she eschewed concrete, bricks and steel for traditional techniques using bamboo, mud and straw. Mud walls are perfectly suited to the climate, naturally absorbing humidity, as well as keeping the classroom cool in the summer and warm in the winter without using electricity. Importantly, the children also helped to build the school: not just to decorate it, but to undertake the real work of cutting straw, mixing the mud and making ropes to bind the bamboo frames. Heringer says: “Apart from using tools, water buffalos and cows, all the rest was man-power and that is pretty impressive when you start with a pile of dirt and bamboo sticks. In the end you know that you built it with your own hands. It was an incredible experience for the children and gave them so much confidence.” The hands-on role the students played in constructing their own classrooms has deepened their connection with the natural world and taught them the importance of building sustainably. She hopes students will take that into adulthood and lead more people to choose these traditional, renewable materials in the future. “When you are in the classroom you feel really embraced by the earth walls. It’s a wonderful environment to learn in,” Heringer adds. “It’s amazing how many people want to touch the building. Humankind grew up using this element, earth, and now we hardly have contact with it. It is something that we have a very old relationship with and something that children also connect with. It opens up your senses and that is important for learning.” Students at a primary school in the Scottish Highlands are also reducing their classroom’s carbon footprint. But rather than getting their hands dirty in construction, they are using their own body heat. That’s because Acharacle primary school in Ardnamurchan, Lochaber, is heated by warmth from the children, staff and computers. And the school’s green credentials don’t stop there. The building is made from natural materials including timber, the furniture is specially sourced so it is free from toxic substances such as glue, and the paint is fruit-based. A wind turbine on a nearby hill generates electricity to heat water, and rainwater is collected for flushing the toilets. The message of sustainability is reinforced in the classrooms, where monitors display the temperature and humidity, as well as levels of daylight and carbon dioxide. The lights switch off if there is enough natural daylight, the windows open automatically if it is too warm or if there is too much CO2 in the air, and the blinds come down when it is warm to prevent overheating. Headteacher Lyndsay Bradley says these features make students very aware of why they are trying to be more green. She explains: “The classroom’s sustainable design is helping us teach them to be very aware of conserving energy and cutting pollution – all the things we want them to take on board and carry with them into their adult lives.” From 3D printing to augmented reality, much is made of how emerging technologies are revolutionising teaching and learning. But as the world finally wakes up to the reality of climate change, more and more schools are using their space to raise awareness of sustainability and reduce education’s impact on the environment. Through clever design, teachers are not only setting the next generation on the path to a brighter future, but a greener one as well. The schools of the future series is funded by Zurich Municipal.

Named one of 10 inspirational Bangladeshis last year, Rakshand was born to a wealthy family. But he turned his back on money and for the past eight years has been running an NGO in one of Dhaka’s biggest slums. He talks freely about the moment that changed everything for him. While travelling around the country at the age of 21, Rakshand met a group of children who were collecting bottles to sell and ended up spending the day with them. “In the evening when it was time to go home one of the kids – a six-year-old girl – took my hand and said ‘Sir, thank you so much for the day, but I don’t have a home to go to, will you take me with you?’” Rakshand recalls. “I felt helpless, I didn’t know what to say to her. I had to leave her that day, but I resolved that I must turn my guilt into something positive.” He decided his focus should be on children. Half of Bangladesh’s population is under 25, so the country’s future depends on them rising out of poverty. When lots of call centres started opening up in Bangladesh, Rakshand realised that speaking English gave employment opportunities. “I thought that if I teach children English they might get a job in the future – either locally or internationally. That was the vision.” It wasn’t straightforward. At first he received a suspicious reaction in many of Dhaka’s slums. Although he is Muslim, he has an unusual Bangladeshi name and some of the inhabitants thought he was a Christian missionary. In the end, a domestic assistant who worked for his mother recognised him and agreed to send her children to learn English. From her endorsement he got a class of 17 children. He rented a room in Rayer Bazaar, one of the main slums in Dhaka, and hung up the letters of the alphabet on a piece of string. That’s how his NGO, Jaago Foundation, started. Rakshand’s parents weren’t happy with his choice of career. They had sent him to one of Bangladesh’s most expensive schools and expected him to get “a good job”. They gave him an ultimatum – he could either work for their business or “pick his madness”. He chose the latter and moved out of their comfortable airconditioned home to live in the school, and was dependent on the slum dwellers generosity for food. Living alongside the poorest people in Bangladesh and becoming part of their community taught him a lot. When Rakshand realised that a lot of children in his class dropped out because their parents lost their jobs, he decided to help them find employment. He bought two sewing machines and offered the mothers discounted sewing classes. No one was interested. Then he offered free classes – still no one was interested. Finally he offered them 500 taka (£4.12) to learn to use the sewing machines and the women turned up. “It showed how we have a different mindset,” he says. “That was a new learning for me.” The dresses the women make are now supplying an Australian social enterprise, Bachhara. Despite success setting up a school in the capital, Rakshand knew that the places in Bangladesh with the least opportunities for children were rural areas. “There is no quality education outside Dhaka,” he says. When he visited remote schools he saw that quality teaching was unavailable and got an idea – primary education via Skype. Jaago now has 10 successful online schools. “Everyone said the kids will lose concentration,” says Rakshand. “But they think the teacher is on television.” Classroom assistants and frequent video clips help keep the children focused. An unintended advantage of the system is that the assistants – local teachers – get free training. “They repeat what the main teacher is saying,” says Rakshand. “Automatically, you might not need the online school after two years.” Jaago works with big communication companies to ensure the rural schools have reliable connectivity and Rakshand is now talking about scaling up. The government’s Digital Bangladesh mandate synchronises well with the model. As well as connectivity, Jaago is catalysing the use of renewable energy in the rural communities. The online schools have unreliable electricity through generators. “If we can convert the schools to solar energy it will give them an uninterrupted connection,” Rakshand says. The electricity can also be sold at a low price to the rest of the village. He is currently pitching for funding to install solar panels at the schools. Jaago is eight years old now. Rakshand has come a long way from sleeping at the school in the slum and being fed by the children’s parents. His proudest moment was when one of his students, 15-year-old Shuborno, was on a Unicef conference panel with the UN regional secretary. “That was when I really felt that I’d done something,” he says. “For one person at least.” Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

Extremely poor people cannot lift themselves out of poverty without access to reliable energy. More than a billion people live without power today, denying them opportunities as wide-ranging as running a business, providing light for their children to study, or even cooking meals with ease. Ending poverty requires confronting climate change, which affects every nation and every person. The populations least able to adapt – those that are the most poor and vulnerable – will be hardest hit, rolling back decades of development work. How do we achieve the dual goals of expanding energy production for those without power and drastically reducing emissions from sources such as coal that produce carbon dioxide, the primary contributor to climate change? There is no single answer and we cannot ask poor communities to forego access to energy because the developed world has already put so much carbon pollution in the air. An array of policies and programs backed with new technology and new thinking can — if combined with political will and financial support — help poor populations get the energy they need while accelerating a worldwide transition to zero net carbon emissions. An end to fossil fuel subsidies The World Bank Group’s focus is on five key areas: building low-carbon, climate resilient cities; moving forward on climate-smart agriculture; speeding up energy efficiency and investment in renewable energy, including hydropower; supporting work on ending fossil fuel subsidies; and developing carbon pricing to increase the cost of emissions. Such an approach depends on decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions. We have to keep economies growing to bring shared prosperity for all, but we also have to bring down greenhouse gas emissions. We are seeing change: countries are shifting from fossil fuels to renewable forms of energy with massive new investments in well-known types of renewables, like hydropower, geothermal, solar and wind. Between 2010 and 2012, the uptake of modern renewable energies grew by 4% globally. East Asia led the charge, representing 42% of new renewable energy generation. In countries like Bangladesh and Mongolia small scale solar power is dramatically changing the lives of poor people, lighting up their homes with low-cost solar systems. As part of the government’s sustainable development strategy, more than 3.5m solar homes systems have been installed in rural Bangladesh, creating 70,000 direct jobs. Morocco is setting an example for the African continent. It has a renewable energy target of 42% of total electrical capacity by 2020, has recently established an agency dedicated to solar energy and is working to develop a “super grid” that integrates solar power, wind power, hydropower and biomass. Renewable energy investment in Morocco grew from $297m in 2012 to $1.8bn in 2013, due in part to reduced fossil fuel energy subsidies. From an investment perspective, a global focus on low-carbon or carbon-free energy production also means that continuing to pollute will cost more. We’re running out of room for how much carbon we can emit into our atmosphere, so every ton emitted is becoming more expensive. There are now about 40 countries and more than 20 cities, states and provinces using or planning to use a price on carbon to bring down greenhouse gas emissions. Altogether, these initiatives are valued at almost $50bn. Increasingly, we are hearing the voices of business calling for a price on carbon and investing in clean energy sources. Green bonds are also on the rise. A new report shows the World Bank (IBRD) has issued 100 green bonds in 18 currencies, raising the equivalent of $8.4bn. The investments are targeting low carbon and climate resilient growth in countries. Two energy efficiency projects in China, supported by green bonds, are estimated to reduce 12.6m tons of carbon dioxide annually – equivalent to taking 2.7m cars off the road each year. Our private sector arm, IFC, has to date, issued a total of $3.9bn in green bonds. The Bank and IFC helped pioneer the green bond market, with the global green bond market now worth about $38bn. And as we head towards December’s climate change conference in Paris, we’re seeing clear signs that in the halls of government, debate has shifted from the offices of ministers of the environment warning about climate change to the offices of ministers of finance assessing the likely price tag of dealing with and adapting to climate change. We know the cost of inaction is much greater. We already face the certainty of rising oceans, shifting weather patterns and resulting human migrations, all with a toll of trillions of dollars and potentially hundreds of thousands of lives. Increasing extreme weather events – drought, storms and wildfires – are already exacting a heavy cost. Pollution takes a toll on people’s health as well as straining public purses. Developed and fast-developing governments need to make their economies and energy systems more efficient and wean themselves off the practices of the past. At the same time, we need to extend access to energy to the world’s poorer populations and do so as cleanly as possible. For the developing world, this moment represents an opportunity. The challenge is to build economies that are competitive without carbon. Let’s keep our eyes on the prize."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2015/aug/03/obamas-clean-power-plan-will-hit-shale-gas-industrys-share-of-energy-generation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-03T17:10:39Z","webTitle":"Obama's clean power plan will hit shale gas share of electricity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/03/obamas-clean-power-plan-will-hit-shale-gas-industrys-share-of-energy-generation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/aug/03/obamas-clean-power-plan-will-hit-shale-gas-industrys-share-of-energy-generation","fields":{"headline":"Obama's clean power plan will hit shale gas share of electricity","bodyText":"The final version of the clean power plan has thrown the Obama administration into conflict with shale gas, America’s 21st-century energy darling. Coal, the most polluting source of electricity, has already entered a long twilight. Around a fifth of all US coal-fired plants are expected to shut between 2012 and 2020 and some analysts believe the hamstrung sector to be in ‘structural decline’. Should the clean power plan survive an anticipated blitzkrieg of legal and state government challenges, it will hasten this demise. The competition to replace coal plants as they shut down is fierce. Billions of dollars worth of generating income is at stake. And at the moment, lightly-regulated gas fracked cheaply from the US’s vast shale fields is inexorably filling the vacuum. For a brief moment in April and for the first time in history, gas deposed coal as the largest source of electricity in the country. Under the clean power plan as proposed by Obama in June last year, gas would have permanently overtaken coal as the largest energy source by 2020. But over the weekend, the administration announced changes designed specifically to give wind and solar a fighting chance. These include a programme of “strong incentives” in the form of pollution credits for states that improve energy efficiency in poor communities or build lots of renewable energy before the targets come into force in 2022. These credits can be used to offset pollution emitted later. . A fact sheet released by the US government on Sunday said the new provisions would “drive more aggressive investment in clean energy technologies than the [original] proposed rule, resulting in 30% more renewable energy generation in 2030.” Experts said that this may force gas to cede a little of the floor in the jostling to dance on the grave of the coal industry. “This looks like a whole new thing,” said Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s Americas chief, Ethan Zindler. “They’ve suggested that they want more renewables shorter term. That has the potential to take a bite out of gas.” This was important, said Zindler, because a mini-crash in new renewable energy is expected in the coming years as government tax credits expire, with little hope of renewal through the Republican-dominated Congress. “If this does provide a short-run boost for renewables in 2017, 18 and 19, that’s very good news for the industry because right now they are not looking like great years for the sector.” However he cautioned that the details of the renewables plan had not yet been released. Overall, the new plan also pushes for a slightly increased target of 32% reduction on 2005 emissions levels by 2030. This is up from 30% in the original plan. “The tighter target means states would have to do more than originally estimated in the draft rule,” said John Reilly, an energy economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Thus, it does make gas somewhat less attractive... this would seem to give a boost to renewables, but the reduction might be met with nuclear or efficiency.” The gas industry reacted furiously on Monday. “An accelerating move to natural gas is critical to keeping the lights on,” said Marty Durbin, president and CEO of America’s Natural Gas Alliance. “With the reported shift in the plan, we believe the White House is perpetuating the false choice between renewables and natural gas. We don’t have to slow the trend toward gas in order to effectively and economically use renewables.” Rick Umoff, an adviser at the Solar Energy Industries Association, said it expected the rule to drive investment towards solar: “We believe states will use a more flexible timeline under the clean power plan to invest in solar early so they can take advantage of the booming solar economy, in addition to the compliance incentives that the EPA is planning to offer – ultimately benefiting both ratepayers and the environment.” “The clean energy incentive programme holds promise as a way to encourage states to move forward well before 2022,” said Tom Kiernan, CEO of the American Wind Energy Association. In an indication of exactly where the coal industry still sees its biggest enemy, World Coal Association chief executive Benjamin Sporton took aim at natural gas. “Unabated gas is not a solution to tackling climate change; gas also needs carbon capture and storage to achieve significant CO2 reductions,” he said. Burning gas emits less CO2 than coal, although it is still a significant source of carbon. Concerns have also been raised over the carbon savings that gas can offer. Methane, a much more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2, is released in unknown quantities during the extraction process. This negates at least some of the carbon savings made from shale gas. While Zindler thought the new changes would boost renewables, he said the long term positive trends for gas meant that it would probably continue to grow. An Energy Information Administration (EIA) analyst said she had not had time to evaluate the effect that the changes could have on the existing projections. But the changes to the plan indicate Obama’s intention to force as many fossil fuels out of the electricity system as early as possible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2015/may/21/spacecraft-sailing-on-sunbeams-begins-test-flight","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-20T23:53:27Z","webTitle":"Spacecraft sailing on sunbeams begins test flight","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/21/spacecraft-sailing-on-sunbeams-begins-test-flight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2015/may/21/spacecraft-sailing-on-sunbeams-begins-test-flight","fields":{"headline":"Spacecraft sailing on sunbeams begins test flight","bodyText":"A tiny spacecraft designed to sail on sunbeams has been launched in a test flight that could transform long-distance space exploration. The probe, called LightSail, is equipped with a huge silver sail that will unfurl in the coming weeks and use the momentum of sunlight to propel it smoothly through space. The craft was developed by the US Planetary Society in a crowd-funded project and piggy-backed on the launch of an Atlas 5 rocket. “LightSail is technically wonderful, but it’s also wonderfully romantic,” said Bill Nye, the non-profit organisation’s CEO. “We’ll sail on sunbeams. But wait, there’s more: This unique, remarkable spacecraft is funded entirely by private citizens, people who think spaceflight is cool.” Unlike conventional solar energy, where incoming light is converted into electricity, solar sailing relies on energy transferred from sunlight bouncing off the sail’s reflective surface. Each individual photon imparts a minuscule force, but at 32m across – one third of the length of a football pitch – the ultra-lightweight sail captures enough light to propel the tiny craft forwards without the need for any other fuel. “Over the next days, we will be monitoring our CubeSat as we prepare for the big show: the day LightSail deploys its super shiny Mylar sails for flight on sunlight. Stay tuned, the best is about to happen,” said Nye following the launch. The idea of solar sailing may only just have become a reality for space missions, but has been a staple of science fiction for decades. Count Dooku used an solar sailing ship as an escape vehicle in the Star Wars saga and it featured in Arthur C Clarke’s short story, Sunjammer. The LightSail mission is the first to test the feasibility of solar sailing for a small spacecraft, known as a CubeSat, which is around the size of a loaf of bread. Packed inside the body of the craft is the sail, which is about 4.5 microns thick, similar to spider silk, and communication equipment and cameras that will track the mission’s progress and beam data back to Earth. The ability to power small spacecraft with solar sails could pave the way for a new era of cheap long-distance space missions, led by universities, companies or even individuals. The cost for the entire LightSail project is about $5.5m (£3.5m), about one fifth of which it still needs to raise from from donors. By comparison, traditional space missions typically cost hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. The current mission is taking place in a low orbit and is designed primarily to test whether the solar sail can be deployed successfully. After a few days of sailing, the craft is likely to start burning up as it re-enters the Earth’s atmosphere. “The nominal plan is to deploy the sail 28 days from now,” said Bruce Betts, director of science at the Planetary Society. A more ambitious mission, in which a second LightSail is launched into a higher orbit, is planned for next year if the current one is successful. In the future, Nye and others hope to pursue long distance solar sailing. Since the solar wind is also continuous, over time it should be possible to reach extremely high speeds. Scientists estimate that the twin Voyager spacecraft, which have just reached the edges of the solar system 30 years after launch, would have got there in less than half that time had they been propelled by solar sails. The only successful solar sailing mission to date is Ikaros, the Japanese spacecraft that launched in 2010, and travelled to Venus. A previous planned Nasa mission, Sunjammer, was abandoned last year, while another Nasa mission NanoSail-D was lost in a launch failure in 2010."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2015/aug/03/obamas-clean-power-plan-hailed-as-strongest-ever-climate-action-by-a-us-president","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-03T10:55:33Z","webTitle":"Obama's clean power plan hailed as US's strongest ever climate action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/03/obamas-clean-power-plan-hailed-as-strongest-ever-climate-action-by-a-us-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2015/aug/03/obamas-clean-power-plan-hailed-as-strongest-ever-climate-action-by-a-us-president","fields":{"headline":"Obama's clean power plan hailed as US's strongest ever climate action","bodyText":"Hundreds of businesses including eBay, Nestlé and General Mills have issued their support for Barack Obama’s clean power plan, billed as the strongest action ever on climate change by a US president. The rules, announced on Monday, are designed to cut emissions from power plants and have been strengthened in terms of the long-term ambition as originally proposed by the president last year, but slightly weakened in the short-term in a concession to states reliant on highly-polluting coal. White House adviser Brian Deese said the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules represented the “biggest step that any single president has made to curb the carbon pollution that is fuelling climate change”. The US is the world’s second biggest carbon emitter after China. The rules are expected to trigger a “tsunami” of legal opposition from states and utilities who oppose the plans, which will significantly boost wind and solar power generation and force a switch away from coal power. Republican presidential hopefuls moved quickly to voice their opposition, saying they would be economically damaging. But 365 businesses and investors wrote to 29 state governors to strongly support the rules, which they said would benefit the economy and create jobs. Mindy Lubber, who is attending the launch ceremony of the rules on Monday and is the president of Ceres, a network of investors that organised the letter, said: “The clean power plan is the right measure at the right time. It’s a flexible, practical and economically sound blueprint to transition America toward a low-carbon future.” Other signatories included Unilever, L’Oréal, Levi Strauss, Staples, renewable energy company SunEdison and Trillium Asset Management, which manages $2.2bn in assets. It is the largest group of businesses to support the rules so far. The final rules propose a 32% cut in carbon emissions from power plants by 2030 on 2005 levels, up from the initial proposal of 30%. However states will only have to comply by 2022 rather than 2020 as originally proposed, and will be able submit their plans on meeting the targets by 2018 instead of 2017. CO2 emissions from power plants fell 15% between 2005 and 2013, meaning the country is halfway to the target. Monday’s version of the rules also gives an explicit boost to wind and solar power, angering the natural gas industry which will still be a large beneficiary of the switch from coal to gas-fired power plants, which produce much lower emissions. America’s Natural Gas Alliance, a trade body, said it was “disappointed and discouraged” by the rules. The World Coal Association claimed the plan “will significantly increase the cost of electricity to American consumers.” The Solar Energy Industries Association, on the other hand, said the rules were “historic” and “critically needed”. The new rules will give a “give a head start to wind and solar deployment”, according to a White House fact sheet. “Drive more aggressive investment in clean energy technologies than the proposed rule, resulting in 30% more renewable energy generation in 2030 and continuing to lower the costs of renewable energy,” it said. Barack Obama, in a video address, emphasised the health benefits of reduced air pollution from coal plants, and a duty to future generations as reasons for the clean power rules. “Power plants are the single biggest source of the harmful carbon pollution that contributes to climate change. But until now there have been no federal limits on the amount of that pollution those plants can dump into the air. Think about that,” he said. Obama’s plan to bring in the rules to cut emissions from power plants – which account for a third of the US’s greenhouse gas emissions – date back to 2009 when the EPA declared carbon emissions a public danger, the first step towards regulating them. The final rules are likely to be welcomed by the United Nations, which is hosting a climate summit in Paris at the end of the year to agree on a deal on post-2020 curbs on emissions, as well as financing to help poorer countries manage global warming. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, issued a statement welcoming the regulations. Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the Washington DC-based thinktank the World Resources Institute, said: “The clean power plan should reassure international partners that the US administration is determined to deliver the 26-28% emissions reductions promised for 2025. “Our analysis suggests that this rule can be implemented without technical or financial impediment, and in a manner that is likely to promote more, not less, economic prosperity.” Describing the rules as very important, Lord Stern, the author of an influential review of the economics of climate change, said: “It shows the determination of the world’s richest country to maintain better economic growth while also cutting greenhouse gas pollution. President Obama has recognised in particular the enormous damage caused by pollution from the burning of coal in power stations.” Gina McCarthy, the EPA’s administrator, said she believed the agency was on strong legal grounds for defending the rules from the legal challenges they are almost certain to face. “Over the next few days we will hear the same tired old plays from the old special interests playbook,” said McCarthy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/economics-blog/2015/jun/05/solar-power-africa-sun-electricity-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-05T11:38:16Z","webTitle":"Solar power to the people: how the sun can ease Africa's electricity crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/jun/05/solar-power-africa-sun-electricity-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/economics-blog/2015/jun/05/solar-power-africa-sun-electricity-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Solar power to the people: how the sun can ease Africa's electricity crisis","bodyText":"“We shall make electric light so cheap that only the wealthy can afford to burn candles,” said Thomas Edison, inventor of the modern lightbulb. That was almost a century and a half ago. Today in Africa, 621 million people – two-thirds of the population – live without electricity. And the numbers are rising. A kettle boiled twice a day in the UK uses five times as much electricity as someone in Mali uses in a year. Nigeria is one of the world’s biggest oil exporters but 93 million residents depend on firewood and charcoal for heat and light. On current trends, there is no chance Africa will hit the global target of energy for all by 2030. Unlike droughts, health epidemics and illiteracy, Africa’s energy crisis seldom makes the headlines. Yet the social, economic and human costs are devastating. Inadequate and unreliable electricity undermines investment. Power shortages cut economic growth by 2-4% annually. The toxic fumes released by burning firewood and dung kill 600,000 people a year – half of them children. Health clinics are unable to refrigerate life-saving vaccines and children are denied the light they need to study. Politics is at the heart of Africa’s energy crisis. The continent’s power utilities are notoriously inefficient. This is partly down to mispricing and underinvestment. But it’s also because utilities are vehicles for political patronage and, in some cases, institutionalised theft. Some $120m went missing from the Tanzanian state power utility last year through a complex web of offshore companies. The sheer scale of Africa’s energy deficit often fuels a sense of fatalism and paralysis. Yet on the flipside of this crisis are enormous opportunities. Sub-Saharan Africa has some of the world’s most abundant and least exploited renewable energy sources, especially solar power. With the price of solar panels plunging, there are opportunities for firms and governments to connect millions of poor households to affordable small-scale, off-grid systems. This would help the poorest most. The latest Africa Progress Panel report, published this week, estimates that 138 million households living on less than $2.50 a day spend $10bn annually on energy-related products, including charcoal, candles and kerosene. Measured on a per-unit cost basis, these poor households pay 60-80 times more for energy than people living in London or Manhattan. Off-grid solar power could slash these costs, releasing resources for productive investment, health and education, driving down poverty and raising life expectancy. If you think this is a pipedream, think again. Bangladesh has installed more than 3.5m off-grid solar power systems, and the figure is set to double over the next few years. The key to success? Financial and technical support from government, allied to new business models. In Africa, a vibrant off-grid solar industry is poised for takeoff. The only thing missing in most countries is government action to support, encourage and enable this investment. Supporting the development of large-scale renewable energy is not just the right thing to do for Africa. It is also the smart thing to do on climate change. One of the symptoms of Africa’s energy poverty is the destruction of forests to produce charcoal for rising urban populations: fewer trees means the loss of vital carbon sinks. Small-scale solar energy can provide millions of people with a first step on the energy ladder. But it cannot in the medium term fill the energy void left by large-scale utilities. African governments must aim for an annual growth rate in power generation of 10% a year for the next two decades – about five times current levels. Countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya and Rwanda have demonstrated this is possible. Both have simultaneously increased public investment while attracting large-scale foreign investment. Aid donors can help by providing bridging loans and helping to reduce risk. Throughout history electricity has fuelled the growth that has created jobs, cut poverty, and improved the quality of life. Now, almost 150 years after Edison developed the lightbulb, it is time to spark an African energy revolution. We lack neither the finance nor the technologies to do so: all that’s needed is the vital connection of international cooperation and political will.

The method, developed by scientists in Paris (pdf), could be much less invasive and damaging than surgical stitches or staples and involves placing drops of nanoparticle solution in a deep cut and pressing the two wound surfaces together for less than a minute. The nanoparticles spread out and form millions of tiny bridges between the wound surfaces, binding them together. In contrast to existing medical adhesives, the nanoparticles do not form an extra, unwanted layer in the wound and the method works well even in the presence of fluids such as blood. The scientists have repaired injuries in animals with solutions containing silica nanoparticles as well as iron oxide nanoparticles, which, as a bonus, could provide useful contrast for medical imaging. A shrimp's eye view Insects see very differently from us, with multifaceted eyes that receive light via thousands of individual lenses. This gives them the advantage of a very wide field of view and fast motion detection. For several decades, scientists have attempted to build compact imaging devices, or artificial eyes, that imitate the insects' compound eye design, for example to use in robotic vision. Scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Illinois have now made an artificial eye inspired by crustaceans such as crabs and shrimps. Like insects, they have compound eyes with thousands of individual light-receiving units. However, light is not collected with lenses but via multiple reflections inside microtubes. The scientists fabricated a closely packed array of square silicon microtubes in a half-spherical shape and showed they can make simple images with a wide field of view close to 180 degrees, without distortions. A specific advantage of the reflective mechanism is that it avoids colour distortions and has high sensitivity to light. Possible applications could be in infrared imaging for medical or astronomical studies. Patching up Personal healthcare could be revolutionised by the next generation of lightweight, electronic monitors, which can be worn against the skin without any discomfort. Scientists in South Korea and the US have developed a prototype smart skin patch, as thin and flexible as a common plaster, that can detect movement disorders such as tremors caused by Parkinson's disease. In addition, it can store any data it captures in memory cells and even control the release of drugs delivered through the skin. The sensors are spring-like silicon filaments that change electrical resistance when bent and stretched. These strain measurements, which indicate different types of movements, are stored as binary information in the oxide memory elements that have stable low (\"0\") and high (\"1\") resistance states. To make the patch, nanomembranes – thin films of high-quality crystalline material – are used to fabricate the motion sensors and memory elements, which are then printed on a soft, stretchable material. On the sticky side that rests against the skin, the patch contains silica nanoparticles loaded with drugs. The drugs can be released on demand by heating elements on the top side of the patch. The smart patch is a prototype, but demonstrates that in future several useful functions could be combined in wearable medical devices. Time to switch Radio frequency tags have found widespread uses, such as in chips for runners to accurately determine their race time or to track valuable books. Further improvement in the performance of high-speed electronic circuits that can be integrated in flexible and wearable materials could open up many more useful applications, such as in mobile wi-fi devices and long-distance radio-frequency identification. Germanium, a close cousin of silicon, conducts charges faster and can be controlled with lower voltages, so could be promising for radio-frequency applications. Researchers in China and the US have made electronic circuits from germanium nanomembranes on plastic substrates and have demonstrated that their radio-frequency switches perform better than existing flexible devices made from silicon. A possible application for flexible radio frequency devices is to enable wireless control of smart healthcare devices such as the skin patch described in the previous item. Nanotube fuel Molecules that can switch between two stable configurations when they absorb light, and release the energy when they switch back, could be used as solar thermal fuel. A well-known disadvantage of solar power is that the sun isn't always shining, so a reliable way to store energy for later use is essential. This could be done with light-switching molecules, but the challenge is how to do so efficiently. Scientists at MIT have found a way to pack a large number of light-switching molecules into a small space by attaching them to carbon nanotubes – rolled up sheets of carbon. The nanotubes fit very closely together, with the light-switching molecules sticking out from the nanotube walls and neatly locking in place like teeth in a zip. The new material is robust and can store and release energy over many cycles. In theory, a kilogram of the material could pack 0.2 kilowatt-hours of energy – roughly enough to boil a kettle of water. • This article was amended on 1 May 2014. The original stated that a kilogram of the nanotube solar fuel could store 2 kilowatt-hours of energy.

The lack of capacity is at the 14 private sector distribution network operators (DNOs) which carry electricity from the main grid to commercial and domestic users. Western Power Distribution, the DNO for the Midlands, south-west England and Wales, has closed the grid to new large renewable projects in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Dorset for up to six years. Large parts of eastern and south-east England barely have any capacity, maps from UK Power Networks, the DNO for these regions, show. Under EU targets, the UK must produce 15% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. It is about halfway there because the target includes transport and heating, as well as electricity generation. The Office for National Statistics said in February that Britain was on track to meet its commitments but to hit the overall 2020 targets, it needs to more than double the amount of electricity from renewable sources to 30%. Leonie Greene, the head of external affairs at the STA, said the grid had lacked investment for many years because of a lack of action by the government and Ofgem, the energy regulator. She said: “The grid is now sclerotic in places and there are even modest solar roofs that cannot get grid connections. We are trying to get the DNOs to operate on a more active business model but the amount of solar that is projected for 2023 is less than we have today. “We are missing basic information because we don’t have an assessment of how much actual capacity is left and what is needed to meet the 2020 targets. The new secretary of state has no time to waste to get the grid on track if we want a low-carbon electricity system.” Ashley Seager, a director at solar energy firm Sun4net, said the lack of capacity was exacerbated by prohibitively high connection charges for businesses wanting to produce their own energy. He said that only two out of about 75 projects his company had looked at in recent months proved feasible. He said: “For about 80% of those projects, grid connection was too expensive to make them viable.” Western Power Distribution said connection charges were agreed nationally with Ofgem and payment was needed upfront before it could upgrade the network. It said: “These require the connecting party to pay for the assets installed to directly connect them, and to contribute towards the cost of network reinforcement. While there are circumstances where Western Power Distribution can reinforce the network ahead of need, these require demonstration to Ofgem that the benefits outweigh the costs to the wider network user.” Ofgem said: “There has been huge growth in small-scale generation in Great Britain. Over the past year, installations have increased by 40%. In some areas this has put pressure on network capacity. This is why we have allowed major increases in investment and encouraged network companies to take creative approaches to connecting generators without costly network upgrades. “We are consulting on whether further strategic investment is needed to help generators connect. In addition we are reviewing the issue of network constraints more generally to see if further action is needed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/2015/may/10/the-big-issue-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2015-05-09T23:03:06Z","webTitle":"Climate change: we must look to international agencies to save the world | the big issue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2015/may/10/the-big-issue-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2015/may/10/the-big-issue-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"Climate change: we must look to international agencies to save the world","bodyText":"In the Observer Tech Monthly climate change special, people were asked: “Which of the following should take the most responsibility for tackling global warming?” Surely, both the 45% who answered “governments” and the 13% who answered “households/individuals” are simply wrong. Only international agencies, including the UN, EU, G7, G20, IMF and the World Bank can take action at appropriate levels. We, including governments, should try to ensure that these institutions use power in the interests of the many and the environment, not the few, rich, individuals and corporations. Many households and individuals already try to reduce personal carbon footprints, and this will continue. Worldwide, though, those who can’t afford to run a car, cook food or heat their homes adequately contribute more to reducing humanity’s collective footprint. Through the renewables levy in electricity bills, even those in fuel poverty contribute to the profits of multinational energy companies, whether or not those produce clean energy. A recession helps lower emissions, yet governments still seek and applaud growth, however achieved. Governments cannot also act together to take the truly radical steps needed. Jan Dubé Peebles I was amazed to see that we have an influential paper noticeably missing out any reference to population in the climate change equation. Our growing population drives consumerism. Meanwhile, the population of the world continues to creep up. In the UK, an estimated 1,000 births daily; worldwide, an estimated 10,000 births an hour. World population is projected to be eight billion by 2025, and that is a conservative estimate. Family planning is the most cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions. £4 spent on contraception equals 1 tonne of carbon saved, as opposed to £35 spent on solar energy, for example. We can practice all the accepted methods to reduce carbon emissions, but a growing population will counteract all our efforts. Our world population is responsible for increasing environmental degradation and is hastening CO2 emissions, the results of which will lead to runaway climate change, increasing poverty and famine. Sheena Howarth Worcester I am really puzzled as to how you can run a major feature on climate change without a single reference to population growth. Agriculture is one of the biggest users of fossil fuel, and the necessity of feeding an ever-growing population means greater dependency on oil: it also means that more and more forests will be cleared, since we are already using practically all of the easily cultivable ground on the planet. The erosion of topsoil, rising sea levels, drought and more extreme weather all show how population levels and climate impinge on one another. Are we afraid to discuss this? I’m more afraid of the consequences of not discussing it. Paul Ehrlich quotes one demographer as saying: “We will never reach a population of 10 billion: either because we do something about it, or because we don’t.” Roger Plenty Stroud, Gloucs The nuclear industry must be patting itself on its radioactive back in response to your Tech Monthly chart, purporting to show that 91% of us would “prefer” to use energy “from less carbon-intensive sources (eg wind, hydroelectric, solar, nuclear)”. These four energy sources, bracketed together by your innocuous-looking parentheses, are presented as environmentally equivalent. How quickly have we forgotten Sellafield, Chernobyl, Fukushima? The undeniably urgent imperative to reduce carbon emissions should not blind us to the ever-present potential for catastrophe from nuclear power plant malfunctions. Your chart takes for granted what needs to be questioned and debated: namely, can we “solve” the carbon crisis at the cost of 24,000 years of pollution (the half-life of plutonium 239)?

On the one hand, London’s Greens now claim a surging membership of around 12,000 and will have gathered valuable experience from fighting the recent general election campaign. On the other, anything less than emulating the feat of Jenny Jones in 2012 by finishing third, just ahead of the Liberal Democrats, would surely be a disappointment. The Greens took 5% of the London vote in last month’s national poll compared with 8% for the Lib Dems and Ukip alike. Given the distinctive character of London mayoral elections, this need not be a bad omen but it underlines the importance of having a persuasive candidate. There are five contenders so far. Jonathan Bartley from Lambeth is a former Commons researcher who writes of confronting David Cameron about his plans for disabled children and being “dragged off the steps of St Pauls” in solidarity with the Occupy movement. He was part of the 2012 Jenny Jones team and is a semi-professional musician, playing the drums. His website is here and you can follow him on Twitter. Sian Berry, a Camden councillor, was the Green mayoral candidate in 2008, finishing fourth. Her youth and energetic monstering of gas-guzzler cars spoke to the Green demographic and gut Green concerns. This time around she has the priceless endorsement of the Greens’s sole MP Caroline Lucas and is promising a “big, creative, exciting campaign for London,” tapping into grassroots activism. Website here, Twitter here. Tom Chance, the Lewisham-based co-coordinator of his party’s general election effort and the London Assembly Green group’s researcher, says his party “can give London hope” with policies that are “both radical and credible”. Chance proposes setting up a “pan-London housing co-operative” and giving Londoners a £10 stake in a new solar energy co-op. He cites his six years’ experience at City Hall as a major strength and is battling to prevent building on Crystal Palace Park. Website here, Twitter here. Benali Hamdache describes himself as a London young professional and trade unionist. He is the Greens’ equalities spokesperson and helped write the party’s GBTIQ and BAME manifestos for the general election. Hamdache, whose father is Algerian and mother English, says his upbringing and background are a major reason why he’s involved in politics and that “London needs champions who will battle inequality, discrimination and marginalisation.” Website here, Twitter, here. Caroline Russell forms the one-woman opposition to Labour on Islington council having secured her seat last year. She’s worked as an artist, a college lecturer and a cycle courier. Russell contends that London could be an example of “how economic prosperity can go hand in hand with a green revolution” that improves the quality of homes, streets and the city’s air. She is her party’s national spokesperson on local transport. Website here, Twitter here. All five Green mayoral hopefuls are also running to be placed high on their party’s list of candidates for the London Assembly, which represents their best chance of being elected under the proportional representation element of the assembly ballot. Any Greens elected next year will succeed Jenny Jones and Darren Johnson, who have been Green AMs ever since the mayoralty and assembly began in 2000 and have announced they will be standing down next year. By general consent Jones and Johnson have used their time at City Hall well, energetically promoting Green concerns and nurturing the broad consensus that London works better socially and economically if its air is cleaner, its housing cheaper and more secure and its streets more conducive to cycling and walking. Jones has also been prepared to constructively challenge the police in ways that other AMs have not. Any successors will have plenty to live up to. The Green mayoral and assembly candidates will be selected by London Green Party members using the single transferable vote system, with voting taking place either by post or online. The process will be organised by the Electoral Reform Society and the result is expected to be announced in the first week of September. Update, 18:45. This article originally said that there remains time to join the Green party in London in time to vote for its candidates. Unfortunately, that is not in fact the case as the Greens’ London office had mistakenly told me. These things happen. Update, July 9, 2015. A sixth candidate has made his way on to the ballot sheet. He is... Rashid Nix, a housing activist, South Bank University graduate, youth mentor and radio presenter from South London. He originally worked in publishing, then trained to be a BBC cameraman before taking up running film-making courses for young people. He ascribes his political awakening to the estate he lived on being earmarked for regeneration by the local Labour council. He’s big on cricket and community action and contested Dulwich and West Norwood at the general election.

When she asked if he was worried about climate change, Koch replied, Well, I mean I believe it’s been warming some. There’s a big debate on that, because it depends on whether you use satellite measurements, balloon, or you use ground ones that have been adjusted. But there has been warming. The CO2 goes up, the CO2 has probably contributed to that. This response isn’t entirely accurate. For example, data from satellites, balloons (both of which are also ‘adjusted’), and thermometers on the ground (including their raw, unadjusted data) all show a clear long-term global warming trend at or near the Earth’s surface. But at least Koch acknowledged that the planet has been warming and carbon pollution has contributed to it. In fact, humans are responsible for all of the global warming we’ve seen since 1950. Despite not being 100% accurate, at least Koch is beyond Stages 1 and 2 of climate denial (denying the problem exists or that we’re the cause). That’s better than some Republican presidential candidates like Ted Cruz and possibly even Jeb Bush, although most other politicians have moved beyond the first stages of climate denial, apparently viewing them as a political liability. Koch’s Stage 3 and 4 Climate Denial Unfortunately, Charles Koch exhibited Stage 3 (deny it’s a problem) and Stage 4 (deny we can solve it) climate denial in some of his other interview comments, saying, They have these models that show [warming], but the models don’t work. Given the recent study finding that climate models are even more accurate than we thought, and we already knew they’ve been quite accurate, Koch’s “models don’t work” statement was poorly timed and simply untrue. He also claimed, But they say it’s going to be catastrophic. There is no evidence to that. Setting impossible expectations is one of the five telltale techniques of climate denial. Do we not have to worry about the consequences of climate change until they become catastrophic? And what if the consequences are just really, really bad? There is certainly plenty of evidence for that; whether or not those potential consequences are deemed “catastrophic” is a judgment call. Is it a “catastrophe” if half of global species go extinct, for example? There’s evidence we’re headed in that direction. I discussed some potential climate impacts in the following Denial101x lecture. How to Avoid Economic Catastrophe Koch eventually got to the root of his concerns, So do we want to create a catastrophe today in the economy because of some speculation based on models that don’t work? It’s interesting that Koch believes that there’s no evidence for catastrophic climate change, but that cutting carbon pollution will create an economic catastrophe. In fact, that’s exactly backwards. Cutting carbon pollution has costs, but it also creates benefits by reducing the costs of climate damages. To accurately evaluate the economic impact of climate policies, a cost-benefit analysis is needed. There’s approximately 95% agreement among economists that the benefits outweigh the costs and the USA should take steps to cut its carbon pollution. Consider the energy sector. We only know the true costs of various energy sources if we also account for the cost of the climate damages they cause, because taxpayers have to pay those costs as well. If you combine the costs of renewable vs. fossil fuel energy, and the estimated costs of climate damages, then wind and solar energy are in reality far cheaper than coal. Wind is also much cheaper than natural gas, and solar panels are around the same cost as natural gas. Moreover, there are ways to curb those climate damage costs without hurting the economy. One study, for example, found that a revenue-neutral carbon tax (in which 100% of the revenue generated from the tax is rebated to taxpayers) would be modestly beneficial for the economy without even accounting for the economic benefits of reducing climate damages. Such a policy would have to be implemented by US Congress. Unfortunately the Republican Party currently opposes all efforts to cut carbon pollution. This has forced President Obama to address the problem. Specifically, his Environmental Protection Agency has followed its legal obligation to regulate carbon pollution. Charles Koch and most of the Republican presidential candidates have expressed opposition to this approach, claiming that it will harm the economy. This is the standard industry reaction whenever pollutant regulations are proposed. As President Obama noted, in every case the regulations have been successfully implemented, benefits have exceeded costs, and the economy and regulated industry have done just fine. Bad for Koch Business, but Good for the Rest of Us However, if conservatives are worried about these government regulations, there’s an easy solution: pass climate legislation that replaces those regulations with a free market alternative. That’s what Democrats have been trying to do for a decade. They even came close in 2009, and would have been successful with just a little bit of Republican support. The problem for the Kochs is that even free market, small government policies to cut carbon emissions will be bad for the fossil fuel industry from which they greatly profit. And with the Kochs’ political network pledging $889 million for the 2016 election campaign, the Republican presidential candidates are under serious financial pressure to toe the same line. But in the real world, an economic catastrophe is far more likely if we fail to cut carbon pollution than if we succeed. We can use free market forces to cheaply reduce those emissions, and in the process produce a great economic benefit by minimizing the costs of climate damages. It would be a loss for the fossil fuel industry, but a big win for the rest of the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2015/jul/31/three-choirs-festival-saul-review-glyndebourne","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-02T07:00:08Z","webTitle":"Three Choirs festival; Saul – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/31/three-choirs-festival-saul-review-glyndebourne","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2015/jul/31/three-choirs-festival-saul-review-glyndebourne","fields":{"headline":"Three Choirs festival; Saul – review","bodyText":"The visceral power of voices united has been a feature of this changeable, disagreeable English summer. A super-charged chorus generated its own solar energy to match idyllic sunshine at Glyndebourne for the opening of Handel’s Saul, while our longest-established celebration of singing, the Three Choirs festival, defied more typical gales and biting rain to emerge triumphant into its fourth century. We hear so much of the Proms and Edinburgh that Britain’s oldest musical gathering, which set the pattern for all those that came later, has often been overshadowed. It’s time we honoured it. Established 300 years ago this year, it has seen the genesis of some of the nation’s favourite works and serves as an annual reminder that our cathedrals are a continually renewing source of musical excellence. Perhaps its origins in a pub, where the singing men of Hereford, Worcester, and Gloucester cathedrals met to run through some less than ecclesiastical repertoire, gives this festival its zest and its willingness to move away from a staple diet of devotional works. This year, in a week of almost nonstop music-making, artistic director Geraint Bowen programmed the traditional greats of Elgar’s Gerontius and Beethoven’s Missa Solemnis alongside Stravinsky’s thoroughly pagan Rite of Spring and Messiaen’s Turangalîla-Symphonie, that wildly exuberant celebration of love and sex. There’s nothing prim about Hereford. Pianist Steven Osborne played the fiendish solo piano writing with the same dazzling command he was to bring to a superbly intimate recital of late Beethoven and Schubert sonatas two days later. The Philharmonia Orchestra, brilliantly directed by Jac van Steen, romped through the dizzying score, the blowsy brass particularly splendid. Sitting amid all the clamour and rampant ardour of this colossal 10-movement work, Messiaen has one moment of blissful calm, a visit to the Jardin du sommeil d’amour, when that electronic curiosity, the ondes martenot, which up to then has been whopping with decidedly frisky joy, sings an ethereal song of love against a background of birdsong, trilled sweetly from the piano. It’s an exquisite moment and one beautifully realised in this ecstatic performance. Not so successful was the rarely heard Morning Heroes, written by Arthur Bliss to honour the memory of his brother, killed in 1916. It’s a huge, rambling piece, deploying a speaker rather than a singer as soloist, and melds Homer, Walt Whitman and Wilfred Owen into a long examination of war and its awful consequences. The trouble lies in the amount of text given to the singers. Committed as it was, the Three Choirs Festival Chorus was virtually unintelligible in the vaulted grandeur of Hereford Cathedral when tackling Whitman’s lengthy, repellent poem about excitable preparations for the US civil war. Conductor Sir Andrew Davis strove to give it shape and purpose and actor Malcolm Sinclair read the Homer and Owen with chilling authority, but ultimately Bliss let them down, much of the music urgent but directionless and the word-setting muddy and incoherent. But this is a festival that has always been prepared to take a chance – to re-evaluate the past and, importantly, to commission the new. Bob Chilcott wrote an attractive set of canticles for the 300th anniversary, sung a couple of days after the festival’s future, its Youth Choir, sang his Requiem with poise and precision. A few intonation problems crept into its reading of Bernstein’s Chichester Psalms, but two young soloists really impressed – Ruairi Bowen (tenor) and Patrick Dunachie (countertenor). It was good to see that some of those in the Youth Choir are already gap-year choral scholars in the back rows of the three cathedral choirs that came together to form the two choruses in Bach’s St Matthew Passion, a performance that also saw the Three Choirs debut of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. With players of this quality and a stellar cast of soloists it was always going to be a special evening, but few could have been prepared for the dramatic intensity of evangelist James Oxley’s performance. For three hours he lived the role, singing without a copy, freighting each utterance, first with urgency and then resigned solemnity as his narrative slid towards the inevitability of Golgatha. Bass Matthew Brook brought a shining dignity to his portrayal of Christ while William Towers (countertenor), Elizabeth Watts (soprano), Anthony Gregory (tenor) and Roderick Williams (baritone) all sang impeccably. The boys of the three choirs performed with bushy-tailed vigour but the men were too often buried in their copies to fully communicate their grave message; one small cloud in an otherwise serenely azure sky. The OAE had travelled to Herefordshire from Sussex, where they are stunning audiences with Glyndebourne’s dazzling new hit – Barrie Kosky’s startling realisation of Handel’s oratorio Saul. Much of its success is down to the tremendous commitment of the chorus. Kosky makes huge demands on it, but its response had the audience clapping and cheering within 10 minutes of the curtain rising. Kosky centres his hugely imaginative production on Saul’s raving jealousy of Goliath-slayer David, the saviour of his people. Christopher Purves portrays Saul’s descent into madness with frightening intensity, while Iestyn Davies, as David, is superb; his rich, secure countertenor seems to get better with every new role. Sophie Bevan and Lucy Crowe excel as chalk-and-cheese sisters Michal and Merab and tenor Paul Appleby is a noble Jonathan. With designer Katrin Lea Tang’s glorious pastiche-Georgian costumes, some wildly entertaining dancing and conductor Ivor Bolton driving it all along, it’s a five-star evening. • Saul runs at Glyndebourne until 29 August Star ratings (out of five): Three Choirs festival **** Saul *****"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/18/catholic-church-renewable-energy-philippines","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2015-08-18T10:34:56Z","webTitle":"Can the church shift the balance to renewable energy in the Philippines?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/18/catholic-church-renewable-energy-philippines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/aug/18/catholic-church-renewable-energy-philippines","fields":{"headline":"Can the church shift the balance to renewable energy in the Philippines?","bodyText":"In June, the Catholic church in the Philippines joined the One Million Against Coal Campaign, which aims to gather at least one million signatures nationwide in a bid to pressure the government to reverse the approval of dozens of coal power plants meant to address the country’s energy security concerns. “We are strongly opposing coal energy because of its negative effects on the health of the people and the environment. Coal plants are the primary cause of global warming,” says Father Edwin Gariguez, executive director of Caritas Philippines National Secretariat for Social Action, the church’s social action arm. The petition was announced days before Pope Francis called on the world to phase out the use of fossil fuels in his powerful 180-page encyclical on the environment. Gariguez told the Guardian the encyclical confirms they’re on the right track. Although much of the church’s effort has centred on opposing fossil fuels, it’s taking a two-pronged approach to include clean energy use. For instance, one project – a proposed 1,200-megawatt (MW) coal plant in Atimonan, 170km south of capital Manila – has met strong protests from locals, led by church leaders. These leaders are paving the way for renewable energy use by installing solar panels at their parish church. “We’re encouraging our communities to adopt renewable energy sources by setting an example. This has not been cascaded to all Catholic churches nationwide, but that’s our hope. We’ll include this as part of our best practices,” Gariguez explains. Yet there are challenges. Gariguez said the Church doesn’t have the funds to make renewable energy use a widespread effort. That’s why it’s turning to groups that may be able to help out. Gariguez is in talks with a Norway-based NGO focusing on solar energy about a partnership to promote renewable energy use in off-grid and remote communities in the Philippines. If it works out – Gariguez declined to identify which group they’re talking to saying the negotiations are all still “exploratory” – the project will involve installing solar panels in schools and health districts. “This is a step. We’re doing something,” he says. The Catholic church plays a prominent role in the Philippines. With 76 million members, accounting for roughly 80% of the population – the biggest in Asia, it has the ability to influence public debate on any issue. For instance, church officials have stirred protests against mining, particularly open-pit mining techniques and mining laws, which they claim give too many incentives to foreign companies. Gariguez says they want to turn fossil fuels and clean energy into a mainstream issue as they did mining. The church has joined hands with environmentalists and activists such as non-government organisation Philippine Movement for Climate Justice (PMCJ) in this goal. PMCJ is working with the church on the signature drive against coal. It was also part of the campaign that called for Norway to divest its over $8 billion fossil fuel investments, some of which were channeled to the Philippines. “Together with the faith community and affected sectors, we are taking into account what the Pope is calling for and what the climate needs: a radical shift away from dirty energy, specifically coal, towards renewable energy,” PMCJ national coordinator Gerry Arances says. “The entry of the Catholic church in the climate scene is a much needed element to introduce the moral and ethical arguments into the climate debacle.” But Gariguez believes there’s only so much they can do. He urges the government to do its part. “The church doesn’t have the financial capacity. What we can do is advocate for government to support renewable energy. We’ve had dialogues with them. But we’re tired. They’re insensitive and they’re not listening.” Church leaders are blaming the government for failing to lay the groundwork for renewable energy fast enough so it could plug the energy requirement gap without having to tap more coal. The government had announced 23 new coal power plants would go online by 2020. The Philippine economy is fast expanding, which means electricity demand is growing. The grid on Luzon, the country’s largest island where most business activities happen, has an installed capacity of 13,200 MW. But many power plants suffer outages because they’re old, while hydropower capacity falls during dry months, resulting to dwindling output and sometimes, rotating blackouts. Mario Marasigan, director of the energy ministry’s renewable energy management bureau, says there are many factors weighing on the country’s renewable energy plan. Renewable energy requires time to build – you have to find and validate a resource before you can develop it. It’s also more expensive to produce at the moment, though this is expected to get cheaper with better technology. In contrast, coal takes the shortest time. It’s the fastest way to cope with energy demand. Marasigan also lamented that some renewable energy projects are facing delays due to opposition from local communities, sometimes even the church. This is the case in the province of Sorsogon, where a listed oil and gas company has received the green light to develop geothermal energy. “The priest is objecting to the project, saying it will destroy the environment and bring about an ecological imbalance,” says Marasigan. “In general, the church is pro-renewable energy but there are isolated cases like this. We’re trying to educate them.” Nonetheless, the energy ministry is ramping up renewable energy development to change the Philippines’ energy mix. In fact, it claims its renewable energy plan has picked up pace. The Philippines targets a renewable energy supply of 15,300 MW by 2030 (pdf), about half of the energy demand forecast of 30,000 MW. Demand today stands at nearly 12,000 MW. The goal is largely fuelled by cost considerations. The Philippines imports most of its fuel requirements, making it dependent on international markets. “We’re lessening our dependence on imported fuels,” say Marasigan. “By developing indigenous resources that are clean and green.” Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

Meanwhile, mobile internet use in Africa is predicted to grow at double the rate of the rest of the world over the next five years. “The world is getting smarter and we’re just one of a number of companies tapping into this growing ‘internetisation’ to bring change to people’s lives,” enthused Duby. “Developing communities have traditionally been viewed as too poor to use sophisticated energy services, but we aim to show that is simply not the case.” Referring to smart thermostat startup Nest, now owned by Google, he said: “We call ourselves ‘Nest for the rest’. We’re using the same type of technology and the same intelligent processes to catalyse major social and environmental benefits.” Having experienced the challenges of running micro-grids – small-scale power grids operating independently or in conjunction with a central grid – Duby and co-founder Harrison Leaf now focus entirely on developing smart tools for grid owners to operate successfully. And the time is right for remote electricity monitoring technology, Duby believes, as solar energy becomes more affordable and a rapidly industrialising continent seeks more power, against a backdrop of insufficient energy infrastructure. So how does it work? Grid owners and operators install SteamaCo’s hardware at their power stations and monitor the technical and financial performance of grids remotely – and in real time – via cloud-based software. They can troubleshoot and address problems, such as dips in battery voltage, before they become serious, as well as identify spare capacity that could be directed to other uses, like water-pumping, and check customers’ power usage against their remaining balance. Meanwhile, customers get flexible access to electricity. They top up their credit and check their balance as they would a pay-as-you-go phone. Importantly, all data, including notifications to top up, is sent via SMS messages, making it possible to operate in some of the most remote, rural regions. Having won its first customer in 2013, SteamaCo is now supporting 30 grids (26 in Kenya and four in Tanzania, Benin and Nepal) that provide a total of 120kW of power to 1,000 homes and small businesses. Among the owners of the first grids are energy heavyweights E.ON and PowerGen. SteamaCo plans to expand further in Kenya and beyond. “SteamaCo’s technology stands to tip the balance in expanding access to electricity by making micro-grids an investable proposition,” explains Dr Anne Wheldon, renewable energy expert and Ashden judge. “Investors can see there’s a clear mechanism in place to manage grid maintenance and capture payments transparently.” Additionally, the flexibility of the SteamaCo platform means it could even be used to connect people to the mains grid. Should electricity regulators approve the idea, a micro-grid using SteamaCo technology could buy a connection from the mains grid, and share the cost with its users. With the cost of a single grid connection in Kenya typically around $700 (£440) – a figure far beyond the means of most people – this could make electricity affordable for millions of families. A connection to SteamaCo’s micro-grid currently costs around $10. Cheap power for families and entrepreneurs “Affordability is crucial to expanding access to electricity in developing communities, and doing so in an equitable way,” explains Wheldon. “Paying per unit of electricity used means people can buy power in line with their earning patterns and domestic needs. It makes electricity for the poorest possible.” And with 1.2 billion people worldwide lacking access to electricity, there is real potential here for technologies of this kind to help alleviate poverty and support sustainable development. What’s more, gaining access to a reliable source of energy stands to unleash a wave of entrepreneurial activity. SteamaCo has already seen evidence of this in Kenya, where people have launched all kinds of businesses since connecting to their local micro-grid. Hairdressing salons, water pumping stations and mobile phone charging kiosks are thriving, says Duby, while one technician is offering radio repair services, saving locals a 200km round trip to the nearest town."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"global-development-professionals-network/2015/jun/15/what-does-tesla-mean-for-energy-in-africa","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development-professionals-network","sectionName":"Global Development Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T11:11:28Z","webTitle":"What does Tesla mean for energy in Africa?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jun/15/what-does-tesla-mean-for-energy-in-africa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jun/15/what-does-tesla-mean-for-energy-in-africa","fields":{"headline":"What does Tesla mean for energy in Africa?","bodyText":"With only 30% of people in Africa having access to electricity, it’s little wonder Tesla’s Powerwall home-storage batteries are being touted as the next big revolution for African energy. In countries like Nigeria diesel-powered generators are the default back-up for chronic, daily national power cuts. Tesla’s Powerwall battery works as a back-up that is not reliant on fossil fuels. It stores renewable energy like solar and wind and can last more than 24 hours. All this at no cost other than the upfront cost of the Powerwall itself. For Africa’s energy consumers and low-income groups, affordability is the main hurdle for the Powerwall’s adoption. Tesla’s 7-kilowatt-hours (kWh) capacity battery costs $3,000 upfront, excluding installation. Average per-capita incomes across sub-Saharan Africa mostly fall below $3,000, and it costs Africans much more to access energy than in many parts of the developing world. The continent remains hugely dependent on expensive fossil fuel sources for primary energy consumption, while renewable energy still accounts for only 20% of installed generation capacity, despite recent progress. Other new energy solutions have proved cost-effective, for instance, mobile pay-as-you-go solar power services. Under the model, pioneered by companies like Azuri Technologies, users pay a one-off installation fee of around $10 for a solar panel that can power two LED lights. The pack also includes a phone-charging device. The total weekly cost is about $1.50, which is at least 50% lower than fossil fuel alternatives such as kerosene. Users also get up to eight hours a day of energy. It would take 18 months to pay for the Azuri unit, bringing the total cost to around $108. Compare this to the $3,000 price tag of the Powerwall pack. But Tesla’s storage solution could help accelerate Africa’s permanent transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, thus aiding the continent’s fight against environmentally destructive greenhouse gas emissions. At least 40% of the African communities that use solar energy still rely on fossil fuel energy sources as a backup. Existing small-scale solar battery devices can’t compete with Tesla’s Powerwall battery, which can supply 1,000 watts for at least 10 hours and possibly more. The impact on everyday life, from tasks such as cooking to study-lighting for school children in urban, semi-urban and rural Africa, could be monumental. Already, Africa’s off-grid communities that have moved from wood-burning to solar power lanterns have enjoyed health and economic benefits. The average urban African household only needs six hours of energy a day to run productively – rural households require much less. Since the Powerwall can offer more than 24 hours of uninterrupted power supply there may be ways to deliver the Tesla solution in a corporate pool to rural communities, rather than to individual households, for whom costs would be prohibitive. Shared utilities such as water, light, and heat still form part of the cultural fabric of many African communities. In order to do this, however, the policy environment for renewable energy – particularly solar and wind – needs to be favourable. Even if Tesla plans to introduce a grant element or cheaper version of the Powerwall battery pack to off-grid African markets, a communal platform for Tesla batteries in Africa may still require a government subsidy scheme. But subsidies could undermine the move towards cleaner energy sources on the continent, and place a huge economic burden on countries. Global experts are awed by the low costs of Tesla’s Powerwall batteries, since competing technologies cost twice as much. The introduction of the technology has clearly reinforced the merits of energy storage systems and could create momentum for the development of cheaper sustainable energy solutions for Africa’s low-income off-grid communities. Tesla is already designing a battery pack for large utility companies in the US, suggesting the possibility of tailored options for specific markets. Africa is grappling with the challenge of transitioning to clean energy systems such as solar. That transition would be smoother if countries’ grid-reliant communities – and not just off-grid ones – formed a core constituency for solar technology. While Africa’s rural poor are often viewed as the main protagonists in the energy access and energy-poverty discourse, the continent’s middle, and largely urban class, are probably the most crucial link in cementing the shift to green energy. It will be primarily this middle-class demographic than can afford the type of solar technology that will force this shift. In the short-term, at least, this demographic could also be the most viable target market in Africa for Tesla’s ground-breaking energy storage.

It gave us the gun-barrel titles and the Monty Norman theme. There was Ursula Andress in the bikini and the exotic Johnny Foreigner villain with an outrageous island lair. What’s not to indulge? Rating: ★★★★★ From Russia With Love (1963) My favourite. Weirdly ungadgety and downbeat, with Istanbul locations. Connery searches his hotel room for bugs for what seems like 10 minutes, with the theme music playing deafeningly. Great train fight with Robert Shaw. ★★★★★ Goldfinger (1964) “You eckshpect me to talk? No, Mr Bond, I expect you to DIE!” This introduced us to his Aston Martin DB5, and the weirdo spectacle of Shirley Eaton suffocating in gold. It established the convention whereby the villain leaves 007 time to escape some elaborate automated death. ★★★★★ Thunderball (1965) The evil organisation Spectre had its first appearance in Fleming’s Thunderball novel, and we’d got used to it by now. Good stuff here, but the franchise faltered a bit, with long underwater sequences. ★★★★☆ You Only Live Twice (1967) This great action movie put Sean’s Bond right back on top, and introduced us to the horribly scarred, Nehru-suit-wearing, cat-stroking master criminal Spectre chief, Blofeld, played by Donald Pleasence. Connery announced his intention to quit after this. ★★★★★ Casino Royale (1967) Wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Even a cameo from Orson Welles couldn’t lend lustre to this pointless and unfunny spoof Bond, a dire tongue-in-cheeker which slipped past the franchise control of the producers, Eon. David Niven saunters unsexily as the retired “Sir James Bond” in this chaotic film. ★☆☆☆☆ On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969) George Lazenby’s sole appearance wasn’t a bad Bond. Had he done more, Lazenby might have developed into a favourite. Diana Rigg played the woman who shows 007 is no commitmentphobe. They get married, before gunfire poignantly restores Bond’s eternal singledom. ★★★☆☆ Diamonds Are Forever (1971) Uh-oh. Connery was tempted back to the role with a big pay packet, now looking craggier and toupéed. Ernst Blofeld, boringly played by Charles Gray, wants to use diamonds to focus his space laser. Bond girl Tiffany Case was played by Jill St John, whose real-life boyfriend, Henry Kissinger, would have been better as Blofeld. ★★★☆☆ Live and Let Die (1973) And so began the reign of Rog, tacitly conceding the campness that many saw as unavoidable for Bond. Moore was witty, sprightly and a mature 46 when he took over. (Connery had started at 32.) This movie has a great song from Paul McCartney and Wings. ★★★★☆ The Man With the Golden Gun (1974) I think this was Moore’s best Bond, despite iffy reviews at the time, perhaps because he had one of the very best villains, wonderfully played by Christopher Lee: Scaramanga, he of the creepy third nipple. It’s a preposterous 70s fuel-crisis drama about a solar energy device. There’s some funky martial arts. ★★★★☆ The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) This has a well-loved Bond song, Carly Simon’s Nobody Does It Better. It also introduced us to the exotic henchman Jaws. The action opens with that staggering skiing-off-a-cliff stunt, just after Moore is seen supposedly skiing in front of an outrageous back projection. ★★★★☆ Moonraker (1979) A whopping, mega-budget Bond in its day, clearly influenced by the Star Wars-led revival of sci-fi. It’s all about the theft of a space shuttle but this excursion into space can’t conceal the fact that Roger is looking a bit jaded. ★★★☆☆ For Your Eyes Only (1981) Oh dear. You can hear a whistling and a crackling in the air as Rog begins to tune out. The stunts hold up, but Moore is on the exit ramp and his flaccid relationship with 24-year-old Carole Bouquet is a deathly embarrassment, with Bouquet in any case famous for her detached hauteur. ★★☆☆☆ Never Say Never Again (1983) The title is what Connery’s agent should have shouted at him when he was offered the comeback: (“Never”! Say “Never”! Again!) Sean lumbers back for the remake of Thunderball that no one wanted or needed. He was never a six-pack guy at the best of times, but he’s out of condition now. One to forget. ★★☆☆☆ Octopussy (1983) Outrageously daft but silly and fun. Roger Moore wears a gorilla costume. ★★★★☆ A View to a Kill (1985) Quite unexpectedly, Rog pulled it back a bit for his last hurrah. (It was also, sadly, the last hurrah for Lois Maxwell’s Miss Moneypenny). Christopher Walken was always destined to play a Bond villain and it came to pass in this film, as the evil electronics mogul Max Zorin. A good note for Roger to bow out on. ★★★☆☆ The Living Daylights (1987) This was the turn of straight actor and RSC stalwart Timothy Dalton. He was supposedly there to give Bond a hard and gritty new seriousness, but always looked a bit humourless. This was an Aids era of sexual restraint, so Bond only cops off a couple of times. ★★☆☆☆ Licence to Kill (1989) Bond goes rogue, and Dalton stays dull. Without permission from his superiors, 007 pursues a murderous revenge campaign against a drug lord who killed Felix Leiter’s wife. This one is notable for the young Benicio del Toro as a humble henchman. After this, legal copyright rows caused a six-year production hiatus during which Dalton quit, having made less of an impression than Lazenby. ★★☆☆☆ GoldenEye (1995) Was it a Bondaissance? A Brosnanaissance? Whatever. Stylish yet assertive smoothie Pierce Brosnan had already made an impression in the TV caper Remington Steele. He took to Bond like a duck to water: virile, cool, nice suits. Judi Dench made her debut as M. Bond was back! ★★★☆☆ Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) It took a spanking from Titanic at the box office, but this is a good, underrated Bond: one of the very few films (or plays or books) to satirise Rupert Murdoch and his Chinese expansionist plans – a rather taboo subject in 90s media. Jonathan Pryce has great fun with the role of the villainous mogul. ★★★★☆ The World Is Not Enough (1999) Not bad, but something of the fizz is going. In this film, the distinction between villain and henchman seems to collapse a bit with three bad guys: Robert Carlyle, Robbie Coltrane and, erm, Goldie, who was very big in those days. ★★★☆☆ Die Another Day (2002) Oh dear. Oh lawdy. The Bond franchise was looking lost in the grim and joyless new War On Terror era and this movie featured the worst gadget in the history of 007: an invisible car. Whaat? What on earth is the point of that? You can almost see the P45 being pressed into Brosnan’s hand. ★★☆☆☆ Casino Royale (2006) Daniel Craig had to face a lot of internet bickering when he was cast, but he blew everyone away with a performance that was just right: cool, cruel, ruthless, yet sardonic. It was great at the time and looks even better now, one of the best Bonds. ★★★★★ Quantum of Solace (2008) Much mocked at the time, this film actually wasn’t as bad as that – despite the silliest title in the series’s history. Craig is always watchable and Mathieu Amalric is a very eccentric and oddball villain. ★★★☆☆ Skyfall (2012) An excellent, intelligent Bond which shrewdly expanded the role of Judi Dench’s M, developed her relationship with 007 and created a plausible, sympathetic backstory for him personally. Javier Bardem got his teeth into the villain role. ★★★★☆ Spectre (2015) Boom! Craig and director Sam Mendes bring off an absolutely storming 007 extravaganza, kicking off with a head-banging action sequence in Mexico City. Léa Seydoux has a Veronica Lake-type sultriness and Ben Whishaw almost steals the scene as the geeky Q. ★★★★★ • This article was amended on 24 October 2015. The original omitted Octopussy.

As pounding bass-filled music booms out of the PA, a great mass of the young, the middle-aged and the old are all glazed with submission as they appear to seek the meaning of the universe in the transformative process of ultraviolet radiation. A few yards away in a darkened auditorium beneath a strange mock pinkish pyramid the Starmus festival is under way. Dedicated to celebrating a synthesis between astronomy and music that is of a more transcendent kind than that practised around the Mediterranean Palace pool, it has drawn hundreds of people focused on very different but no less familiar stars: Brian Cox, Richard Dawkins, Brian May and, the greatest scientific supernova of them all, Stephen Hawking. These, along with 11 Nobel laureates, are some of the leading speakers at the third Starmus festival at the Pirámide de Arona, an island of vaulting intellectual aspiration surrounded by tourist hotels with armies of sunbathers fastened to their poolside loungers as if by superglue. Starmus is an unusual affair, but not necessarily for its setting. It’s not a typical science conference for academics at which new papers are presented. Nor is it a typical public talk designed to popularise established academic theories. Instead it’s a sort of hybrid – at once specialist and popularising, openly public, and yet sufficiently off-circuit to feel discreetly private. It also seeks to bridge the separate worlds of science and the arts or, more specifically, music and cosmology. The brainchild of a bearded Armenian astrophysicist, Garik Israelian, Starmus was first held in 2011. Israelian’s original idea was to do a concert at La Palma observatory, which features the world’s largest optical and infrared telescope. A disarming 53-year-old with a scattershot charm, Israelian had been working at Nasa “trying to get acoustic sound waves in stellar atmospheres” and wondered if musicians might be able to use his collection. He approached Jean-Michel Jarre, who was keen on the idea, only for the concert to be cancelled when the Canary Islands government withdrew funding. Undeterred, Israelian decided to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin’s first space flight with a festival in 2011. That was the first Starmus. In one sense it was a tremendous success because the keynote speaker was Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon and someone whose public appearances were so rare as to raise suspicion of their authenticity. “When we announced Neil Armstrong was coming,” Israelian recalls, “we completely lost our credibility because no one believed he was going to be there. People said we were crazy. It was the worst thing we could do. And then he came!” Armstrong’s fellow crew member Buzz Aldrin was also there, as well as Jim Lovell, commander of the ill-fated Apollo 13 who was played by Tom Hanks in the eponymous film. In addition there was the progressive electronic band Tangerine Dream. However, in financial terms it was a disaster. Admission was free for most visitors, there was no sponsorship, and Israelian and his co-producers were left to pick up a hefty bill. But that didn’t stop them holding a second Starmus, again on Tenerife. This time Stephen Hawking came. He was a massive draw, but once again the festival lost money. Israelian talks darkly of broken promises by the Canary Islands government and the disappointing lack of sponsorship. They say that one definition of madness is to keep doing the same thing and to expect different results. If so, then Israelian is mad in the best tradition of mad professors, because he came back for a third time with a cast list that was starrier than ever. Not until you’ve seen Brian Cox at a gathering of science buffs can you appreciate how much the awe-filled physicist and TV personality is adored by his public. To walk alongside him though the Pirámide de Arona is to be submerged by a sea of autograph hunters and selfie-takers. Unlike Dawkins, who looks as if he can’t wait to get to the green room, Cox seems to relish the attention. What did he think of his first Starmus? “It’s brilliant,” he says, tucking into an ice-cream. “There’s a lot of time to talk to the speakers. And you don’t normally get people like Brian Eno, Brian May and Hans Zimmer in the same room as Stephen Hawking and Joe Stiglitz.” We talk about Eno’s lecture in which he discussed the intimate relationship between science and art, one the legendary music producer and former Roxy Music synthesiser player characterised as “science discovers and art digests”. “He’s right,” says Cox. “If you look at the history of astronomy, these ideas of finding our place in the universe have had a massive social impact. The obvious one is the relegation of the Earth from the centre of it. That battle to define whether or not we’re special was one of the defining battles of the 17th century onward. Our physical demotion is now widely accepted, but what of the emotional impact if you start talking as Brian Greene and Martin Rees [two other speakers] did about the multiverse. What does it mean if there are an infinite number of these pocket universes? If that’s the case, we’re not geographically significant. We’re not even lucky. We’re just inevitable. Does that matter?” Good question, but I’m not sure that I’ve fully mastered the concept of an infinite number of pocket universes, so I silently nod with as much sagacity as I can muster. “The fact that we’re in an insignificant physical speck in a possibly infinite universe,” he continues, “is as easy or difficult to accept as that we are a very tiny temporal speck in a possibly infinite time span. We know how to deal with that, with death and a finite life time. There is an interesting parallel to be drawn. But it’s a conversation that won’t be had by physicists. It’s a conversation that’s best had in art, philosophy, literature and theology. That’s where the meaning of the things we discover about the universe is teased out.” Back in the darkened auditorium with its decorative scattering of fairy lights – to suggest the stellar illuminations of the cosmos? – Hawking is wheeled on stage. Hawking, as Cox says, is “iconic”, but as the presenter of Forces of Nature also noted, his extraordinary image, the great brain trapped inside the paralysed body, has tended to overshadow his achievements, at least in the mind of the general public. “He’s up there with the best,” says Cox. “Several of the things we take for granted – black holes, Big Bang, singularity – those are his contributions.” Like everyone, Hawking pre-writes his speech – entitled A Brief History of Mine – in his case by selecting the appropriate letters on his computer by moving a keyboard sensor with his cheek. But unlike everyone else, he records the speech, which is then issued one sentence at a time by another movement of his cheek. The speech is a bit like an audio version of the film The Theory of Everything, with a gallop through Hawking’s life story plus key moments of scientific breakthroughs. Interestingly, he estimates that as a lazy Oxford undergraduate, he worked for 1,000 hours in his three years – so much for Malcolm Gladwell’s 10,000-hour theory as the basis for genius. Several times there are long pauses, and a cosmic silence pervades the auditorium, until an assistant comes on stage to reboot Hawking’s computer. At the end of a funny, moving and profound speech there is a standing ovation. A little while later there is a comedy musical tribute to Hawking by the American musician and web developer Ken Lawrence, who goes by the stage name of MC Hawking. He performs rap and hip-hop employing gangsta-style slang mixed in with the esteemed scientist’s quotes. It’s sort of clever, even impressive in a way, but painfully unfunny, though that doesn’t stop people laughing. Among the most conspicuously entertained during a chorus of “Black hole yo!” is the Queen guitarist and doctoral astrophysicist Brian May, sitting in the front row. With his long frizz of white hair, May looks how Isaac Newton might have looked if he’d had the opportunity to ram his wet fingers into an electric plug socket. “That was what Starmus is all about,” says Cox afterwards. The session closes with an inspirational talk by the astronaut Chris Hadfield, who had a big hit on YouTube with his rendition of David Bowie’s Space Oddity, recorded during his five-month spell up in the International Space Station. He argues that peopled space travel is a vital part of humanity’s fundamental desire to explore. Before that, though, there’s a discussion between Dawkins and the astrophysicist Steven Balbus about life on other planets. If it exists, says Dawkins, he believes that it’s governed by the laws of evolution. Dawkins has appeared at every Starmus, but he doesn’t look any more comfortable for the experience. Perhaps it’s because – I’m told – he’s staying at the Mediterranean Palace. That thumping bass could get to the most relaxed of people, and not even his most devoted fans would describe him as relaxed. The following day there is a round-table event at the observatory in La Palma. It lasts 108 minutes – the time taken for Gagarin’s first trip into space – and features eight great minds discussing various aspects of space exploration, global issues such as climate change and public communication. Seven of them are men – all white and middle aged or older – and one is a woman. Of the 39 speakers listed for the whole week, only four are women. There are more men called Brian – five of them. And there is one solitary non-white face (the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson). I asked Israelian if the lack of diversity was an issue for him. “No, no. I don’t think about such things,” he says, irritated by the question. “I invited many female scientists and they couldn’t come. I’ve got limited time – I cannot keep inviting people to get 50%. That’s not my problem.” The round table debate turns out to be quite dull, with everyone speaking in optimistic platitudes or pessimistic generalities. It’s not a forum for deep expertise but strong opinion and it turns out that in a group debate the sum is less than its parts. The debate is streamed live on the internet and also into the auditorium beneath the pyramid in Tenerife, which is about half full. As the crowd files out I take a good look at them. They’re much younger on average than the speakers and, in terms of gender at least, much more representative of the outside world. I speak to a 40-year-old physics student called Raquel Rodriguez. If you were looking for a stereotype of an astro-nerd, then Rodriguez is not where you’d start. She looks like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct and tells me her favourite area of discussion is “dark matter and quantum physics”. Then there’s a 32-year-old Norwegian nurse called Guro Nygård. Her brother brought her here for the week as a birthday present. She’s fascinated by astronomy, she says, though this is the first time she’s been to such an event. Her personal highlight from the week was seeing Hawking. “He’s unbelievable,” she says. “His personal history is truly amazing.” Both women noticed the imbalance between men and women but both believed the key thing was to get the best people and that gender, in the short term, was a secondary issue. I find 36-year-old Sam Alexandroni talking to a neuroscientist, a brain surgeon and a rocket scientist. He used to be a journalist at the New Statesman, he says, but now he’s writing a novel. “My teachers did a miserable job at school of communicating the wonder of science. Having discovered it later in life, events like this are brilliant for communicating ideas,” he says. As for combining the sciences and the arts, Alexandroni is all for it, though he says he’s “yet to experience the synergy” at Starmus. The much-anticipated synergy is due to occur the following day at the closing Sonic Universe concert, featuring the woman who lost her heart to a starship trooper, Sarah Brightman, along with the Tenerife Symphony Orchestra, Chris Hadfield and Rick Wakeman doing some Bowie, Hans Zimmer the Hollywood composer, and guest artist Brian May. But sadly I won’t be there. It’s time to pick up my things from the Mediterranean Palace and take to the skies back to London. As I leave, the prostate worshippers of solar energy are still pursuing melanogenesis to the accompaniment of a bludgeoning Eurobeat. Science never stops. And nor, alas, does the music. Chris Hadfield Q&amp;A Chris Hadfield, 56, is a retired Canadian astronaut who served as commander of the International Space Station and became a viral sensation on the internet with his rendition of David Bowie’s Space Oddity. Did you ever get to have any communication with David Bowie? Yeah, I did. I never met him in person. I wish I had, but in order to do what we did, of course we needed his blessing and he was gracious enough to give us very heavily the thumbs-up. He loved the result and said it was the most poignant version ever. Everything I did with him he just came across as a thoughtful, funny, original gentleman of a guy. How did you come to Starmus? I got to know Brian May. I forget how. I think we were conversing from space actually. Then I spent some time with him in Australia and we just hit it off. So I think it was initially Brian who sent a note to me saying, “Hey, this is going on. You should come if you can.” How has being in space change you as a person? Really, it did two things. It gave me a different perspective, and it gave me a level of public voice that I didn’t have before. So then the eternal question is, what do you do with what you are? Do I sell soap or do I buy a yacht? I mean I can’t afford to buy a yacht, but I’m just saying, what do I decide to do with fame? For me, the internal change that came from space flight clarified an understanding of what the world truly is. I think somewhere in my 2,600 orbits, you start to get a completely unfettered understanding of the world. You start to understand what four and a half billion years means. There’s also the commonality of the human experience. If you come to Tenerife you’ll kind of focus on the differences – how is this place different than where I am, or where I grew up, or they’re stupid here because it’s different to the way I do it. But if you go over Tenerife, and a few seconds later over the Cape Verde, and then you cross Africa and then you cross Madagascar, then you come across Perth and then you’re coming around to Sydney and that happens over and over and over again – it’s the similarities of the human experience that predominate. And therefore, obviously pretty quickly, the shared nature of life and the fact that our objectives, no matter what political or religious system we were raised with, have a lot more in common than they do apart. Did you ever find that overwhelming? I mean, how do you not crack up with the weight of that perspective? The people who have had epiphanies of various sorts or have cracked up, almost all of them were in the previous generation of space explorers. Because at that time we threw people into space with a purely technical purpose and almost no human preparation. This was the cold war and we gotta win it, so details be damned. So guys came back from the moon, and some of the cosmonauts... some of them came back alcoholic, depressed or with a religious epiphany. And no one ever treated them the same again. Neil came back a recluse because that was the only way he could deal with it; Buzz came back an alcoholic, but he turned that around. I don’t know anyone in the latter-day era who has had an epiphany. I think it’s spiritual and immensely contemplative, but we prepare for it psychologically. We have a whole team of support people and psychiatrists. They put the guitar on the space station, and a movie library. They build us psychological support equipment. You’re a believer in a peopled mission to Mars. Well, it’s not a belief system. That misrepresents the fundamental question which is: should human exploration stop? That’s a ridiculous expectation because human exploration is innate. We learn to walk way before we learn to talk. You have to be able to explore in order to develop as a human being. A little toddler making odd decisions that are enabled by mobility is how we discovered everything. It took a long time to be able to see what’s over the ocean or even across the Red Sea. It took even longer to cross the Tasman Strait, or all the way down to Antarctica, and even longer to fly – and then even longer to fly above the atmosphere. But it’s all the same. There is nothing magic about space exploration. Space is just an adjective."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
