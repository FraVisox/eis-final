Officials say at least 437 children have died since Russia’s invasion began. More than 800 have been injured. How many kids are permanently traumatised is anybody’s guess. Every day, Vladimir Putin gets away with murder. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is shelled again, despite repeated UN warnings of Europe-wide catastrophe. In liberated Kherson, more grisly evidence of war crimes is uncovered. Wherever the Russians go, it’s the same horror story. Every day the killers go unpunished. Relentless waves of indiscriminate missile strikes darken Ukrainian skies, pulverising apartment blocks, clinics, shopping centres and schools. Moscow no longer even pretends to target the military. Its aim: to terrorise civilians. Destroying electricity, heat and water supplies to the main cities, already suffering food and medicine shortages, is key to Putin’s winter war. He strives to break Ukraine’s will, imperilling millions besieged by snow and ice. Every day, he perpetrates crimes against humanity. Russia’s red-handed army of homicidal generals, incompetent field commanders, out-of-control soldiers and hapless conscripts is attempting genocide – annihilation of a nation and a people – in plain sight. The European parliament voted last week to declare Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. Good. Now order Putin’s arrest! Issue warrants for the president and all his gang. Expel his lying diplomats. Penalise his pals. Close the borders. Or is this feelgood Euro-posturing? The question is rhetorical. You know the answer. As blacked-out Moldova warned last week, another huge humanitarian and migrant crisis looms, akin to that of last spring. It will challenge every EU country. Yet as the strain of multiple Ukraine-related problems begins to tell, European support may be faltering at this critical juncture. The war and its atrocities are being normalised and, increasingly, discounted. Where is the outrage now? Where the visceral fury? Nine months in, western public opinion is dulled, deadened and desensitised by a daily diet of remote, unceasing, almost routine carnage. People are no longer shocked, nor even greatly surprised. They feel powerless. The majority still wants Ukraine to prevail. But victory is not expected soon. In the absence of peace talks or any relief, war fatigue teeters towards apathy. In Italy and Germany, far-right voices complain they are “fed up” with the war’s costly knock-on effects. Protests against the stand-off with Moscow pockmark central Europe. Conflicted fellow travellers give Putin leave to carry on killing. It’s only November. For everyone, the worst of winter is yet to come. And there are limits to how often Kyiv can repair damaged pylons, cables and power plants. As soon as they are fixed, missiles blow them apart. “Invincibility shelters” can only do so much. “Today is just one day, but we have received 70 missiles. That’s the Russian formula of terror,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last Wednesday. “Hospitals, schools, transport, residential districts all suffered.” As usual, the “firm reaction” he demanded from the UN security council never came. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, says it’s obvious what Putin wants: “Ukraine without Ukrainians.” More than 7.8 million people have fled as refugees since February, the UN estimates. Millions more are internally displaced. Concern grows about a second exodus. “Right now, across the country, people are facing a grim choice: flee or freeze,” said Jan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council. With temperatures falling as low as -20C (-4F), Ukraine’s health system is “facing its darkest days so far”, the World Health Organization’s regional director, Hans Kluge, warned. “Put simply, this winter will be about survival.” Nato countries have provided generous billions in financial aid and weapons systems to Ukraine. But the pace is slowing. The EU’s latest sanctions package has been repeatedly diluted and delayed. It is bickering over a Russian oil price cap. The west is also struggling to meet Ukraine’s desperate need for anti-missile defences. Stocks of Stinger, S-300, Nasams, Hawk and Starstreak missiles are low. Supplies of more sophisticated systems, such as American Patriots and Germany’s Iris-T, are limited by production and training issues. If the US, Britain and others had heeded Zelenskiy’s pleas last spring for Nato-guaranteed safe havens or some form of defensive no-fly or air exclusion zones, Ukrainians might have been spared today’s missile hell. It’s not too late to act. As the war becomes a familiar fact of daily life, and negative fallout spreads, will public support soften further? Pro-Kyiv sentiment in Europe stands at about 57%, according to a Eupinions poll. But that figure is down on the summer – and the “peace camp” is advancing. For example, 60% of Germans favour diplomacy. In the US, satisfaction over Ukraine’s military successes has led, paradoxically, to complacency – and reduced focus on continuing threats. When Republicans take control in Congress in January, aid may be cut. In Ukraine itself, in contrast, public attitudes are hardening. Pride in the Ukrainian nation and pro-western, pro-EU sentiment have never been stronger – including among ethnic minority Russians. Overall, 89% of respondents in one survey accused Russia of genocide. The Ukrainian people are a formidable force. They have shown they can beat their enemies. But should they fear their friends? A weakening of US and European support, leaving Ukraine out in the cold, is perhaps the most dismaying hazard they face. Putin is counting on it. Might the peoples of the west, for the sake of a quiet life, really get “fed up” with the war to the point where they are ready to ignore or even tolerate mass murder, war crimes and the evisceration of a sovereign nation as the new normal? It’s democracy’s biggest test. Every day, it gets harder in Ukraine. One thing is certain: it’s going to be a long winter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-denies-wagner-claims-of-bakhmut-breakthrough-by-ukraine","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-12T17:49:44Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zelenskiy thanks UK for Storm Shadow missiles; Kremlin denies ground lost in Bakhmut – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-denies-wagner-claims-of-bakhmut-breakthrough-by-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/12/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-denies-wagner-claims-of-bakhmut-breakthrough-by-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zelenskiy thanks UK for Storm Shadow missiles; Kremlin denies ground lost in Bakhmut – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is almost 9pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s stories: In a tweet, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked the British prime minister Rishi Sunak for the provision of long-range cruise missiles. Yesterday, the UK defence secretary Ben Wallace confirmed that the UK would send long-range cruise missiles. Two Russian pilots were killed on Friday when a Russian Mi-28 military helicopter crashed in the annexed peninsula of Crimea, Russian news agencies reported, citing the defence ministry. The defence ministry said it believed the reason for the crash was equipment failure, the TASS news agency reported. Russia’s defence ministry has said some of its troops fell back “to more advantageous defensive positions” near a reservoir north-west of the east Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. The statement on Friday was the first admission by Moscow that Ukraine was successfully recapturing ground around Bakhmut, a largely destroyed city with a prewar population of about 70,000 that Russia has been trying to conquer for more than 10 months. Wagner group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose troops have done the bulk of the fighting in and around Bakhmut, said via his press service that what the defence ministry had described was in fact a “rout” which had seen troops flee. He said Ukraine had been able to completely regain control of a crucial supply road that links Bakhmut with the town of Chasiv Yar and had seized useful higher ground, Reuters reported. Ukraine’s planned counteroffensive to win back territory occupied by Russia has a good chance of success but may bring high casualties if Russia uses its prepared defences well, Czech president and former Nato general Petr Pavel said on Friday. Pavel, 61, said in an interview that Ukraine needs support for Nato and European Union entry but joining either will be a lengthy process, though talks on the EU accession could start this year, Reuters reported. Police in the Russian city of St Petersburg have created an anti-drone unit to detect unmanned drones after a suspected attack on the Kremlin earlier this month, Reuters reports. The unit launched on 9 May during the annual the second world war victory day celebrations on St Petersburg’s Palace Square, the city’s interior ministry said. Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Moscow had never refused the “diplomatic track” to resolving the conflict in Ukraine in a phone call with his South African counterpart, the Kremlin said. Putin said he supported South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s proposal to involve African leaders in talks regarding a peace process for Ukraine, according to the Kremlin’s readout of the call. Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday that Ukrainian forces carried out “offensive operations” on Thursday along the entire line of contact near Soledar, the ministry’s official Zvezda news outlet reported. More than a thousand troops and up to 40 tanks were used in the assault, it said, adding that the attacks were “repulsed”. UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi plans to present an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the UN security council this month, indicating a deal is close, four diplomats have told Reuters. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Grossi has been trying for months to secure an agreement to reduce the risk of a catastrophic nuclear accident from military activity like shelling at Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, which is in Ukraine and has been occupied by Russia for more than a year. A Russian defeat in Ukraine will not derail China’s rise, while relations between Beijing and the EU will be “critically affected” if Xi Jinping does not push Vladimir Putin to withdraw his forces, European ministers have been told. The message comes in a paper drawn up by the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who is meeting the EU’s 27 foreign ministers on Friday in Stockholm to discuss how the bloc should “recalibrate” its policy towards Beijing. Russia’s defence ministry has denied reports that Ukrainian forces had broken through in various places along the frontlines and said the military situation was under control. Moscow was reacting after Russian military bloggers, writing on the Telegram messaging app, reported apparent Ukrainian advances north and south of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, with some suggesting a long-awaited counteroffensive by pro-Kyiv forces had started. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had earlier said the offensive had yet to start. Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, has said that parties to the Black Sea grain initiative are approaching an extension. Akar’s comment was released by his ministry in a statement on Friday, after talks in Istanbul. Ukrainian military analyst Oleksandr Musiyenko says Kyiv’s backers understand that a counteroffensive “may not result in the complete eviction of Russian troops and the definitive defeat of Russia in all occupied areas”. “We have to be ready for the war to continue into next year - or it could end this year,” Musiyenko told Ukrainian NV Radio. “It all depends on how the battles develop. We can’t guarantee how the counter-offensive will develop.” The Russian-imposed mayor of occupied Donetsk has reported on Telegram that one person was killed by Ukrainian shelling of the city overnight. The commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet has said its defences are being tightened amid a flurry of Ukrainian drone strikes targeting its home base, the Crimean port of Sevastopol. V-Adm Viktor Sokolov told Friday’s edition of the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda: “In connection with the threat of attacks by robotic surface and underwater systems, we have increased the technical defences of the fleet’s main base and of the ships’ anchorages”. Sokolov said the Black Sea Fleet, whose flagship, the cruiser Moskva, was sunk by Ukraine in April 2022, would receive four new ships in 2023. China’s foreign ministry has announced that its special representative of Eurasian affairs will visit Ukraine, Poland, France, Germany and Russia from Monday in what it calls “an effort to promote peace talks”, US President Joe Biden and Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez will discuss Ukraine, defence cooperation, and migration on Friday during a meeting at the White House. While Madrid agrees with Washington on the illegality of Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Sánchez will convey the divergent views of China and Brazil and propose giving greater weight to the views of non-Nato nations hurt by the war, a Spanish diplomatic source told Reuters. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the Ukraine war live blog for today. Thanks for following along. UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi plans to present an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the UN security council this month, indicating a deal is close, four diplomats have told Reuters. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Grossi has been trying for months to secure an agreement to reduce the risk of a catastrophic nuclear accident from military activity like shelling at Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, which is in Ukraine and has been occupied by Russia for more than a year. With Ukraine preparing a counteroffensive in the area, there is a risk that fighting near the plant and its six reactors will intensify. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling that has repeatedly downed power lines vital to cooling the reactors and preventing a nuclear meltdown. “It looks promising,” one diplomat said about securing an agreement. Others said Ukraine, which long opposed the plan, now backed it while Russia’s position was less clear. Russia’s defence ministry has said some of its troops fell back “to more advantageous defensive positions” near a reservoir north-west of the east Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. The statement on Friday was the first admission by Moscow that Ukraine was successfully recapturing ground around Bakhmut, a largely destroyed city with a prewar population of about 70,000 that Russia has been trying to conquer for more than 10 months. The Russian defence statement came hours after Kyiv said that its forces had advanced by about 2km (1.2 miles) around Bakhmut this week. Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, said on Friday: “The enemy suffered great losses of manpower. Our defenders advanced 2km in the Bakhmut sector. We did not lose a single position in Bakhmut this week.” It came as Russia’s foreign ministry condemned the UK for supplying Ukraine with the long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles that Kyiv wants to boost its chances in a counteroffensive – the first western country to do so. Ukraine’s planned counteroffensive to win back territory occupied by Russia has a good chance of success but may bring high casualties if Russia uses its prepared defences well, Czech president and former Nato general Petr Pavel said on Friday. Pavel, 61, said in an interview that Ukraine needs support for Nato and European Union entry but joining either will be a lengthy process, though talks on the EU accession could start this year, Reuters reported. Pavel, who was Czech army chief and also the principal military adviser to the Nato secretary-general in 2015-2018, said Ukraine would eventually get western fighter jets it has been calling for but it was impossible to deliver them in time for the upcoming offensive, and there were higher priorities such as ammunition. “There is certainly high hope that the Ukrainian counteroffensive will be successful, because Ukraine is motivated, well prepared, its troops are experienced and certainly do not succumb to such deficiencies as the Russian army,” Pavel said at Prague Castle, the seat of the Czech presidency. The Russian army had severe problems in logistics and morale, but a collapse of defences should not be expected, he said. “Russia has had time to prepare a relatively high-quality and in-depth defence in several lines, which, if used effectively, will cost … Ukraine large casualties,” he said. It was impossible to say what size of territory Ukraine could win back as various scenarios were open, he said. “Things do not always go according to wishes and plans but I think that the chance for a significant Ukrainian success is really high.” White House national security council spokesperson John Kirby said on Friday that the Biden administration has consistently urged countries not to provide weapons for Russia’s war with Ukraine when asked about US allegations that South Africa sent an arms shipment to Russia. Kirby declined to talk specifically on the South Africa issue, but said “it’s a serious issue.” A Russian defeat in Ukraine will not derail China’s rise, while relations between Beijing and the EU will be “critically affected” if Xi Jinping does not push Vladimir Putin to withdraw his forces, European ministers have been told. The message comes in a paper drawn up by the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who is meeting the EU’s 27 foreign ministers on Friday in Stockholm to discuss how the bloc should “recalibrate” its policy towards Beijing. Along with the war in Ukraine, relations with China have become Europe’s most pressing foreign policy issue, but EU politicians take different approaches on how to respond to an increasingly repressive and nationalistic Beijing – revealed in the furore over Emmanuel Macron’s comments about not being drawn into a US-China clash over Taiwan. In a letter to ministers to accompany the paper, Borrell highlights at least three reasons to adjust the EU’s approach: China’s internal changes “with nationalism and ideology on the rise”; the “hardening of US-China competition” in all areas and China’s status as a key regional and global player. Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Moscow had never refused the “diplomatic track” to resolving the conflict in Ukraine in a phone call with his South African counterpart, the Kremlin said. Putin said he supported South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s proposal to involve African leaders in talks regarding a peace process for Ukraine, according to the Kremlin’s readout of the call. He also repeated an offer to deliver Russian grain and fertilisers free of charge to African countries, Reuters reported. It came as South Africa’s foreign ministry summoned the US ambassador over allegations he made that the country had provided arms and ammunition to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Amid the diplomatic fallout, South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, would also speak with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation said in a statement posted on Twitter. The US ambassador, Reuben Brigety, said at a press conference on Thursday that South Africa had loaded weapons and ammunition on to a sanctioned Russian vessel at the Simon’s Town Naval Base near the city of Cape Town in December last year. The arms were then transported to Russia, Brigety said. Two Russian pilots were killed on Friday when a Russian Mi-28 military helicopter crashed in the annexed peninsula of Crimea, Russian news agencies reported, citing the defence ministry. The defence ministry said it believed the reason for the crash was equipment failure, the TASS news agency reported. The crash occurred at 3.42pm local time during a training flight, and the helicopter was flying without weapons, news agencies cited the defence ministry as saying in a statement. An investigation was opened to confirm the cause of the crash, which occurred in the Dzhankoi region of northern Crimea. Wagner group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose troops have done the bulk of the fighting in and around Bakhmut, said via his press service that what the defence ministry had described was in fact a “rout” which had seen troops flee. He said Ukraine had been able to completely regain control of a crucial supply road that links Bakhmut with the town of Chasiv Yar and had seized useful higher ground, Reuters reported. The risk, he said, was that if more ground was lost Ukrainian forces could gradually encircle Bakhmut. Prigozhin, who has been openly feuding with Russia’s defence ministry for months, has repeatedly accused the top brass of sabotaging Wagner’s push for Bakhmut and this week accused them of doing too little to protect Bakhmut’s flanks. The ministry appeared to push back against that assertion on Friday, saying that Ukrainian attempts to counterattack Bakhmut’s flanks were being repelled. Prigozhin complained his men were still not getting enough shells and equipment, but said they were still advancing in Bakhmut and only needed to capture around a further 20 buildings to take full control of the city. Bakhmut, much of which now lies in ruins, has been the focus of fierce fighting for months. In a tweet, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked the British prime minister Rishi Sunak for the provision of long-range cruise missiles. He said: Had a phone call with UK prime minister Rishi Sunak. Thanked for the significant enhancement of our capabilities with long-range Storm Shadow missiles and other irreplaceable military assistance. We discussed further defence cooperation and coordinated our positions on the eve of upcoming international events. In particular, we need clear signals about Ukraine’s future with Nato. Yesterday, the UK defence secretary Ben Wallace confirmed that the UK would send long-range cruise missiles. Zelenskiy is expected to attend the next Nato summit in Vilnius in July, but has repeatedly requested for a firmer time table and more concrete steps for Ukraine to join the alliance. Belgium will use €92m (£81m/$101m) it has received in taxes on frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine, its government said on Friday, Reuters reports. Half of the amount will be used to deliver military goods such as armoured vehicles, weapons and munition. The rest is earmarked for humanitarian support, the future reconstruction of Ukraine and strengthening Belgium’s diplomatic presence in the country, the government said. Rishi Sunak is disappointed that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s request to address the Eurovision song contest was refused, the UK prime minister’s spokesperson said on Friday. Ukraine’s president had requested to make a video appearance during the final on Saturday in Liverpool. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said on Thursday that while Zelenskiy’s request was made with “laudable intentions”, granting it would be against the non-political nature of the event and its rules prohibiting making political statements. “The prime minister believes it would be fitting for President Zelenskiy to address the event and we are disappointed by the decision,” Sunak’s spokesperson said. “The value and freedoms that President Zelenskiy and the people of Ukraine are fighting for are not political, they are fundamental. Eurovision themselves recognised that last year when they rightly suspended Russia’s participation from the competition.” Police in the Russian city of St Petersburg have created an anti-drone unit to detect unmanned drones after a suspected attack on the Kremlin earlier this month, Reuters reports. The unit launched on 9 May during the annual the second world war victory day celebrations on St Petersburg’s Palace Square, the city’s interior ministry said. In a video message, Roman Uvarov, the department’s head, said it will “ensure the protection of public order” during large public events. The unit will include officers armed with snipers and carbines, groups trained to neutralise unmanned drones, and mobile patrols to detain those suspected of operating drones. Two Russian strategic bombers have conducted routine flights over the Chukchi Sea between Siberia and Alaska, the Tass news agency said on Friday. “In the course of the flight, the crews of the long-range aircraft carried out aerial refuelling,” Tass quoted the defence ministry as saying. At a secret location in southern Ukraine, Roman Kostenko watched a drone rise into the sky. It ascended to a height of 100 metres, buzzing above a yellow rapeseed field. The drone dropped a dummy anti-tank grenade on to a pile of tyres. The test worked. That night Kostenko’s team repeated the exercise over occupied territory. Two bombs fell on a Russian armoured fighting vehicle. It blew up, smoke pluming into darkness. Kostenko, a decorated special forces colonel, said his unit had destroyed dozens of Russian military objects. They included tanks and howitzer guns. These operations took place every night on “a tactical level”, he said, close to the frontline. This stretches for 900 miles, from the eastern city of Bakhmut where Ukrainian troops launched a local counterattack this week, to the southern provinces of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. There has been intense speculation that Kyiv is about to launch a major counteroffensive. On Thursday night, Russian military bloggers erroneously reported that it had already started. Speaking earlier the same day, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his forces needed “some more time”. According to Kostenko, Ukraine’s long-anticipated push should be understood as a rolling “spring-summer campaign” against an entrenched and powerful adversary. Kostenko said the campaign was already unfolding in stages. The first saw the step-by-step elimination of Russia’s military potential, with strikes against logistical targets such as weapons depots and fuel dumps. This has begun, he said. A second stage involved seeking out and eliminating Russian command and control centres, causing a breakdown of communications with troops in the field. “That’s already happening too, probably,” he said. Ukraine’s armed forces were unlikely to embark on a major frontal offensive until they had weakened Moscow’s battlefield capability, he indicated. “Our army won’t go forward until this preparation work is done. We can’t win if they have large amounts of ammunition and resources,” he said. He acknowledged that Ukraine was playing a disinformation game about when and where it might strike, with signs that it was working, and that Moscow was beginning to panic. Germany aims to buy 18 Leopard 2 tanks for €525m (£457m) to replace tanks delivered to Ukraine, a defence source told Reuters on Friday. The total price including an option for another 105 tanks will be €2.9bn (£2.5bn) and the German parliament’s budget committee is expected to sign off on the deal at the end of May, the source said. Germany has supplied 18 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine since the Russian invasion last year and has said it intends to plug the gap with new tanks as soon as possible. The Leopard is jointly manufactured by KMW and Rheinmetall. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is “disappointed” in the decision of the European Broadcasting Union, Downing Street has said, after it was reported that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was blocked from addressing Eurovision. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said: The prime minister believes it would be fitting for President Zelenskiy to address the event and we’re disappointed by the decision from the European Broadcasting Union. The values and freedoms that President Zelenskiy and the people of Ukraine are fighting for are not political, they’re fundamental, and Eurovision themselves recognised that last year when they rightly suspended Russia’s participation from the competition. There are no plans to intervene and ask broadcasters to change their mind, Downing Street suggested. The Kremlin said on Friday that a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and the Chinese special envoy Li Hui, who is to tour European countries next week to discuss Ukraine, had not yet been set up. “There is no such meeting in the schedule yet. This will all be worked out through diplomatic channels,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday that Ukrainian forces carried out “offensive operations” on Thursday along the entire line of contact near Soledar, the ministry’s official Zvezda news outlet reported. More than a thousand troops and up to 40 tanks were used in the assault, it said, adding that the attacks were “repulsed”. The Kremlin said on Friday that there was nothing new to report after talks on possible renewal of the Black Sea grain deal in Istanbul, and that a potential conversation between the leaders of Turkey and Russia would not help clinch an agreement, Reuters reports. In one of his regular calls with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that only full implementation of the deal would facilitate its renewal. Russia has repeatedly insisted that western sanctions are impeding its export of agricultural products, and that it is unwilling to extend the deal to allow Ukraine to export grain unless this changes. It cites the disconnection of the Russian Agricultural Bank from the Swift payment system and difficulties in being able to insure export vessels as being among factors that need to be addressed. Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said earlier on Friday that parties to the Black Sea grain pact were nearing a deal to extend it. Russia’s defence ministry has denied reports that Ukrainian forces had broken through in various places along the frontlines and said the military situation was under control. Moscow was reacting after Russian military bloggers, writing on the Telegram messaging app, reported apparent Ukrainian advances north and south of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, with some suggesting a long-awaited counteroffensive by pro-Kyiv forces had started.

While Madrid agrees with Washington on the illegality of Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Sánchez will convey the divergent views of China and Brazil and propose giving greater weight to the views of non-Nato nations hurt by the war, a Spanish diplomatic source told Reuters. US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen met German finance minister Christian Lindner on Friday, to underscore the importance of working together to counter evasion of sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine, the US Treasury has said. The prime ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania said on Friday they are considering speeding up a plan to disconnect the Baltic region’s electricity supply from Russia’s power grid. South Africa did not approve any arms shipment to Russia, the minister who chairs the country’s national conventional arms control committee, Mondli Gungubele, told local radio station 702 on Friday, Reuters reports. The United States envoy to South Africa said on Thursday he was confident that a Russian ship had picked up weapons in South Africa last year, in a possible breach of Pretoria’s declared neutrality in the Ukraine conflict. The ambassador’s assertion saw the rand and South African government bonds sell-off, as currency traders said they were worried that South Africa could now face western sanctions. The South African president Cyril Ramaphosa’s office said on Thursday that his government would open an inquiry led by a retired judge into the allegation that arms had been shipped to Russia. The prime ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania said on Friday they are considering speeding up a plan to disconnect the Baltic region’s electricity supply from Russia’s power grid. “Today we agreed to continue discussions on accelerating as soon as all of our studies are finished,” Reuters reports Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas told a joint news conference with her Latvian and Lithuanian counterparts. “Technical studies, especially on production capacity and energy crisis, will allow us to clarify the details and exact timing of this process,” she added. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, will discuss Ukraine, defence cooperation, and migration on Friday during a meeting at the White House. While Madrid agrees with Washington on the illegality of Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Sánchez will convey the divergent views of China and Brazil and propose giving greater weight to the views of non-Nato nations hurt by the war, a Spanish diplomatic source told Reuters. There isn’t often a huge amount of news available from the occupied areas of Ukraine, but a Reuters reporter has been allowed to speak to people at a temporary accommodation facility in the occupied port city of Berdiansk in Zaporizhzhia region, one of the areas of Ukraine which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex. Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-installed acting governor of occupied Zaporizhzhia has said that the temporary relocation of people – prioritising families with children – was due to increased Ukrainian shelling of 18 settlements near the frontline. The claim has not been independently verified. Three evacuees interviewed by Reuters said they had chosen to be evacuated themselves for security reasons. Two expressed satisfaction with their new conditions. All said they hoped to one day return home. Lyudmila, 22, who said she chose to be evacuated from her home in the town of Kamianka-Dniprovska, said the situation there had sometimes been “difficult” and that shells had landed nearby. “We used to go out and watch. Especially at night, you could see the flashes as they launch. We’ve had shells land nearby and when it landed the entire sky was red,” she said. “People get used to it fast, children get used to it. They stop being afraid.” She said she thought people still remaining in her town were “sitting on suitcases” ready to leave if the situation there became more dangerous. She said she was hoping for peace and that the two sides could find common ground. Holding his family’s small dog in his arms as he spoke, a man who gave his name as Artyom said he chose to be evacuated from the town of Tokmak with his wife and children as a precaution. “We are sure that everything will be fine, but we don’t want to take any risks. When the opportunity arose, we left,” he said. Alyona Trokai, a representative for the Russian Movement for Children and Youth, which is working to help settle the evacuees, said around 2,000 people had arrived at the centre so far. Ukraine has repeatedly complained about Russian authorities relocating Ukrainian citizens. The commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet has said its defences are being tightened amid a flurry of Ukrainian drone strikes targeting its home base, the Crimean port of Sevastopol, an area that the Russian Federation claimed to annex from Ukraine in 2014. Reuters reports V-Adm Viktor Sokolov told Friday’s edition of the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda: “In connection with the threat of attacks by robotic surface and underwater systems, we have increased the technical defences of the fleet’s main base and of the ships’ anchorages.” Sokolov said the Black Sea Fleet, whose flagship, the cruiser Moskva, was sunk by Ukraine in April 2022, would receive four new ships in 2023. Sevastopol has repeatedly been attacked with drones since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, met the German finance minister, Christian Lindner, on Friday, to underscore the importance of working together to counter evasion of sanctions imposed on Russia over its war in Ukraine, the US Treasury has said. “Secretary Yellen expressed appreciation for Germany’s close coordination on the implementation of Russia sanctions and discussed the importance of aligning efforts to counter sanctions evasion,” Reuters reports it said in a statement. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that overnight there have been three explosions recorded in Sumy oblast. No casualties are known. China’s foreign ministry has announced that its special representative of Eurasian affairs will visit Ukraine, Poland, France, Germany and Russia from Monday in what it calls “an effort to promote peace talks”, Reuters reports. Xi Jinping, China’s president, had pledged in a phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart last month that he would send a delegation to the region to help facilitate peace talks. It was the first time the two presidents had spoken since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. In April, a report on Chinese state TV said Xi had told Zelenskiy during their call: “Negotiation is the only viable way out.” Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has issued a combative statement in response to Uzbek and Azerbaijani news websites publishing an article by Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the president of Ukraine. In the course of it, she says: This libeler (he cannot be called anything else) is unable to accept this inconvenient truth: Russia is a friend and defender of anyone who is interested in its friendship and defence, anyone who does not act antagonistically at its doorstep, or attack its citizens, compatriots, culture or history. There are simply no examples to the contrary. The fact that our allies are providing platforms for a high-ranking representative of the Nazi authorities in Ukraine to distort the essence of our relations is certainly baffling. We know that the collective west, not hiding its intentions to inflict damage on Russia, would use anyone, including the post-Soviet countries – not actually considering them valuable partners, but springboards for attacks on our country that still have untapped potential as such. But it is precisely the Nazi essence of the current government in Kyiv, sponsored by the west, that has undermined the foundations of European security. We respect the freedom of the press. However, it is our belief that the information landscape in countries friendly to us cannot be a platform for broadcasting intentionally false and provocative fabrications. Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and during the course of what it terms its “special military operation” it has passed new laws restricting criticism of the war, and jailed journalists. Reuters has a quick snap that Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, has said that parties to the Black Sea grain initiative are approaching an extension. Reuters reports Akar’s comment was released by his ministry in a statement on Friday, after talks in Istanbul. The Russian-imposed mayor of occupied Donetsk has reported on Telegram that one person was killed by Ukrainian shelling of the city overnight. Alexei Kulemzin posted “As a result of the shelling of the Kyivskyi district of Donetsk region, a man of 40-50 years old was killed.” My colleague Archie Bland looks at what a Ukrainian counter-offensive might mean in practice in today’s First Edition newsletter: Ukraine’s greatest success of the war so far came when it successfully fooled Moscow into thinking its September attack would come in the south, and not in the northern Kharkiv region. Surprises over timing and location are the most powerful tool at Ukraine’s disposal as it attempts to regain lost territory, break Russian supply lines, and bolster western support for the long war that likely lies ahead. But it is also extremely difficult to maintain. After the stalemate of winter, Ukraine has talked openly about a planned counteroffensive for months. “We are preparing for it,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in April. “It will happen.” But yesterday, he suggested that despite endless speculation about the timing, his country’s forces were not yet ready. Ukrainian commanders have also said that Kyiv lacks vital weapons for the new push – but there are also reasons to be sceptical. The Economist’s defence editor Shashank Joshi wrote on Twitter that “Of course this is what you’d say if the counter-offensive was about to begin,” appending a shrug emoji. And it is always useful for Ukraine to increase pressure for more western military hardware. “Secrecy is very, very important,” the Guardian’s defence editor Dan Sabbagh said. “It’s essential to the success of what happens next. In Russian, it’s called ‘maskirova’ – the military concept of operational security and secrecy, but also active deception about what to expect. So we don’t know exactly what’s going to happen or when.” With a 900-mile frontline that divides occupied eastern territory roughly the size of Portugal from the rest of Ukraine, there are no shortage of possible sites for the attack. But there is a relatively brief list of options both viable enough and valuable enough to be plausible. “The ‘route one’ option, and the most obvious strategic imperative, is to cut the “land bridge” to Crimea,” Dan said. That would severely hamper supply lines to Russian troops in the rest of Ukraine as well as being a humiliating blow for Putin. “But the obvious counterpoint to that is that the geography is perfectly obvious to the Russians as well. They have been preparing for a possible attack and they are very well dug in.” There are other options available. “They could also try to attack Crimea by crossing the Dnieper River further west,” Dan said. “But the Dnieper is a formidable, wide river that has already hurt the Russians when they were forced to give up Kherson.” Also possible is a counterattack in Bakhmut in the eastern Donbas region, where Russia has the upper hand after long and bitter fighting – but Ukraine made its first significant gains in months this week. Finally, the Ukrainians could seek a breakthrough in the northern province of Luhansk – more sparsely defended, and providing a route to Russian-held cities in the Donbas. But there is less obvious strategic value in that territory. “And it’s quite close to Russia proper, so it would be easier to bring in reinforcements,” Dan added.

Ukraine’s defence ministry has issued some statistics about air attacks on Kyiv. The Ukrainian capital has faced 851 hours and 38 minutes of air alarms (the equivalent of just over 35 days) since 24 February 2022, the ministry said. It also states that “not a single missile or drone has reached its target” for over two months now thanks to air defence efforts. Rodion Miroshnik, formerly the self-styled ambassador to Russia of the Luhansk People’s Republic, has posted on Telegram that “the situation on the frontline in the north-west of the LPR has not changed significantly”. Tass quotes the Russian-imposed official as saying: “According to intelligence and satellite surveillance, there are attempts to concentrate [Ukrainian] armoured forces in the Krasnyi Lyman and Kupiansk directions. But so far they are at a distance from the zone adjacent to the line of contact.” The claims have not been independently verified. Luhansk is one of four partly occupied regions of Ukraine that the Russian Federation has claimed to annex. According to Reuters, Ukrainian military analyst Oleksandr Musiyenko says Kyiv’s backers understand that a counteroffensive “may not result in the complete eviction of Russian troops and the definitive defeat of Russia in all occupied areas.” “We have to be ready for the war to continue into next year - or it could end this year,” Musiyenko told Ukrainian NV Radio. “It all depends on how the battles develop. We can’t guarantee how the counter-offensive will develop.” Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russia’s Wagner private army which has led the fight in Bakhmut, on Thursday said Ukrainian operations were “unfortunately, partially successful”. He called Zelenskiy’s assertion that the counteroffensive had not yet begun “deceptive”. A strong explosion was heard in Melitopol in Zaporizhzhia a short whole ago, according to exiled mayor Ivan Fedorov. Zaporizhzhia is under Russian occupation. “A strong single explosion in Melitopol. Resounded in the very centre of the city,” Federov wrote on Telegram. He did not provide further details. In case you missed this yesterday: Britain has become the first western country to provide Ukraine with the long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles that Kyiv wants to boost its chances in a much-anticipated counteroffensive, prompting a threat from the Kremlin of a military response, the Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh and Luke Harding report. Hours after Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he needed more western weapons to be confident of a victory this summer, Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, told MPs that the missiles – which cost more than £2m each – were “now going in, or are in the country itself”. The gift of the missiles was supported by the US, Wallace added, although previously Washington had declined to give Ukraine long-range missiles of its own, fearing that the outcome could escalate hostilities in the 15-month war. “The use of Storm Shadow will allow Ukraine to push back Russian forces based within Ukrainian sovereign territory,” Wallace told MPs, adding: “Russia must recognise that their actions alone have led to such systems being provided.” Unnamed Kremlin sources say recent statements by Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin is “seriously disturbing the top leadership” in the Kremlin, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest update on the conflict. Citing a report by Russian opposition outlet Meduza, the US thinktank noted that the sources said “Prigozhin may have crossed the Kremlin’s “red lines” and may alienate his supporters within the Russian inner circle”. Russia’s defence ministry has denied reports that Ukrainian forces had broken through in various places along the front lines and said the military situation was under control, according to Reuters. Moscow was reacting after Russian military bloggers, writing on the Telegram messaging app, reported what they said were Ukrainian advances north and south of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, with some suggesting a long-awaited counteroffensive by pro-Kyiv forces had started. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had earlier said the offensive had yet to start. “Statements circulated by individual Telegram channels about ‘defence breakthroughs’ that took place in different areas along the line of military contact do not correspond to reality,” the Russian defence ministry said in a Telegram post. “The overall situation in the area of the special military operation is under control,” it said in a statement, using the Kremlin’s description of the war in Ukraine. The fact the Russian ministry felt obliged to release the statement reflects what Moscow acknowledges is a “very difficult” military operation. Welcome back to our continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. Out top story this morning: Moscow has rejected reports by Russian military bloggers and Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin that Ukrainian forces have broken through Russian frontlines in the devastated city of Bakhmut. “Statements circulated by individual Telegram channels about ‘defence breakthroughs’ that took place in different areas along the line of military contact do not correspond to reality,” the Russian defence ministry said in a Telegram post. “The overall situation in the area of the special military operation is under control,” it said in a statement, using the Kremlin’s description of the war in Ukraine. Elsewhere: Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has confirmed reports that the UK is donating long-range Storm Shadow missiles to Ukraine. Wallace said Ukrainians will have the “best chance to defend themselves”. The US ambassador to South Africa has accused the country of covertly providing arms to Russia – a charge that drew an angry rebuke from Pretoria. Reuben Brigety told a media briefing that the US believed weapons and ammunition had been loaded on to a Russian freighter that docked at a Cape Town naval base in December. “We are confident that weapons were loaded on to that vessel and I would bet my life on the accuracy of that assertion,” Brigety said, according to a video of the remarks. “The arming of Russia by South Africa … is fundamentally unacceptable.” A Ukrainian brigade commander fighting in the ruins of Bakhmut said Russian mercenary forces have stepped up shelling and artillery attacks in recent days and were not facing a munitions shortage, despite its chief’s claims to the contrary. Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin said on Thursday that the situation on the flanks near the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut was unfolding in line with the “worst of all expected scenarios”. Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, confirmed that the army was aware of a possible missile heading towards the country in December but failed to inform the government. Poland has been on alert for possible spillover of weaponry from the war in neighbouring Ukraine, especially since two people were killed near the border last November by what Warsaw concluded was a misfired Ukrainian air defence missile. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the country needs more time to prepare for a much-anticipated spring counteroffensive, saying: “We can go forward and be successful. But we’d lose a lot of people. I think that’s unacceptable. So we need to wait. We still need a bit more time.” Zelenskiy again denied any Ukrainian responsibility for the drone incident over the Kremlin. Russia has accused Washington and Kyiv of masterminding the attack, which it described as an assassination attempt on Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Putin was not in the Kremlin at the time, and no injuries were caused by the drones. A Ukrainian drone attacked an oil storage depot in the Russian border region of Bryansk, the local governor has claimed in a post on his Telegram channel on Thursday. There were no casualties after the attack on the facility near the town of Klintsy, owned by Russia’s Rosneft oil company, though one storage tank was partly damaged, the governor, Alexander Bogomaz, said. Belgorod’s governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, claimed that seven settlements in the Russian region have been left without electricity after Ukrainian shelling over the border."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/01/hinkley-point-b-nuclear-plant-could-be-spared-imminent-closure","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-01T13:04:40Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point B nuclear plant could be spared imminent closure","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/01/hinkley-point-b-nuclear-plant-could-be-spared-imminent-closure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/01/hinkley-point-b-nuclear-plant-could-be-spared-imminent-closure","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point B nuclear plant could be spared imminent closure","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nuclear power advocates believe the energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is open to extending the life of the Hinkley Point B plant to help wean the UK off gas imports and prevent a faster-than-expected decline in Britain’s fleet of atomic reactors. Soaring gas prices and the war in Ukraine have already spurred the government to ask coal power plant owners to stay open longer, while ministers also revisited their staunch opposition to fracking in the light of energy supply concerns. There is a growing feeling in the nuclear industry and its supporters that Kwarteng could also be persuaded to back an extension of up to 18 months to the life of Hinkley Point B, which is due to stop generating electricity this summer. Such a plan, which would chime with Boris Johnson’s backing for new nuclear in the recent energy security plan, would keep 1GW of electricity generation on the National Grid in the short term, replacing the need for gas-fired generation for up to 1.5m homes. The Conservative MP Ian Liddell-Grainger, whose Bridgwater and West Somerset constituency includes Hinkley, said he had spoken to Kwarteng about the possibility and that he was “definitely” open to it. “Kwasi is no fool,” he said. “He understands the stresses and strains we’re going through and that we need to look at everything we can. They are fully aware of what the [Hinkley] B station is capable of. She’s old but she’s in good health.” Hinkley’s owner, EDF Energy, would have to produce a safety case for extending the life of a power station that was hooked up to the grid in 1976 and whose closure was previously postponed by seven years in 2012. EDF would have to prove to the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) that the ageing graphite cores of the plant’s reactors remain in good enough condition that control rods could be inserted, even in the event of a huge and unprecedented earthquake, to prevent a nuclear accident. One nuclear industry source said there was a “six-week window” left, during which EDF could still make that case in time for the ONR to give a verdict on the safety of the plans and postpone the scheduled end to Hinkley generating electricity on 15 July. Greg Hands, a junior minister in Kwarteng’s business and energy department (BEIS), visited Hinkley last week. Engineers there are understood to have told Hands that they expected the plant to shut as scheduled. But the nuclear industry source said that while engineers were naturally focused on shutdown plans they had been working towards for many months, senior figures at EDF were likely to be more open to extending Hinkley’s life. The ONR would ultimately decide on whether such a plan could go ahead but Kwarteng’s approval is crucial. This is because EDF would incur significant costs to put together a safety case for an extension and would need to be confident that ministers would not block it. EDF declined to comment on whether it was planning to do so. BEIS said it had not held any discussions about such a proposal. “It [extending Hinkley] would stop you having to import a chunk of gas,” said the nuclear industry source. The Guardian also understands that Torness, near Dunbar, and Heysham 2 in Lancashire could come off grid earlier than expected, depending on regular assessments of the state of their graphite cores. Their retirement has already been brought forward, with EDF saying earlier this year that they would stop generating in 2028, rather than 2030. In theory, each station that operates for a year can replace more than 1bn cubic metres of gas imports. While nuclear power is traditionally expensive, the sky-high price of gas in recent months, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, means the £45 per megawatt hour that EDF gets from its nuclear contract is significantly below wholesale market power prices. The trade unions Prospect and the GMB have also called for the life of Britain’s nuclear fleet to be extended. Pressure on Kwarteng to signal to EDF that the government would back plans to keep Hinkley Point B open comes against the backdrop of concern that the capacity of Britain’s nuclear fleet could be declining even faster than thought. Based on current projections for the retirement of reactors and the building of new ones, UK nuclear capacity will fall from 5.8GW today to 4.4GW in 2028, factoring in the construction of Hinkley Point C but also the end of life of Torness and Heysham. However, the 2028 completion date for Hinkley Point C, which is already over budget and behind schedule is under review, with a forecast due this summer. • This article was amended on 2 May 2022 to refer correctly to the graphite cores and control rods of reactors, rather than to graphite rods."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-eu-decry-moscows-plan-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-27T17:27:59Z","webTitle":"Defeat would leave Russia brutal and vindictive even if Putin ‘disappeared’, says RAF chief – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-eu-decry-moscows-plan-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-eu-decry-moscows-plan-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","fields":{"headline":"Defeat would leave Russia brutal and vindictive even if Putin ‘disappeared’, says RAF chief – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Preliminary operations have begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of deoccupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines. Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counteroffensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for. Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”. Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported. Defeat in its war against Ukraine would leave Russia “vindictive” and “brutal” and posing a threat to Nato countries, the outgoing head of the RAF said. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told The Telegraph that Russia’s air force, surface navy and submarine force are a threat to Britain and Nato. He warned its threat could even get worse if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was ousted. A construction worker has been killed near the Russian village of Plekhovo, a few kilometres from the border with Ukraine after shelling from the Ukrainian side, said Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region. Works were being carried out not far from Plekhovo on fortifying defensive lines for the state border, the governor said on Telegram. Ukraine struck oil pipeline installations deep inside Russia on Saturday with a series of drone attacks including on a station serving the vast Druzhba oil pipeline that sends western Siberian crude to Europe, according to Russian media. Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia have been growing in intensity in recent weeks, and the New York Times reported that US intelligence believes Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month. Ukraine has asked Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, an air-launched weapon with a range of 500 km (310 miles), a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said on Saturday. Germany received the request several days ago, the spokesperson said, confirming a report by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She declined to provide further details or say how likely it was that Germany would supply the missiles to Ukraine. Russia has dismissed criticism from the US president, Joe Biden, over Moscow’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying Washington had for decades deployed just such nuclear weapons in Europe. Russia said on Thursday it was pushing ahead with the first deployment of such weapons outside its borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the weapons were already on the move. Russia is to start expelling German diplomats, teachers and employees of cultural institutions next month. The measure is expected to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries, which have already had very fraught ties since Russia invaded Ukraine early last year. Russia failed in a bid to prevent Ukraine taking a place on the World Health Organization’s Executive Board, on a day which also saw North Korea gain a berth. Ten countries joined the board for a three-year term but Russia tried to exclude Ukraine, which it invaded 15 months ago, from joining the 34-nation forum at the ongoing World Health Assembly in Geneva. Russia has accused Japan of “cynical, unscrupulous speculation” over Tokyo’s comments around the nuclear threat Moscow poses and promised to respond to Japan’s latest round of sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Friday that Japan would place additional sanctions on Russia after the G7 summit Tokyo hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The death toll from a Russian missile attack on an outpatient clinic in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro has risen to two, with 30 people wounded, according to media reports. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “Russian terrorists once again confirm their status of fighters against everything humane and honest.” Tehran on Saturday accused Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, of anti-Iranian propaganda in his call for Iran to halt the supply of drones to Russia, saying his comments were designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west. Zelenskiy in a video address on Wednesday called on Iranians to stop their slide into “the dark side of history” by supplying Moscow with drones. A Belarus court has rejected an appeal by a jailed Polish-Belarusian journalist against his eight-year prison sentence for reporting critically on president Alexander Lukashenko’s regime. Agence France-Presse reports that Andrzej Poczobut, a correspondent for the leading Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza and active member of the Polish minority in Belarus, was sentenced in February. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, plans to visit Finland, Sweden and Norway from this Monday to deepen cooperation on top national security and economic issues, the US state department has said. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finland has joined Nato, with Sweden’s bid to join awaiting ratification from Hungary and Turkey. A deal allowing the safe export of grain and fertiliser from Ukrainian Black Sea ports has not yet resumed full operations, the UN said on Friday, having come to a halt before Russia’s decision last week to extend it. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has told China’s special envoy Li Hui there are “serious obstacles” to resuming peace talks, blaming Ukraine and western countries. Meanwhile, Russia’s deputy security council chair, Dmitry Medvedev, has said the conflict in Ukraine could last for decades and negotiations with Ukraine were impossible as long as Volodymyr Zelenskiy was in power. The former UK prime minister Boris Johnson and former US president Donald Trump discussed Ukraine and “the vital importance of Ukrainian victory” on Thursday, a spokesperson for Johnson said. Two years ago, Raman Pratasevich, a young Belarusian dissident blogger, was white-knuckled, begging a Ryanair flight crew not to make an emergency landing at Minsk airport, writes Andrew Roth and Shaun Walker. He said: “Don’t do this, they will kill me, I am a refugee,” according to a fellow passenger. The plane, escorted by a Belarusian Mig-29 fighter jet sent to force it down, landed anyway. Pratasevich was promptly arrested. Last week he emerged from custody. The activist and blogger, accused of more than 1,586 crimes, was charged on 10 counts including conspiracy to seize power. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and then promptly pardoned, his reward from Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko for becoming a full-throated mouthpiece of the regime. Ukraine’s ministry of defence has tweeted this video footage. Around 400 Ukrainian soldiers have started training on American M1 Abrams tanks in Germany, the New York Times reported. Half of the group started training in Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels in southern Germany, being taught medical skills and how to shoot firearms. The other half were taught how to fuel and maintain the tanks. Around 31 tanks were due to be sent to Germany to be used in the training programme, which is expected to last 10 to 12 weeks, according to the newspaper. A 73-year-old woman has died and two others have been injured after Russian troops shelled 16 areas in Zaporizhzhia, a local Ukrainian governor said. Yurii Malashko reported that Russia had launched 108 attacks against the southeastern city in one day using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, and drones. Malashko wrote on the Telegram messaging app: “The enemy will be held accountable for every war crime, for every broken fate and life that has been cut short. Ukrainians are strong and unbreakable, Victory is ours.” The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 6pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s headlines: Preliminary operations have begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of deoccupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines.

Zelenskiy in a video address on Wednesday called on Iranians to stop their slide into “the dark side of history” by supplying Moscow with drones. A Belarus court has rejected an appeal by a jailed Polish-Belarusian journalist against his eight-year prison sentence for reporting critically on president Alexander Lukashenko’s regime. Agence France-Presse reports that Andrzej Poczobut, a correspondent for the leading Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza and active member of the Polish minority in Belarus, was sentenced in February. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, plans to visit Finland, Sweden and Norway from this Monday to deepen cooperation on top national security and economic issues, the US state department has said. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finland has joined Nato, with Sweden’s bid to join awaiting ratification from Hungary and Turkey. A deal allowing the safe export of grain and fertiliser from Ukrainian Black Sea ports has not yet resumed full operations, the UN said on Friday, having come to a halt before Russia’s decision last week to extend it. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has told China’s special envoy Li Hui there are “serious obstacles” to resuming peace talks, blaming Ukraine and western countries. Meanwhile, Russia’s deputy security council chair, Dmitry Medvedev, has said the conflict in Ukraine could last for decades and negotiations with Ukraine were impossible as long as Volodymyr Zelenskiy was in power. The former UK prime minister Boris Johnson and former US president Donald Trump discussed Ukraine and “the vital importance of Ukrainian victory” on Thursday, a spokesperson for Johnson said. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Nadeem Badshah will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Russia failed in a bid to prevent Ukraine taking a place on the World Health Organization’s Executive Board, on a day which also saw North Korea gain a berth. Ten countries joined the board for a three-year term but Russia tried to exclude Ukraine, which it invaded 15 months ago, from joining the 34-nation forum at the ongoing World Health Assembly in Geneva. Normally those joining the forum, which plays a key role in the governance of the WHO, are elected on the nod but Moscow forced the first vote since 1977 at this year’s 76th assembly. In the event, the vote was easily carried by 123 votes to 13. Russia’s delegation stated: “We deeply regret the fact that the assembly has voted for a country that will simply further politicise the work of the EB,” saying it opposed “politicisation of the work of the WHA and of the WHO as a whole.” There was further acrimony at the gathering after the United States said it regretted the extension of a place for North Korea after it was put forward by South East Asia. Ukraine struck oil pipeline installations deep inside Russia on Saturday with a series of drone attacks including on a station serving the vast Druzhba oil pipeline that sends western Siberian crude to Europe, according to Russian media. Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia have been growing in intensity in recent weeks, and the New York Times reported that US intelligence believes Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month. Ukraine has not publicly acknowledged launching attacks against targets inside Russia. The Ukrainian defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday, Reuters reported. In the Tver region, which lies just north-west of Moscow, two drones attacked a station that serves the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline, one of the world’s largest oil pipelines, the Kommersant newspaper said. The Tver local council said that a drone had crashed near the village of Erokhino, about 500 km (310 miles) from the border with Ukraine. The Telegram channel Baza, which has good sources among Russia’s security services, said the drones attacked a station serving the Druzhba pipeline. Preliminary operations have already begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of de-occupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines. “The intensity is increasing, but it will take quite a long period of time,” he added, predicting that as the counteroffensive gathered momentum, there would be more incursions into Russia by Russian rebel groups, such as the raid in Belgorod region earlier this week. On Saturday the commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, raised expectations that a major operation could be imminent by declaring on social media: “The time has come to take back what’s ours.” Zaluzhnyi’s declaration on the Telegram messaging app was accompanied by a cinematic video showing heavily armed Ukrainian soldiers preparing for battle to a soundtrack of ominous music and a narrator reciting a prayer calling for strength to “annihilate” Ukraine’s enemies. Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported. More on the expulsion of German diplomats from Russia (see 12:53pm). Germany has said more than 100 employees will be withdrawn after Moscow imposed limits on the numbers allowed to work at diplomatic missions in Russia, a source with the German foreign ministry said on Saturday. “This limit, set by Russia for the beginning of June, requires a major cut in all areas of our presence in Russia,” the source said, Reuters reports. Those affected included teachers, as well as other employees of schools and the Goethe Institute, and was necessary to maintain the right balance for Germany’s diplomatic presence, said the person, who described the number affected as at least 100. Relations between Russia and Germany, which used to be the biggest buyer of Russian oil and gas, have broken down since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the west responded with sanctions and weapons supplies. The source called the limit, announced in April, “unilateral, unjustified and incomprehensible”. The person declined to say what the limit imposed by Moscow was. The number of German employees leaving was earlier reported by Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung. Russia’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russia is to start expelling German diplomats, teachers and employees of cultural institutions next month. The measure is expected to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries, which have already had very fraught ties since Russia invaded Ukraine early last year. The German foreign ministry criticised Russia’s move, calling it an “unilateral, unjustified and incomprehensible decision”. The expulsions will affect several hundred German state employees, including teachers and staff of the Goethe Institute, which promotes German culture and language abroad, the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported. It comes in response to the reduction of the presence of Russian intelligence services in Germany earlier this year. A construction worker has been killed near the Russian village of Plekhovo, a few kilometres from the border with Ukraine after shelling from the Ukrainian side, said Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region. Works were being carried out not far from Plekhovo on fortifying defensive lines for the state border, the governor said on Telegram. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Russia has accused Japan of “cynical, unscrupulous speculation” over Tokyo’s comments around the nuclear threat Moscow poses and promised to respond to Japan’s latest round of sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Friday that Japan would place additional sanctions on Russia after the G7 summit Tokyo hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Matsuno also condemned Russia’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying it would further inflame the situation and that Japan would never accept “Russia’s nuclear menace, let alone its use”. Russia’s foreign ministry said it was assessing the implementation of Japan’s sanctions on its national security and economy and would not leave Tokyo’s “illegitimate actions” unanswered, Reuters reported. The ministry also took issue with Matsuno’s casting of Russia as engaging in “nuclear blackmail”. Defeat in its war against Ukraine would leave Russia “vindictive” and “brutal” and posing a threat to Nato countries, the outgoing head of the RAF said. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told The Telegraph that Russia’s air force, surface navy and submarine force are a threat to Britain and Nato. He warned its threat could even get worse if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was ousted. He said: When the Ukraine conflict is over and Ukraine has restored its borders, as it must, we will have a damaged, vindictive, and brutal Russia, whose means of harming us is through air attack, missile attack and subsurface attack. Sir Mike is set to step down next month after four years at the top of the RAF. He added: But it also demonstrates that this is more than about just one person. There is a whole structure and a hierarchy behind Putin. So even if Putin was to disappear off the stage, there are countless others that could replace him that could be as equally as brutal and vicious to their own people and to neighbouring states. Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”. “Yesterday and today there have not been any active battles – neither in the city nor on the flanks,” she wrote, adding that Moscow’s troops were instead shelling the outskirts and approaches to Bakhmut. “The decrease in the enemy’s offensive activity is due to the fact that troops are being replaced and regrouped,” Maliar said. “The enemy is trying to strengthen its own capabilities.” She added that Ukrainian troops “firmly hold” the heights overlooking Bakhmut from the north and south, as well as a portion of the outskirts, but have not advanced during the past two days to focus on “other tasks”. Ukraine has asked Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, an air-launched weapon with a range of 500 km (310 miles), a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said on Saturday. Germany received the request several days ago, the spokesperson said, confirming a report by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She declined to provide further details or say how likely it was that Germany would supply the missiles to Ukraine. If it supplied the missiles, Germany would be following in the footsteps of Britain, which earlier in May became the first country to publicly provide Kyiv with long-range cruise missiles. The United States has so far declined to supply Ukraine with the 297-km range Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles amid concerns that Ukraine could use them to strike inside Russia’s internationally recognised borders. Ukraine has been asking for months for these kind of weapons, but support from western allies has focused on shorter-range weapons Russia has dismissed criticism from the US president, Joe Biden, over Moscow’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying Washington had for decades deployed just such nuclear weapons in Europe. Russia said on Thursday it was pushing ahead with the first deployment of such weapons outside its borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the weapons were already on the move. Biden said on Friday he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has moved ahead with a plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reported. The US state department denounced the Russian nuclear deployment plan. “It is the sovereign right of Russia and Belarus to ensure their security by means we deem necessary amid of a large-scale hybrid war unleashed by Washington against us,” Russia’s embassy in the United States said in a statement. “The measures we undertake are fully consistent with our international legal obligations.” The US has said the world faces the gravest nuclear danger since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis because of remarks by Vladimir Putin during the Ukraine conflict, but Moscow says its position has been misinterpreted. Tehran on Saturday accused Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy of anti-Iranian propaganda in his call for Iran to halt the supply of drones to Russia, saying his comments were designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west. Zelenskiy in a video address on Wednesday called on Iranians to stop their slide into “the dark side of history” by supplying Moscow with drones. Iran initially denied supplying Shahed drones to Russia but later said it had provided a small number before the conflict began. Ukraine says the drones have played a major role in Russia’s attacks on cities and infrastructure. “The Ukrainian president’s repeat of delusional claims against the Islamic Republic of Iran is in line with the anti-Iranian propaganda and media war aimed at attracting as many arms and financial aid as possible from western countries,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said in a statement carried by Iranian media. Ukraine, Kanaani said, has been refusing to allow an independent investigation into these claims. A Belarus court has rejected an appeal by a jailed Polish-Belarusian journalist against his eight-year prison sentence for reporting critically on president Alexander Lukashenko’s regime. Agence France-Presse reports that Andrzej Poczobut, a correspondent for the leading Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza and active member of the Polish minority in Belarus, was sentenced in February. He had extensively reported on mass protests against Lukashenko and refused to leave the Moscow-allied country after authorities unleashed an historic crackdown on dissent. Belarus’s supreme court said in a statement that the sentence was “left unchanged”. The verdict has come into force. Poczobut, 50, who stood trial in his home city of Grodno, near the Polish border, was found guilty of taking part in “actions harming national security” and “inciting hatred”. Poland, Belarus’s western EU-member neighbour, has condemned the trial and called for his release. After Poczobut’s appeal was rejected, Warsaw said it would impose new punitive measures against Lukashenko’s regime next week. The Polish interior minister, Mariusz Kaminski, said on Twitter: On Monday, I will announce the decision to add to the sanctions list several hundred representatives of the Lukashenko regime responsible for political repression, including repression against Poles living in Belarus. Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counter-offensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for. Reuters reports that the Ukrainian defence ministry’s intelligence directorate said Russian forces would soon shell the plant and then announce a radiation leak. This would force an investigation by international authorities, during which all hostilities would be stopped. The directorate’s statement, posted on Telegram, did not provide any proof. It said Russia had disrupted the planned rotation of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, who are based at the plant. The agency, which frequently posts updates on the plant, has made no mention of any disruption. Last week witnesses said Russian military forces had been enhancing defensive positions in and around the plant ahead of the counter-offensive. Ukraine is ready to launch its much-anticipated counteroffensive against Russian forces, a senior Ukrainian official has told the BBC. The broadcaster reported that Oleksiy Danilov would not name a date but said an assault to retake territory from President Vladimir Putin’s occupying forces could begin “tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or in a week”. He said Kyiv had “no right to make a mistake” on the decision because it was an “historic opportunity” that “we cannot lose”. As secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Danilov is at the heart of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s de facto war cabinet. Danilov also told the BBC he was “absolutely calm” about Russia beginning to deploy nuclear weapons to Belarus, saying: “To us, it’s not some kind of news.” The Wagner mercenary group’s forces have probably begun to withdraw from some of their positions around the devastated Ukrainian city of Bakhmut and are likely to be used for other offensive operations in the Donbas region, according to British intelligence. The UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update that Wagner’s owner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, had said the withdrawal had begun and positions were being transferred to Russian defence ministry forces. Kyiv corroborated Wagner’s rotation out from the city’s outskirts. The UK ministry said in its update, posted on Twitter, that forces of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic had probably entered the eastern Ukrainian city since Wednesday to start “clearance operations”. Bakhmut has been the scene of the war’s longest and bloodiest battle. The ministry said: Ukrainian forces had taken 20 square kilometres of Bakhmut’s flanks as of 16 May. The rotation out of Wagner forces is likely to continue in controlled phases to prevent collapse in pockets around Bakhmut. Despite Prigozhin’s ongoing feud with the Russian MOD [ministry of defence], Wagner forces will likely be used for further offensive operations in the Donbas following reconstituting its forces. US president Joe Biden has said he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has moved ahead with its plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, while the European Union has condemned the plan. Reuters reports that the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said: This is a step which will lead to further extremely dangerous escalation. Russia signed a pact with Belarus on Thursday about the storage of the warheads, at a facility due to be finished in just over a month. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said later that the relocation of some of the weapons had already begun. Borrell said the agreement contravened multiple international agreements. We call on Russia to abide by these commitments. The Belarusian regime is an accomplice in Russia’s illegal and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. Borrell said any attempt “to further escalate the situation will be met by a strong and coordinated reaction”. Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. This is Adam Fulton and here’s an overview of the latest. The European Union has condemned Russia’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in neighbouring Belarus, while US president Joe Biden says he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has already begun moving ahead with the plan. More on that story soon. In other news: The death toll from a Russian missile attack on an outpatient clinic in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro has risen to two, with 30 people wounded, according to media reports.

The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said in a phone call with his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, that Russia is open to dialogue over Ukraine. Lula tweeted that he had reiterated Brazil’s willingness to talk to both sides of the war in Ukraine but declined Putin’s invitation to visit. Russia has blamed Kyiv for dozens of strikes on its southern Belgorod region. Its governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said the Ukrainian military was responsible for artillery, mortar and drone attacks across the region over 24 hours but reported no casualties. In a rare attack on the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, east of Crimea, two drones damaged buildings in the city centre, officials said. In the neighbouring Rostov region, the governor said a Ukrainian missile had been shot down near Morozovsk, where there is a Russian airbase. Canada will donate 43 AIM-9 missiles to Ukraine to help the country “secure its skies”, the national defence has said. “Canada’s support for Ukraine is unwavering,” said Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. The country also said it welcomed Ukraine’s application to join the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership (CPTPP). Moscow’s city court will hold a preliminary hearing next Wednesday in a new criminal case against the jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on charges including incitement to extremism. The Russian arms company Kalashnikov, maker of the world’s most widely used assault rifle, is launching a division for the production of kamikaze drones – a key weapon used in the Ukraine war. Ukraine said it shot down 10 missiles and 25 drones launched by Russia in overnight attacks on the capital of Kyiv, the city of Dnipro and eastern regions. Several drones and missiles hit targets in the Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, officials said on Friday. There was no immediate word of any deaths. The city of Donetsk has come under fire from Ukrainian forces, the Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said. As a result, he said, a young woman died and another was injured. Japan will place additional sanctions on Russia after the Group of Seven (G7) summit the country hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, has said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/13/russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-region-hit-by-drone-strikes-putin-to-meet-turkish-president-erdogan-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-13T17:53:49Z","webTitle":"Russian forces will be ‘annihilated’ if Putin uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine, says senior EU official – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/13/russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-region-hit-by-drone-strikes-putin-to-meet-turkish-president-erdogan-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/13/russia-ukraine-war-kyiv-region-hit-by-drone-strikes-putin-to-meet-turkish-president-erdogan-live","fields":{"headline":"Russian forces will be ‘annihilated’ if Putin uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine, says senior EU official – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is coming up to 9pm in Kyiv. That’s it from me, Joe Middleton, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog for today. Here is a round-up of everything you might have missed: The EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Moscow that its forces would be “annihilated” by the west’s military response if president Vladimir Putin used nuclear weapons against Ukraine, AFP reports. At the opening of the Diplomacy Academy in Brussels, Borrell said: “Any nuclear attack against Ukraine will create an answer, not a nuclear answer but such a powerful answer from the military side that the Russian army will be annihilated.” The Nato chief, Jens Stoltenberg, also said Russia faced “severe consequences” if it launched a nuclear assault on Ukraine. After retreating about 20km in the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely to be attempting to consolidate a new frontline west from the village of Mylove, according to British intelligence. Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end, where Ukrainian advances mean Russia’s flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, Volodymyr Saldo, has urged residents to leave the area and asked Russia to help evacuate people. Just hours later Russia confirmed it would evacuate residents from Kherson. The Russian deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin said on state television: “The government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country. We will provide everyone with free accommodation and everything necessary.” Ukraine’s state emergency service said a 12-year-old boy had been rescued after hours under rubble, after rockets hit a five-story residential building in Mykolaiv. Ukraine’s power grid has been “stabilised” after Russian strikes on the country that in particular targeted energy infrastructure, causing power and hot water cuts, the national energy operator Ukrenergo said Thursday. A residential building in the southern Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border was hit Thursday in shelling by Kyiv’s forces, the city governor said today. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, denied Kyiv’s military was responsible and said Russia had tried to shell Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv on the border “but something went wrong”. Russia said it had summoned diplomats from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Moscow and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. “Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,” the foreign ministry said. Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, did not discuss ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine at their bilateral meeting on Thursday, the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. The UN general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine as 35 nations abstained including China, India, South Africa and Pakistan. The resolution “condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine“ and “the attempted illegal annexation” announced last month of four regions by Russia president Vladimir Putin. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, told Russian television Thursday that the vote was anti-Russian and that the west had used methods of diplomatic terrorism against developing countries in order to force them to vote. He dismissed US claims that Washington did not persuade anyone to vote. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukraine currently had only 10% of what it needed in terms of air defences. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said that Russia would run out of supplies and armaments before the west did. He said procurement processes were in place among allies in the west that would ensure that the international community could continue arming Ukraine for years ahead. The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told Russian state Tass news agency in an interview on Thursday. Daniel Boffey reports for us from Kyiv: Moscow has announced it will evacuate Kherson after an appeal from the Russian-installed head of the region, raising fears the occupied city at the heart of the south Ukrainian oblast will become a new frontline. Marat Khusnullin, a Russian deputy prime minister, told state television on Thursday that residents would be helped to move away from the region in south Ukraine, which remains only partly occupied by invading troops due to a successful Ukrainian counterattack in recent months. “The government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country,” Khusnullin said. The development followed a public request on the social media platform Telegram by Volodymyr Saldo, a former mayor of the port city, who was installed in April by the Russian forces as head of the wider Kherson region. Read more: Russia announces Kherson evacuation, raising fears city will become frontline Simon Smith is chair of the steering committee of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House, and they write for us to argue that Putin’s latest campaign stems from desperation: The Russian missile strikes on Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine over the past two days have opened a further deplorable chapter in Russia’s aggression against the country. Yet we need to resist seeing it as a shocking new moment in Russia’s assault. Each additional death brings new personal tragedy and heartbreak. But, in many respects, the wrecking of civilian lives and infrastructure is not new. It’s what millions of Ukrainians have been bravely living with for months. These strikes – and those that may well follow – are more of the same: entirely in line with the vindictiveness and indifference to civilian suffering with which Ukrainians have become familiar over eight years under Russian attack. Read more here: First ‘Nazis’, now ‘terrorists’: Putin’s latest campaign stems from desperation Andriy Yermak, the head of the Office of the Ukrainian Presidency, has tweeted a picture and footage of 20 newly-released prisoners of war. As we reported earlier, Ukraine and Russia said 20 soldiers on both sides had been released as part of a prisoner exchange, 40 soldiers in all. In a follow-up post, Yermak said that 14 of the returned soldiers were from the Ukrainian armed forces, four were from the territorial defence forces, one from the national guard and one from the navy. Russia said today it will evacuate residents from the occupied Ukrainian region of Kherson after a plea from a Kremlin-backed official, AFP reports. The Russian deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin said on state television: The government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country. We will provide everyone with free accommodation and everything necessary. As we reported earlier Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed head of the Kherson administration, posted a video on Telegram urging people to leave the region due to missile attacks. He directly addressed Russian authorities and asked them to “help organise this work.” The plea is a possible sign that Ukraine’s counteroffensive is continuing to make inroads in the south of the country. It comes just a day after Kyiv said it had retaken five settlements in Kherson. Kherson is one of the four regions in Ukraine that Moscow recently claimed to have annexed. Young Ukrainians from Kyiv are organising “repair together” weekends to help villages devastated by Russian occupation by cleaning up and rebuilding homes for free. Tetiana Burianova was traveling in Peru when the war broke out and rushed back to Ukraine to help out in any way she could. With her friends, she began collecting donations and organising repair events that now attract hundreds of young people from cities each weekend. The Guardian’s Christopher Cherry reports from a liberated village where he meets locals finding it impossible to forgive a brutal occupation, and volunteers determined to build a better Ukraine amid the ruin. Maksym Kozytsky, the head of the regional military administration in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, said today that Russia launched six rockets in the region. He said that Ukraine’s air defence forces shot down four of them, but two of the rockets hit a target. Kozytsky did not specify what was struck by the bombardment or if there were any casualties. In a post on his Twitter and Telegram accounts, he said: Today, the enemy launched 6 rockets on the territory of Lviv region. Unfortunately, there are two hits. Four rockets were shot down by soldiers of the “Zahid” PvK. Thanks to our air defence for the highly professional work. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Moscow today that its forces would be “annihilated” by the west’s military response if president Vladimir Putin uses nuclear weapons against Ukraine, AFP reports. At the opening of the Diplomacy Academy in Brussels, Borrell said: Putin is saying he is not bluffing. Well, he cannot afford bluffing, and it has to be clear that the people supporting Ukraine and the European Union and the member states, and the United States and Nato are not bluffing neither. Any nuclear attack against Ukraine will create an answer, not a nuclear answer but such a powerful answer from the military side that the Russian Army will be annihilated. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg also said Russia faces “severe consequences” if it launches a nuclear assault on Ukraine. However the alliance has stopped short of threatening to use its nuclear arsenal to respond as non-member Ukraine is not covered by its self-defence clause. After retreating around 20km in the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely attempting to consolidate a new front line west from the village of Mylove, according to British intelligence. Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end where Ukrainian advances mean Russia’s flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, has urged residents to leave the area and asked Russia to help evacuate people.

Ukraine and Russia say 20 soldiers on both sides have been released as part of a prisoner exchange, 40 soldiers in all, Associated Press reports. The Russian defence ministry said: As a result of the negotiation process on the exchange today, 20 Russian servicemen were returned from the territory of Ukraine controlled by the Kyiv regime. Ukraine also said its 20 soldiers have been freed from captivity in Olenivka, in the occupied territories of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. They are now undergoing medical checkups. The head of the Ukrainian president’s office, Andriy Yermak, vowed on Telegram: We will bring everyone back. Philip Oltermann reports for us in Berlin: Europe’s largest economy is still a “teenager” when it comes to foreign security policy, the German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s chief of staff has said, asking for patience from western allies urging Germany to take a more proactive leadership in its support of Ukraine. “We are getting into a situation that Americans have known for decades: people want us to lead,” said Wolfgang Schmidt, a longstanding ally of Scholz who also serves as the political point of contact for the country’s intelligence agencies. “We are in the teenager years in that role,” he said, responding to criticism that Berlin has been slow to live up to the Zeitenwende or “epochal turn” on military and foreign policy Scholz had declared in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Earlier we reported that Moscow had summoned the ambassadors from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Russia and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures on the Nord Stream gas pipelines [see 10.52am]. The Reuters news agency is now carrying a statement from the Danish foreign ministry which says “the Russian wish to participate in the investigation of the Nord Stream leaks has been brought up through diplomatic channels in Moscow and Copenhagen.” However, Sweden’s foreign ministry appears to have told the media that it has not received any summons. At the same time, the Russian president’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said, according to reports from Russian agency Interfax, that arrests have been made after an attempt to attack the TurkStream pipeline: Some forces, Putin gave hints about the possible origin of these forces, they encroached on the TurkStream as well. Saboteurs were taken, several people were arrested. They wanted to blow it up. On our territory, on land. The TurkStream pipeline runs from near Anapa in Krasnodar Krai to Kıyıköy in north-western Turkey. Interfax reports that earlier in October, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said that Ukrainian authorities were trying to undermine a section of the pipeline. Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, has posted images of a visit to the city by Harjit Sajjan, who is Canada’s minister for international development. Lviv was one of the cities whose electrical infrastructure was attacked by Russia earlier in the week. The Moscow-installed head of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region has urged residents to leave the area and asked Russia to help evacuate people, Agence France-Presse reports. In a video posted to Telegram, Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed head of the Kherson administration, said: We suggested to all people of the Kherson region to, if they wish, leave to other regions to protect themselves from missile hits. In addressing the leadership of the country [Russia], I ask you to help organise this work. He added: We, the people of the Kherson region, know that Russia does not abandon its own. Saldo said the region was being hit by an increasing amount of rocket attacks bringing “serious damage”, in signs that Ukraine’s counteroffensive was continuing to made progress. His warning comes just a day after Kyiv said it had retaken five settlements in the Kherson region. Kherson is one of the four regions in Ukraine that Moscow recently claimed to have annexed. Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, did not discuss ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine at their bilateral meeting today, the state-run RIA news agency reported, citing the Kremlin. “The topic of a Russian-Ukrainian settlement was not discussed,” RIA cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying. A residential building in the southern Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border was hit today in shelling by Kyiv’s forces, the city governor said today. Agence France-Presse reports that the Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement on Telegram: The Ukrainian armed forces shelled Belgorod. There is damage at a residential apartment building on Gubkin street. Information about the victims is being detailed. Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, denied Kyiv’s military was responsible and said Russia had tried to shell Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv on the border “but something went wrong”. Gladkov added that shelling by Ukraine’s forces had landed near school grounds in a village called Krasnoye outside the main city of Belgorod, with students learning online from home. No one was reported injured or killed. Attending a Nato meeting, the UK’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said there was no risk that western allies would run out of arms supplies to aid Ukraine against Russia. “The UK-Danish joint-led international fund is all about placing orders in a manufacturing space to make sure that we can go on between 2023, 24, and keep going on,” Wallace said today. He added that the UK would provide Ukraine with air defence systems that would complement US-provided systems. Ukraine faced a barrage of missile strikes earlier this week, damaging civilian infrastructure and knocking out electricity supplies in some cities AFP reports that Ukraine‘s power grid has been “stabilised” after Russian strikes on the country that in particular targeted energy infrastructure, causing power and hot water cuts, the national energy operator Ukrenergo said today. The head of Ukrenergo, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, said on Facebook: The introduction of scheduled emergency blackouts is currently not being planned ... This became possible, first of all, thanks to the fact that Ukrenergo and Oblenergo experts stabilised the energy supply in all regions of Ukraine. We withstood what was probably the largest missile attack on energy infrastructure in history. Whether there will be [supply] restrictions in the future depends primarily on whether there will be new shelling and destruction. Russia has blitzed Ukraine with missiles this week, in attacks that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said were retaliation for a deadly explosion at a Crimea bridge. As we previously reported, Ukrainian officials said that 40 towns and cities in the country had been targeted by Russian forces in the past 24 hours. As well as Putin’s idea for a gas hub, detailed in the post below this one, the Russian president and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, also discussed nuclear power. Meeting Putin at the start of a regional summit in Kazakhstan, Erdoğan mentioned Russia’s construction of Turkey’s first nuclear power plant, which Ankara hopes to open next year, AFP reports. Erdoğan raised the idea of Russia building a second nuclear power plant in northern Turkey. The Turkish president also defended Ankara’s booming trade ties with Moscow. The US and the EU are piling pressure on Turkey to comply with sanctions they imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. But Erdoğan has refused, offering the Nato member Turkey as a neutral venue for possible truce talks, and approving a range of agreements that have seen the value of exports to Russia more than double in recent months. Russian president Vladimir Putin floated the idea of a major gas hub in Turkey during talks with his counterpart Recep Tayip Erdoğan today. Putin told Erdoğan at a meeting in Kazakhstan: Turkey has turned out to be the most reliable route for deliveries today, even to Europe. We could consider the possibility of creating a gas hub in Turkey for supplies to other countries. The Russian president added: In the course of the work of this hub, which we could create together, of course, it would also be a platform not only for supplies, but also for determining the price, because this is a very important issue - the issue of pricing. Today, these prices are sky-high; we could easily regulate at a normal market level, without any political overtones. Putin suggested on Wednesday that Russia could create a major gas hub in Turkey by redirecting supplies intended for the damaged Nord Stream undersea pipelines, reports Reuters. Swedish and Danish authorities are investigating the blasts as acts of sabotage but have not yet said who they believe was responsible. In the televised exchange between the two leaders, Erdoğan did not comment on the gas hub idea. This graphic shows the location of the Russian missiles that struck 40 Ukrainian towns and cities today, according to officials. Ukraine‘s Armed Forces General Staff said that in the past 24 hours more than 40 settlements were hit by Russian shelling. In response Ukraine‘s air force carried out 32 strikes on 25 Russian targets. The mayor of the port city of Mykolaiv, Oleksandr Senkevich, said in a social media post that the southern city was “massively shelled”, reports Reuters. Young Ukrainians from Kyiv are organising ‘Repair Together’ weekends to help poor villages devastated by Russian occupation by cleaning up and rebuilding homes for free. Tetiana Burianova was traveling in Peru when war broke out, and rushed back to Ukraine to help out in any way she could. With her friends, she began collecting donations and organising repair events that now attract hundreds of young people from cities each weekend. The Guardian’s Christopher Cherry reports from a liberated village where he meets locals finding it impossible to forgive a brutal occupation, and volunteers determined to build a better Ukraine amid the ruin. Estonia has confirmed a new military aid package for Ukraine that will include winter gear, equipment and ammunition. Prime minister Kaja Kallas confirmed the additional support in a tweet today. Kallas added: Let us all speed up our help, so Ukrainians can free their territories. This is the way to peace. Estonia, who share a border with Russia, have already provided Kyiv with more than €220 million (£192,479,486) in military assistance and have called for richer Western nations to increase weapons supplies to the country. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, have started talks in Astana, Kazakhstan. The duo are in the country for the the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia. The meeting is taking place on the sidelines of the regional summit, and the Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov previously suggested the Erdoğan could propose ideas for peace. Philip Oltermann reports for us from Berlin: The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has accused Vladimir Putin of waging “a crusade against our way of life”, in a shift of rhetoric days after heavy Russian missile strikes hit major Ukrainian cities. “They consider their war against Ukraine to be part of a larger crusade,” Scholz said in a video address to a summit of European socialist, liberal and green politicians and thinkers in Berlin. “A crusade against liberal democracy, a crusade against the rules-based international order, a crusade against freedom and progress, a crusade against our way of life,” he added. Read more: Putin’s war on Ukraine part of crusade against liberal democracy, says Scholz Ukraine’s state emergency service has said it is actively searching for people trapped under rubble after a Russian strike on Mykolaiv. In a statement on Thursday, it said: “Rockets hit a five-storey residential building. As a result, the two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest – under rubble.” A 12-year-old boy has been rescued from the site but there are thought to be at least seven others trapped. After retreating around 20km to the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely to be attempting to consolidate a new frontline west from the village of Mylove, according to British intelligence. Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end where Ukrainian advances mean Russia’s flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. Russia said it had summoned diplomats from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Moscow and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. “Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,” the foreign ministry said. The UN general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine, as 35 countries abstained, including China, India, South Africa and Pakistan. The resolution “condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine” and “the attempted illegal annexation” announced last month of four regions by Vladimir Putin. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, told Russian television on Thursday that the vote was anti-Russian and the west had used methods of diplomatic terrorism against developing countries to force them to vote. He dismissed US claims that Washington did not persuade anyone to vote. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukraine had only 10% of what it needed in terms of air defences. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said Russia would run out of supplies and armaments before the west. He said procurement processes were in place among allies in the west to ensure the international community would be able to continue arming Ukraine for years to come. The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told Tass, the Russian state news agency, in an interview on Thursday. Turkey’s aim is to stop the bloodshed in the Russia-Ukraine war as soon as possible despite hurdles, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told a regional summit in Kazakhstan. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Thursday the war in Ukraine was part of a broader movement against the west by Russia. He said: “Vladimir Putin and his enablers have made one thing very clear: this war is not only about Ukraine. They consider their war against Ukraine to be part of a larger crusade, a crusade against liberal democracy.” The Russian state-owned Tass news agency is reporting that officials at Russia’s nuclear power station operator Rosenergoatom have begun the process of transitioning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) to Russian processes, in particular “the storage system for spent fuel of the Russian Federation”. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Joe Middleton will be here shortly. Russia said it had summoned diplomats from Germany, Denmark and Sweden to complain that representatives from Moscow and Gazprom had not been invited to join an investigation into ruptures of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. “Russia will obviously not recognise the pseudo-results of such an investigation unless Russian experts are involved,” Reuters reports the foreign ministry said. European nations have suggested the only possible cause of the ruptures to the pipelines was sabotage, with only a limited number of state actors suspected of being capable of such an operation. Two quotes this morning underscore the diplomatic gulf between the rhetoric of western leaders and Russia. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has this morning said the war in Ukraine is part of a broader movement against the west by Russia. Reuters quotes him saying: “Vladimir Putin and his enablers have made one thing very clear: this war is not only about Ukraine. They consider their war against Ukraine to be part of a larger crusade, a crusade against liberal democracy.” Meanwhile, Tass news agency is reporting the words of Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov. He has told Russian television that the west used methods of diplomatic terrorism against developing countries so an anti-Russian resolution on “referendums” in the occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions was adopted at the session of the UN general assembly. Tass report Lavrov also said that US claims that Washington did not persuade anyone to vote were false. Here is the clip of the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, explaining that procurement processes are in place among allies in the west that he says will ensure that the international community will be able to continue arming Ukraine for years ahead. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has issued its latest situation map of how it sees developments on the ground in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine has only 10% of what it needs in terms of air defences. The president was speaking in a question and answer session with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Reuters has reported. Zelenskiy also said diplomacy was not possible with leaders who did not respect international law. Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, has posted to Telegram to report that the city of Orikhiv has been targeted, killing one person. He writes: The city of Orikhiv is once again the target of the enemy. The occupier destroyed residential buildings along the central street and in a residential neighbourhood with a massive, multi-hour shelling of a small, peaceful town. The enemy took the life of a resident of the village. In addition, we have 9 wounded from Orikhov and 1 from Preobrazhenka, 3 more in Stepnohirsk. Other objects of civil infrastructure and utility networks, homes in which people invested their whole lives were destroyed. We will rebuild everything as soon as we knock out the enemy from our land, but the main thing is to save human life. Zaporizhzhia is one of the four occupied regions of Ukraine that the Russian Federation has claimed to annex, despite not being fully in control of the territory. The British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said there “isn’t a risk” of the western supply of arms to Ukraine running out before Russia’s supplies are exhausted. He told Deborah Haynes, the defence and security correspondent of Sky News: There isn’t a risk because unlike Russia, who has already isolated itself and we saw that yesterday at the United Nations vote, they need a supply chain. Large parts of the supply chain were not in Russia. They came from all over the world, including in Europe, including indeed even in Ukraine, some of their supply chain was in Ukraine. We have the ability to refurbish or indeed manufacture a new supply chain which is what we are doing right now. The UK-Danish joint-led international fund is all about placing orders in a manufacturing space to make sure we can go on in 2023, 2024 and keep going on. The state emergency service of Ukraine has issued this image of the target of a strike in Mykolaiv. In the UK, the foreign secretary James Cleverly has been doing the morning media round. So far his interviews have entirely been dominated by domestic issues. However, on Sky News he did mention the vote in the UN, telling viewers that domestic problems were being “amplified by Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine.” He went on to say: We need to help Ukrainians defend their country. We saw in the vote in the United Nations last night, we’ve got an international coalition of condemnation against Russia in support of Ukraine. The Russian state-owned Tass news agency is reporting that officials at Russia’s nuclear power station operator Rosenergoatom have begun the process of transitioning the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) to Russian processes, in particular “the storage system for spent fuel of the Russian Federation”. It quotes Renat Karchaa, adviser to the general director of Rosenergoatom, saying: “The process of switching to the Russian system has already been launched.” He added: “This implies a number of points, starting with documents, regulations and so on. It is clear that there will be a transitional period for each component. “While we are immersing ourselves in the process, we are simultaneously analysing all the processes and developing specific solutions, including those related to the storage of all nuclear materials.” Yesterday, Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, described the situation at the ZNPP as “deeply worrying” after the plant again lost external power due to Russian military action cutting supplies. Energoatom, the Ukrainian operator of the plant, also accused the Russian forces occupying it of blocking attempts to refuel the site’s diesel generators. The governor of Lviv, Maksym Kozytskyi, has said that “the day in our region passed without worries” in his latest update. He stated that 301 people arrived in the region on evacuation trains from the east of Ukraine, and that 547 travelled from Lviv oblast to Przemyśl in Poland on evacuation trains. Rodion Miroshnik, the self-styled ambassador to Russia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), has criticised the vote at the UN, saying developing nations had been forced to vote “at the point of an American gun”. He posted to Telegram: Yesterday’s vote at the special session of the UN General Assembly is a demonstration of the US’s ability to put pressure on and twist the arms of developing countries. The “scoreboard” only demonstrates who is not yet ready to resist American blackmail, and who they have not found leverage against. It has nothing to do with the true will of states and their peoples. But even with such a vote “at the point of an American gun,” countries with a population of half the world either voted against or abstained from voting for the American-Albanian resolution condemning Russia’s actions to recognise referendums in the LPR, Donetsk People’s Republic, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. The Russian Federation has announced that the occupied Ukrainian region of Luhansk is to be annexed, after staging widely-derided “referendums” in four regions. The LPR is only recognised as a legitimate authority by three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. Ukraine’s state emergency service has said it is actively searching for people trapped under rubble after a Russian strike on Mykolaiv. In a message on Telegram, the service said: One of the rockets hit a five-story residential building in one of the districts of the city. As a result, the two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest – under rubble. As of 8am, rescuers unblocked a twelve-year-old boy from under the rubble, who was handed over to doctors. According to preliminary information, there may be seven residents of the five-story building under the ruins of the building, with whom there is currently no communication. Rescuers are searching for them and analysing the destroyed structures. To provide assistance to the local population, volunteers of the Red Cross Society of Ukraine are working on the spot, emergency medical teams, law enforcement officers and emergency teams of the city are involved. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Turkey’s aim is to stop the bloodshed in the Russia-Ukraine war as soon as possible despite hurdles, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has told a regional summit in Kazakhstan. The admission of Ukraine to Nato could result in a third world war, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, Alexander Venediktov, told the Russian state Tass news agency in an interview on Thursday. Tass cited Venediktov as saying: Kyiv is well aware that such a step would mean a guaranteed escalation to a World War Three. Apparently, that’s what they are counting on - to create informational noise and draw attention to themselves once again.” Venediktov also repeated a Russian position that the west, by helping Ukraine, indicated that “they are a direct party to the conflict”. After retreating around 20km in the north of the Kherson sector in early October, Russian forces are likely attempting to consolidate a new front line west from the village of Mylove, according to British intelligence. Heavy fighting continues along this line, especially at the western end where Ukrainian advances mean Russia’s flank is no longer protected by the Inhulets River, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. “In recent days, the Russian occupation authorities have likely ordered preparation for the evacuation of some civilians from Kherson,” the report adds. “It is likely that they anticipate combat extending to the city of Kherson itself.” Recently released satellite images show a close view of traffic and bridge repair work on the collapsed part of the Kerch bridge in Crimea. The images made available by Maxar Technologies are dated 12 October. An explosion on Saturday partially destroyed the strategic key bridge, built specifically on Putin’s orders and linking Crimea to Russia. Ukraine has not directly claimed responsibility for the attack. Dozens of Ukraine’s allies have pledged to send more military aid to Ukraine after more than 50 western countries met In Brussels on Wednesday. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, lauded the arrival of the first of four Iris-T defence systems from Germany and an “expedited” delivery of the sophisticated national advanced surface-to-air missile systems (Nasams) from the US. “A new era of air defence has begun in Ukraine,” Reznikov tweeted. “Iris-Ts from Germany are already here. Nasams are coming. This is only the beginning. And we need more.” The UK has said it will donate cutting edge air defence weaponry, capable of shooting down cruise missiles It did not say how many of the Amraam rockets would be sent to Ukraine, but said they would be used with Nasams. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said: “Russia’s latest indiscriminate strikes on civilian areas in Ukraine warrant further support to those seeking to defend their nation. So today I have authorised the supply of Amraam anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine. These weapons will help Ukraine defend its skies from attacks and strengthen their overall missile defence alongside the US Nasams.” France has also promised radar and air defence systems in the coming weeks while Canada said it would provide artillery rounds and winter clothing. The Dutch defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, wrote in a letter to parliament that her government would be donating €15m (£13m) worth of air defences to Ukraine. US president Joe Biden said the vote sent a “clear message” to Moscow. “The stakes of this conflict are clear to all, and the world has sent a clear message in response – Russia cannot erase a sovereign state from the map,” he said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he was “grateful to 143 states that supported the historic UNGA [United Nations general assembly] resolution”, tweeting: “The world had its say – [Russia’s] attempt at annexation is worthless and will never be recognised by free nations.” US secretary of state Antony Blinken said the vote showed international unity against Russia and repeated that Washington would never recognise the “sham” referendums. The vote “is a powerful reminder that the overwhelming majority of nations stand with Ukraine, in defence of the UN Charter and in resolute opposition to Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine and its people,” he said in a statement. Before the vote, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, said: “Today it is Russia invading Ukraine. But tomorrow it could be another nation whose territory is violated. It could be you. You could be next. What would you expect from this chamber?” The United Nations general assembly has overwhelmingly condemned Russia’s “attempted illegal annexation” of four Ukrainian regions, demanding that Moscow reverse course. Three-quarters of the 193-member general assembly – or 143 countries – voted on Wednesday in favour of a resolution that called Moscow’s move illegal, deepening Russia’s international isolation. Only four countries joined Russia in voting against the resolution – Syria, Nicaragua, North Korea and Belarus. Thirty-five countries abstained, including Russia’s strategic partner China, together with India, South Africa and Pakistan. The rest did not vote. The resolution adopted on Wednesday declares that Moscow’s actions violate Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, are “inconsistent” with the principles of the UN charter, and “have no validity under international law and do not form the basis for any alteration of the status of these regions of Ukraine.” It demands that Russia “immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders.” It also supports “the de-escalation of the current situation and a peaceful resolution of the conflict through political dialogue, negotiation, mediation and other peaceful means” that respect Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and internationally recognised borders. Russian president Vladimir Putin is set to meet his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on the sidelines of a regional summit in Kazakhstan later today. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said the Turkish president may propose ideas for peace, hinting that “a very interesting and, I hope, useful discussion awaits us” while speaking to reporters on Wednesday. Now many say that the Turks are ready to come up with other initiatives in the context of the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict. There are reports in the press that the Turkish side is putting forward specific considerations in this regard, I do not exclude that Erdogan will actively touch on this topic during the Astana contact. So a very interesting and, I hope, useful discussion awaits us.” As we await more details on the reported drone strike on Kyiv region this morning, the southern city of Mykolaiv has also reported being hit by a barrage of missiles overnight. “A five-storey residential building was hit, the two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest – under rubble. Rescuers are working on the site,” mayor Oleksandr Senkevich said in a Telegram post just before 4am local time, adding the southern city was “massively shelled”. After the first night, Mykolaiv was massively shelled. A five-story residential building was hit. The two upper floors were completely destroyed, the rest - under rubble. Rescuers are working on the spot.” Russian forces have reportedly struck the Kyiv region with kamikaze drones, according to local officials and media reports. Kyiv regional governor, Oleksiy Kuleba, issued an update via his official Telegram channel just after 6am local time, saying: We have attacks on one of the communities of the region. Previously - an attack of kamikaze drones. Rescuers are already working.” Kuleba urged residents to stay in shelters. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of president Zelenskiy’s office, also reported that critical infrastructure facilities were hit by drone strikes in the region. Another attack by kamikaze drones on critical infrastructure facilities.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next few hours. Russian president Vladimir Putin is set to meet his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on the sidelines of a regional summit in Kazakhstan later today. Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said the Turkish president may propose ideas for peace, hinting that “a very interesting and, I hope, useful discussion awaits us” while speaking to reporters on Wednesday. We are also receiving reports that the Kyiv region has been hit by drone strikes early this morning with Zelenskiy’s office reporting critical infrastructure facilities being struck. Here’s a rundown of all the latest major developments over the past 24 hours. The United Nations general assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine as 35 nations abstained including China, India, South Africa and Pakistan. The resolution “condemns the organisation by the Russian Federation of so-called referendums within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine“ and “the attempted illegal annexation” announced last month of four regions by Russia president Vladimir Putin. A Russian nuclear strike would “almost certainly” trigger a “physical response” from Ukraine’s allies and potentially from Nato, a senior Nato official has said. Any use of nuclear weapons by Moscow would have “unprecedented consequences” for Russia, the official was quoted by Reuters as saying. The US will need to deter two major nuclear weapons powers for the first time, the Biden administration has warned. Washington’s new national security strategy (NSS) depicts China as the most capable long-term competitor, but Russia as the more immediate, disruptive threat, pointing to its nuclear posturing over Ukraine. “Russia’s conventional military will have been weakened, which will likely increase Moscow’s reliance on nuclear weapons in its military planning,” the strategy blueprint reads. Putin will meet Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in what is likely to be a “very interesting” meeting in Kazakhstan on Thursday, where the Turkish leader may propose ideas for peace in Ukraine, the Kremlin has said. Ukraine’s army boasted of territorial gains near the strategically vital southern city of Kherson on Wednesday. Five settlements in the Beryslav district in the north-east of the Kherson region – Novovasylivka, Novogrygorivka, Nova Kamyanka, Tryfonivka, Chervone – were said to have been taken from Russian forces over the day. Nato allies delivered new air defence systems in the wake of Russia’s recent missile attacks across the country. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, lauded the arrival of the first of four Iris-T defence systems from Germany and an “expedited” delivery of sophisticated National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (Nasams) from the US. France has promised radar and air defence systems in the coming weeks while Canada said it would provide artillery rounds and winter clothing and Britain pledged to donate Amraam anti-aircraft missiles capable of shooting down cruise missiles. External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Rafael Grossi had warned earlier that the loss of off-site power at the facility, Europe’s largest, was “deeply worrying”. Ukrainians are being reduce their electricity consumption during peak hours to avoid blackouts. Prime minister Denys Shmyhal appealed to citizens and businesses to reduce power consumption from 5pm to 10pm by 25%. “This is a necessity and this is our contribution to the victory. After all, it depends on each of us how we will get through this winter,” he said. The European Commission will next week present plans to mitigate soaring energy costs. Energy commissioner Kadri Simson told reporters on Wednesday that the commission would bring forward a proposal that includes joint gas purchases by 2023. By harnessing the bloc’s collective purchasing power, she said, the EU could “avoid member states outbidding each other on the market” and thus “driving up” prices. Putin says Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational. The ball was in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via the pipeline, Putin said in an address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. The head of the Russian state-owned gas monopoly supplier, Gazprom, has warned Europe of the consequences of renouncing Russian gas. There is “no guarantee” that Europe would survive winter based on its current gas storage capacity, Alexei Miller said, adding that gas in Germany’s underground storage would be enough for between two- and two-and-a-half months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/12/centrica-and-edf-are-at-the-table-now-uk-ministers-must-strike-a-fair-electricity-price","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-12T18:23:48Z","webTitle":"Centrica and EDF are at the table – now UK ministers must strike a fair electricity price","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/12/centrica-and-edf-are-at-the-table-now-uk-ministers-must-strike-a-fair-electricity-price","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/12/centrica-and-edf-are-at-the-table-now-uk-ministers-must-strike-a-fair-electricity-price","fields":{"headline":"Centrica and EDF are at the table – now UK ministers must strike a fair electricity price","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Centrica and EDF, the duo behind the UK’s current fleet of nuclear power stations, have read the political breezes, sensed the popular mood and come to the correct conclusion: they’re up for a negotiation with government to cap the price of electricity. So they should be, of course. Even if the size of windfall profits being collected by generators is currently unclear, nobody doubts the fact of outsized returns when current forward-selling contracts fall away. The wholesale price of electricity, absurdly, is tied to the price of gas, creating nonsensical outcomes in those corners of the generation market where input prices are virtually unchanged. One could, perhaps, be slightly nervous that Centrica and EDF have volunteered for duty so speedily. The companies aren’t charities and they’ll be looking for something for themselves – namely medium or long-term guarantees on prices. That worry, though, is really an argument for transparency when the deal-making begins. At this stage, willingness to come to the table is what matters. It’s up to ministers, if they’re really dead-set against new windfall taxes, to thrash out decent terms to protect the public purse. So where are the other corporate volunteers? Drax, as a biomass-based business, tends to be overlooked in the focus on nuclear, wind and solar generators, but it is in exactly the same lucky economic boat. Burning wood pellets to generate power is a lucrative business if you’re being paid as if you’re a gas generator. Witness the jump in Drax’s profits, and two-thirds improvement in the share price, since wholesale energy started to climb last autumn. Since Drax is also the beneficiary of stupendous support under current arrangements (thinktank Ember calculates that from 2012 until 2027, the company will have collected more than £11bn in government subsidies), it ought to have been the first company to say it will come to the table. Will Drax play ball? Aside from a few boiler-plate words about working in partnership with government, Drax on Monday was gloriously unclear about its readiness to negotiate. Not good enough. Get with the programme. Reasons to admire outgoing Serco CEO’s corporate rescue job Serco is one of those companies that is doomed never to enjoy popular acclaim and affection – or even, in some quarters, acceptance. That’s life. Nor is suspicion remotely surprising given that the outsourcing firm only emerged a few months ago from a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Serious Fraud Office related to past shenanigans with electronic tagging contracts for prisoners. There are, though, two strong reasons to admire the corporate rescue job performed by chief executive Rupert Soames, who on Monday announced his looming retirement (“outsourcing myself”, as he put it). The first is that Serco still exists. Back in 2014, survival wasn’t guaranteed. Aside from the scandal with tags, Soames inherited a £1.5bn annual loss and a chunk of contracts that made no commercial sense for the provider. The company was an operational and balance-sheet mess. Soames served up a £150m rights issue as an amuse bouche on day one, and made investors swallow a £550m thumper the following year. Both fundraisers were essentially acts of faith on the part of investors. Turnaround wasn’t quick, but the new strategic direction has been vindicated. Today’s Serco is a government-only contractor with a greater international spread (particularly in North America) and a bias towards defence. Progress from the 100p rights issue price to today’s 168p has been steady, rather than spectacular, but that is roughly what low-margin contractors should deliver: a touch of reliability. Investors have been much better off by owning Serco in the period than outsourcing twin Capita (let alone its cousin, the late and unlamented Carillion). Soames, 63, will be replaced by Mark Irwin, who seems to have been earmarked for succession for a while. One hopes the new man has digested the second lesson of the Soames era: speak plainly, acknowledge that outsourcing is controversial and be prepared to debate your critics. A few non-believers will never accept that public services should be delivered by private companies. The rest of us know that it is often a better way to deliver value for money – but we do still want maximum transparency from the providers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/31/hopes-for-power-and-purpose-from-an-energy-industry-in-flux","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-31T16:00:22Z","webTitle":"Hopes for power and purpose from an energy industry in flux","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/31/hopes-for-power-and-purpose-from-an-energy-industry-in-flux","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/31/hopes-for-power-and-purpose-from-an-energy-industry-in-flux","fields":{"headline":"Hopes for power and purpose from an energy industry in flux","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A tall white rig punctures the Cornish skyline, offering a hint of a new industrial era at a site near Redruth, once a copper mining capital. This year, the first power produced by a geothermal plant in the UK is expected from a project three decades in the making. The United Downs project aims to produce constant low-carbon electricity for the grid, and heat for homes, from hot rocks. Geothermal energy is an established power source in volcanically active areas of the globe, often near tectonic plate boundaries. However, it can also be used in other areas if the rock temperature is high enough, and the rocks are permeable enough for water to circulate. The project is developed by Geothermal Engineering and has received funding from the EU and Cornwall county council. Its introduction to the electricity generation mix will come in a year which could prove defining for a British energy industry that has spent the past 12 months in crisis mode. Here’s what other changes and challenges the sector can expect in 2023: Renewed impetus for renewables The importance of renewable power sources was underlined in 2022. The invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring and left countries paying through the nose for gas to replace Russian supplies, and hit household and public finances. Expect a fresh focus on new renewable projects this year, in part as a result of the lifting of the ban on onshore wind in England. Meanwhile, Scotland’s largest offshore windfarm – the £3bn Seagreen project, a joint venture between SSE Renewables and France’s TotalEnergies – is expected to be fully operational by the summer. An even bigger windfarm, at Dogger Bank 80 miles off the north-east coast of England, should also deliver its first power by the summer. And another SSE project, Coire Glas, is taking shape: it will be the first large-scale pumped hydroelectric storage scheme for more than 30 years and should provide a significant backup when wind and solar power are not available. It could also prove a crucial year for executives behind the £18bn project to connect Britain with a huge wind and solar farm in the Sahara through an undersea cable. They hope to secure a “contract for difference” with government – meaning they would receive public subsidies to give them a fixed price for power – as the clock ticks on the project. Nuclear vision The £30bn Sizewell C nuclear power station development in Suffolk became emblematic of the political tumult of 2021 – as the planning decision on its future was repeatedly delayed, before eventually being given the green light by Boris Johnson. It then looked in doubt amid Liz Truss’s mini-budget chaos before the government announced a £700m cash injection which also eased out China General Nuclear. This year, bankers will hope to finally land other backers to complement developer EDF and the government in the project. Could British Gas owner Centrica commit to investment? Rolls-Royce will hope to gain some momentum behind its long-awaited small modular reactor programme. Fossil fuels hang on The role of polluting fuels in Britain’s energy mix was high on the agenda in 2022, as fossil fuel firms faced a windfall tax on their Ukraine-inflated profits but were asked to step in to ensure security of supplies this winter. The government is set to award 130 new licences for North Sea oil and gas exploration by the summer, although the move faces a legal challenge. The futures of the huge Cambo and Rosebank fields remain uncertain but could get the green light this year. Green campaigners will also hope to see more progress in the transition away from coal after the approval of the first new coalmine for three decades, in Cumbria, and deals to keep coal plants running this winter. Britain has committed to end the use of coal power by October 2024. Regulations revamp The biggest redesign of the electricity market in a generation began this year in the form of the Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (Rema). A key part of the work will be de-linking gas and electricity prices as Britain shifts towards renewable power. Green energy suppliers have bemoaned the link between the surging cost of natural gas, after the invasion of Ukraine, and high power prices. Policymakers are attempting to create a market better suited to a greater proportion of renewables, by improving grid connections for windfarms and battery storage sites. Significant proposals for reform are expected in 2023. Heavy industrial companies are hoping new regulations, designed to encourage investment in hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, are completed to ease the path to decarbonisation. Generation flex Industry watchers have long predicted that consumers could take a more active role in Britain’s energy network. This year saw the introduction of a National Grid scheme, first trialled by Octopus, which saw households paid to turn limit energy usage at peak times. And with electric vehicle ownership increasing, the potential is growing for drivers to play a part in storing and pushing power back to the grid with car batteries. Octopus’s bosses will hope it can keep pushing innovation in these areas while integrating Bulb, the bust energy supplier which it has acquired in the face of a legal challenge from rivals. Counting the cost The biggest unknown for the energy industry this year is how gas prices will fare. While prices have begun easing in recent weeks thanks to warmer than average weather, wholesale natural gas costs are forecast to remain high across Europe in 2023, with few cheap options to replace the huge volume of Russian fuel lost to the market. Those prices will affect the cost of the energy price guarantee, the government’s measure to protect households from huge bills, which becomes less generous from April. However, signs of a global recession could further pull down the price of oil and fuel. Ministers may feel the energy crisis is under control, but it looks far from over. • This article was amended on 4 January 2023. An earlier version referred to volcanic activity “near to tectonic plates”. However, plates cover the surface of the earth, so volcanic areas are on, rather than near, plates. It has been corrected to convey that geothermal resources are often found “near tectonic plate boundaries”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/30/uk-isolated-as-eu-agrees-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-30T14:41:19Z","webTitle":"UK isolated as EU agrees windfall tax on energy firms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/30/uk-isolated-as-eu-agrees-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/30/uk-isolated-as-eu-agrees-windfall-tax-on-energy-firms","fields":{"headline":"UK isolated as EU agrees windfall tax on energy firms","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"EU energy ministers have agreed to levy windfall taxes on energy companies’ profits, and to cut electricity use, but remain at loggerheads over proposals to cap the price of gas. Meeting in Brussels on Friday, the bloc’s 27 energy ministers signed off on proposals to levy a “solidarity contribution” on fossil fuel producers that have benefited from soaring energy prices. Revenues of renewable energy and nuclear power companies will be capped in response to the “unexpectedly large financial gains” made in recent months, as a result of their profits being linked to the price of expensive gas and coal, according to an EU statement. The measures, which together could raise €140bn (£123bn) to help lower consumer bills and fund the switch to green energy across the EU, contrast with the British government’s approach. Liz Truss, the UK prime minister, has ruled out extending the £5bn energy tax introduced by the former chancellor Rishi Sunak. Unlike the UK, the EU is also moving ahead with plans to reduce demand for energy. Ministers agreed on a voluntary target to cut electricity use by 10% and a mandatory energy savings target of 5% during peak hours. The mandatory peak hours target was deemed necessary to avoid power being simply moved from most to least efficient countries in the EU’s shared electricity market. The 10% cut in electricity use is meant to be achieved between 1 December and the end of March. A 15% voluntary target for cutting gas consumption over the winter was agreed in July. EU officials said if the demand-reduction plans were successful, governments would earn less than the estimated €140bn from windfall taxes, but consumers would benefit from lower bills. The emergency measures were agreed after a 37% decline in gas supplies from Russia to the EU between January and August, following the invasion of Ukraine. The risks to EU energy supply were further exposed this week when four leaks were found in two Nord Stream gas pipelines, believed by EU leaders to be acts of sabotage. Despite the consensus on a windfall tax and energy savings, ministers remain divided over plans to cap the price of gas. France, Italy, Spain and Poland were among 15 countries this week urging the European Commission to table a price cap as “the one measure that will help every member state to mitigate the inflationary pressure, manage expectations and provide a framework in case of potential supply disruptions, and limit the extra profits in the sector”. The Czech Republic’s industry minister, Jozef Síkela, who chaired Friday’s meeting, called on the commission to table additional measures targeted at reducing gas prices as soon as possible. “The households and businesses need the help now. We are in the energy war with Russia and we need to act. Now means now … Now is not in a week and definitely not in a month,” he said. Germany, the Netherlands and EU officials, however, are sceptical about a price cap, fearing it could harm the EU’s ability to secure scarce supplies of liquified natural gas in a competitive global market. Critics also say the system would require an EU authority to allocate and ration gas to member states, a politically fraught task never done at EU level. Luxembourg’s energy minister, Claude Turmes, said capping the wholesale price of gas had risks. “What happens when the clearing is not happening? Who will then decide where gas goes? [Is the] European Commission to decide? … Look, I think this is a system that can be very, very difficult to administer.” The commission continues to favour capping the price of Russian gas, a measure that has the support of only the Baltic states and is unlikely to pass. Kadri Simson, the EU energy commissioner, said the commission was “ready to develop a temporary EU-wide measure to limit the price of gas in electricity generation”, which she described as a far-reaching step. “A wholesale gas price cap is a legitimate option,” she told reporters, “but it requires a radical intervention in the market which means several non-negotiable conditions have to be met before this cap will work.” One of those conditions, she said, would be a gas-savings target going beyond the 15% already set. Riina Sikkut, Estonia’s infrastructure minister, rejected suggestions that Europeans faced a choice between heating and eating. “We can’t forget that we are in a situation of war,” she said. “Ukrainians are paying with their lives. So we may temporarily pay higher bills or prices in the food store.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/06/ukraine-motivational-messaging-maintains-morale-as-winter-bites","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-06T13:47:55Z","webTitle":"Ukraine’s motivational messaging maintains morale as winter bites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/06/ukraine-motivational-messaging-maintains-morale-as-winter-bites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/06/ukraine-motivational-messaging-maintains-morale-as-winter-bites","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine’s motivational messaging maintains morale as winter bites","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Adverts on Ukraine’s underground system carry motivational messaging: “Together to the victory”, “Bravery is carrying on” or “Just a bit more and it will get easier”. Psychologists are invited on to television shows almost daily to offer tips on how to manage anxiety and the breaks are filled with videos in support of the army. Positive messaging, mental health advice, and examples of how to “do your bit” are all part of the information ecosystem helping Ukrainians sustain their morale throughout the war. Experts say this partly top-down, partly organic approach will play a significant role in supporting Ukrainians through what is likely to be a punishing winter. Ukrainian TV channels are running a series of adverts on how people can save energy amid government pleas for consumers to reduce usage. Under the slogan “The rules of a warm country”, one video advises people to use alternative methods to keep warm, including using hot water bottles and cats, as well as getting together with neighbours. There are also several segments a day featuring Ukrainians across the country demonstrating how they have prepared for winter. One man recently interviewed said in the event of no electricity or gas, he would pitch a tent inside his flat and sleep in a sleeping bag. Breathing inside a small tent, he said, will maintain the heat better than a room. On social media, Ukrainians are sharing infographics on which appliances use the most electricity and videos of the recent trend of making candles-come-stoves for soldiers in the trenches. This winter, Ukraine is facing the frightening prospect of sub-zero temperatures with bouts of no electricity, water and even heating. For the last month, Russia has been targeting critical elements of Ukraine’s energy sector with a combination of missiles, rockets, and Iranian-supplied drones. On Monday alone, Russia targeted at least seven regional power stations and since then they have attacked at least another three, according to Ukraine’s authorities. Ukrainian repair workers and energy dispatchers have been quick to reconnect and reroute supplies and scheduled blackouts have been rolled out in several regions, including the capital, Kyiv, to stabilise the electricity grid. But Ukraine’s officials have warned that these short shutdowns are probably just a small taste of what’s to come. Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the head of Ukraine’s state energy company, Ukrenergo, said this week that if the Russian attacks continued, “power cuts in Ukraine will become longer and longer”. Kudrytskyi said Ukrenergo could not repair the grid as quickly as it was being destroyed. According to him, “virtually all” major non-nuclear power stations in the country have been hit, including 30% of the substations. The head of Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, said his office was preparing for the event that blackouts may last as long as two weeks. The news of yet more bad times ahead has, however, not made a discernible dent in the country’s morale. According to Volodymyr Kulyk, a leading professor of sociology, Ukrainians remain defiant and want to demonstrate that. “People increasingly perceive Russia as a genocidal actor … [and] are ready to sacrifice to remain free and remain themselves,” said Kulyk. “[Messages of defiance] are both stemming from people themselves and also disseminated centrally from the government, the media and influencers.” The top-down messages – particularly those from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the daily update from Ukraine’s general staff – play a therapeutic role for many Ukrainians, Kulyk said. “We need this news to know that everything is OK and there is no disaster with the Ukrainian army,” he said. All of the state agencies make their own motivational videos – the fire services, police, the ministry of defence, as well as the TV channels and private companies. “These societal adverts that show heroism, of course, make [people] proud,” said Ostapa, the head of Detector Media, a media-monitoring organisation. Psychiatrists and psychologists are regularly invited on Ukrainian TV to discuss how people can identify mental health problems in themselves and their loved ones. How to talk to children about the war is a particularly prominent topic. Oleh Chuban, the head of psychiatry at a leading medical university in Ukraine and a regular guest on TV, said he aimed to tell people that what they are feeling was normal. “The fact that people are worried and anxious, chopping firewood, buying up all the generators, is a normal reaction. Only an idiot wouldn’t react to someone telling them that there will be power, water and heating outages,” said Chaban. “People are saving themselves, just like during Covid 19.” “The media has a big influence [on people] so I try to give them optimism and explain their worries are natural and demonstrate that they living people with (functioning) emotions,” said Chaban. On Tuesday, Zelenskiy spoke to the nation stressing the need for perseverance. “Instead of overcoming poverty in their country, the Russian leadership spends everything not to admit what a historical mistake they made with this war against Ukraine,” he said. “Patience is needed to prove that the hope for the winter for Russian terrorists will not come true. I am sure we will get through this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/18/ukraine-says-30-of-its-power-plants-destroyed-in-last-eight-days","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-18T17:00:27Z","webTitle":"Ukraine says 30% of its power plants destroyed in last eight days","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/18/ukraine-says-30-of-its-power-plants-destroyed-in-last-eight-days","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/18/ukraine-says-30-of-its-power-plants-destroyed-in-last-eight-days","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine says 30% of its power plants destroyed in last eight days","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Nearly a third of Ukraine’s power stations have been destroyed by Russian attacks since Monday last week – prompting Nato’s secretary general to announce that new counter-drone defences would be delivered within days. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of engaging in “terrorist attacks” with its missiles and Iranian-made drones, while British ministers attended emergency meetings in Washington on how to counteract them. Zelenskiy tweeted: “Since Oct 10, 30% of Ukraine’s power stations have been destroyed, causing massive blackouts across the country.” Attacks on civilian infrastructure meant there was “no space left for negotiations with Putin’s regime”. The bombing is often inaccurate and civilians have been killed in residential buildings in Kyiv and other big cities. But enough have got through to cause problems for a power grid already short of generation after the Zaprorizhzhia nuclear power plant was shut down. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the presidential office, said energy infrastructure and power supply were targeted overnight in an eastern district of Kyiv, where two people were killed, and in the cities of Dnipro and Zhytomyr. “The situation is critical now across the country because our regions are dependent on one another … it’s necessary for the whole country to prepare for electricity, water and heating outages,” Tymoshenko told Ukrainian television. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, said member countries would “step up” and deliver more air defences to help stabilise the situation. “Nato will in the coming days deliver counter-drone systems to counter the specific threat of drones, including those from Iran,” he said. Russia has been targeting Ukraine with a mixture of missiles and, more recently, Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones, rebranded as Geran-2 by the attackers. Although there are signs that Moscow is running short on guided missiles, it has acquired up to 2,400 of the drones, according to Ukraine, and is using them as cheaper substitutes to hit the energy targets and strike fear into civilians. Iran denies supplying the drones to Russia, while the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he did not have any information about their origin. “Russian equipment with Russian names is being used,” Peskov said. Ukraine, experts and western governments believe the Gerans are rebranded Shahed drones, identifiable by their distinctive delta wing shape and from an examination of fragments recovered from the ground. A western official, speaking on condition of anonymity in a briefing on Tuesday, said they believed Russia was “pursuing a deliberate strategy of attempting to destroy Ukraine’s electricity network”. It was “not in doubt”, the official said, “where these weapons were coming from”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he would ask Zelenskiy to cut diplomatic ties with Tehran – while presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak asked what Iran had got in return from Russia, speculating that it could be uranium, “nuclear technologies”, or some other guarantee. Reuters reported that Iran had promised to provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles, in addition to more drones, citing two senior Iranian officials and two Iranian diplomats. Germany said that Iran should be punished with “further sanctions” after the recent spate of drone attacks. Its ambassador to the UK, Miguel Berger, said Tehran had helped Russia “terrorise civilians in Ukraine with their kamikaze drones” and there were “worrying reports” that Iran might sell missiles to Moscow. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, and the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, flew to Washington on Tuesday to discuss how to respond to Iran’s intervention, as officials briefed that a new air defence package for Ukraine was being prepared. A western official said a lot of colleagues within the western alliance were “looking at what the right package might be to support the Ukrainians”. Last week Germany delivered the first of four Iris-T air defence systems it had promised to supply Ukraine, but the US has been wary of strengthening Ukraine’s air force and defences for fear it would be seen as an escalation. Two “objects of critical infrastructure” were damaged in Kyiv on Tuesday, said the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, and electricity and water supply in “many houses” in east Kyiv was “partially limited”. The mayor appealed to residents to conserve electricity by turning off air conditioners, electric kettles and microwaves, and said houses experiencing reduced water pressure should use water as “economically as possible”. All of Zhytomyr was without electricity and water after a double missile strike on an energy facility, said the mayor, Serhiy Sukhomlyn. Hospitals were running on backup power, he said. Russia said on Tuesday that its forces were maintaining strikes against military and energy infrastructure targets, and that it had used what it described as high-precision, long-range air- and sea-based weapons. The targets were “military command and energy infrastructure of Ukraine, as well as arsenals with ammunition and foreign-made weapons”, it said. “All assigned objects were hit,” it added. Klitschko said a fifth person, an elderly woman, had been found dead after a wave of drone attacks in the centre of Kyiv on Monday morning. She died after a residential building was hit by a drone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/10/the-disastrous-bursting-of-ukraines-nova-kakhovka-dam-and-the-battle-that-is-to-come","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-10T18:16:25Z","webTitle":"The disastrous bursting of Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam – and the battle that is to come","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/10/the-disastrous-bursting-of-ukraines-nova-kakhovka-dam-and-the-battle-that-is-to-come","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/10/the-disastrous-bursting-of-ukraines-nova-kakhovka-dam-and-the-battle-that-is-to-come","fields":{"headline":"The disastrous bursting of Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam – and the battle that is to come","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Four-and-a-half days after Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam burst, the longer-term scale of the flooding disaster is gradually becoming apparent. In the station at Mykolaiv, the first city inland, pensioner Olena Lysiuk, says she had no choice but to quit her apartment in Kherson, even though it was too high up to be flooded. “It’s not just that we don’t have any water, gas or electricity. We have also got used to not having those during the Russian occupation. But now the sewage doesn’t work. That’s the new problem,” Lysiuk says. Now she plans to stay in Mykolaiv with relatives, with the state having given her about 10,000 hryvnia (£215) in support. Vasyl Chornyi gets off an evacuation carriage from Kherson while the train is joined with another and lights a cigarette. The Inhulets river flooded part of his village, Fedorivka, 18 miles (29km) north-east of Kherson, and while his house wasn’t directly affected, he too was leaving because “we are fearing a pandemic”. “The cemetery is drowned, the sewers have been drowned,” Chornyi says, even claiming to have seen coffins floating downstream. “When the waters go down, there will be lots of dead fish, other decay. In Kherson the wells are spoiled. Outside toilets are flooded,” he says, and acknowledges that while the Russian occupation between March and November did not force him out, the flooding disaster has. Whole houses are being washed into the Black Sea. On Friday an intact roof ended up on a beach in Odesa, 130 miles away. Locals in the city have been told not to try to clean up the rubbish, reeds and other waterborne detritus amid concern that landmines, some made of light plastic, could be floating dangerously within. That though, leaves the clean-up to the already stretched state emergency services. Kyiv’s interior ministry counts 27 people missing so far, although the true figure is likely to be far higher, following a disaster that came at the most critical point in the war since Russian troops were repelled from Kyiv. A day earlier, on Monday, Ukraine started, albeit without any fanfare, its long awaited counter-offensive on which the future of the war, of Ukraine and perhaps even Russia, hinges. Then at 2.50am on Tuesday, cataclysm struck the Nova Kakhovka dam. Locals reported hearing a deafening explosion with the “sky turning to white” in the small hours. Subsequent seismic analysis by Norsar of Norway, relying on sensors in Romania, has so far borne that out, while US media report that spy satellites also detected a blast around that time. Experts add that it would have been very much harder to destroy the dam from outside, than to have blown it up from the inside. If it was Russia, as seems most likely, what motive could its forces have? One explanation is that it was an instinctive defensive response to the threat of an amphibious attack in Kherson oblast across the Dnipro, a fearful reaction to the possibility of a surprise strike by Kyiv across the country’s central, defining river. Certainly, a marine assault is now more difficult for Ukraine, and the building of a pontoon bridge across the widened Dnipro is all but impossible. But if there was an attempt to emulate Stalin’s destruction of the larger Zaporizhzhia dam in the face of the advancing German army in 1941, the consequences of Tuesday’s events would be borne largely by civilians, and paradoxically Russian soldiers, on the left, southern bank of the Dnipro, the side held by the invaders. A group of Russian anti-war groups reported that 1,842 residents in and around the flooded town of Oleshky, across the Dnipro river from Kherson, are “currently not allowed to leave by the Russian military” of which 338 are in need of urgent assistance with water and food supplies running dangerously short. The Red Cross has been prevented from reaching the area, prompting the groups to appeal on Saturday to the US government to use “diplomatic means” to ease the crisis. Nevertheless, it was the Russians who held the hydroelectric station perched on the top of the dam. Under the occupation Nova Kakhovka had long since stopped generating power and had been turned into a garrison, from which the Russians could fend off any attempt by Ukrainian forces to approach the dam from the right bank. There are other signs that Russia saw the dam as a chip in a military game, without clear regard for the consequences. The Russian occupiers had allowed water levels in the Kakhovka reservoir behind the dam to build up to a 30-year high, filling the reservoir with more than 18m cubic metres of water, the size of Utah’s Great Salt Lake. Also concerned was the Ukrainian power company that used to run the hydro plant before it was overrun. “At the end of September, beginning of October, the Ukrainian workers at the station spotted that the Russians brought a lot of explosive material inside,” said Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukrhydroenergo. “But later in October, the Ukrainian workers were sent away and it became a military headquarters for the Russians.” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told an online meeting with environmental activists on Thursday: “We warned the world about the mining of the dam and other facilities. It was obvious that Russia had an intent to cause disaster.” Another possibility has been raised by the publication by the Ukrainian security service on Friday of a recording of what it claimed was an intercepted conversation between two Russian soldiers, in which one reveals to the other that it was a sabotage unit from their own side that set off the explosion, and that the resulting devastation had been far greater than intended. “Our saboteur group is there. They wanted to cause fear with this dam. It did not go according to the plan. More than they planned,” the soldier said. The authenticity of the call is unverified and probably unverifiable. If authentic though, it adds weight to the screw-up version of history, that the intention had been to wash Ukrainian forces off the river islands which made up the no man’s land between the two banks, and the saboteurs got their calculations wrong. Whatever the motives, there is no doubt about the consequences. While the immediate attention in the past week has been on the human and environmental tragedy unfolding downstream, an even greater catastrophe may be looming upstream in the coming months and years. By the end of the week, the water level in the Kakhovka reservoir sank below 12 metres, entering what Ukrainian officials called the “dead zone”. That meant it was too low to feed the four Soviet-era canal systems that feed the entire region, particularly Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts and Crimea. Together those regions represent one of the world’s breadbaskets, and the Ukrainian agriculture ministry warned that, without those life-giving canals, they could become “deserts” as early as next year. The sinking water levels in the reservoir also threaten drinking water supplies to cities, towns and villages all along the course of lower Dnipro. And there is another threat, less certain but potentially even more catastrophic. The level of the Kakhovka reservoir is now well below the 13.3 metres required to reach the intake channel for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, about 125 miles upstream from the dam. Normally, water would be sucked up from the reservoir into spray ponds used to cool the six reactor cores and the spent fuel stored at the plant. The draining of the reservoir is not an immediate threat, because all six reactors at Zaporizhzhia had been shut down after the plant’s occupation by Russian forces and its transformation into a garrison and military depot. One of the reactors had been kept in “hot shutdown”, kept warmer than the others to help with heating to the adjacent town of Enerhodar. That has now been put on cold shutdown. The water needs of the plant are far less than when it was functioning. Furthermore, there is a sizeable cooling pond for emergencies. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) estimates that it contains enough water to keep cooling operations going for several months. Ukrainian officials from the Ukrainian nuclear energy corporation, Energoatom, believe it is enough for several years. However, it emerged last week that studies commissioned by Energoatom after the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in 2011 found that, without the counteracting force of the waters of the Kakhovka reservoir on the other side, the dyke around the cooling pond could burst from the pressure of the water inside. Energoatom’s president, Petro Kotin, played down that scenario, and reassured Ukrainians there were other sources of water in an emergency to prevent a meltdown of the radioactive fuel at the plant. “These are mobile pumping units that can be deployed if necessary, and the last frontier is the use of underground drinking water wells,” Kotin said on Friday. The real threat, Kotin said, was that of deliberate sabotage by the plant’s Russian occupiers. If the Russians did indeed blow up the Kakhovka dam, it raises fears they could also blow up the Zaporizhzhia plant, regardless of the consequences that would almost certainly spill onto Russian territory. At present, the waters have hardly receded from their peak – and the situation is complicated by the fact that, after a one-day pause on Wednesday, Russian shelling and Ukrainian retaliation resumed. Two rescuers were wounded in the Ukrainian-held city on Saturday, emphasising the dangers, while the security situation was too serious for another group to brief the Observer on their latest emergency efforts. Islands in the Dnipro delta, previously occupied by the Russians, have been submerged, and drone footage shows that former shoreline settlements such as Hola Prystan are also inundated. A humanitarian disaster on the Russian-held left bank “would undoubtedly heighten the risk” of an outbreak of cholera or other intestinal infections, says Prof Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia and adviser to the World Health Organization. “Flooding could wash sewage into water extracted for drinking, which if not adequately treated could lead to a whole range of water-borne problems, of which the scariest is in cholera,” Hunter says. Cholera has not appeared in Ukraine so far, he adds, but the disease has a history of surfacing in and around wars, most recently in Syria. To avoid problems, Ukraine will help with medical surveillance, vaccinations and ensuring that when people get ill they can get good healthcare, he adds. Meanwhile, with terrible effect, the destruction of the Kakhovka dam raises the already enormous stakes riding on the Ukrainian counter-offensive. Already the challenge facing Ukrainian troops as they try to storm well-prepared Russian defensive lines was daunting, and pictures began to circulate on social media of the first losses of western armour, German Leopard tanks and US-made Bradley fighting vehicles. “With the exception of the US, no other western-style military can conduct sustained combined arms operations at scale. So Ukrainian forces are attempting to do something at the tactical level that no other European Nato member is currently capable of,” Franz-Stefan Gady, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, wrote on Twitter. But now the flooding has deepened the crisis in Ukraine. The dramatic moments in the small hours of Tuesday morning mean the country is no longer just fighting a war, but also grappling what is almost certain to have been a human-made and entirely unnecessary environmental and humanitarian catastrophe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/apr/25/poland-change-europe-high-achievers-country","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-25T12:36:17Z","webTitle":"Poland has changed beyond recognition – and so has its place in Europe's pecking order | Anna Gromada","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/25/poland-change-europe-high-achievers-country","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/25/poland-change-europe-high-achievers-country","fields":{"headline":"Poland has changed beyond recognition – and so has its place in Europe’s pecking order","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When the iron curtain was swept away on that miraculous night of 9 November 1989, it exposed some of the deepest differences between geographical neighbours the world has ever recorded. The 13:1 GDP per capita gap between Poland and soon-to-be united Germany was twice that between the US and Mexico. That same night, my pregnant mother and her brothers were workers in the shadow economy on an eco-farm near Frankfurt, helping to meet the needs of a newly minted class of environmentally aware Germans. My family admired that country where “you never got lost on a highway”. People in Germany drove immaculately clean cars and manual labourers could play Stille Nacht on several instruments – which they did at the farm for Christmas 1989 – leading my mother to marvel at an education system that could so universally equip people not just with marketable skills but also with an ingrained sense of beauty. Neighbouring countries tend to have comparable levels of development. A common security context, investment spillovers, migration, remittances and regional supply chains create geographical pockets of welfare or poverty that transcend borders on the map. It takes a solid physical barrier – the Himalayas between China and Nepal for instance, the barbed wire that runs along the Korean border, or the Berlin Wall – to maintain economic chasms such as those that existed between the Poland and Germany of my mother’s era. But eastern Europe’s economic prospects were rapidly revived by the economic integration that took off in Europe in the 1990s. Reunified Germany wanted to have something akin to “the west” in its immediate eastern neighbourhood even if this required a degree of political heavy-lifting elsewhere in the EU. France was much less keen on adopting post-communist orphans in a united Europe. Like China in the 1990s, eastern Europe embarked on its capitalist journey as a simple subcontractor. Ready parts would be parachuted in like sealed Lego sets to be assembled by a cheap and docile workforce that simply followed the instructions before exporting the completed products with low added value to richer countries. At this stage, the low cost of labour drove foreign investment. From 1992 to 2014, wages in Poland slid from 63% of GDP – the level of today’s unionised Germany – to 46%, second lowest in the EU. Car factories in Germany paid workers €3,122 a month, almost four times as much as their Polish, Czech, Slovak or Hungarian colleagues, who made €835 for similar work. “We built capitalism without capital,” Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, who was Poland’s prime minister in 1991, told me a quarter of a century later – when I questioned what appeared to my generation to be an economic model based willingly on semi-dependency. It replaced a communist-era coerced economic dependency on the east – courtesy of Soviet tanks. In the early 2000s, about to join the ranks of EU citizens, my greatest personal hope was for a world-class education. I was trying to learn more languages, cracking my head against German grammar from the aptly named textbook Deutsch – deine Chance (German – Your Chance). Polish eco-farm workers were just hoping to move out of the shadows and into the legal, tax-paying economy. But the farm in Germany, devoted to environmental ethics, showed less commitment to its human equivalent. The illegal workers were pulling double shifts on little sleep, with inadequate health and safety protection on machines operated 24/7. One of those machines fatally injured my uncle. The employer offered to pay to have the coffin taken back to Poland. We, his family, offered to forget about the case. Back then, we assumed this was an acceptable deal. Maybe it was because we preserved some of the thought patterns that had served us well in the past. We clung to them until our operating system got an update. For eastern Europe, the 2004 accession to the EU came as a long-awaited escape from the trap of history. It opened a cashflow for governments, freedom of movement and a vast labour market for workers, and elite universities for overeager girls like me. Others benefited even more. Between 2010 and 2016, Poland received 2.7% of GDP as EU transfers annually, and sent 4.7% as profits to western investors. The gaps were even larger for smaller countries: 2% to 7.5% for the Czech Republic, and 4% to 7.2% for Hungary. From 2004, Poland’s and Germany’s economic cycles intimately aligned, as if in a compatible but unequal marriage. This paid off during the 2008 financial crash: Poland remained an island of growth in a sea of continental recession – largely because Germany, its main contractor, weathered the storm. Germany is almost as important to Poland as the next six of its trade partners put together. Fully 28% of Poland’s exports go to Germany. Less than 6% of German exports go to Poland. My private misgivings about our treatment didn’t germinate until the next decade, by which time I was a poster child for western integration after an educational grand tour through Oxbridge, the Ivy League and grande école. It was 2014 and I was sitting in my best friend’s dorm in Geneva, surrounded by human rights adepts, when this very upper-middle-class question popped into my head: why hadn’t we sued that eco-farm owner back then for such a preventable accident? This question foreshadowed the emergence of a newly entitled ego which regarded the law as a legitimate tool in its playbook, and ahistorically flagellated its past self for not considering what now appeared obvious. Like my sense of entitlement, my country has changed beyond recognition. Poland has experienced uninterrupted growth over three decades, the longest in European history. Its GDP has increased tenfold nominally, sixfold when corrected for the cost of living. It has a record low unemployment rate of 3%, lower infant mortality than Canada, higher female life expectancy than the US and less violent crime than the UK . And now you don’t get lost on Polish highways either. The change is symbolised by, guess what, the car industry. It turned out that eastern Europe did not after all have to be just the assembly line: it could do without the Lego sets. Poland, and others, started clambering up the value chain. Our factories were soon producing high-quality components on the spot rather than importing them from somewhere in Bavaria or Hessen. Poland began to export not just finished cars, but engines, then electric car batteries. The country’s organic move up the supply chain, gave rise to a question: if we have all the human and technical components for car production, why don’t we do it ourselves? This question was a real-world illustration of what theorists such as Joseph Schumpeter said happens in globalised capitalism when technological progress overtakes and destroys established industrial monopolies (such as those of western Europe) turning them into the dinosaurs and giving newcomers (such as eastern Europe) a chance to sneak in. In 2004, joining the EU meant higher standards of living, unprecedented economic growth and life chances. For years, it also meant accepting an inbuilt bias in rule-making towards the old-timers: France and Germany. The EU-funded highway system in Poland for example, primarily developed the west-east axis, promoting German trade and North Sea ports, rather than the north-south axis which would boost Poland as an eastern European trade hub along with its Baltic ports. When Poland became a leader in European road haulage services, Germany pushed for common EU rules for truck drivers which harmed the competitiveness of Polish transport companies which employ half a million workers and account for 6% of GDP. To many in Poland, the reform looked like a selective application of rules in the service of richer countries. But the balance of power is steadily shifting in ways that some may find uncomfortable. The last few years have been marked by political and economic ruptures in the Poland-Germany relationship. Politically, the feeling that Germany failed to take Ukraine’s sovereignty seriously – until its own supply of Russian gas was threatened – has provoked angst throughout the region. What if, one day, they don’t take our sovereignty seriously either? Economically, the surface current still looks like the old model of Polish subcontracting, relatively cheaper labour and a slow clamber up the value chain. But it masks undertows of a new economic relationship in which Germany faces competition from its eastern back yard. A Polish-Finnish firm recently launched pioneering satellites with cloud-penetrating technology. The US army has just procured 10,000 Polish Manpad missiles (man-portable air-defence systems) after they proved more effective than American Stingers. The Polish army sourced nanosatellites newly invented by a local company. Some Polish start-ups, such as molecular diagnostics firms, are being sold for hundreds of millions of dollars. And the Polish electric car Izera will hit the market in 2026 with plans to produce 60% of components locally. No wonder that, although it does so with velvet gloves, Germany uses its EU muscle to try to impede Polish strategic infrastructural investments such as new nuclear power plants, inland waterways and the development of a container port in Szczecin-Świnoujscie – an obvious competitive threat to German ports. Globally and locally, economic cooperation based on a centre-periphery division of labour is being challenged. When your assembly line grows in power, it starts coming up with its own Lego sets. China-US rivalry may soon be echoed in regional (and friendlier) miniatures, such as a Polish-German divide. As eastern Europe grows in power, it is questioning its role in the pecking order. The region has learned the hard way that if you are not at the negotiating table, you are on the menu.

To be, at 19 years of age, the most recognised climate crisis campaigner in the world, shouldering the burden of averting – or at this late stage, merely softening – the biggest calamity humanity has ever faced? What can that possibly feel like? At the end of Amol Rajan Interviews Greta Thunberg (BBC Two), the conversation becomes more personal and we get a few answers: how Thunberg doesn’t enjoy being stopped in the street and certainly doesn’t appreciate threats to her family; how she despairs at being told her presence reassures people about the future of the planet, because it implies they are outsourcing their individual responsibility to her. But a fundamental insight into Thunberg’s existence has already been provided by the previous half-hour of questions about her advocacy of “annual, drastic, immediate emissions cuts, on a scale unlike anything the world has ever seen”. Thunberg has sacrificed her youth to tackle the climate emergency, having realised that it demands a radical reimagining of our whole way of life. Now she is doomed to the pure hell of arguing with people who cannot conceive of that way of life changing. Rajan, who asserts in his introduction that Thunberg’s influence must be acknowledged “whether you admire her or despair of her”, spends large parts of the interview reflecting mainstream discourse on climate – which is to say, he risks sounding ignorant in order to give commonplace gotchas and canards an airing. The sport is in how efficiently Thunberg can knock down questions we should, by now, have moved beyond asking. Early on, she is pressed for an opinion on nuclear power and shale gas. Aren’t they important components of a strategy to hit net zero by 2050, as per the Paris Agreement? Thunberg does say that the former is too slow and the latter is, er, a fossil fuel and thus not a cracking idea, but stresses that her concern is driving awareness of the extent of the problem, not getting bogged down in hot-button issues: arguments about which bucket of water to use will dissipate once people agree that the house is on fire. Unskewing our priorities is also the rejoinder to Rajan’s question, steeped in conservative attitudes towards which expenditures are inevitable and which must be interrogated, about how we would “pay for” free public transport, a key Thunberg objective, during a “cost of living crisis”. Thunberg is presented with several versions of the same argument: we can’t do that, because it would cost money or be inconvenient in the short term. At a time when both main UK political parties have recently used the slogan “growth, growth, growth”, Thunberg’s contention that the endless pursuit of economic expansion might just be, you know, suicidal feels like listening to an intelligent alien who is beamed down to sort us out. Rajan’s question on the topic is remarkable: “Economic growth creates leisure time, it creates opportunities for new experiences – some of which will have a negative impact on the environment, but a lot of which people really enjoy. Flying is one of those … do you think flying should be illegal?” More credibly, Rajan asks how Thunberg can call capitalism a failed ideology, when life expectancy and infant survival rates in China and India have risen as those countries have commercialised. Delicately, Thunberg observes that the collapse of life-support systems, wars for resources and other likely effects of out-of-control global warming might soon cause those graphs to slope back down. It’s not all such a struggle. Thunberg often has a refreshingly unguarded response to daft statements: her reaction to Rajan sincerely intoning that “There is one individual looming over this debate – and that’s Elon Musk” is untrammelled giggling. And, in this extended format, Rajan has time to include more profound questions. An inquiry about whether the gap between what we’re doing and what we need to do is widening (yes) is valuable, as is a discussion about whether Thunberg ought not to encourage blanket cynicism towards politicians, and should consider going into politics herself. She counters that although politicians will ultimately implement the required action, public opinion will be what compels them to act, and protest is an effective way of amplifying that consensus. The politicians themselves then become irrelevant, and we can “reconsider what is politically possible” – the payment of reparations to poorer countries deeply affected by a changing climate they have done little to cause, to take the example Rajan puts forward of a demand that is absurdly unrealistic, might well become feasible. Her main point is that this needs to happen soon. We are desperately short of time, and Thunberg has given herself the task of communicating that urgency. As this programme shows, it is a terribly difficult job."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2021/apr/22/israel-confirms-syrian-missile-landed-near-dimona-nuclear-reactor","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-22T16:19:34Z","webTitle":"Israel confirms Syrian missile landed near Dimona nuclear reactor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/22/israel-confirms-syrian-missile-landed-near-dimona-nuclear-reactor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/apr/22/israel-confirms-syrian-missile-landed-near-dimona-nuclear-reactor","fields":{"headline":"Israel confirms Syrian missile landed near Dimona nuclear reactor","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Israel has acknowledged that its air defences failed to intercept a missile fired from Syria overnight that traversed 125 miles of its highly protected airspace and landed near its secretive Dimona nuclear reactor. The surface-to-air missile was believed to have been fired by Syrian air defences against Israeli jets that were bombing a site near Damascus, but the path it flew initially led to speculation that Israel’s most sensitive site may have instead been a target. The defence minister, Benny Gantz, claimed the missile had landed in Israel as a result of errant Syrian anti-aircraft fire. In doing so he raised concerns about the effectiveness of his country’s vaunted air defence capabilities, which have been entrusted to counter such threats. Gantz said Israel’s anti-missile systems had attempted to intercept the SA-5 but were unsuccessful. “In most cases we achieve other results. This is a slightly more complex case. We will investigate it and move on,” he said The incident follows the publication of an analysis in an Iranian newspaper at the weekend that called for the Dimona reactor to be targeted to avenge an apparent Israeli sabotage operation at the Natanz nuclear site in Iran a fortnight ago. Syria is a staunch ally of Iran, and Iranian forces use Syrian territory to stockpile weapons to supply to its Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah. However, despite hundreds of Israeli attacks targeting Iranian interests, Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, has remained reluctant to launch offensive attacks against Israel, fearing his war-ravaged country could be drawn into a broader conflict with a technically superior foe. Directly firing a large missile at Dimona could have been a trigger for such an escalation. Instead, Israeli officials claim that the impact of the missile was likely to have been inadvertent, and are now focusing on how its various defence systems failed to intercept it. The missile landed around 20 miles short of the Dimona site, in Israel’s Negev desert. Israel has some of the most tightly protected airspace in the world and has shot down drones and missiles at various points over the past decade, including during a similar incident in early 2017 in which one Syrian missile downed an Israeli jet and another landed in the country’s north. Air raid sirens sounded at about 1.30am in Abu Krinat, a village in Israel’s desert. Security sources said the projectile exploded in mid-air – a common technique used by anti-aircraft missiles to guarantee they hit jets – and that fragments landing on the ground. Israel’s military said its forces responded to the missile by bombing the “battery from which the missile was launched and additional Syrian surface-to-air batteries in the area”. With tensions already high with Iran, Israel may be seen as wanting to play down any attempted attack or risk a confrontation. Still, Israel has in the past been quick to blame Syria or Iran for other alleged strikes, including when it accused Iranian forces of firing rockets at its troops in 2018. Israel and Iran have fought an increasingly open war across the region in the past three years, with more than 1,000 airstrikes inside Syria and Iraq, missiles fired, and mines placed by both sides against commercial shipping, and the assassination of Iranian nuclear officials, which western intelligence agencies have blamed on Israel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jun/15/two-us-volunteers-in-ukraine-feared-taken-prisoner-by-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-16T00:12:21Z","webTitle":"Two US volunteers in Ukraine feared taken prisoner by Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/15/two-us-volunteers-in-ukraine-feared-taken-prisoner-by-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jun/15/two-us-volunteers-in-ukraine-feared-taken-prisoner-by-russia","fields":{"headline":"Two US volunteers in Ukraine feared taken prisoner by Russia","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Two American volunteers in Ukraine have gone missing and are feared to have been taken prisoner by Russia, officials and family members said on Wednesday. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh, 27, are both US military veterans who had been living in Alabama and went to Ukraine to assist with war efforts. Relatives have been in contact with Senate and House offices seeking information on the men’s whereabouts. The pair haven’t been heard from in days, members of the state’s congressional delegation have said. Captive Americans would add another layer of complexity to efforts by the US, which is pumping billions of dollars into Ukraine but trying to steer clear of direct confrontation with Russia. If confirmed, they would be the first Americans fighting for Ukraine known to have been captured since the war began in February. Drueke’s mother reached out earlier this week, said Terri Sewell, her local congresswoman. “According to his family, they have not heard from Drueke in several days,” Sewell said in a statement. “We will continue to do everything in our power to assist in locating him and finding answers for his family.” White House spokesman John Kirby said he could not confirm the disappearance of the two Americans but said, “If it’s true, we’ll do everything we can to get them safely back home.” He said that the US discouraged Americans from traveling to Ukraine, which has endured a nearly four-month war against invading Russian forces. “It is a war zone. It is combat. And if you feel passionate about supporting Ukraine, there’s any number of other ways to do that that are safer and just as effective,” Kirby told reporters. The Telegraph, which first reported their disappearances, quoted an unnamed fellow fighter who said the two men were captured after running into a larger Russian force during a 9 June battle north-east of Kharkiv. Drueke’s mother, Lois Drueke, said her son told his family that he was teaching Ukrainian troops how to use US-made weapons. “Alex felt very strongly that he had been trained in ways that he could help the Ukrainians be strong and push Putin back,” she told the Washington Post, referring to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Two British nationals have been reported killed in the fighting and another two Britons are facing the death penalty after being captured and convicted as mercenaries by a pro-Russian court. Joe Biden earlier Wednesday announced another $1bn in military aid to Ukraine but has said that US forces will not directly engage Russia, a fellow nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/jan/31/armed-counter-terrorism-officers-british-cross-channel-ferries-security","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-31T10:14:11Z","webTitle":"Armed counter-terrorism officers to be deployed on British cross-Channel ferries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/31/armed-counter-terrorism-officers-british-cross-channel-ferries-security","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/jan/31/armed-counter-terrorism-officers-british-cross-channel-ferries-security","fields":{"headline":"Armed counter-terrorism officers to be deployed on British cross-Channel ferries","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Armed counter-terrorism officers will be deployed on British cross-Channel ferries for the first time this summer, though government sources said there was no specific threat to passenger vessels. Firearms police from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) are to be posted on ferries out of Dover, as well as on passenger ships between Newcastle and the Netherlands. The move will tighten security on British ferries, which are unguarded and seen as vulnerable, with passengers not individually searched or given body scans when boarding, unlike those on planes or Eurostar trains. A government spokesperson said: “The government will always take the strongest possible action to protect our national security and our priority remains maintaining the safety and security of our citizens. “We are constantly developing protection for UK citizens against the threat of terrorism. This includes strengthening security by fully equipping law enforcement and emergency responders to respond to terrorist incidents, no matter where they occur.” It is understood about 40 CNC officers will be posted on a rotation basis on ferries with a trial starting in July. The CNC has officers available as a result of nuclear power stations being decommissioned. A senior counter-terrorism source told the Times that ferries were seen as extremely vulnerable and “completely unguarded”. “Ferries are the weak link when it comes to policing transport against terror attacks. Moving a handful of CNC officers to ferries makes sense and they will be a visible deterrent,” the source said. A government source confirmed to the Guardian there was “no specific threat to passenger vessels” and the treaty and other cooperation with France formed part of the UK government’s wider strategy to ensure it was able to protect UK citizens against terrorism “no matter where it occurs”. With the decommissioning of nuclear power stations, the number of officers required to protect them is falling. The decision to redeploy CNC officers is part of a plan to extend the force’s remit to enable them to offer services beyond the civil nuclear sector and provide support to other police forces. A UK-France maritime security treaty was signed in July to improve joint working. It will come into force once the UK and France have completed ratification procedures and is designed to mitigate against a high-threat security incident on a ferry or other large vessel in the Channel.

US intelligence says Ukrainian forces are making “slow but meaningful progress” on the battlefield. “We’ll see how things pan out,” defence undersecretary Colin Kahl said. “But I certainly think things are going better on the Ukrainian side right now in the south than is true on the Russian side.” The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based thinktank, reported on Wednesday that Ukrainian forces probably captured Verbivka, less than two miles (3.2km) north-west of Balakliia, on Tuesday, citing geo-locatable images posted by Ukrainian soldiers. Shelling resumed near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Wednesday. Ukrainian officials accused Russian forces of firing on the city of Nikopol, across from the plant, as well as in Enerhodar, where the power plant is located. “Employees of communal and other services simply do not have time to complete emergency and restoration work, as another shelling reduces their work to zero,” the Ukrainian mayor of Enerhodar, Dmytro Orlov, said on Telegram. The UN has accused Moscow of forcing Ukrainians into detention camps and even prisons via a Kremlin-directed “filtration” program, and removing children from the war zone to hand over to adoptive parents inside Russia. “We are concerned that the Russian authorities have adopted a simplified procedure to grant Russian citizenship to children without parental care, and that these children would be eligible for adoption by Russian families,” Ilze Brands Kehris, assistant UN secretary-general for human rights, told the security council. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the council that estimates indicate authorities have “interrogated, detained, and forcibly deported” between 900,000 and 1.6 million Ukrainians to Russia since late February in an attempt “to prepare for an attempted annexation”. The body of a British aid worker who was captured by Russian proxies in April has been handed to Ukraine with “possible signs of unspeakable torture”, according to the country’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. Paul Urey, 45, from Warrington, Cheshire, was captured along with another Briton, Dylan Healey. The two men were charged with “mercenary activities” by the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, but in July the Russian proxy authorities announced that Urey had died as a result of “illness and stress”. Kuleba said Urey’s body had been returned, showing possible signs of torture. Vladimir Putin has threatened to tear up a fragile Ukraine grain deal allowing exports from the Black Sea. During a bellicose speech at an economic conference in Vladivostok, Putin said he would speak with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, about “limiting the destinations for grain exports”, claiming that only two of 87 ships leaving Ukraine with grain had gone to developing countries. Data from the UN showed the claim was false by a factor of at least 10. Putin also threatened to cut off all deliveries of gas, oil, and coal to Europe if they imposed a price cap on Russian energy imports. “Will there be any political decisions that contradict the contracts? Yes, we just won’t fulfil them. We will not supply anything at all if it contradicts our interests,” he said, according to a Reuters translation of his remarks. “We will not supply gas, oil, coal, heating oil – we will not supply anything.” Recalling a Russian fairytale, he said that Europeans could “freeze like the wolf’s tail”. Putin declared that Russia had “lost nothing” in launching a war on Ukraine during a belligerent and defiant speech at the Russian Eastern Economic Forum on Wednesday. “We haven’t lost anything and we won’t lose anything,” he said, when asked about the cost of the invasion. “The main gain is the strengthening of our sovereignty.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/mar/27/boris-johnson-to-confront-bitter-tory-splits-over-uk-energy-strategy-and-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-27T08:15:20Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson to confront bitter Tory splits over UK energy strategy and bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/27/boris-johnson-to-confront-bitter-tory-splits-over-uk-energy-strategy-and-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/mar/27/boris-johnson-to-confront-bitter-tory-splits-over-uk-energy-strategy-and-bills","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson to confront bitter Tory splits over UK energy strategy and bills","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Boris Johnson is expected to hold crunch talks with senior cabinet ministers this week to resolve fractious talks over plans to tackle rising bills and boost the country’s energy security. The government’s energy strategy has been delayed by cabinet splits over onshore wind, funding for nuclear energy and the role fracking should play given spiralling energy prices and the Ukraine invasion. It is understood that major disagreements still remain between the prime minister, chancellor Rishi Sunak and Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary. The cabinet tensions have only grown since the chancellor’s spring statement last week, which drew criticism for failing to do enough on the cost of living. Sunak now faces pressure from Number 10 to sanction spending on new nuclear power and renewables projects. Kwarteng’s department is said to be keen on schemes that would boost onshore wind by giving energy bill discounts for those who live near turbines – a scheme that has been run successfully by Octopus Energy. The prime minister is also said to favour accelerating the creation of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) produced by Rolls-Royce, but Sunak has been warning about the long-term costs involved in a big expansion of nuclear power. Voters now regard energy as the second most important issue facing the UK, even ahead of the economy. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer found that 48% of voters flagged it as an important issue, up 17 points from a month ago. Only health and the NHS are greater concerns. The disputes are rumbling on alongside concerns that some of the help already offered by the chancellor on household bills will not reach vulnerable households. The Observer has been told that more than a million households are set to miss out on one of the main measures. An official assessment of its much-vaunted £150 council tax rebate predicted that 1.3m households won’t receive it. In its assessment of the spring statement, the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted that a fifth of those who did not pay their council tax by direct debit would not take up the rebate, thereby saving the exchequer £195m. Local councils warned they had not been given the resources to deliver the rebate. The most vulnerable households are more likely to be among those who do not receive the tax cut automatically. The government has said it is the job of local councils to ensure that those who do not receive the rebate automatically do not miss out. However, the Observer has seen pleas from councils to ministers that they have not been given the resources to help them ensure no one misses out. One council leader said distributing the rebate would cost it “in the region of £450,000, with no government funding to assist”. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said: “It is staggering that more than a million families are set to miss out because of this Conservative government’s half-baked plans. Often those who don’t pay council tax by direct debit are older and more deprived, meaning some of these households are likely to be among the most vulnerable in the country. “People are facing sky-rocketing bills and plummeting living standards, but it looks like even the meagre support on offer from the Conservatives won’t reach those who need it most. Rishi Sunak must confirm that anyone who misses out on the rebate will get their £150 cheque in the post. No one should go without the help they need because of this Conservative government’s incompetence.” A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “Direct debit is the quickest and easiest way to pay council tax, and the best way for most people to get the rebate. Councils are responsible for making sure eligible households who don’t pay their council tax by direct debit receive the rebate and we have suggested a range of payment options. With the support of councils, we are confident that all those eligible for a rebate will receive their payments in good time.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/27/james-lovelock-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T15:54:11Z","webTitle":"James Lovelock obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/27/james-lovelock-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/27/james-lovelock-obituary","fields":{"headline":"James Lovelock obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The scientist James Lovelock’s discoveries had an immense influence on our understanding of the global impact of humankind, and on the search for extraterrestrial life. A vigorous writer and speaker, he became a hero to the green movement, although he was one of its most formidable critics. His research highlighted some of the issues that became the most intense environmental concerns of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, among them the insidious spread through the living world of industrial pollutants; the destruction of the ozone layer; and the potential menace of global heating. He supported nuclear power and defended the chemical industries – and his warnings took an increasingly apocalyptic note. “The planet we live on has merely to shrug to take some fraction of a million people to their deaths,” Lovelock wrote in 2006. “But this is nothing compared with what may soon happen; we are now so abusing the Earth that it may rise and move back into the hot state it was in 55m years ago, and if it does, most of us, and our descendants, will die.” In a speech to the Royal Society, he described the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as “the scariest official document I have ever read”. Lovelock, who has died on his 103rd birthday, was best known through the Gaia theory, a controversial idea that he proposed in the 1960s and developed with the US biologist Lynn Margulis in the 70s. They suggested a radically different way of looking at the evolution of life. Their proposition challenged the view of Earth as just a lump of rock, a passive host to millions of species of plants and animals that simply adapted to their environment. Gaia held that those countless millions of organisms not only competed, but also cooperated to maintain an environment in which life could be sustained: a process of co-evolution. It was a conjecture that jarred with many scholars, such as Richard Dawkins, the evolutionary biologist, who regarded the notion as a profound heresy against Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection anchored in the thesis of survival of the fittest. Gaia was an instant inspiration for the green movement; but it took years to get overt recognition from the scientific establishment. That came in 1988 when the American Geophysical Union held a meeting in San Diego, California, that drew leading physicists, biologists and climatologists to weigh the evidence for Gaia and debate its implications for the future of science. In 2001, more than 1,000 scientists met in Amsterdam to declare that the planet “behaves as a single self-regulating system comprised of physical, chemical, biological and human components”. In effect, Lovelock and Margulis had won the day: the details could be debated, but the broad argument was settled. Early in his career, Lovelock devised techniques to freeze and then re-animate cell tissue, and even whole animals such as hamsters. Just for fun, in 1954, he used microwave radiation from a continuous wave magnetron to cook a potato. “It may have been the first working microwave oven used to cook food that was then eaten,” he wrote. “If it was, then I did invent it.” He worked with the actors Leo McKern and Joan Greenwood on a BBC drama, The Critical Point (1957), about the experimental freezing of a human, and used a home-made electronic sound generator to simulate the failing breath, the fading heartbeat and the death rattle of an actor. He was later told that his tape inspired the BBC to found its pioneering radiophonic workshop. He designed new types of extraordinarily sensitive instruments that could detect the presence of unimaginably tiny concentrations of man-made chemicals in gases. When they were used to study the chemistry of the atmosphere they pointed the finger at the spread of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as the source of destruction of the ozone layer. Similarly, they revealed the accumulation of residues of pesticides in the tissues of virtually all living creatures, from penguins in Antarctica to mothers’ milk in Europe and the US. Throughout his life he went on delivering inventive ideas. With Chris Rapley, then director of the Science Museum in London, Lovelock proposed in the journal Nature in 2007 a way by which humans could churn the world’s oceans to stimulate algal growth, draw down extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, increase the formation of sunlight-reflecting clouds and thus damp down global heating. Lovelock was born in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, but was brought up in Brixton, south London, where his parents, Tom and Nellie, ran a shop selling picture frames. He was educated at the local grammar, the Strand school. At an early age, he discovered the public library, which he said fired a fascination with science. By comparison, he found science lessons at school dull. In the unfettered freedom of the library, he soaked up information with equal relish from science fiction or any science textbook that caught his interest, on astronomy, natural history, biology, physics and chemistry. Lovelock’s practical flair was also given free rein. He recalled inventing a gadget as a schoolboy, an airspeed indicator that he held out of the window during train journeys. His parents could not support their son at university, so Lovelock got a job as a laboratory technician in industry, and studied for a BSc at evening classes. In 1940 he joined the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, where he stayed for 20 years. Then a Quaker, he was a conscientious objector during the second world war. While at the NIMR, he took a PhD in biomedical science and made the most important of his inventions, the electron capture detector. It was a matchbox size device that could detect and measure tiny traces of toxic chemicals. Like many great inventors Lovelock was not really a team player. He craved independence. The electron capture detector earned him enough money to get that freedom, and in later years he liked to describe himself as an “independent scientist since 1964”. “Any artist or novelist would understand,” he wrote in his autobiography, Homage to Gaia (2000), “some of us do not produce their best when directed.” Lovelock’s transition to independence began when he left the NIMR in 1961 to work for Nasa, the US space agency. He was invited to design experiments for the Surveyor series of unmanned spacecraft that were to examine the surface of the moon before the US government would authorise a lunar landing attempt by the Apollo astronauts. He moved from the moon project to work with Nasa’s interplanetary exploration team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California, on ideas for looking for signs of life on Mars. He was surprised at the shortage of suggestions from the universities and research institutes to a request from Nasa for proposals to study the biological aspects of the Red Planet. He attributed the lack of interest to an obsession with molecular biology and genetic evolution triggered by the stunning discovery by Francis Crick and James Watson of how the genetic code was carried by DNA. Lovelock was disappointed in the shift in the focus of research in biology from the big picture to the small. The study of life concentrated more on a closer examination of molecules and atoms rather than on whole organisms, with the implication that the whole was never more than the sum of its parts and scientists could figure out how organisms worked by taking them to pieces. Lovelock’s experiments to look for signs of life on Mars were conceived quite differently, through a holistic approach rather than a reductionist one; and his approach had an important influence in the thinking he and Margulis shared in establishing the principles of the Gaia theory. Nasa plans to look for evidence of extraterrestrial life were targeted initially on Earth’s neighbouring planets, Venus and Mars. Lovelock predicted from a study of the chemical composition of their atmospheres that both Mars and Venus would be lifeless. Then, with a bit of pure lateral thinking, he wondered how Earth might appear to an extraterrestrial intelligence. He pursued the idea in a conversation with Dian Hitchcock, a colleague at JPL, about why there were such extreme differences between the atmosphere of Earth and those of Mars and Venus. He said the conclusion he reached was probably the moment Gaia was born. The atmospheres of both Mars and Venus comprised over 95% carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and other gases. In contrast, the Earth’s atmosphere was 77% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with traces of carbon dioxide and other gases. He looked for an explanation as to what made the Earth’s atmosphere so different, and unique in our solar system. The evidence that the sun’s energy had increased 30% during the three and a half billion years life had existed on the planet, and yet the Earth’s surface temperature had remained constant, particularly puzzled him. Lovelock reckoned that, according to standard physics, the planet’s surface should have boiled with the increasing heat, rather than remain cool. The only explanation, he decided, was that the Earth was a self-regulating system that had found a way to preserve its equilibrium: and that the organisms on Earth had kept their environment stable. He reasoned that the Earth’s atmosphere was a continually changing balance of gases because of its living and breathing inhabitants, while the Martian atmosphere was static. The regulatory mechanism began when the earliest life-forms in the ancient oceans extracted carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and released oxygen back into it. Over vast spans of geological time, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere declined to the present composition to favour the oxygen-dependent organisms. Lovelock and Margulis argued that the biosphere of planet Earth could be considered a self-evolving and self-regulating system that unconsciously and subtly manipulated atmosphere, water and rocks to its own advantage. When he was developing his theory, Lovelock described his ideas to his then friend and neighbour in the Wiltshire village of Bowerchalke, the novelist William Golding, and asked his advice on a suitable name. Golding suggested Gaia, after the Greek goddess who drew the living world forth from Chaos. As an illustration of the Gaia theory, Lovelock invented the Daisyworld model of coevolution. Daisyworld involved a field of black and white daisies. If the temperature rose, the black flowers absorbed more heat than the white ones, and withered. The white daisies proliferated. Eventually, the white daisies reflected more heat back into space, cooling the planet down again and allowed the black daisies to re-emerge. Although Gaia exerted a great influence on the green movement, Lovelock had, by his own admission, “never been wholly on the side of environmentalism”. He acted as a consultant to corporate groups such as Hewlett-Packard and Shell, and in Homage to Gaia wrote: “Too many greens are not just ignorant of science, they hate science.” He likened them to “some global over-anxious mother figure who is so concerned about small risks that she ignores the real dangers”. He wished they “would grow up” and focus on the real problem: “How can we feed, house and clothe the abundant human race without destroying the habitats of other creatures?” Unlike most environmentalists, Lovelock favoured nuclear energy. “Some time in the next century, when the adverse effects of climate change begin to bite, people will look back in anger at those who now so foolishly continue to pollute by burning fossil fuel instead of accepting the beneficence of nuclear power. Is our distrust of nuclear power and genetically modified food soundly based?” he asked. He filed more than 40 patents, and wrote more than 200 scientific papers, as well as several books on the Gaia theory. He was awarded scientific medals, and showered with international prizes and honorary doctorates by British and other universities. From his first book, Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth (1979), to his last, published when he was 99, Lovelock wrote elegantly and persuasively. He remained an optimist. In Novacene: The Coming Age of Hyperintelligence (2019), he delivered what he called “a shout of joy” for the colossal expansion of human knowledge during his lifetime, and hoped for the potential salvation of humanity by a new generation of artificially intelligent cyborgs that would – unlike many of his fellow humans – understand the importance of other living things in maintaining a habitable planet. In 1977, Lovelock and his wife Helen – already ill with multiple sclerosis – moved from Bowerchalke to Coombe Mill, near the Devon/Cornwall border, which grew into a 35-acre woodland experimental farm. In later years he lived in Abbotsbury, near the Dorset coast. Helen (nee Hyslop), whom he had married in 1942, died in 1989. His second wife, Sandy (nee Orchard), whom he married in 1991, survives him, along with two sons, Andrew and John, and two daughters, Jane and Christine, from his first marriage. • James Ephraim Lovelock, chemist, biomedical scientist and inventor, born 26 July 1919; died 26 July 2022 • Pearce Wright died in 2005"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/jan/21/global-nuclear-weapons-ban-begins-without-the-worlds-nuclear-powers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-01-21T22:00:30Z","webTitle":"Global nuclear weapons ban begins - without the world's nuclear powers signing up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/21/global-nuclear-weapons-ban-begins-without-the-worlds-nuclear-powers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/jan/21/global-nuclear-weapons-ban-begins-without-the-worlds-nuclear-powers","fields":{"headline":"Global nuclear weapons ban begins – without the world's nuclear powers","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"An international treaty banning all nuclear weapons that has been ratified by 51 countries and that campaigners hope will help raise the profile of global deterrence efforts comes into force on Friday. Although in some respects the step is largely symbolic because the world’s nuclear powers have not signed up, the treaty will be legally binding on the smaller nations that have endorsed it, and it is backed by the UN leadership. The treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons (TPNW) outlaws the creation, ownership and deployment of nuclear weapons by signatory states and places obligations on them to assist other victims of nuclear weapons use and testing. Britain’s Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament has released polling saying that 59% of the UK public support the country signing up to the TPNW and that 77% support a “total ban on all nuclear weapons globally”. Kate Hudson, CND’s general secretary, called on the UK government “to cease its intransigence and engage constructively with the new treaty”, arguing that the polling showed this position would command popular support. But there is no prospect of the world’s leading nuclear powers endorsing it. Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of Nato, said in November the treaty disregarded the realities of global security. “Giving up our deterrent without any guarantees that others will do the same is a dangerous option,” he said. “A world where Russia, China, North Korea and others have nuclear weapons, but Nato does not, is not a safer world.” Recent years have seen a gradual erosion of global nuclear controls, with the 1987 intermediate nuclear forces (INF) treaty, which kept nuclear missiles off European soil, allowed to expire in 2019 amid mutual recriminations from Russia and the US. The new strategic arms reduction treaty between the US and Russia, which limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, is due to expire on 5 February – although Nato is calling on both sides to extend it following this week’s inauguration of Joe Biden as American president. The TPNW emerged following the creation of a UN working group in 2016. It was supported by 123 countries, with 38 voting against. The US, UK, France and Russia were all opposed, as was Israel, which is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons. China, India and Pakistan abstained. Countries that have ratified the agreement include Nigeria, Malaysia, Ireland, Malta, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Vietnam and the Vatican City – although last autumn the US made a last-ditch lobbying attempt to try to convince countries to rescind their signatures. That effort failed, and in October Honduras became the 50th country to sign the document, which meant that it would gain legal force after a 90-day period. Rebecca Johnson, a veteran disarmament campaigner and a leading figure behind the development of the treaty, said: “This is an example of UN multilateralism in action. Britain needs to be at the table, taking the next steps towards ridding the world of nuclear weapons.” The Foreign Office said the UK was “committed to the long-term goal of a world without nuclear weapons”. A spokesperson added: “We firmly believe the best way to achieve this is through gradual multilateral disarmament.” • This article was amended on 27 January 2021 to clarify that 51 countries have ratified the treaty, rather than signed it as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/jun/14/cbi-boss-says-world-is-way-off-track-in-fight-against-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-14T06:02:45Z","webTitle":"CBI boss says world is ‘way off track’ in fight against climate crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/14/cbi-boss-says-world-is-way-off-track-in-fight-against-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/jun/14/cbi-boss-says-world-is-way-off-track-in-fight-against-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"CBI boss says world is ‘way off track’ in fight against climate crisis","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The head of the UK’s biggest business lobby group has warned that the corporate world is “way off track” in tackling the climate crisis. Tony Danker, the director general of the CBI, called on the government to do more to unlock the resources of the private sector by publishing new guidance on heating and transport. “Tackling the planet’s climate crisis before it’s too late has always been a seismic challenge demanding global cooperation on an unprecedented scale,” he will say in a speech at the CBI’s Road to Zero conference on Monday. “The world has no room for failure. The climate crisis is worsening and currently we’re way off track.” The CBI, which represents the UK’s biggest employers, wants the government to “fill in the blanks” in its plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 68% by the end of this decade, and by 78% compared with 1990 levels by 2035. Danker called for the government to put forward detailed plans on a charging network for electric vehicles, the phasing out of gas boilers, new offshore windfarms, and funding formulas for new nuclear power stations. Last year, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced a much-heralded “10-point plan” for a green industrial revolution, but few of the aspirations it contained came with any concrete policies attached. Danker told the Guardian: “I think the 10-point plan is very good, but it does not have quite enough detail. We need a blueprint to build, to make sure we move from ambition to action.” Without such detail and policies, the UK would miss out on much-needed investment from international companies, he warned. “Companies are alert and keen to play in Britain, but they are now saying they need more granularity [detail] to make real investment decisions,” he said. The UK will host vital UN climate talks, called Cop26, in Glasgow this November to attempt to put the world on track to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, of limiting global heating to well below 2C and preferably less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The CBI is holding a conference on the long-term goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The organisation has set out its recommendations on achieving the targets, which include seven new gigafactories to build batteries and other components for electric vehicles, a plan for a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging and a review into fuel duty by the end of this year. A new strategy to decarbonise homes should include a requirement for new gas boilers sold after 2025 to be “hydrogen ready”, and no new gas boilers should be sold from 2035. He said the government should learn from the failure of its green homes grant scheme, which was intended to insulate tens of thousands of homes but was scrapped after six months amid widespread complaints from consumers. “It’s OK to get the execution wrong, but you can’t scrap the intention – they need to come back with a better plan,” he said. Danker stopped short of recommending a halt to airport expansion, which campaigners have called for, saying instead that the government should pour more effort into “jet zero” plans for low-carbon flying using fuels and technology that have yet to be developed. The UK government said: “The UK is a world leader in the global effort to tackle climate change. We were the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to climate change by 2050, and have just committed to a highly ambitious climate target to cut emissions by 78% by 2035 compared to 1990 levels. “We are powering forward with the prime minister’s 10-point plan, which will mobilise £12bn of government investment to create and support up to 250,000 highly skilled green jobs in the UK, and attract over three times as much private sector investment by 2030.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/12/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-170-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T00:52:42Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 170 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/12/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-170-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/12/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-170-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 170 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has told officials to stop talking to reporters about Kyiv’s military tactics against Russia, saying such remarks were “frankly irresponsible”. The president’s comments come after news organisations cited unidentified officials saying Ukrainian forces were responsible for blasts that destroyed a Russian air base in Crimea on Tuesday, despite Kyiv declining to say whether it was behind the explosions. The devastation at the Russian air base in Crimea suggests Kyiv may have obtained new long-range strike capability with potential to change the course of the war. The base is well beyond the range of advanced rockets that western countries acknowledge sending to Ukraine so far, with some western military experts saying the scale of the damage and the apparent precision of the strike suggested a powerful new capability with potentially important implications. The UN has urged a demilitarised zone around Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as Russia and Ukraine trade accusations over more shelling of the plant on Thursday. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company said it had been shelled five times by Russian forces on Thursday, resulting in staff being unable to change shifts. However, Russian news agency Tass reported that the local Russian-imposed authorities in occupied Zaporizhzhia said the plant had been fired upon by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s Energoatom agency said the plant was operating normally. The United States supports calls for a demilitarised zone around the Zaporizhzhia plant after fighting involving Russian and Ukrainian forces in the vicinity of the plant, a State Department spokesperson said on Thursday. “Fighting near a nuclear plant is dangerous and irresponsible and we continue to call on Russia to cease all military operations at or near Ukrainian nuclear facilities and return full control to Ukraine, and support Ukrainian calls for a demilitarised zone around the nuclear power plant,” the spokesperson said. The British defence secretary has said Vladimir Putin is now unlikely to succeed in occupying Ukraine. Ben Wallace said that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “faltered” and was “starting to fail”, as he pledged more financial and military support to the eastern European nation’s defence. Russia has doubled the number of air strikes on Ukraine’s military positions and civilian infrastructure compared with the previous week, Ukrainian Brigadier General Oleksiy Hromov said on Thursday. “The enemy’s planes and helicopters avoid flying into the range of our air defences, and therefore the accuracy of these strikes is low,” he told a news conference. Ukraine aims to evacuate two thirds of residents from areas it controls in the eastern battleground region of Donetsk before winter, partly out of concern people won’t be able to stay warm amid war-damaged infrastructure, the deputy prime minister said on Thursday. The government plans to evacuate some 220,000 people out of around 350,000, including 52,000 children, Iryna Vereshchuk told a news conference. Ukraine expects a ship to arrive on Friday to load grain for delivery to Ethiopia under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey, Reuters reports. Ukraine expects $3bn of US financial aid to arrive in August and a further $1.5bn in September, its finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, said on Thursday. Marchenko said the payments were part of the $7.5bn financial aid package agreed by Ukraine and the US at the start of the summer and would be used to finance “critical spending” such as healthcare and pension costs. Belarus has said that blasts heard overnight at one of its military bases 19 miles from Ukraine were caused by a “technical incident”. At least eight explosions were heard after midnight near Zyabrovka military airport, according to reports on Telegram messenger. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports. McDonald’s will start reopening some of its restaurants in Ukraine in the coming months, in a show of support after the American fast-food chain pulled out of Russia. The burger giant closed its Ukrainian restaurants after Russia’s invasion nearly six months ago but has continued to pay more than 10,000 McDonald’s employees in the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/nov/29/try-being-trustworthy-martin-lewiss-advice-to-mps-seeking-to-restore-trust-in-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-29T19:03:22Z","webTitle":"Try being trustworthy!

Martin Lewis’s advice to MPs seeking to restore trust in politics","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Here’s a thought. One that should keep some MPs awake at night. Are politicians intrinsically untrustworthy? Are only people who are predisposed to being economical with the truth attracted to a career in public life? Or are they a misunderstood bunch? The good guys. Just ordinary men and women who want to make the world a better place. It’s just the nature of the job that forces them into some uneasy compromises with the truth. If so, does a bit of them die each time they trade in half-truths and lies? Are they corroded from the inside till they are little more than a fragile carapace? Or are they born again each day, untainted by the falsehoods of the past? These existential questions were on the minds of the culture select committee as it gathered to take evidence on misinformation from the money-saving expert Martin Lewis, AKA, in many quarters, the most trusted man in Britain. A man who can be guaranteed to tell the truth. “What makes someone a trusted voice?” asked the Scottish National party MP John Nicolson. A man who had good cause to wonder, as he was later to be referred to the privileges committee for the heinous crime of trying to get Nadine Dorries referred to the privileges committee for misleading the select committee by making public his correspondence with the speaker. Go figure. Only in parliament. Lewis didn’t need a moment to think. The key thing was to be inherently trustworthy in the first place. On this bombshell … Trustworthiness wasn’t something that could be created. Or marketed. He’d once been in a meeting where some energy companies had begged David Cameron to help them become more trustworthy. Lewis had interrupted the love-in. He would do anything he could to stop trusting the energy companies, because most of the information they passed on through their call centres was incorrect. And much the same applied to politicians, he continued. The problem was cabinet collective responsibility and the whipping system. Everyone knew that MPs voted for things in which they did not believe to stay onside with their party. So politicians shouldn’t complain when people think they tell lies. Or get too precious if they do defy the party line and act on principle. Take it on the chin. When it comes to the truth, MPs are near the bottom of the food chain. Take Rishi Sunak. All those promises he made during his summer leadership campaign? Forget them. He lost the leadership contest to the deranged Liz Truss so all bets are off. No one should for a minute imagine that he still believes the same things now as he did a few months ago. All he now believes is in a damage limitation campaign to get him through to the next election. At which point he’s toast. Everything is geared to making him not look weak and indecisive. Which is how the whole country sees him. Not even the Tories believe in him any more. Rish! has created a cabinet in his own image. Largely by force majeure. Believe it or not, the current crop of ministers are what passes for competence. Only in the UK would we have a business secretary who in a former life invented pseudonyms to sell a get-rich-quick-scheme. And Grant Shapps wonders why no one takes him seriously. Though – incredibly – he’s seen by Sunak as one of the few safe pairs of hands. Shapps was in the Commons to make a statement on Sizewell C. If you thought this was familiar, you’d be right. The government had already committed to the nuclear power station in the recent budget. But there is so little news to report – partly because there are no plans and partly because, when there is, Tory MPs start objecting – that ministers are now re-announcing old statements. It won’t be long before the transport secretary announces the opening of the M25. Understandably, Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, was underwhelmed. Why had Shapps come over all Shakespearean in his enthusiasm for renewables as he attempted to pad out his statement beyond 30 seconds. Everyone knew Shapps hated onshore wind turbines and Rish! hated solar panels. And the government had done nothing to insulate 19m homes. Shapps – or Green or Fox or whatever he was calling himself today – said the offshore turbines were too big for onshore. Everyone looked blank. Just make the onshore ones a bit smaller. Duh! Still, there was one person to admire and trust in Westminster on Tuesday. Though she wasn’t a politician. She was a politician’s wife. Then Olena Zelenska, Ukraine’s first lady, had never bargained on being a public figure. She had married a comedian and the closest she had expected to get to celebrity was the green room of a TV chatshow. Then Volodymr Zelenskiy had become president. Almost as a joke. And when Russia invaded Ukraine, he had become an unexpected hero. A politician loved and admired by millions inside and outside his country. Zelenska was in London to remind the UK of the war crimes being committed in Ukraine and she spoke to 100 or so MPs and peers – Boris Johnson was demoted to the cheap seats: how are the mighty fallen – in committee room 14. You’d have thought parliament could have found somewhere a little grander than the usual haunt of Tory leadership contests. And she was hugely impressive. Not only because she had a just cause in which she and her audience could believe. But because of her delivery. There was none of the theatrics born of the Oxbridge debating societies so often found in Westminster. Just a quiet, plain delivery. Almost fragile. Not so much a speech. More a prayer.

The government is expected to outline long-awaited proposals this week for a once-in-a-generation drive to invest in nuclear power and possibly more onshore wind and solar power, as well as approving continued North Sea oil and gas exploration. The plan expected to be set out by ministers on Thursday has been delayed amid disagreements in the cabinet about which technologies to back, including a fraught battle over new nuclear power plants, with the Treasury thought to be reluctant to invest large sums in costly projects. One industry source said heavy energy users were “not expecting anything” to help them on gas or electricity, the latter of which can cost up to 60% more than the price paid by European competitors. Earlier this month, Boris Johnson promised measures to “address the needs of British steel, British ceramics and the whole of British industry” but the business and energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, told MPs last week that the government had already taken steps to support industrial firms facing soaring costs. Against a backdrop of ballooning energy bills for strategically important companies and major manufacturing firms, energy intensive industries told the Guardian that the mixed messages had left them fearing they will receive minimal help, or none at all. Richard Warren, a spokesperson for the trade body UK Steel, said it had “long urged the government to reduce the politically and regulatory controlled elements of electricity bills in line with action taken by governments elsewhere”. Simply renewing a compensation scheme that gives electricity intensive industries a refund on the cost of the UK’s emissions trading scheme, but which expired on Friday, would be only a “partial solution”. UK Steel said the industry “needs full compensation for the costs of carbon in electricity, an increase in the relief on renewables levies, and similar reductions in network costs as already provided by governments in France, Germany, and the Netherlands”. Stephen Elliott, the chief executive of the Chemical Industries Association, warned that prolonged high energy costs could see factories reduce operations or foreign-owned firms take their business elsewhere. “I can’t stand in front of Kwasi Kwarteng and say that businesses will be shutting a week on Thursday, but I can’t say they’ll be viable and running full tilt, either,” he said. “Things are getting tighter as our ability to pass through cost to our customers is becoming increasingly more difficult. “Our continental European competitors are getting more relief [following the EU’s recent crisis framework enabling more state aid in this area]. If we leave it to the moment when a chemical plant shuts, restarting those is a very challenging thing to do from a health and safety perspective responsibly.” Over the weekend, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, rejected calls for the UK to consider rationing energy, as ministers explore ways to boost Britain’s resilience to international shocks to oil gas markets after the Russian invasion of Ukraine led to record increases in costs. Kwarteng told the Sunday Telegraph that nuclear energy and offshore wind turbines would play a bigger role in energy production, with as many as seven new nuclear plants by 2050. Chemicals companies use disproportionately large amounts of electricity in their processes. Inovyn, a chlorine manufacturer that operates from a plant in Runcorn on the banks of the Mersey, uses as much electricity as the nearby city of Liverpool. Elliott warned that some businesses owned by overseas companies might reconsider their investment in the UK if nothing is done about energy prices. “If you were to ask investors in chemicals around the world, there are good reasons for coming to the UK, but the negative factor has always been energy costs. So UK sites of foreign parents are always marked down on that front and will increasingly be so. Please don’t leave it until we are shutting, because by then it’s probably too late.” Elliott wrote to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in March calling for greater support for UK companies to pay carbon emissions costs, pointing to measures taken by European countries. A BEIS spokesperson said: “We will continue to support energy intensive industries with the costs of energy, and will set out details of further support soon. “Volatile gas prices are a global issue, underscoring the importance of building a strong, homegrown renewable energy sector to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.” •This article was amended on 4 April 2022 to add a comment from BEIS"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-278-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T13:18:57Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 278 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-278-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-278-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 278 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Fighting around the key eastern Ukraine town of Bakhmut has descended into a bloody morass with hundreds of dead and injured reported daily. As Russia moved fresh formations to the area in recent weeks, neither Russian or Ukrainian forces were able to make a significant breakthrough after months of fighting Russian forces continue to shell residential infrastructure and housing in the recently liberated city of Kherson, according to Ukraine’s military. In its latest update, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said Russian troops were digging trenches and fortifying their positions in preparation for a possible Ukrainian counteroffensive in eastern Kherson. Russians are sporadically shelling cities with no apparent strategic aim other than to cause casualties. The Guardian visited a residential district in Dnipro, where a series of houses were destroyed by a fragmentation warhead, designed to inflict maximum casualties, which had landed on Saturday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has claimed Russia will soon launch a series of new missile strikes on his country, warning his defence forces and citizens to prepare for the attack. He gave the ominous caution in his Sunday evening address. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has warned that Russia will probably continue to attack Ukraine’s power grid, gas infrastructure and basic services. He said Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, was trying to use “the winter as a weapon of war against Ukraine”. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains under Russian control, the Russia-installed administration of the occupied city of Enerhodar, home to the facility, has said. The announcement comes after the head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear energy firm suggested that there were signs that Russian forces might be preparing to leave the occupied plant. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office has said 329 children are currently considered missing in Ukraine, while 12,034 have been deported to Russia. According to the Ukrainian government’s children of war portal, 440 children have been killed as a result of Russia’s war and 851 children are now reported as injured. Russia has “unilaterally postponed” talks with the US aimed at resuming nuclear weapons inspections in Cairo this week, a US state department spokesperson confirmed. Talks between US and Russian officials were scheduled to begin tomorrow. The Russian foreign ministry confirmed in a statement that talks would no longer take place this week. The Pentagon is considering a Boeing proposal to supply Ukraine with cheap, small precision bombs fitted on to abundantly available rockets, allowing Kyiv to strike far behind Russian lines, according to a Reuters report. US and allied military inventories are shrinking, and Ukraine faces an increasing need for more sophisticated weapons as the war drags on. Russia and the US have ways to manage nuclear risks at the level of intelligence agencies, chargée d’affaires of the US embassy in Moscow Elizabeth Rood told Russia’s state news agency Ria Novosti, adding that for now there were no meetings scheduled. The Kremlin’s spokesperson has denied reports that Russian forces were planning to leave the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, telling reporters they should not look for signs where there were none. The Kremlin said it welcomed a Vatican offer to provide a negotiating platform to resolve the Ukraine conflict, but that Kyiv’s position made this “impossible”. Pope Francis reiterated 10 days ago that the Vatican was ready to do anything possible to mediate and put an end to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, in an interview with the Italian daily La Stampa. The mayor of Kyiv has traded verbal jabs with Zelenskiy and his allies over how to help residents withstand power cuts. Former professional boxer Vitali Klitschko said 430 “warming centres” were helping residents cope with the effects of Russian attacks on power stations, and more than 100 extra centres were planned in case of extreme conditions. Klitschko said Zelenskiy’s allies had engaged in “manipulation” about the city’s efforts. Foreign ministers of Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden visited Kyiv today to show support for Ukraine. Gabrielius Landsbergis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, vowed that Ukraine would win despite Russia’s “barbaric brutality”. Olena Zelenska, the wife of Ukraine’s prime minister, has visited Downing Street during her visit to London to discuss the prevention of sexual violence in conflicts. Zelenska met with Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, and prime minister Rishi Sunak’s wife, Akshata Murty. Hundreds of Ukrainians fled Kherson city on Sunday as Russian shelling intensified. The liberation of Kherson earlier this month marked a major battlefield gain for Kyiv, but the population has struggled with a lack of water, heating and electricity. Britain will promise to maintain or increase military aid to Ukraine next year, according to an extract of a speech released by the office of the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, which he plans to deliver on Monday. “We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. We will maintain or increase our military aid next year. And we will provide new support for air defence,” Sunak will reportedly say. The UK will provide Brimstone 2 missiles, a precision-guided missile, to Ukraine as part of its latest aid package. “This aid has played a crucial role in stalling Russian advancements,” the UK Ministry of Defence said in a statement. Ukrainian authorities are gradually restoring power, aided by the reconnection of the country’s four nuclear plants, but millions of people are still without heat or electricity after the most devastating Russian airstrikes of the war. “We have been restoring electricity generation and supply day after day,” Zelenskiy said in his Sunday night address. Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s survival may depend on his value to Vladimir Putin as a future bargaining chip, his chief aide has said. Leonid Volkov, speaking on a visit to London, added that Navalny had lost access to his family and was being permanently detained in a “8 by 12ft” cell after being forced into indefinite solitary confinement by Russian authorities last week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/08/scottishpower-build-150m-green-hydrogen-plant-port-felixstowe","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T13:10:08Z","webTitle":"ScottishPower to build £150m green hydrogen plant at Port of Felixstowe ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/08/scottishpower-build-150m-green-hydrogen-plant-port-felixstowe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/08/scottishpower-build-150m-green-hydrogen-plant-port-felixstowe","fields":{"headline":"ScottishPower to build £150m green hydrogen plant at Port of Felixstowe ","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"ScottishPower is planning to build a £150m green hydrogen plant at the Port of Felixstowe to power trains, trucks and ships, the Guardian can reveal. The energy company has drawn up proposals for a 100megawatt plant at the Suffolk port which will provide enough fuel to power 1300 hydrogen trucks from 2026. The company, owned by €63bn Spanish utilities giant Iberdrola, said demand for the green fuel had stepped up since petrol and diesel prices began to soar last year, emboldening the firm to invest. It has submitted an application to the government’s Net Zero Hydrogen Fund, which provides state backing to develop low-carbon hydrogen projects for the next three years. ScottishPower estimated the whole project could cost between £100m and £150m. ScottishPower plans to build the facility, which will be around the size of a football pitch, on brownfield land within the port, which is one of the busiest in the UK and a trade hub. Green hydrogen is produced by using renewable electricity to drive an electrolyser that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The gas is burned to produce power, emitting water vapour, warm air, and no carbon greenhouse gases. But, depending on the method of burning, it can also cause health-harming air pollution and, as a climate-heating gas itself, any leakage of hydrogen could offset some of the advantages of its use. ScottishPower plans to supply hydrogen to the vehicles and machinery used by the Port of Felixstowe, which is owned by Hutchison Ports, part of Hong Kong based multinational CK Hutchison. About 6,000 heavy goods vehicles a year use the port and logistics providers are increasingly studying hydrogen as an option to cut fuel bills and carbon emissions. The hydrogen will also be used to power trains used for rail freight into the port and shipping vessels. ScottishPower, headquartered in Glasgow, already has significant interests in East Anglia, where it has offshore windfarms. Iberdrola owns Europe’s largest production site for green hydrogen for industrial use, at Puertollano in Spain. Barry Carruthers, the hydrogen director at ScottishPower, told the Guardian: “The strength of demand from the port itself, logistics and distribution companies and rail freight companies has given use the confidence to press ahead with this facility. This is a big, industrial scale project that we’re doing at pace. “The cost of hydrogen is now comparable with diesel so this can be cheaper and cleaner for customers. The market has given us a really good glide path.” ScottishPower is already in the process of developing a smaller hydrogen facility at Whitelee, the UK’s largest onshore windfarm near Glasgow, in partnership with Sheffield’s ITM Power. The 20MW electrolyser, which is due to produce hydrogen by next year, is expected to make up to 8 tonnes of green hydrogen a day, roughly equivalent to fuelling 550 buses to travel from Glasgow to Edinburgh and back again each day. Carruthers said the Felixstowe site would also offer the opportunity to produce “green ammonia” from green hydrogen, which can then be used in agricultural fertiliser. Further up the Suffolk coast, environmental campaigners have protested against proposals for the £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station. But Carruthers said the proposed hydrogen plant “will not dominate the skyline” and is likely to be built within the grounds of the port. “For locals it should mean less diesel pollution and cleaner power for the trains and lorries in the area,” he said. Last week it was announced that dockers at Felixstowe belonging to the Unite union are planning eight days of strike action over pay that are expected to cause serious disruption to the UK’s largest container port. • This article was amended on 18 August 2022. An earlier version said that no greenhouse gases are emitted when green hydrogen is burned; that meant to refer to carbon greenhouse gases. It was further amended on 14 November 2022 to provide more details about the possible effects of using green hydrogen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/28/eu-foreign-ministers-expected-to-suspend-russian-tourist-visa-facilitation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-28T16:33:46Z","webTitle":"EU foreign ministers expected to suspend Russian tourist visa facilitation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/28/eu-foreign-ministers-expected-to-suspend-russian-tourist-visa-facilitation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/28/eu-foreign-ministers-expected-to-suspend-russian-tourist-visa-facilitation","fields":{"headline":"EU foreign ministers expected to suspend Russian tourist visa facilitation","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The EU’s foreign ministers are expected to approve suspending the bloc’s visa facilitation agreement with Moscow next week, as Russian rocket and artillery strikes hit areas across the Dnieper River from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. The EU move, aimed at reducing the number of visas issued to Russian nationals after pressure from eastern member states, falls short of an outright ban but would make getting travel documents significantly more complicated and expensive. The Financial Times quoted one EU official as saying its was “inappropriate for Russian tourists to stroll in our cities” and the bloc had to “send a signal to the Russian population that this war is not OK, it is not acceptable”. Another told the paper that before the end of the year the bloc aimed to go further than ending the agreement, which would remove the current preferential treatment for Russian citizens when they are applying for any kind of EU visa. The bloc’s foreign ministers are due to meet in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, which hold’s the EU’s rotating presidency, on Tuesday where they are expected to give their political backing to the suspension. However, the bloc is far from united on increasingly vocal demands from countries such as the Czech Republic, Poland and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – many of which have stopped issuing visas to Russians for all but essential travel – for an EU-wide ban on Russian tourists. Many other member states continue to issue travel documents to Russian citizens, meaning they can travel freely throughout the Schengen passport-free zone. Finland, which has said Russians are increasingly dodging the closure of EU airspace by using Helsinki airport as a gateway to the zone, announced this month that it would restrict Russian visa applications to one-tenth of the current number. But countries such as Germany have insisted an outright ban would be misguided, and Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, has argued prohibition is “not a good idea”. The bloc “has to be more selective”, Borrell said last week. On the ground in Ukraine, Russian artillery fired at towns across the Dnieper from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, officals said on Sunday, amid mounting concern over a possible radiation disaster. Each sides has accused the other of targeting the plant, which was captured by Russian troops in March but is still run by Ukrainian staff and has become a major hotspot in the conflict, which has now entered its seventh month. The regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said on Telegram that Russian forces had struck residential buildings in the region’s main city of Zaporizhzhia, two hours’ drive from the plant, while Ukraine’s army command reported that towns had been struck on the opposite bank of the Dnieper from the plant. Moscow said nine Ukrainian artillery shells had landed in the power station’s grounds, technical personnel were monitoring the condition of the site and radiation levels remained normal. None of the reports could be verified. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Russia had turned the plant into a military base and was putting the whole continent at risk. Both the UN and Kyiv have called for a withdrawal of military equipment and personnel from the plant, which the UN nuclear watchdog is waiting for clearance visit. In eastern Ukraine, where Russian and separatist forces are battling for control, shelling hit the strategically significant cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk but no casualties were reported, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of the Donetsk region, said. Defenders foiled Russian attempts to break through around the strategic city of Bakhmut, Ukraine’s armed forces said. Britain’s defence ministry said in its latest briefing that Russia had lost “tens of thousands” of troops and it was not clear how more would be recruited. A decree signed by Vladimir Putin to increase the size of the armed forces from 1.9m to 2.04m was unlikely to make “substantive progress” towards increasing Russia’s combat power, the report said.

Last week we got the first substantial look at where the government may be headed. Perhaps not surprisingly, it raised more questions than it answered. Some of what is proposed – particularly the creation of a federal Environment Protection Agency to decide whether developments can go ahead and uphold a new set of national environmental standards – could revolutionise conservation management across the country. But there are also elements of what the government is proposing that could exacerbate existing problems if not well implemented. Most of the big design decisions are still to come as legislation is drafted in 2023. A quick reminder of just how bad the problem is: a five-yearly report on the state of the environment found that nature in Australia is in a poor and deteriorating state due to a long list of pressures, including the climate crisis, habitat destruction, the spread of invasive species, pollution and mining. The country is a global leader in extinction, having lost more mammal species than any other continent. Nearly 20 ecosystems are showing signs of collapse or near collapse. By any measure, the country’s main environment laws, under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999, are failing. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, correctly described the report as a “shocking document” and promised that “under Labor the environment is back on the priority list”. She later announced targets including a goal of “zero extinctions” and protecting 30% of Australian land by 2030. The state of the environment report tells us just how bold the zero extinction target is. Between 2011 and 2021, 377 animal and plant species were newly listed as threatened matters of national environmental significance. Put bluntly, they are on a path towards extinction. Hardly any have conservation plans or the funding needed to arrest their plight. Many more are likely to be added to the list in the years ahead as the catastrophic toll of the black summer bushfires three years ago becomes clearer. We could spend an age listing the failures of the EPBC Act, but three major problems stand out. Far too much of the environmental damage in Australia isn’t referred for assessment under national law before it happens. To give one galling example: hundreds of thousands of hectares of primary and re-growing native forest are bulldozed every year, but 93% of the area cleared between 2000 and 2017 was not even considered under the national laws because it happened without being referred to the commonwealth government for assessment. It means no one is responsible for overseeing most of the damage. Instead, we have a mix of mostly inadequate state and territory laws, some industry exemptions, failing environmental offset schemes, little to no data collection and a whole lot of authorities turning a blind eye. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Secondly, with few exceptions (a ban on nuclear power, for example) the environment minister of the day has near total discretion in deciding how to apply the law. Most who have held the position have prioritised doing the minimum necessary to allow developments to go ahead. These developments are nearly always considered in isolation. Their cumulative impact is routinely ignored. Third, the laws are silent on the climate crisis. A climate trigger, which would allow fossil fuel developments to be blocked or curtailed based on their greenhouse gas emissions, has long been discussed but never introduced. Plibersek’s announcement last week of the government’s response to a two-year-old review of the EPBC Act by the former competition watchdog, Prof Graeme Samuel, addresses only some of these issues directly. The creation of a national EPA – a step that goes further than what Samuel recommended – and the introduction of environmental standards against which conservation protection decisions and major development applications must be measured are potentially transformational steps. To succeed, the EPA will need to be truly independent, have conservation as its primary goal, and be given the funding and powers necessary to enforce the law across the country. The standards will need to be specific and detailed enough to work as measurable benchmarks. On climate change, there is no trigger, but Plibersek says companies will be required to disclose their emissions within Australia and how they planned to reduce them – which sounds like it could be used as a trigger in all but name, depending on the design. One of the biggest question marks is over a proposal to use regional planning, which has been promised to speed up development. It would bring in a traffic light system under which areas deemed to have high environmental value would be protected (a red zone), those with moderate environmental value would be open to development subject to approval processes (orange) and those considered to have lower environmental value would be opened up to rapid development without Commonwealth oversight (green). If well executed, this could expand the parts of the country that are subject to national environment law, and start to factor in cumulative impacts – both necessary steps. But if poorly implemented it could become an arbitrary trade-off, with some nature areas and wildlife sacrificed in return for others being protected. Probably the most controversial element is how the government plans to use environmental offsets. The current use of offsets, under which developments are allowed to go ahead if the developer agrees to protect another existing area, has been an environmental and administrative disaster that has mostly just allowed the destruction of nature. Plibersek says the government will address this by no longer allowing offsets that just protect an existing area while another area is bulldozed. Instead, it would reinforce the mostly ignored “mitigation hierarchy” that places a greater onus on developers to avoid environmental damage and requires a much more substantial investment in environment restoration elsewhere if offsets are used. But conservationists have expressed alarm that the minister plans to entrench a system that would let developers who were unable to find a “like for like” offset to just make a conservation payment to the government. The government suggests the payment would need to be substantial – enough to lead to a “net positive environmental outcome” and make developers think twice about whether they should go ahead as planned. It is not clear how this would work in practice. Would a company be allowed to clear a forest that was home to threatened koalas and greater gliders if they were prepared to pay enough to, say, clean up a couple of polluted rivers? It seems improbable, but the appalling history of offset schemes (explored in depth by Guardian Australia’s Lisa Cox) tells us scepticism is a justified starting point. It is tempting to argue conservation would be better served by a simple combination of substantial funding and sharp regulation. Failing that, bring on the details."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/25/co2-producers-meet-food-needs-halt-production-energy-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T14:55:51Z","webTitle":"UK food and drink sector sounds alarm over CO₂ shortages as plant halts production","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/25/co2-producers-meet-food-needs-halt-production-energy-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/25/co2-producers-meet-food-needs-halt-production-energy-prices","fields":{"headline":"UK food and drink sector sounds alarm over CO₂ shortage as plant halts output","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Food and drink industry bodies have sounded the alarm over potential carbon dioxide shortages, after one of the UK’s largest suppliers of the gas said surging energy costs were forcing it to pause production. The US firm CF Industries said soaring natural gas prices meant it would have to “temporarily halt” activity at its remaining UK ammonia plant, which creates CO2 as a byproduct. The plant in Billingham, Teesside, accounts for nearly a third of the UK’s supplies of the gas, which is essential to industries ranging from beer to meat to fizzy drinks and is also used in hospitals and as a coolant in nuclear power plants. Meat processors, brewers, bakers, farmers and soft drink producers all use CO2 in producing their goods and packaging them in inert gas to keep them fresh. It is also required for the stunning before slaughter of animals including pigs and chickens. CF Industries said the shutdown was the result of tough market conditions, noting that current prices for natural gas used in the process were “uneconomical” after rising to twice the level they were a year ago. It expects prices to continue rising in the months ahead. The UK experienced a crisis in CO2 last September, when high energy prices combined with annual maintenance shutdowns brought UK production to a near halt. The government was forced to use taxpayer money to fund a three-week bailout for CF Industries to stave off supply chain chaos, before brokering an emergency deal with the company. The US firm previously accounted for 60% of the UK’s CO2 supplies until it permanently shut another of its fertiliser plants at Ince in Cheshire earlier this summer, a move that has already heaped pressure on industries that rely on the gas. Nick Allen, the chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association, said the closure of the Cheshire plant made UK firms even more vulnerable to domestic supply shocks, and had sent them searching for overseas sources. However, producers in countries including Italy and Germany have also cut production, forcing firms to compete for more limited supplies across Europe. “Whilst we are in a much better position now than we were a year ago, if CF Industries follows through on its threat to close Billingham, the British meat industry will have serious concerns,” Allen said. “Without sufficient CO2 supplies, the UK will potentially face an animal welfare issue with a mounting number of pigs and poultry unable to be sent for processing.” The British Beer and Pub Association said a new shortage would also heap extra pressure on its own members who are struggling to cover surging costs. “The timing of this news couldn’t be worse as our pubs and brewers are already dealing with severe headwinds and pressures on their supply chain,” the association’s chief executive, Emma McClarkin, said. She called on the government to take action. “Our pubs and brewers are between a rock and a hard place and waiting even a few weeks for the government to act could be too long. We need a sustainable plan for the supply of CO2 to our industry and urgent help with rising energy bills for businesses before they’re forced to close their doors.” The government issued a statement on Thursday morning urging the industry to do more to meet demand. “Since last autumn, the CO₂ market’s resilience has improved, with additional imports, further production from existing domestic sources and better stockpiles,” a spokesperson said. “While the government continues to examine options for the market to improve resilience over the longer term, it is essential industry acts in the interests of the public and business to do everything it can to meet demand.” CF Industries said it had notified customers who buy CO2 about the “impending temporary halt” in production, but said it had not yet settled on an exact date for the shutdown or how long it might last. “At this time, CF Fertilisers UK do not anticipate any impact on employees regarding this announcement given the substantial level of activity that will continue to occur at Billingham,” the company said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/28/cabinet-divisions-over-uk-energy-independence-strategy-boris-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-28T12:16:20Z","webTitle":"UK energy independence strategy: what are the cabinet divisions?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/28/cabinet-divisions-over-uk-energy-independence-strategy-boris-johnson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/28/cabinet-divisions-over-uk-energy-independence-strategy-boris-johnson","fields":{"headline":"UK energy independence strategy: what are the cabinet divisions?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Downing Street’s long-awaited energy independence strategy is not expected to be published until next week, amid wrangling between No 10 and the Treasury over how to fund it. Boris Johnson’s cabinet ministers have a range of views on the best way forward: Kwasi Kwarteng: the business secretary is an avowed enthusiast for green energy sources, and has made clear he thinks the Ukraine situation only makes them more important. He has publicly suggested planning rules may need to be liberalised to facilitate new onshore wind development, reversing the effective moratorium imposed by David Cameron’s government. Kwarteng has also previously made clear his scepticism about fracking, the controversial practice of domestic shale gas extraction. He has toned down his rhetoric of late, however, insisting he has no objection in principle, but wants to see scientific evidence that it is safe. Jacob Rees-Mogg: the Brexit opportunities minister has urged Boris Johnson to press ahead with fracking, whose advocates have become more vocal since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine underlined the arguments for energy independence. On a recent episode of his regular “Moggcast”, he called shale gas “very clean” and dismissed concerns about earth tremors, saying they were “equivalent to a bus passing by your house”, and “not the San Francisco earthquake”. Like most cabinet ministers, Rees Mogg also backs a more rapid expansion of domestic nuclear power. He is more sceptical about onshore wind power, however, with a small-c conservative dislike of turbines scattered across the British countryside. Boris Johnson: the prime minister is enthusiastic about expanding domestic nuclear production. The lengthy timelines mean it will make little short-term contribution to the UK’s energy independence, but he called in industry experts last week to discuss how to speed up the building of new plants. Johnson has been sceptical about wind power in the past, once notoriously suggesting in one of his contrarian columns that it would not “pull the skin off a rice pudding”, but aides say he is now keen on a rapid expansion of offshore wind – and open-minded about onshore generation. On fracking, Kwarteng cited a conversation with Johnson to explain the recent softening of his position. Downing Street insists no decision has been made – but say given the seriousness of the situation, all options must be on the table. Rishi Sunak: the chancellor rarely mentions net zero in his public pronouncements – it didn’t feature in last week’s spring statement speech, for example. Aides say that’s not because he is a sceptic, but because he believes private sector investment will need to do much of the work in funding the transition. Meanwhile, he has been keen to grant new licences for North Sea extraction, telling the Mail on Sunday earlier this month: “In the short term we need to make sure we are helping people with the cost of energy but also recognising that things like natural gas have a role to play in our transition. We are going to get to net zero over decades, not over days and weeks.” Sunak has suggested he is not opposed to fracking in principle, but wants to see evidence that it is safe – a similar line to Kwarteng’s. He and Johnson have been wrangling in recent days about the funding for new nuclear power plants. Michael Gove: The levelling-up secretary told a recent environment reception he was “not convinced” of the case for fracking, and would like to see the development of more onshore – as well as offshore – wind, alongside solar and nuclear. As Kwarteng has made clear, that would be likely to require a change in the planning system – which Gove oversees. The Cameron government did not ban new onshore wind developments, but made them subject to stringent local consultation, which ministers admit has been tantamount to a moratorium. Alok Sharma: with the Glasgow summit over, the UK’s Cop26 president is regarded as the government’s conscience on net zero, telling the Guardian in a December interview, “given that people do see that the UK has shown a great deal of international leadership when it comes to climate, it’s important we maintain that focus across the whole of the UK government”. Not surprisingly, he is known to be sceptical about fracking, and has made clear publicly that drilling more in the North Sea will do nothing to bring down domestic prices. “Ultimately the price that’s going to be generated is going to be the international wholesale gas price,” he has said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2021/jan/27/hinkley-point-c-costs-may-rise-by-500m-covid-crisis-nuclear-power-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2021-01-27T10:42:29Z","webTitle":"Hinkley Point C costs may rise by £500m on back of Covid crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/27/hinkley-point-c-costs-may-rise-by-500m-covid-crisis-nuclear-power-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2021/jan/27/hinkley-point-c-costs-may-rise-by-500m-covid-crisis-nuclear-power-plant","fields":{"headline":"Hinkley Point C costs may rise by £500m on back of Covid crisis","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Covid-19 pandemic could delay construction of the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactor by six months and raise its costs by £500m, according to its developer. The fresh delays are expected to take the cost of the UK’s first new nuclear power plant in a generation to £23bn, EDF Energy said, and put back its launch to the summer of 2026. Before the coronavirus outbreak, Hinkley Point was expected to start up by the end of 2025, at a cost of between £21.5bn and £22.5bn. However, EDF Energy, which is owned by the French state, said the pandemic had caused delays of three months last year and was expected to lead to similar delays in 2021. “Ten months after it began, we are still facing the full force of the pandemic,” Stuart Crooks, the managing director of Hinkley Point C, said in a video message to employees. He said that despite increasing the number of workers on the 160-hectare (400-acre) site in Somerset from below 2,000 to more than 5,000, physical-distancing requirements “still limit the number of people we can safely have on site at any one time”. The Covid-19 delays have led to the second major cost increase for Hinkley in under two years after EDF Energy said in 2019 that construction costs had climbed by up to £2.9bn because of delays. Hinkley Point’s costs have risen by £5bn in the last five years. It will cost almost double the amount to build as first thought in 2008, and will begin generating electricity almost a decade later than the original start date of Christmas 2017. Crooks said: “None of this extra cost is carried by British consumers.” The rising cost of the project will be shouldered by EDF Energy, which agreed a guaranteed price of £92.50 for every megawatt-hour of electricity produced by Hinkley. That price remains unchanged by the delays. EDF Energy is still estimated to make a return of between 7.1% and 7.2% on its investment, which will be paid back through energy bills. The nuclear plant is expected to add between £10 and £15 a year to the average energy bill for 35 years, making it one of the most expensive energy projects undertaken. The government is in talks with EDF Energy to build a second nuclear reactor project with its junior partner, China’s CGN, at Sizewell in Suffolk to consolidate what it has learned from the construction of Hinkley Point. However, ministers are unwilling to repeat a similar financing deal for Sizewell after fierce criticism from MPs, consumer groups and green activists, and hope to find a new funding framework to support the plans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2022/mar/04/us-ukraine-biden-democrats-republicans-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T22:22:32Z","webTitle":"Blinken on Ukraine: ‘Suffering is likely to get worse before it gets better’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/mar/04/us-ukraine-biden-democrats-republicans-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2022/mar/04/us-ukraine-biden-democrats-republicans-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Blinken on Ukraine: ‘Suffering is likely to get worse before it gets better’ – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, spoke more from Brussels, warning that when it comes to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the “suffering we’ve already seen is likely to get worse before it gets better.” The Biden administration is asking Congress for $10bn more to aid Ukraine. Joe Biden made some remarks in Washington on manufacturing and infrastructure. A federal appeals court ruled that the Biden administration can continue to rapidly expel migrant families unlawfully crossing the US-Mexico border, but should avoid sending them anywhere they could be persecuted or tortured. Speaking of Poland, a bipartisan group of senators are calling on Joe Biden to expedite the sale of arms to the country amid tensions: Amid the unrest in Europe, vice-president Kamala Harris will head to Poland and Romania next week to reaffirm the US-Nato alliance: And we finally have a statement from Donald Trump about Bill Barr, his second attorney general and the author of a book, out next week but extensively trailed, in which he says his former boss was unfit to be president and still will be if he chooses to run again. In Trump’s words, Barr… … wouldn’t know voter fraud if it was staring him in the face – and it was. The fact is, he was weak, ineffective, and totally scared of being impeached, which the Democrats were constantly threatening to do. They ‘broke’ him. He should have acted much faster on the Mueller Report, instead of allowing the fake Russia, Russia, Russia, Hoax to linger for so long, but it was the Election Fraud and Irregularities that he refused to act on because he wanted to save his own hide – and he did. He never got impeached, contempt charges never went forward, and the Democrats were very happy with him – but I wasn’t. In Barr’s words – and to be fair, the words of many others – Trump’s lie about election fraud was just that, a lie. Barr resigned on 14 December 2020, at a meeting at which Trump gave him a bogus report about supposed fraud in Antrim county, Michigan, which he kept pushing on subordinates after that, as his attempt to overturn the election ran on and up to the January 6 riot at the US Capitol. Here’s more about Barr’s book – what’s in it and, more to the point, what isn’t: A little tidbit from Joe Biden and his meeting today with Sauli Niinisto, the president of Finland: Last night, the Florida senate passed a bill banning access to abortions after 15 weeks. Vice-president Kamala Harris issued a statement today that “the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to do everything in our power to protect access to healthcare and defend a woman’s right to make decisions about her body and determine her future”. “The right of women to make decisions about their own bodies is non-negotiable,” she said. Former vice-president Mike Pence reportedly will call on Republicans to stop repeating the lie that Donald Trump keeps peddling that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. White House press secretary Jen Psaki fielded a question about Lindsey Graham and his comments calling for the assassination of Vladimir Putin. “That is not the position of the United States government that is certainly not the statement you would hear coming from the mouth of anybody working in this administration,” she said. When pressed further on the topic – on whether Joe Biden agreed with Graham that Putin’s death was the only way out of this war – Psaki staunchly doubled down. “The president believes there continues to be a diplomatic path forward,” she said. “President Putin has the ability to deescalate. We have left the door open for months now to engage in deescalation.” Psaki continued: “We are not advocating for killing the leader of a foreign country or a regime change. That is not the policy of the United States.” Read more about the outcry against Graham’s comments here: White House press secretary Jen Psaki addressed the Russian attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. The US embassy in Ukraine called the attack on the nuclear plant a war crime. But Psaki said the determination of Russia’s war crimes is still an ongoing process that is taking place within the administration. “It’s a legal review and a process that goes through the administration,” Psaki said. “What I will say, the intentional targeting of civilians or civilian objects would be considered a war crime. Regardless of legality, this action was the height of irresponsibility. The Kremlin must cease operations around nuclear infrastructure.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki is at the podium for her press briefing and she began with the administration’s request to Congress for more funding for Ukraine. Since 2021, the US has already provided more than $1.4bn to Ukraine, and administration officials are now requesting $10bn more to “deliver additional security assistance to Ukraine, to provide life-saving humanitarian assistance for the Ukrainian people and more support for stronger sanction enforcement and for US troop deployment to reinforce Nato’s eastern flank and deter Russian aggression,” Psaki said. Back to the no-fly zone and whether it can be implemented in other ways than shooting down Russian jets, and how the US assesses Russian military strength after a week of war. Blinken says the US is looking at what can be delivered to Ukraine for it to defend itself, every day. On conclusions about Russian military strength, Blinken says he doesn’t want to draw any yet. What we do know, he says, is “how extraordinary the Ukrainian people are. Their will, their determination, their absolute commitment to defend their country, to defend their freedom, to defend their future. “That’s the story of the past week and it’s an incredibly powerful one.” And with that, he’s gone. Blinken is asked if energy sanctions on Russia are being considered. “As a general proposition, nothing is off the table,” he says, adding that minimising harm to the US and partners and allies is also part of implementing sanctions, which means the US wants to avoid raising prices at the pumps at home. “We have a strong interest in degrading Russia status as a leading energy supplier. Over time, this would be a profound strategic shift. That’s why Nord Stream two was shut down. “That’s why we’re surging [liquid natural gas] to Europe right now, to help accelerate its diversification away from Russian gas. It’s why we’re denying critical technologies to Russia for further energy exploration … this is part of a process to reduce reliance, dependence on Russian energy.” Blinken is asked how many more people have to die before energy sanctions are used but he avoids a direct answer, of course. Secretary of state Antony Blinken has just issued a fresh warning about the war, echoing other leaders of late who have warned that the worst is ahead. An Irish questioner asks how much worse things are going to get in Ukraine, and if “the no to the no fly zone is set in stone completely or would you consider it if this conflict does become a massacre? “And just to follow up – Was it naive of you and of course the Europeans to trust in Putin for diplomacy?” “I think the terrible expectation is that the suffering we’ve already seen is likely to get worse before it gets better,” Blinken says. With regard to the no fly zone, Blinken cites Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato general secretary, in saying that Nato has a responsibility to “ensure the war doesn’t spill over beyond Ukraine”. Shooting down Russian planes could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe, Blinken says. “President Biden has been clear that we are not going to get into a war with Russia. But we are going to tremendous lengths with allies and partners to provide Ukrainians with the means to to effectively defend themselves. And of course, we’re seeing every single day, their extraordinary heroism as well as very, very real results in in what they’re doing to achieve that.” About potential naivety, Blinken says the US was “the opposite of naive” and had warned for months that Putin was planning “an aggression of Ukraine”, and was prepared either way. Blinken is asked if nothing the west and Nato has done has slowed the Russian invasion so far, what does he tell the Ukrainian people. He is also asked if arms supplies can be increased, to include heavier weapons such as jets. Blinken takes the second part first. He’s in contact constantly with the Ukrainian government, he says, and touts how much security assistance has already been given. He says Nato and the EU have discussed “what more we can do and how to do it effectively”, with the foreign minister of Ukraine contributing. “We’re working on that every day,” he adds. No specifics – no surprise there. He touts damage to the Russian economy as a result of sanctions and so forth. “I have a list five pages long of all the businesses that have left Russia,” Blinken says, adding: “Let’s see how Russia responds to that.” “Unfortunately this is not like flipping a lightswitch,” he says about the prospects of increasing aid and implementing harsher measures, even though “virtually the entire world” supports Ukraine. “There is a huge weight bearing down on Russia,” he says. “Let’s see what the impact is.” Of the Russian attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant yesterday, Blinken says: “The Kremlin should immediately cease all attacks around Ukrainian nuclear facilities and allow civilian personnel do their work to ensure the facilities’ safety and security, as both the IAEA director general and a resolution adopted yesterday by the agency’s board of governors have called on Russia to do.” He says Nato, the EU and other partner nations have never before worked so closely together. He praises those countries which have accepted Ukrainian refugees. Humanitarian corridors are being worked on, he said, to allow people out and supplies in. He says Vladimir Putin cannot have imagined the united response and the tide of protest that has “increasingly turned Russia into a pariah state”. “We do not oppose the Russian people,” Blinken says. He also says the US “will defend every inch of Nato territory”, if necessary. He takes questions. Here’s our latest reporting on the fighting in Ukraine: Tony Blinken is now speaking in Brussels. “Stability in Europe hangs in the balance and the international rules based order that’s critical to maintaining peace and security is being put to the test by Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine,” he says, to begin. Here’s the state department stream. The Biden administration can continue to rapidly expel migrant families unlawfully crossing the US-Mexico border, but should avoid sending them anywhere they could be persecuted or tortured, a federal appeals court ruled today. The mixed ruling on concerning the increasingly-controversial Title 42 rule largely upholds restrictions put in place by the administration of former Republican president Donald Trump aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19 even as many other coronavirus-related border bans have been lifted. Reuters writes: A group of affected migrants, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other non-profit organizations, sued over the expulsion policy known as Title 42, which the administration of Joe Biden, a Democrat who took office a year ago, has largely kept in place. They argued the expulsions were illegal but the panel of appeals court judges disagreed, finding it likely that the covered migrants “have no right to be in the United States, and the Executive can immediately expel them.” The court added however, that “the Executive cannot remove aliens to a country where their ’life or freedom would be threatened’ on account of their ’race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion’” or “to a country where they will likely be tortured.“ Biden has fought to retain the Title 42 order, which was issued in March 2020 by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Many Democrats, health experts and pro-immigrant advocates oppose the order, saying it unlawfully cuts off access to asylum and is not supported by scientific evidence. Border arrests soared to record levels in 2021 during Biden’s first year in office and could climb even higher this year, officials told Reuters in January. A federal judge ruled last September that the Title 42 policy could not be applied to families but the Biden administration appealed that decision. Early in his presidency, Biden exempted unaccompanied children from the expulsion policy. Since Biden took office in January 2020, more than a million migrants have been expelled under the order. Many of those have been people who have crossed the border more than once. Joe Biden did not take questions at his event on manufacturing and infrastructure, and therefore did not make any new comment on the Ukraine crisis. His secretary of state, Tony Blinken, is however due to talk in Brussels soon. The Department of State live stream is here. Biden describes his administration’s efforts to make the federal government buy more American goods, including making agencies which want to spend money abroad publicly seek waivers to do so. He ties this effort back to the early days of the pandemic, when states and cities had to buy PPE and Covid tests abroad. “Yes, we’re going to keep trading with our allies and friends,” Biden says, saying the US also needs “resilient supply chains of our own” – a nod to difficulties affecting many sectors of the economy which are likely to be worsened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “Last year,” Biden says, “I released a plan to increase the number of contracts that go to small disadvantaged businesses by 50% by 2025. This means more contracts will go to Black-, brown-, Asian American-, women-owned and veteran-owned small businesses in every state and territory, in every industry, from services to manufacturing to agriculture.” And with that, he thanks everyone in attendance and leaves the stage without taking questions. Joe Biden begins with a joke and a happy birthday to an aide, and thanks to the other speakers. He then revisits his State of the Union remarks about economic progress on his watch, touting various successes. “This is what it looks like to grow an economy from the bottom up and the middle out,” the president says. He also underlines progress against the coronavirus pandemic, after “two of the hardest years this country has ever faced”. “We’re coming back stronger as a country,” he says. So is American manufacturing, the president says, with companies investing at home rather than overseas. He gives examples of companies “innovating and inspiring” other companies, Tesla among them. He says he just had a “viral” (he means virtual) tour of Siemens facilities around the US. Joe Biden is speaking in Washington, about his infrastructure policy and spending. The great Joan E Greve covered some of the why, and the role of Siemens, here earlier. The White House stream is here. America is divided. That’s not news. But the authoritarian ruler in the Kremlin deciding to invade a democratic neighbor – that’s the type of international crisis that traditionally might have inspired some closing of the ranks: set differences aside, let domestic quarrels rest. But conservatives are evidently out on the idea of patriotic unity. The right’s reactions to Russia’s attack on Ukraine have ranged from blatant admiration for Vladimir Putin to anti-Russian saber-rattling combined with a shrill critique of Joe Biden. Donald Trump initially called the invasion “genius”; he then defended his position at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) over the weekend, adding that Nato was “not so smart” and “our leaders are dumb.” Meanwhile, America’s most successful cable news host Tucker Carlson ridiculed American solidarity with Ukraine, a country he derided as “a tyranny”, led by “the people who paid off Joe Biden’s family”. Trump is the political leader of the Republican party and probably its next presidential candidate. Carlson is one of the premier rightwing culture warriors in the country. Trump and Carlson are not fringe voices, and they aren’t outliers either: a last week’s CPAC, conservative speakers focused their ire on Biden’s supposed weakness as the real cause for Putin’s aggression; and they left no doubt who they considered the biggest threat – the “enemy within”, as Senator Rick Scott put it, the “militant left – wing in our country”. Full column: Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, is in Brussels to meet with the foreign ministers of Nato and European Council. Ahead of his meetings, he warned that Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, will open “a Pandora’s box of trouble” for entire world if he continues his attack on Ukraine. The United Nations security council convened for an emergency meeting in New York today after Russian forces attacked and seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, said “Putin must stop this madness and he must stop this now”. Joe Biden is meeting today with Sauli Niinisto, the president of Finland, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine raises the possibility that Finland could form a closer alliance with Nato. Conservative firebrand Lindsey Graham is calling for the assassination of Putin. Close Donald Trump ally Roger Stone raged at the former US president in the aftermath of the failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election, according to a blockbuster report from the Washington Post, telling a friend Trump was a “disgrace” who would go to prison and adding: “He betrayed everybody.” The Post said it had viewed 20 hours of footage of the political operative that had been shot for a forthcoming documentary. The footage, it said, showed Stone: Meeting and corresponding with members of a far-right militia since indicted for seditious conspiracy over the Capitol riot on January 6. Discussing a plan in which Trump would issue a blanket pardon to co-conspirators in the attempt to overturn the election, Senator Ted Cruz and congressman Jim Jordan among them. Saying Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser, should be “punished” in a way that would leave him “braindead”. Suggesting violence against protesters for racial justice would be possible with the election out of the way. “Once there’s no more election,” Stone reportedly said, “there’s no reason why we can’t mix it up. These people are going to get what they’ve been asking for.” Full story: The supreme court has reinstated the death penalty for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the man convicted of the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 that killed three people and injured hundreds of others. The United Nations security council convened for an emergency meeting in New York today after Russian forces attacked and seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, had harsh words about the attack, saying it was “incredibly reckless and dangerous and it threatened the safety of civilians across Russia, Ukraine and Europe”. “By the grace of god, the world narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe last night,” she said. While she had a strong message about the escalation to attacks on nuclear plants - “nuclear facilities cannot become part of this conflict” - Thomas-Greenfield went harder on the overall war itself. “Russia’s invasion has turned half a million children into refugees,” she said. “Russia has killed thousands of Ukrainians and sacrificed thousand more Russian soldiers’ lives in the process. Russia is destroying critical infrastructure, which is denying people drinking water to stay alive and gas that is preventing people from freezing to death in the middle of winter. The humanitarian impact of this destruction will be significant.” She continued: “One hundred and forty-one nations across the world have called loudly and clearly on President Putin to stop this brutal, unjustified, unprovoked attack. Not only has he not listened, we just witnessed a dangerous new escalation that represents a dire threat to all of Europe and the world. “To my Russian counterparts: This council needs answers. We need to hear you say, this won’t happen again,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “We call on you to withdraw your troops and weaponry from Ukraine. We call on you to respect Ukraine’s borders, its people and the UN charter. We call on you to respect your own troops enough to not send them into an unjust war, or on a suicide mission against a nuclear power plant.” Thomas-Greenfield finished by noting that Russian forces are now 20 miles away from Ukraine’s second largest nuclear facility. “This imminent danger continues,” she said. “President Putin must stop this humanitarian catastrophe by ending this war and ceasing these unconscionable attacks against the people of Ukraine,” she said. “Mr Putin must stop this madness and he must stop this now.” Joe Biden is meeting today with Sauli Niinisto, the president of Finland, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine raises the possibility that Finland could form a closer alliance with Nato. Though Finland already cooperates with Nato, the country is not a member. Support for full membership has grown in the country in the days since the invasion: A poll by public broadcaster Yle last Monday said 53% of Finns support joining. In late January, the number was just 28% when the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper asked the question. Biden and Niinisto “will discuss the US-Finnish defense relationship, which is very strong and in fact complements Finland’s close partnership with Nato”, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters ahead of the visit. Niinisto said in a statement that people should “keep a cool head and assess carefully the impact of the changes that have already taken place and of those that might still happen.” Siemens has announced that it will invest $54m to expand US production of electrical parts, which will aid in the construction of everything from electric vehicle chargers to data centers. Siemens said the investment will lead to the creation of 300 manufacturing jobs in the country. The CEO of Siemens USA, Barbara Humpton, is expected to join Joe Biden at the White House today to celebrate the new investment. The White House championed Siemens’ announcement as the latest indication of how Biden’s “Made in America” agenda is strengthening US supply chains and creating good-paying jobs. “You may recall the previous administration made big claims on how they would restore America’s industrial might. That turned out to be just rhetoric,” a senior administration official said. “President Biden followed through on his commitment to make ‘Buy American’ real.” In his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Biden emphasized his commitment to reinvigorating US manufacturing to strengthen both the economy as a whole and individual families’ financial prospects. “There’s something happening in America,” Biden said Tuesday. “Just look around, and you’ll see an amazing story – the rebirth of pride that comes from stamping products ‘Made in America,’ the revitalization of American manufacturing.” Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, is now heading out of his meeting with Nato’s foreign ministers in Brussels and going into one with the European Council, the policy-guiding arm of the European Union. Before his next meeting, Blinken took a moment to speak to the press along with Josep Borrell, the vice president of the European Commission, and applaud the EU on taking “historic” action, “both with regard to sanctions and support for Ukraine”. “We are faced together with what is President Putin’s war of choice, a war that was unprovoked and that is having horrific consequences for real people, for mothers, fathers, for children,” Blinken said. “We see the images on TV and it has to stop. We are committed to doing everything we can to make it stop.” Blinken continued: “We’ve established together, after two world wars, that are so important to keeping peace and security for everyone, principles that President Putin is egregiously violating every single day - the notion that one country can’t simply go in and change the borders of another country by force or take it over, the principle that one country cannot dictate to another the choices that its citizens would make about their future, the principle that we are past the time of spheres of influence where one country subjugates its neighbors to its will. “All of those things are at stake and if we allow those principles to be challenged as Putin is doing now with impunity, that will open a Pandora’s box of trouble, not just for us, but, quite frankly, for the entire world.” As part of his “Made in America” agenda to bolster the country’s manufacturing sector, Joe Biden is also implementing changes to the Buy American Act. As of now, products under consideration for federal procurement qualify as being made in America if 55% of the value of their component parts are domestically manufactured. The Biden administration will change that threshold to 75% by 2029, with incremental increases to the requirement over the next seven years. A senior administration official explained that the incremental nature of the policy change would “allow both small and large contractors time to transition their supply chains to domestic suppliers and to increase their use of American-made components”. “It marks just one of many significant improvements to domestic sourcing policy that the Biden-Harris administration will be rolling out to ensure that taxpayer dollars help America’s businesses compete in strategic industries and help America’s workers thrive,” the official said. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, took a strong stance on the war today as he arrived for a meeting of Nato’s foreign ministers in Brussels, condemning what he described as Russian attacks on civilians in Ukraine. “Ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us we are ready for it and we will defend every inch of Nato territory,” Blinken said. However, Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg hedged their position a bit this morning, rejecting Ukraine’s demand for no-fly zones. “We are not part of this conflict, and we have a responsibility to ensure it does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine,” Stoltenberg told reporters. “We understand the desperation but we also believe that if we did that (a no-fly zone) we would end up with something that could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe involving much more countries and much more suffering,” Stoltenberg said. Politico took a look at the cracking opposition to the US agreeing to aiding in a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Right now, Joe Biden is in the tricky position of remaining true to his promise to protect Nato territories without escalating into further war with Russia, while at the same time getting more and more pressure to intervene in a way that won’t lead to boots on the ground. On Friday. Nato allies rejected Ukraine’s demand for no-fly zones. “We understand the desperation but we also believe that if we did that (a no-fly zone) we would end up with something that could lead to a full-fledged war in Europe involving much more countries and much more suffering,” Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said. But in Washington, Republican congressman Adam Kinzinger is pushing for a no-fly zone. Politico is reporting that Republican senator Roger Wicker is also in support, as well as Democratic policymakers like Evelyn Farkas, the top official for Ukraine in the Obama Pentagon. Amid soaring tensions and continuous bloodshed in Ukraine, conservative firebrand Lindsey Graham is calling for the assassination of Vladimir Putin. The Republican senator from South Carolina made his remarks first on Fox News with Sean Hannity - who has suggested assassinating Putin previously - before repeating his sentiments on Twitter. Graham’s remarks were met with dismay from both sides of the aisle, with progressive congresswoman Ilhan Omar tweeting, “Seriously, wtf?” Ted Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, also responded by calling Graham’s remarks “an exceptionally bad idea”. Even far-right extremist congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green, who won her seat expressing support for the conspiracy theory QAnon, called Graham’s statements “irresponsible, dangerous and unhinged”. “We need leaders with calm minds and steady wisdom,” she tweeted. “Not blood thirsty warmongering politicians trying to tweet tough by demanding assassinations. Americans don’t want war.” Greetings, live blog readers. Happy Friday. Per usual, we’ll have all our live updates on the Russian invasion of Ukraine here, so make sure to keep an eye on that. But on our end, Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, took a strong stance on the war today as he arrived for a meeting of Nato’s foreign ministers in Brussels, condemning what he described as Russian attacks on civilians in Ukraine. “Ours is a defensive alliance. We seek no conflict. But if conflict comes to us we are ready for it and we will defend every inch of Nato territory,” Blinken said. Meanwhile in Washington, the Washington Post is reporting that previously unseen documentary footage shows Roger Stone, longtime ally of Donald Trump, working to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and secure pardons in the aftermath of the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. We’ll have more on that in a bit.

Energoatom, the state-run operator of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, said in a statement: “Three strikes were recorded on the site of the plant, near one of the power blocks where the nuclear reactor is located.” Russia’s defence ministry accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the plant, saying a leak of radiation had been avoided only by luck. Vladimir Putin has met Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for talks that were expected to focus on Russia’s war in Ukraine and that are being rumoured to include Kremlin efforts to circumvent western sanctions. The Russian president welcomed Erdoğan to Sochi, a resort city on the Black Sea, by thanking the Turkish president for help in securing an international deal that resumed grain exports from Ukraine that had been disrupted by the Kremlin war machine – as well as Russian foodstuffs and fertilisers – to world markets. They agreed to boost cooperation in the transport, agriculture, finance and construction industries, they said in a joint statement after a four-hour meeting. Three ships carrying almost 60,000 tonnes of grain between them have departed Ukrainian Black Sea ports and are on their way to Britain, Ireland and Turkey respectively. Oleksandr Kubrakov, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, said he planned “to ensure ports have the ability to handle more than 100 vessels per month”. Russia says it is ready to talk about a prisoner swap with the US following Thursday’s nine-year jail sentence for US basketball player Brittney Griner. However, the Kremlin said any such negotiations should not be played out publicly. Amnesty International has said it stands by its accusation that Ukraine is endangering civilians by creating army bases in residential areas to counter Russian forces, after a report from the rights group prompted a furious response from Kyiv. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, criticised Amnesty over the report published on Thursday, saying the rights group was drawing a false equivalence between Ukraine as the victim of aggression and the Russian invaders. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has raised concerns about the “security and safety” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, saying Russia has “used artillery units based in these areas to target Ukrainian territory on the western bank of the Dnipro [Dnieper] river”. A European Union plan to cut gas use and help Germany wean itself off dependency on Russia will come into effect early next week, the bloc’s presidency said on Friday. Last week, EU member states agreed to reduce their use of gas by 15% over the winter, with exceptions for some countries and despite opposition from Hungary. Canada is sending up to 225 Canadian armed forces to the UK to recommence the training of Ukrainian military recruits, the Canadian defence minister has announced. Since 2015, Canada has trained 33,000 Ukrainian military and security personnel but in February paused aspects of the training. A US official has accused Moscow of preparing to plant fake evidence to make it look like the recent mass killing of Ukrainian prisoners of war in an attack on a Russian-controlled jail was caused by Ukraine. Kyiv and Moscow have traded blame over last week’s strikes on the prison in Kremlin-controlled Olenivka, in eastern Ukraine. A leading Russian hypersonics expert has been arrested on suspicion of treason, the state-controlled Tass news agency reported on Friday. Andrei Shiplyuk heads the hypersonics laboratory at the Novosibirsk Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, according to the institute’s website, and has in recent years coordinated research to support the development of hypersonic missile systems, Reuters reports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/22/us-and-south-korea-begin-largest-military-drills-for-years-as-north-ramps-up-tensions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-22T04:04:21Z","webTitle":"US and South Korea begin largest military drills for years as North ramps up tensions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/22/us-and-south-korea-begin-largest-military-drills-for-years-as-north-ramps-up-tensions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/22/us-and-south-korea-begin-largest-military-drills-for-years-as-north-ramps-up-tensions","fields":{"headline":"US and South Korea begin largest military drills for years as North ramps up tensions","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The US and South Korea have begun their biggest joint military drills in years – a show of force that is expected to raise tensions with an increasingly hostile North Korea. The exercises, known as Ulchi Freedom Shield, are being seen as a sign of the allies’ determination to restore large-scale training after they cancelled some regular drills and scaled down others to facilitate nuclear talks, and because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Details of the operation have not been released, but past exercises have involved tens of thousands of troops and large numbers of aircraft warships and tanks. They will reportedly include simulated joint attacks, frontline reinforcements of arms and fuel, and removals of weapons of mass destruction. The two militaries said in a joint statement said the drills were a response to an “increased volume and scale of [North Korean] missile tests” over the past year. “With this in mind, and considering the evolving threat … both leaders committed to expanding the scope and scale of combined military exercises and training, they said, adding that Ulchi Freedom Shield would “bolster combined readiness”. The 2019 exercises were cancelled after Donald Trump’s first summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore, the previous year. Trump’s surprise concession was seen as an attempt to persuade Kim to abandon his nuclear weapons programme amid a flurry of diplomacy led by the then president and his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in. Four years on, Washington and Seoul have nothing substantive to show for their efforts at engagement. The North has resumed missile tests – including its first launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile at full range since 2017 – and speculation is building that it is preparing to conduct what would be its seventh nuclear test. The US has said it will consider deploying strategic assets – which could theoretically include tactical nuclear weapons – if the North tests a nuclear device. South Korea’s new president, Yoon Suk-yeol, took office in May promising a harder line against North Korean provocations that would include “normalising” the military exercises and boosting his country’s defences against the North. The resumption of the drills suggests that South Korea and the US, which has 28,500 troops in the country, have reverted to robust displays of their combined military might in the wake of North Korea’s resumption of ballistic missile tests. “The significance of this joint exercise is rebuilding the South Korea-US alliance and solidifying the combined defence posture by normalising … combined exercises and field training,” the South Korean defence ministry said. While the allies insist the field exercises are designed to plan their response to a North Korean attack, Pyongyang routinely condemns them as a rehearsal for an invasion, and in the past has responded with missile launches. The drills, which will end on 1 September, began against a backdrop of increasingly hostile rhetoric from the North. It recently warned of “deadly retaliation” against the South, which it blamed for its Covid-19 outbreak, while Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un’s influential sister, last week dismissed Yoon’s offer of economic help in return for denuclearising as “absurd”, warning that the North would never “barter” its nuclear deterrent for aid. Kim Jong-un, whose until recently appears to have been focused on containing the coronavirus outbreak, has said his country is “ready to mobilise” its nuclear capability in any war with the US and North Korea, although the regime has always insisted its nuclear weapons are a deterrent against a “hostile” US. In a TV interview last month, Choe Jin, the deputy director of a thinktank run by North Korea’s foreign ministry, said the US and South Korea would face “unprecedented” security challenges unless they abandoned their “hostile military stance” against the North, including joint drills. The North has been conducting missile tests at a record pace, with more than 30 ballistic missile launches this year, as it continues to pressure Washington to accept its status as a legitimate nuclear power – and one that some experts believe now has the ability to carry out a nuclear strike against the US mainland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/apr/13/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-plan-to-release-treated-fukushima-water","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-13T03:56:27Z","webTitle":"Everything you need to know about the plan to release treated Fukushima water","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/13/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-plan-to-release-treated-fukushima-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/apr/13/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-plan-to-release-treated-fukushima-water","fields":{"headline":"Everything you need to know about the plan to release treated Fukushima water","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Japan’s decision to release more than 1m tonnes of treated radioactive water from the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea has sparked controversy inside and outside the country. Here are some questions and answers about the plan, which is expected to take decades to complete. What is the processed water? Since the 2011 nuclear disaster, radioactive water has accumulated at the plant, including liquid used for cooling, and rain and groundwater that has seeped in. An extensive pumping and filtration system known as Alps (advanced liquid processing system) extracts tonnes of newly contaminated water each day and filters out most radioactive elements. The plant operator, Tepco, has built more than 1,000 tanks to hold some 1.25m tonnes of processed water at the site but they will be full by the second half of 2022. The Alps process removes most of the radioactive isotopes to levels below international safety guidelines for nuclear plant waste water. But it cannot remove some, including tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that experts say is only harmful to humans in very large doses. The half-life of tritium – the time needed for one half the atoms of a radioactive isotope to decay – is 12.3 years. In humans, it has an estimated biological half-life of seven to 10 days. How will it be released? Japan’s government has backed a plan to dilute the processed water and release it into the sea. The government says the process meets international standards, and it has been endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency. “Releasing into the ocean is done elsewhere,” IAEA’s director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has said. “It’s not something new. There is no scandal here.” The release is not likely to begin for at least two years and will take decades. A government spokesman, Katsunobo Kato, said the dilution would reduce tritium levels to well below standards set domestically and by the World Health Organization for drinking water, with IAEA supervision. Why is it controversial? Environmental groups like Greenpeace, which opposes nuclear power, say radioactive materials like carbon-14 that remain in the water can “be easily concentrated in the food chain”. They allege that accumulated doses over time could damage DNA, and want to see the water stored until technology is developed to improve filtration. Local fishing communities worry that years of work to convince consumers that Fukushima’s seafood is safe will be wiped out by the release. “The message from the government that the water is safe is not reaching the public, that’s the huge problem,” an official with the association of Fukushima fishermen unions told Agence France-Presse. He said trading partners had warned they would stop selling their products and consumers had said they would stop eating Fukushima seafood if the water were released: “Our efforts in the past decade to restore the fish industry will be for nothing.” What about Fukushima seafood? The government says radioactive elements in the water are far below international standards, pointing out that waste water is regularly discharged from nuclear plants elsewhere. Even releasing all the stored water in a single year would produce “no more than one-thousandth the exposure impact of natural radiation in Japan,” the foreign ministry said in a reply to a UN report. For food, Japan nationally sets a standard of no more than 100 becquerels of radioactivity per kilogram (Bq/kg), compared with 1,250 Bq/kg in the EU and 1,200 in the US. But for Fukushima produce, the level is set even lower, at just 50 Bq/kg, in an attempt to win consumer trust. Hundreds of thousands of food items have been tested in the region since 2011. What do scientists say? Michiaki Kai, an expert on radiation risk assessment at Japan’s Oita University of Nursing and Health Sciences, said it was important to control the dilution and volume of released water. But “there is consensus among scientists that the impact on health is minuscule”, he told AFP. Still, “it can’t be said the risk is zero, which is what causes controversy”. Geraldine Thomas, chair of molecular pathology at Imperial College London and an expert on radiation, said tritium “does not pose a health risk at all – and particularly so when you factor in the dilution factor of the Pacific Ocean”. She said carbon-14 was also not a health risk, arguing that chemical contaminants in seawater like mercury should concern consumers more “than anything that comes from the Fukushima site”. On eating Fukushima seafood, “I would have no hesitation whatsoever,” she added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-curfew-begins-in-kherson-ahead-of-expected-ukraine-counteroffensive","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-06T17:27:38Z","webTitle":"Car bomb kills one and injures pro-Kremlin writer in Russian city – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-curfew-begins-in-kherson-ahead-of-expected-ukraine-counteroffensive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-curfew-begins-in-kherson-ahead-of-expected-ukraine-counteroffensive","fields":{"headline":"Car bomb kills one and injures pro-Kremlin writer in Russian city – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is almost 8:30pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s headlines: A prominent Russian nationalist writer, Zakhar Prilepin, was wounded in a car bombing in the region of Nizhny Novgorod on Saturday, the Russian state news agency Tass said, in an attack that Russia immediately blamed on Ukraine and the west. Tass quoted a source in the emergency services as saying the writer’s car was blown up. “He survived, but was wounded and is conscious,” the source was quoted as saying. Russia has been accused of attacking the besieged city of Bakhmut with incendiary phosphorus weapons, BBC News reported. Ukraine’s military shared drone footage of what appeared to show Bakhmut ablaze as white phosphorus rains down on the city. Ukraine hailed the return of 45 Azov battalion fighters captured during the battle for Mariupol while Russia said three of its pilots had been released by Kyiv, but neither side gave a full account of the apparent prisoner swap, Reuters reports. The freed Ukrainian prisoners included 42 men and three women from the Azov battalion, said Andriy Yermak, the head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office. Ukraine’s air force has claimed to have downed a Russian hypersonic missile over Kyiv using newly acquired American Patriot defence systems, the first known time the country has been able to intercept one of Moscow’s most modern missiles. Air force commander Mykola Oleshchuk said in a Telegram post that the Kinzhal-type ballistic missile had been intercepted in an overnight attack on the Ukrainian capital earlier in the week. It was also the first time Ukraine is known to have used the Patriot defence systems. Russian shelling killed six Ukrainian explosives experts engaged in demining operations in the southern Kherson region, the Ukrainian emergency services said on Saturday. The emergency services, in a report on Telegram, said two other members of the de-mining team were injured, along with a female nurse, and were being treated in hospital, Reuters reports. Concerns in the Russian leadership about its vulnerability to attacks and the potential for public protests over the Ukraine war have contributed to the decision to cancel many Victory Day parades, citing security concerns, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. In its latest intelligence briefing, the ministry said six Russian regions, occupied Crimea and 21 cities had cancelled their parades on Tuesday marking the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany. Russia is still not satisfied with how the issue of Russian agricultural exports as part of the Black Sea grain deal is being resolved, Tass news agency quoted deputy foreign minister Sergey Vershinin as saying on Saturday after the latest talks with a top UN official. “We are still not satisfied with the progress. This is very important for us,” Vershinin said. He was speaking after talks in Moscow with the United Nations’ top trade official Rebeca Grynspan, Tass said. Poland will demand European Union sanctions on imports of Russian farm products, its ambassador to the EU Andrzej Sadoś was quoted as saying by PAP news agency. “Europe isn’t threatened by disruptions in supply chain of farm products now, contrary, we have a problem of surpluses. We are resolving a problem of increased imports of farm products from Ukraine,” Sadoś said, according to PAP. Switzerland’s parliament has approved a request from Ukrainian authorities for President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address it. The invitation, announced in a statement late on Friday, comes amid pressure on Switzerland’s government to break with a centuries-old tradition of neutrality and end a ban of exports of Swiss weapons to conflict zones such as Ukraine. Kherson’s weekend curfew is the latest inconvenience for residents who, after enduring months of Russian occupation last year, have been subjected to daily bombardments by Russian troops encamped nearby on the other side of the River Dnipro. Despite their retreat from Kherson city last November, Russian forces still hold large swathes of territory in the wider Kherson region that Ukraine wants to recapture, Reuters reports. Some residents left Kherson in cars and buses on Friday while others stocked up on groceries before a 56-hour curfew began on Friday evening in the southern Ukrainian city. Reuters reports that the announcement of the curfew, lasting until Monday morning, prompted speculation in Kherson that the city was about to be used as a launch point for Ukraine’s much-anticipated counterattack. Strikes on Russian infrastructure including drone attacks on refineries and train sabotage have multiplied in recent weeks, with experts suggesting they are part of Ukraine’s preparations for an expected spring offensive. Agence France-Presse reports that Kyiv has not claimed any of the acts denounced by Moscow as Ukrainian “sabotage” of “unprecedented momentum”, but the majority appear to target Russian army supply chains in border regions and in annexed Crimea, a base for Russian troops. Ukraine sent its first lady, Olena Zelenska, and Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, as the country’s representatives to King Charles’s coronation in London on Saturday. Zelenska posted on her official Facebook: “It is an honour for us and prime minister Denys Shmyhal to attend the coronation of Their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla The royal family here at Westminster Abbey to wish on behalf of all of Ukraine successful governance and prosperity to the country.” The leader of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force has said his forces will leave Bakhmut, which they have been trying to capture since last summer. Yevgeny Prigozhin said they would pull back on Wednesday 10 May – ending their involvement in the war’s longest battle – because of heavy losses and inadequate ammunition supplies, and he asked defence chiefs to put regular army troops in their place. But Ukraine said Wagner fighters were reinforcing positions to try to seize the eastern city before that date. Prigozhin earlier released a video showing him standing in a field of Russian corpses and blaming defence chiefs for the losses suffered by his fighters in Ukraine, appearing to reignite his simmering feud with Russian top brass. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has carried out an inspection of troop readiness for forces engaged in the war, in an apparent coded response to Prigozhin’s criticism. Ukraine said two people had been killed and nine wounded in the eastern Donetsk region and electricity distribution networks had been damaged by shelling in the Donetsk and Kherson regions. Authorities in the Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia have begun evacuating villages near the frontline. The Russian-installed governor, Yevgeny Balitsky, announced the move in anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive aimed at retaking the area, claiming Kyiv’s forces had “stepped up shelling of settlements close to the frontline” in the past few days. Engineers have reduced the risk of a dam bursting and damaging the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, a senior Russian official was quoted by state news agency Tass as saying on Friday. Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the general director of energy engineering firm Rosenergoatom, said specialists had begun discharging water from the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam on the Dnieper River in southern Ukraine. A Moscow court has ordered the arrest of a theatre director and a playwright on charges of “justifying terrorism” over an award-winning play about Russian women recruited online to marry radical Islamists in Syria. Director Yevgeniya Berkovich and author Svetlana Petriychuk were placed in custody until 4 July, Russian news agencies reported. Bill Clinton has said he knew in 2011 it was just “a matter of time” before the Russian president attacked Ukraine. “Vladimir Putin told me in 2011 – three years before he took Crimea – that he did not agree with the agreement I made with Boris Yeltsin,” the former US president recalled. “He said … ‘I don’t agree with it. And I do not support it. And I am not bound by it.’ And I knew from that day forward it was just a matter of time.” That’s it from me for today. We’ll be closing this blog shortly. Thanks for joining us. Russian shelling killed six Ukrainian explosives experts engaged in demining operations in the southern Kherson region, the Ukrainian emergency services said on Saturday. The emergency services, in a report on Telegram, said two other members of the de-mining team were injured, along with a female nurse, and were being treated in hospital, Reuters reports. Russia said its forces had downed a Ukrainian missile over the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014, amid an expected offensive by Kyiv, AFP reports. The Moscow-appointed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said on social media: Air defence forces shot down a ballistic missile over the Republic of Crimea. The missile was launched with Ukraine’s Grim-2 system. There was no damage or casualties. His adviser, Oleg Kryuchkov, later said two such missiles were shot down, Russian news agencies reported. AFP was unable to verify the claims. State-run agency TASS said this was the second official confirmation of a Grim missile being neutralised over Crimea, after a first reported case in April. Russia has in recent weeks seen an uptick in drone incursions and train sabotage, which experts suggest are part of Ukraine’s preparations for an expected spring offensive. A prominent pro-Kremlin writer and Russian nationalist has been injured in a car “explosion” and one other person was killed, the interior ministry in Moscow has said, after a string of apparent drone attacks in Russia amid the fighting in Ukraine. “According to initial reports, one person was killed by the explosion, and the writer Zakhar Prilepin, who was in the car, was injured” in the Nizhny Novgorod region about 250 miles (400km) east of Moscow, the ministry said. The investigative committee, which investigates serious crimes, said Prilepin was “travelling with his family” at the time. Russian state-run agencies cited sources in the emergency services saying the writer sustained leg injuries.

Azov battalion fighters, who did much of the fighting in the failed defence of the port city of Mariupol, have been lionized as heroes by many Ukrainians but are widely vilified in Russia. On the Telegram app in a post that did not mention the release of Russian prisoners, Yermak said: Excellent news on this sunny day. We are returning home 45 of our people. Thirty-five privates and sergeants, 10 officers. The Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement that three pilots had been returned and were being provided with medical and psychological assistance. The statement, which did not mention the 45 Ukrainian prisoners, said: As a result of a difficult negotiation process, three Russian pilots of the Russian Aerospace Forces, who had been in mortal danger while in captivity, were returned from Kyiv-controlled territory. There were no reports on Russian state media of additional Russian prisoner releases. Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, which coordinates prisoner exchanges with Russia, did not immediately respond to a request for more details. Moscow and Kyiv have agreed a number of prisoner exchanges since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February last year. Russia says it launched its “special military operation” to counter a threat from Kyiv’s relations with the west, while Ukraine and its western partners say it was an unprovoked land grab. The time in Kyiv is almost 6pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s headlines: A prominent Russian nationalist writer, Zakhar Prilepin, was wounded in a car bombing in the region of Nizhny Novgorod on Saturday, the Russian state news agency Tass said, in an attack that Russia immediately blamed on Ukraine and the west. Tass quoted a source in the emergency services as saying the writer’s car was blown up. “He survived, but was wounded and is conscious,” the source was quoted as saying. Russia has been accused of attacking the besieged city of Bakhmut with incendiary phosphorus weapons, BBC News reported. Ukraine’s military shared drone footage of what appeared to show Bakhmut ablaze as white phosphorus rains down on the city. Ukraine’s air force has claimed to have downed a Russian hypersonic missile over Kyiv using newly acquired American Patriot defence systems, the first known time the country has been able to intercept one of Moscow’s most modern missiles. Air force commander Mykola Oleshchuk said in a Telegram post that the Kinzhal-type ballistic missile had been intercepted in an overnight attack on the Ukrainian capital earlier in the week. It was also the first time Ukraine is known to have used the Patriot defence systems. Concerns in the Russian leadership about its vulnerability to attacks and the potential for public protests over the Ukraine war have contributed to the decision to cancel many Victory Day parades, citing security concerns, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. In its latest intelligence briefing, the ministry said six Russian regions, occupied Crimea and 21 cities had cancelled their parades on Tuesday marking the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany. Russia is still not satisfied with how the issue of Russian agricultural exports as part of the Black Sea grain deal is being resolved, Tass news agency quoted deputy foreign minister Sergey Vershinin as saying on Saturday after the latest talks with a top UN official. “We are still not satisfied with the progress. This is very important for us,” Vershinin said. He was speaking after talks in Moscow with the United Nations’ top trade official Rebeca Grynspan, Tass said. Poland will demand European Union sanctions on imports of Russian farm products, its ambassador to the EU Andrzej Sadoś was quoted as saying by PAP news agency. “Europe isn’t threatened by disruptions in supply chain of farm products now, contrary, we have a problem of surpluses. We are resolving a problem of increased imports of farm products from Ukraine,” Sadoś said, according to PAP. Switzerland’s parliament has approved a request from Ukrainian authorities for President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address it. The invitation, announced in a statement late on Friday, comes amid pressure on Switzerland’s government to break with a centuries-old tradition of neutrality and end a ban of exports of Swiss weapons to conflict zones such as Ukraine. Kherson’s weekend curfew is the latest inconvenience for residents who, after enduring months of Russian occupation last year, have been subjected to daily bombardments by Russian troops encamped nearby on the other side of the River Dnipro. Despite their retreat from Kherson city last November, Russian forces still hold large swathes of territory in the wider Kherson region that Ukraine wants to recapture, Reuters reports. Some residents left Kherson in cars and buses on Friday while others stocked up on groceries before a 56-hour curfew began on Friday evening in the southern Ukrainian city. Reuters reports that the announcement of the curfew, lasting until Monday morning, prompted speculation in Kherson that the city was about to be used as a launch point for Ukraine’s much-anticipated counterattack. Strikes on Russian infrastructure including drone attacks on refineries and train sabotage have multiplied in recent weeks, with experts suggesting they are part of Ukraine’s preparations for an expected spring offensive. Agence France-Presse reports that Kyiv has not claimed any of the acts denounced by Moscow as Ukrainian “sabotage” of “unprecedented momentum”, but the majority appear to target Russian army supply chains in border regions and in annexed Crimea, a base for Russian troops. Ukraine sent its first lady, Olena Zelenska, and Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, as the country’s representatives to King Charles’s coronation in London on Saturday. Zelenska posted on her official Facebook: “It is an honour for us and prime minister Denys Shmyhal to attend the coronation of Their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla The royal family here at Westminster Abbey to wish on behalf of all of Ukraine successful governance and prosperity to the country.” The leader of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force has said his forces will leave Bakhmut, which they have been trying to capture since last summer. Yevgeny Prigozhin said they would pull back on Wednesday 10 May – ending their involvement in the war’s longest battle – because of heavy losses and inadequate ammunition supplies, and he asked defence chiefs to put regular army troops in their place. But Ukraine said Wagner fighters were reinforcing positions to try to seize the eastern city before that date. Prigozhin earlier released a video showing him standing in a field of Russian corpses and blaming defence chiefs for the losses suffered by his fighters in Ukraine, appearing to reignite his simmering feud with Russian top brass. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has carried out an inspection of troop readiness for forces engaged in the war, in an apparent coded response to Prigozhin’s criticism. Ukraine said two people had been killed and nine wounded in the eastern Donetsk region and electricity distribution networks had been damaged by shelling in the Donetsk and Kherson regions. Authorities in the Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia have begun evacuating villages near the frontline. The Russian-installed governor, Yevgeny Balitsky, announced the move in anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive aimed at retaking the area, claiming Kyiv’s forces had “stepped up shelling of settlements close to the frontline” in the past few days. Engineers have reduced the risk of a dam bursting and damaging the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, a senior Russian official was quoted by state news agency Tass as saying on Friday. Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the general director of energy engineering firm Rosenergoatom, said specialists had begun discharging water from the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam on the Dnieper River in southern Ukraine. A Moscow court has ordered the arrest of a theatre director and a playwright on charges of “justifying terrorism” over an award-winning play about Russian women recruited online to marry radical Islamists in Syria. Director Yevgeniya Berkovich and author Svetlana Petriychuk were placed in custody until 4 July, Russian news agencies reported. Bill Clinton has said he knew in 2011 it was just “a matter of time” before the Russian president attacked Ukraine. “Vladimir Putin told me in 2011 – three years before he took Crimea – that he did not agree with the agreement I made with Boris Yeltsin,” the former US president recalled. “He said … ‘I don’t agree with it. And I do not support it. And I am not bound by it.’ And I knew from that day forward it was just a matter of time.” That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Nicola Slawson will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Russia has been accused of attacking the besieged city of Bakhmut with incendiary phosphorus weapons, BBC News reported. Ukraine’s military shared drone footage of what appeared to show Bakhmut ablaze as white phosphorus rains down on the city. BBC News reported: White phosphorus weapons are not banned, but their use in civilian areas is considered a war crime. They create fast-spreading fires that are very difficult to put out. Russia has been accused of using them before. Russia has been trying to capture Bakhmut for months, despite its questionable strategic value. Western officials have estimated that thousands of Moscow’s troops have died in the assault. On Twitter, Ukraine’s defence ministry said the attack had targeted “unoccupied areas of Bakhmut with incendiary ammunition”. It added: Not enough shells, but more than enough phosphorus. The price of liberation is high. In the village of Posad-Pokrovske in southern Ukraine, a place once on the very frontline of the war, almost every house is damaged by shell fire. Outside a blue-painted church, Father Viktor Kravchuk, 61, has laid out the sheets, quilts and clothes he has rescued from his ruined house to air in front a little cemetery that is a tangle of blossoming lilac. Mykola Barkov, a volunteer, helps Kravchuk clear out a ruined room with a sagging, broken ceiling where, before the war, the priest hosted his church group meetings. Kravchuk tells the story of the village, describing the brief Russian occupation there at the beginning of the war – how after the Russians were pushed out, the village became a frontline position for Ukraine’s soldiers, who were hit by Russian shells for months. Russia is still not satisfied with how the issue of Russian agricultural exports as part of the Black Sea grain deal is being resolved, Tass news agency quoted deputy foreign minister Sergey Vershinin as saying on Saturday after the latest talks with a top UN official. “We are still not satisfied with the progress. This is very important for us,” Vershinin said. He was speaking after talks in Moscow with the United Nations’ top trade official Rebeca Grynspan, Tass said. A mock-up depicting Russian president, Vladimir Putin, hangs from a road sign, which reads ‘Avdiivka is Ukraine’, in the town of Avdiivka, near a frontline in Donetsk region. More on the pro-Kremlin writer and army veteran Zakhar Prilepin who was injured in a car “explosion” on Saturday. One other person in the car was killed, according to the Russian interior ministry. He had been travelling with his family, Russian authorities reported. State-run news agencies said his legs have been injured, Agence France-Presse reports. “According to initial reports, one person was killed by the explosion, and the writer Zakhar Prilepin, who was in the car, was injured” in the Nizhny Novgorod region about 400km (250 miles) east of Moscow, the ministry said. Prilepin, 47, one of Russia’s best-known novelists, joined pro-Russian separatists in the east of Ukraine in 2014, and fought by their side. A Chechnya war veteran, he has regularly gone to eastern Ukraine and is a vocal supporter of Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and of his February 2022 offensive. The incident comes after a series of apparent attacks and sabotage on Russian territory, sometimes far from the front. In April a blast from a statuette rigged with explosives killed 40-year-old pro-Kremlin military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky. And last August Darya Dugina, the daughter of a prominent ultranationalist intellectual, was killed in a car bombing outside Moscow, which Russia blamed on Ukraine. Kyiv denied the charges. Ukraine has sent first lady, Olena Zelenska, and Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, as the country’s representatives to UK’s King Charles’s coronation in London on Saturday. Zelenska posted on her official Facebook: “It is an honour for us and Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal to attend the coronation of Their Majesties King Charles III and Queen Camilla The royal family here at Westminster Abbey to wish on behalf of all of Ukraine successful governance and prosperity to the country.” The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has not yet responded to proposals from United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, on the Black Sea grain deal, Tass news agency quoted the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, as saying. The situation around the deal was “not improving for now”, it quoted him as saying. In April, the UN chief asked the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, to deliver to Putin a letter proposing a “way forward aimed at the improvement, extension and expansion” of the deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of Ukrainian grain, Reuters reported. A prominent Russian nationalist writer, Zakhar Prilepin, was wounded in a car bombing in the region of Nizhny Novgorod on Saturday, the Russian state news agency Tass said, in an attack that Russia immediately blamed on Ukraine and the West. Tass quoted a source in the emergency services as saying the writer’s car was blown up. “He survived, but was wounded and is conscious,” the source was quoted as saying. No further details were immediately available. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram: The fact has come true: Washington and Nato fed another international terrorist cell – the Kyiv regime. She said it was the “direct responsibility of the US and Britain”, but provided no evidence to support the accusation. “We pray for Zakhar,” she added. Ukraine’s air force has claimed to have downed a Russian hypersonic missile over Kyiv using newly acquired American Patriot defence systems, the first known time the country has been able to intercept one of Moscow’s most modern missiles. Air force commander Mykola Oleshchuk said in a Telegram post that the Kinzhal-type ballistic missile had been intercepted in an overnight attack on the Ukrainian capital earlier in the week. It was also the first time Ukraine is known to have used the Patriot defence systems. “Yes, we shot down the ‘unique’ Kinzhal,” Oleshchuk wrote. “It happened during the night time attack on 4 May in the skies of the Kyiv region.” Oleshchuk said the Kh-47 missile was launched by a MiG-31K aircraft from the Russian territory and was shot down with a Patriot missile, AP reported. The Kinzhal is one of the latest and most advanced Russian weapons. The Russian military says the air-launched ballistic missile has a range of up to 2,000km (about 1,250 miles) and flies at 10 times the speed of sound, making it hard to intercept. A combination of hypersonic speed and a heavy warhead allows the Kinzhal to destroy heavily fortified targets, like underground bunkers or mountain tunnels. The Ukrainian military has previously admitted lacking assets to intercept the Kinzhals. Ukraine took its first delivery of the Patriot missiles in late April. It has not specified how many of the systems it has, but they have been provided by the US, Germany and the Netherlands. Germany has acknowledged sending at least one system and the Netherlands has said it has provided two. Poland will demand European Union sanctions on imports of Russian farm products, its ambassador to the EU Andrzej Sadoś was quoted as saying by PAP news agency. “Europe isn’t threatened by disruptions in supply chain of farm products now, contrary, we have a problem of surpluses. We are resolving a problem of increased imports of farm products from Ukraine,” Sadoś said, according to PAP. The European Commission earlier this week set restrictions until 5 June on imports of Ukrainian wheat, maize, rapeseed and sunflower seed to ease the excess supply of these commodities in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last year, the EU has adopted 10 sanctions packages against Russian individuals and companies, Reuters reported. Poland in April proposed a new set of punitive measures against Moscow, including a ban on pipeline oil and diamond imports. The FT’s correspondent Christopher Miller has shared a video of what appears to be Russian forces attacking the city of Bakhmut with incendiary weapons. He tweeted: Video from Ukraine’s special operations forces purportedly showing Russian forces blanketing the embattled city of Bakhmut with incendiary weapons. Switzerland’s parliament has approved a request from Ukrainian authorities for President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address it. The invitation, announced in a statement late on Friday, comes amid pressure on Switzerland’s government to break with a centuries-old tradition of neutrality and end a ban of exports of Swiss weapons to conflict zones such as Ukraine. So far, the government has refused to change this policy, Reuters reported. The subject of Zelenskiy’s address, which will the first by video by a foreign leader to the legislature, is unknown. It is scheduled for the summer session beginning on 30 May. During that session, lawmakers are also set to weigh a motion to provide 5bn Swiss Francs ($5.6bn) of support to Ukraine over five to 10 years. Concerns in the Russian leadership about its vulnerability to attacks and the potential for public protests over the Ukraine war have contributed to the decision to cancel many Victory Day parades, citing security concerns, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. In its latest intelligence briefing, the ministry said six Russian regions, occupied Crimea and 21 cities had cancelled their parades on Tuesday marking the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany. The ministry said: The timing of the UAV [drone] strike on the Kremlin a few days before Victory Day shows Russia’s increasing vulnerability to such attacks and has almost certainly raised the threat perception of the Russian leadership over the Victory Day events. The potential for protests and discontent over the Ukraine war are also likely to have influenced the calculus of the Russian leadership. Moscow’s Victory Day celebration was likely to go ahead but on a smaller scale, said the briefing, posted on Twitter, while the reception for the president, Vladimir Putin, after the parade would not. Kherson’s weekend curfew is the latest inconvenience for residents who, after enduring months of Russian occupation last year, have been subjected to daily bombardments by Russian troops encamped nearby on the other side of the River Dnipro. Despite their retreat from Kherson city last November, Russian forces still hold large swathes of territory in the wider Kherson region that Ukraine wants to recapture, Reuters reports. Russian shelling on Wednesday killed 23 people in Kherson city, and attacks on Ukrainian-controlled parts of the Kherson region continued on Friday, regional authorities said. Some residents left Kherson in cars and buses on Friday while others stocked up on groceries before a 56-hour curfew began on Friday evening in the southern Ukrainian city. Reuters reports that the announcement of the curfew, lasting until Monday morning, prompted speculation in Kherson that the city was about to be used as a launch point for Ukraine’s much-anticipated counterattack. Iryna Chupryna, a former real estate manager, said: Everybody understands it [the curfew]. It means it is necessary for our military. Some residents said they left because they were scared, others because they did not want to spend most of the weekend indoors. Local authorities gave little away about the reason for the curfew, beyond saying it was intended to enable law enforcement agencies to “conduct their activities in Kherson”. No one will be allowed to enter or exit the city during the curfew, and residents must limit their movements to short walks outside their homes. Strikes on Russian infrastructure including drone attacks on refineries and train sabotage have multiplied in recent weeks, with experts suggesting they are part of Ukraine’s preparations for an expected spring offensive. Agence France-Presse reports that Kyiv has not claimed any of the acts denounced by Moscow as Ukrainian “sabotage” of “unprecedented momentum”, but the majority appear to target Russian army supply chains in border regions and in annexed Crimea, a base for Russian troops. Mykhailo Samus, deputy director of the Centre for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies in Kyiv, said: All of this was done to prepare for an offensive. I am sure that the intensity [of the attacks] will increase. A senior Ukrainian official, speaking anonymously, said that “these are standard measures for limiting the capabilities of the Russian armed forces”. Oil facilities – essential for supplying the troops – appear to be the priority targets of the attacks, which have been generally carried out with drones. The list of incidents has expanded on a near daily basis. On Thursday, a drone was shot down near an airbase in Sevastopol in the Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. That same day, Russia’s southern Krasnodar and Rostov regions, both near Ukraine, reported drone strikes that caused fires. On Friday, another fire broke out at the same oil refinery in Krasnodar. Over the past week, two fuel depots also caught fire, in and around Crimea, while last weekend an overnight Ukrainian strike on the Russian border village of Suzemka left four dead. Also in Russia’s Bryansk region bordering Ukraine, two freight trains derailed earlier this week after explosive devices went off on the tracks. Hello and welcome back to our coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war, now in its 437th day. I’m Adam Fulton and let’s begin with a rundown of the latest events. Increasing attacks on Russian infrastructure in recent weeks are part of Ukraine’s preparations for its long-anticipated spring offensive, experts suggest. The majority of the strikes appear to be targeting Russian army supply chains in border regions and in annexed Crimea, a base for Russian forces. In the southern city of Kherson, meanwhile, a 56-hour curfew began on Friday evening and some residents left the city after the curfew announcement prompted speculation that it was about to be used as a launching point for Ukraine’s counterattack. More on those stories shortly.

Even so, the striking feature – beyond the well-trailed two-year price cap for households – was how much has been filed under “to do” or “details to follow”. At least six areas of the canvas are virtually blank. First, six months of “equivalent” support for businesses, public sector bodies and charities inevitably prompts the question of what happens in April. On what basis will deserving causes for ongoing help be selected? Second, negotiations with electricity generators – mainly nuclear power plants and wind and solar projects – to reduce their prices seem barely to have started. The principle of switching firms to contracts-for-difference is fine (for reasons discussed in this column previously) but success will be determined solely by how low prices can be made to fall. With wholesale prices at £400-ish per megawatt hour, some generators’ windfall profits will be enormous. Would a good outcome for taxpayers be a contracted price close to £40, which is roughly where the last capacity auction came out? Or, given that lucrative old-style “renewables obligations certificates” have obvious value, are we talking £100 as a realistic goal? The difference matters hugely if new contracts could run as long as 15 years. Ministers can’t negotiate in public but it’s hard to detect any sense that the Treasury itself knows where it is aiming. The scheme, in essence, is the alternative to Labour’s idea for an extended windfall tax and ministers must be muscular: this should be a “negotiation” in the sense that generators are told, more or less, the definition of a fair price. Third, will the Treasury’s joint £40bn liquidity support scheme with the Bank of England, due to be launched “by the end of October or sooner”, arrive in time? Anecdotal evidence suggests pips are squeaking among power firms as they attempt to sign collateral-backed hedging contracts in the wholesale market. It would be embarrassing, to put it mildly, if replacing Ofgem’s price cap leads to more corporate failures. The situation does not need more Bulbs. Fourth, the terms of reference for the new “Energy Supply Taskforce” need to be clear. The government is underwriting, in effect, the gas and electricity purchases of private companies so it needs to know that contracts are being signed on hard commercial terms. There is an obvious risk that the odd billion slips between the cracks. Fifth, while “fundamental reforms to the structure and regulation of the energy market” are desperately needed, there’s no hint of quick wins. One of Ofgem’s many failures was the regulator’s inability to spot that coupling the price of electricity to the price of gas would cause trouble one day. A review of that outdated pricing set-up is already under way, but needs to be accelerated. Sixth, there was nothing new on measures to improve energy efficiency, even though cries for a mass-insulation programme for public buildings and council houses have been heard for months. A public information campaign is better than nothing, but other European countries have been on the job for ages. On the plus side, the domestic price cap, for all its imperfections (untargeted and of unknowable expense), provides households with certainty this winter. And Truss has swallowed her free-market instincts and understood that intervention at the wholesale end of the energy market must be part of the same deal. It is impossible, though, to avoid the conclusion that the plan would have fewer gaps if big decisions had been made months ago. A long summer of Tory leadership larks has had consequences. Melrose has work to do Melrose Industries’ private equity-style mantra is “buy, improve, sell”. After acquiring GKN, the grand but misfiring FTSE 100 automotive and aerospace engineer, in a bitter battle in 2018, it reckons it’s a long way down the track with the improvement part of exercise. Operations-wise, GKN looks fitter. Finding buyers, however, is proving tricky. Thus there will be a demerger in London next year of the automotive business. In commercial terms, a split makes sense. The two halves of GKN have always looked destined to go different ways eventually, and separation allows both companies to hunt for bolt-on acquisitions. But, as a way to “unlock value for shareholders” – the other ambition – there is work to do. Melrose’s shares fell 9%. It was a reminder that, in the end, the private equity model requires a crystallisation event, in deal-making lingo. A demerger doesn’t qualify on that score."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/23/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-181-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-23T00:14:53Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 181 of the invasion ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/23/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-181-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/23/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-181-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 181 of the invasion ","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russia has accused Ukraine’s intelligence services of carrying out the murder of Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue. Russia’s FSB security service published information and a video it said showed a Ukrainian woman from the country’s Azov regiment was responsible for the murder. The Guardian reports the claim lacks credibility. The UN’s secretary-general, António Guterres, has demanded a halt to “nuclear sabre-rattling” on Monday, saying the world is at a “maximum moment of danger” and all countries with nuclear weapons must make a commitment to “no first-use”. The UN chief described the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, as critical. Shelling and fighting in the area continues. Moscow has requested a UN security council meeting be held on Tuesday to discuss the Zaporizhzhia plant, Russian state-owned news agency RIA reported, citing deputy ambassador to the UN Dmitry Polyanskiy. Ukrainian soldiers who were taken prisoner after the battle for Mariupol have accused Russian forces of torture during their captivity. The soldiers, who were from the Azov regiment and released as part of a prisoner exchange, told reporters they saw soldiers that were beaten until their bones were broken. “Some had needles inserted into their wounds, some were tortured with water,” said Vladyslav Zhaivoronok, who lost a leg. “They undressed us, forced to squat while we are naked. If any of the boys raised their heads, they began to beat them immediately,” added Denys Chepurko. The sole bridge across the strategic Dnieper River in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson was reportedly hit by US-supplied high-precision Himars rockets injuring 15 people, a source told Russia’s Interfax news agency. The bridge is a key crossing for Russian military transport in the region. Three villages in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region were battered by Russian artillery and multiple rocket launchers on Monday. Soledar, Zaytseve and Bilohorivka near the city of Bakhmut were struck, killing at least two civilians, Ukrainian authorities said. Nearly 9,000 Ukrainian military personnel have been killed in the war with Russia, the head of Ukraine’s armed forces, general Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said on Monday. The office of the UN high commissioner for human rights said on Monday 5,587 civilians had been killed and 7,890 wounded between 24 February and 21 August, mainly from artillery, rocket and missile attacks. The US has rejected Ukraine’s call for a blanket ban on visas for Russians, saying Washington would not want to close off pathways to refuge for Russia’s dissidents and others who are vulnerable to human rights abuses. The EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, also said he opposes a complete ban on visas for Russians. The German chancellor says he is working fast to find alternatives to Russian gas. Olaf Scholz said he aims to extricate Germany from its dependence on Russian gas and pursue new energy supplies. Scholz met Canada’s prime minster, Justin Trudeau, in Montreal on Monday. The two leaders are set to sign a deal for Canada to supply clean hydrogen to Germany. Ukraine has restored a rail link to neighbouring Moldova which could carry 10m tonnes of freight a year, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. The 22km (12 mile) line runs from western Ukraine to Moldova. Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksander Kubrakov, said the link would provide an alternative route from the Black Sea port of Odesa. Ukraine’s agricultural exports are likely to rise to about 4m tonnes in August, from 3m tonnes in July, a deputy chair of the Ukrainian agrarian council said. The uptick is due to a UN-brokered deal that unblocked Ukrainian seaports. Europe faces fresh disruption to energy supplies due to damage to a pipeline system bringing oil from Kazakhstan through Russia that was reported by the pipeline operator on Monday.

Russian troops must hold fire for 36 hours to allow people “in the areas of hostilities” to mark Orthodox Christmas, the Russian leader said. Putin’s announcement came hours after the head of the Russian Orthodox church, Patriarch Kirill, called for a ceasefire and a Christmas truce in Ukraine. In a statement, Kirill said he appealed to “all parties involved in the internecine conflict” for the ceasefire, so that “Orthodox people can attend services on Christmas Eve and the day of the nativity of Christ”. Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior aide to Ukraine’s president, dismissed Putin’s calls for a temporary ceasefire to mark Orthodox Christmas. He said a “temporary truce” would be possible only when Russia leaves territory it is occupying in Ukraine. Other Ukrainian politicians said Russia’s offer of a ceasefire came just days after it launched a wave of strikes on Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, as Ukrainians celebrated the new year. Putin is “trying to find some oxygen” by floating a 36-hour ceasefire to mark Orthodox Christmas, said Joe Biden. “I’m reluctant to respond [to] anything Putin says,” Biden told reporters. “I found it interesting. He was ready to bomb hospitals and nurseries and churches on the 25th and new year.” Prior to the ceasefire announcement, Putin told his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Russia was open to dialogue over Ukraine but Kyiv would have to accept the “new territorial realities”, according to a readout of the call between the two leaders issued by the Kremlin. Putin also “acknowledged the destructive role of the west, pumping weapons into Kyiv, providing information and guidance”, the Kremlin said. Putin and Erdoğan also discussed a number of energy issues, including the creation of a gas hub in Turkey and the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant, it added. Erdoğan told Putin during the call on Thursday that peace efforts in the Russia-Ukraine war should be supported by a unilateral ceasefire and a “vision for a fair solution”, the Turkish presidency said in its readout of the call. The two leaders discussed energy and the Black Sea grain corridor, and Erdoğan told Putin concrete steps needed to be taken to clear Kurdish militants from the Syrian border region, it added. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also spoke with Turkey’s leader about “security cooperation” as well as the exchange of prisoners of war and the Black Sea grain initiative, Zelenskiy said. He added he was “glad to hear that Turkey is ready to participate in the implementation” of his “peace formula”, which he first proposed in November. The first inmates recruited by the private military group Wagner have received their promised pardons after fighting for six months in Ukraine, Wagner’s founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, told journalists on Thursday. “They worked off their contract. They worked with honour, with dignity. They were the first ones. Nobody else in this world works as hard as they did,” Prigozhin told the Russian news agency RIA-Novosti, standing alongside a number of former convicts. Addressing the former prisoners, Prigozhin instructed them not to end up back in jail. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk oblast – one of the regions the Russian Federation claims to have annexed – has posted a status update in which he says two people have been killed by Russian fire in the last 24 hours. Overnight, Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), has said that service personnel injured in the attack on the barracks in occupied Makiivka have been mostly transferred to hospitals within Russia. Ukraine’s gross domestic product fell by 30.4% in 2022 – the largest annual fall in more than 30 years – because of the war with Russia, the economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said. She said Ukraine’s economy had suffered its largest losses since it won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 although the fall was less than initially expected. Ukraine’s GDP had grown by 3.4% in 2021. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said France would send light AMX-10 RC armoured combat vehicles, an Elysée official said after a phone call between Macron and Zelenskiy. In a video address, during which he thanked France for providing them, the Ukrainian president said: “This is what gives a clear signal to all our other partners. There is no rational reason why western-style tanks have not yet been supplied to Ukraine.” The provision of tanks may well be part of “the next phase” of weapons transfers to Ukraine, the UK’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said after a meeting in London with Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, on Thursday. Speaking at a joint press conference with Baerbock, Cleverly said the position on the provision of tanks is kept under constant review. A wide-ranging public discussion is taking place in Ukraine over what to do with seven street murals painted in November by the British artist Banksy on a series of destroyed buildings in and around Kyiv. The conversation has grown urgent after thieves last month made off with one artwork from the town of Hostomel, about 15 miles (25km) outside the capital. It shows a woman in a gas mask and dressing gown holding a red fire extinguisher. She is standing next to a real flame-blackened window. The US is not “hand-wringing” over the mass casualties of Russian soldiers in a Ukrainian attack reportedly using US-supplied artillery, a senior White House official said on Wednesday. After criticism in Russia over the use of US-delivered weaponry by Ukrainian defenders, including in the Makiivka strike, the national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said Russia is to blame. Biden said the US was considering sending Bradley Fighting Vehicles to Ukraine. The armoured vehicle with a powerful gun has been used as a staple by the US army to carry troops around battlefields since the mid-1980s. The US is also looking at ways to target Iranian drone production through sanctions and export controls, the White House said. Washington previously imposed sanctions on companies and people it accused of producing or transferring Iranian drones that Russia has used against Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry on Wednesday blamed the illegal use of mobile phones by its soldiers for a deadly Ukrainian missile strike that it said killed 89 servicemen, raising the reported death toll significantly. Moscow previously said 63 Russian soldiers were killed in the weekend strike on Makiivka. Although an official investigation has been launched, the main reason for the attack was clearly the illegal mass use of mobile phones by servicemen, the ministry said. “This factor allowed the enemy to track and determine the coordinates of the soldiers’ location for a missile strike,” it said in a statement issued just after 1am in Moscow on Wednesday. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister said significant Russian losses meant Moscow would probably have to announce a second partial mobilisation in the first quarter of the year. Further strikes deep in Russian territory should be expected, the head of the Ukrainian military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, has told the US TV network ABC. He said the attacks would come “deeper and deeper” inside Russia, without specifically saying whether Ukraine would be behind them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/nov/02/morning-mail-rba-rate-warning-thousands-miss-power-bill-rebates-four-day-work-week-trial","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-01T19:56:46Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: RBA rate warning, thousands miss power bill rebates, four-day work week trial ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/02/morning-mail-rba-rate-warning-thousands-miss-power-bill-rebates-four-day-work-week-trial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/nov/02/morning-mail-rba-rate-warning-thousands-miss-power-bill-rebates-four-day-work-week-trial","fields":{"headline":"Morning Mail: RBA rate warning, thousands miss power bill rebates, four-day work week trial ","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Morning everyone.

Plumes of smoke were seen rising from the Sevastopol military base on Saturday morning, and city residents were urged to stay at home immediately after the strike, the latest in a string of high-profile attacks on sensitive targets there and inside Russia. The governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhaev, said there were no casualties, and initially claimed the drone flew into the airbase’s roof after troops stationed there were not able to shoot it down. He later said soldiers had been able to target the drone, and that it had fallen onto the airbase roof after being hit. “Clarification: the drone was hit...right above the fleet headquarters. It fell on the roof and caught fire. The attack failed. Well done boys,” he wrote. Previous attacks in Crimea, including one earlier this month on the Saky airbase that sent fireballs into the sky and destroyed nine or more warplanes, prompted many residents to flee the peninsula. Worried locals responded to Razvozhaev by asking how a drone had slipped through air defences that at the start of the war were considered among the most sophisticated in the world. “Was our air defence system on a lunch break?” asked one. “When will you finally close the city?” asked another, suggesting the attacks were the work of pro-Ukraine partisans in the peninsula. “We fought harder against the coronavirus! There were checkposts everywhere then, now anyone and everyone enters!!!!” Another wondered if more attacks were coming. Wednesday 24 August is Ukraine’s independence day, and will also mark six months since Russia’s invasion. Many in the country are worried that Moscow may be preparing some kind of major attack that day, but residents in Crimea are also apparently concerned that Ukraine wants to mark its successful resistance. “They have Independence Day on the 24th, maybe they are preparing something? And the [drone] is just to divert attention from the main thing.” The attacks came a day after the US announced a $775m arms package for Ukraine including drones, armoured vehicles and artillery. Government officials have repeatedly said that while western weapons allowed the country to save Kyiv, and hold off Russia in other areas, they are still woefully short of the arms needed to decisively defeat Russia. Promised supplies are also arriving slowly. Last week a senior source estimated only 10% of arms promised by the west had reached Ukraine. And on Saturday presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak warned Moscow was trying to create a “reputation crisis” for Ukraine that would slow the flow of western arms. Ukrainian troops are being pounded by weapons in the south and in the east, where Russian forces are still slowly advancing through a wasteland of cities shelled into ruin before they are captured. On Saturday they stepped up fighting to seize Bakhmut, one of the last major towns in the Donetsk region still held by Ukrainian forces, and which would clear the way for Russia to move on two other strategic targets, Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Russia last month took over all of the Luhansk region, which together with Donetsk makes up the industrial Donbas heartland. Russia-backed separatists self-declared a pair of independent republics there. After Russia’s failure to seize Kyiv, and setbacks in parts of the south including around the city of Kherson, capturing territory here has become a key military objective for Moscow. Shelling in the Mykolaiv region also seriously injured four children and five adults, with one girl losing an eye, said governor Vitaliy Kim. Shells landed in the town of Voznesensk, just 30km from the country’s second-largest nuclear power plant. There is growing global concern about Russia’s occupation of the nearby Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest in Europe, and suspicion that Russian authorities could try to disconnect it from the Ukrainian grid, which would raise the risk of a nuclear accident.

Fewer opportunities to speak Welsh at home and school, coupled with a long-term trend of people migrating from Wales, have caused a decline in the number of Welsh speakers. A recent Office for National Statistics estimate indicates that about 895,000 people speak Welsh, but a lower figure is expected when the 2021 census data is published, on 6 December. Now, another factor is contributing to the decline of the Welsh language: the steady rise of second homes. It’s easy to see why Wales, with its stunning coastline and rural landscapes, has become a favoured location for holiday homes. But the growth in second homes is having a corrosive effect on the Welsh language. In some places, the concentration of second homes is so high that up to 46% of the local housing stock can be empty for parts of the year. In places like Gwynedd, one in every ten homes is a second home. According to government figures, there are currently 23, 974 second homes in Wales. This figure is likely to be an underestimate, as many homes are used as short-term, self-catering accommodation. Because these homes are registered as businesses, they do not appear on council tax lists. The rise of second homes is contributing to rising house prices. This is pushing out many younger Welsh speakers, who feel understandably aggrieved that they have to leave their home communities. As more communities become places for holiday lets, rural and village schools close. This in turn weakens the predominance of Welsh as the default language in particular communities, causing the “anglicisation” of Welsh-speaking towns and villages, according to Simon Brooks, chair of the Commission for Welsh-speaking Communities. Geography and place matter for language. Once a minority language is no longer spoken on the street, at school, or in social and community life, its resonance changes. A language instead becomes rooted in the education system as a skill to be acquired, rather than a spoken part of everyday life. Without opportunities to speak Welsh on a daily basis as part of a community, Welsh speakers may find themselves less able or confident about initiating conversations in Welsh – particularly when they’re dealing with the health service, the government and other services. The case for preserving a Welsh-speaking heartland has been in the public consciousness since the 1920s. More recently, campaigns by the Cymdeithas yr Iaith (the Welsh Language Society) have spearheaded the fight for language rights while tying the Welsh language to a broader set of social and economic issues, seeing the preservation of Welsh as the key to preventing the erosion of communities and quality of life. Inspired by ecological and cultural preservation movements, a raft of recent proposals has attempted to counter the decline of Welsh. Planning policies allow local authorities to consider the Welsh language in planning decisions (the Horizon nuclear power proposal on Anglesey was subject to both an environmental assessment and a Welsh language assessment). Given the rapid rise in housing costs and lack of affordable housing, these planning policies need updating. They could, for example, give a higher weighting to developments that strengthen the survival of the Welsh language, or allocate more resources to local authority programmes that would preserve the language, tackle poverty and improve the services available to Welsh-speaking communities. The Commission for Welsh Speaking Communities was established earlier this year by the Welsh government. It will publish its first report in 2024, and will probably recommend that homeowners obtain planning permission to change their property into a second home. Another proposal could be a variable tax of up to 300% on second homes in particular areas. In addition to this, the Welsh government could strengthen some of the initiatives in community-led housing, such as community ownership models that would transfer property and land to local housing associations or social enterprises, helping to alleviate the housing crisis. A more radical policy would involve offering tax incentives to encourage people to remain in their areas, or to encourage Welsh-speaking newcomers to move into “threatened” areas. Farmers have been paid levies to nurture endangered landscapes, so why not pay Welsh speakers a similar levy to move to an endangered community and help keep the language alive? Despite the erosion of Welsh-speaking communities in north and west Wales, there is still plenty to be hopeful about. Cardiff’s council leader, Huw Thomas, has committed to establishing more Welsh-speaking schools and offering more classes taught in Welsh at English-speaking schools. In other authority areas, there are plans to create Welsh streams in English-speaking schools and to open dual language schools. Meanwhile, initiatives such as the Canolfan Dysgu Cymraeg Cenedlaethol’s (National Centre for Learning Welsh)“Siarad” scheme pairs new speakers with proficient native speakers, giving language learners informal opportunities to mix in places where Welsh is dominant. Many people learning Welsh are likely to see the language as a utilitarian skill they need in order to get a job in particular sectors, rather than as a language for social interaction. To show why Welsh is an important foundation for people living in and contributing to Welsh society, we need leadership and inspiration. Linguistic and community decline is not inevitable. Given the national and local will, there’s no reason we can’t safeguard the Welsh language for future generations. Colin Williams is a professor at Cardiff University’s School of Welsh and a senior research associate at Cambridge University • This article was amended on 24 November 2022.

He underestimated Ukrainian resilience and European readiness to punish Kremlin aggression with sanctions. That forced Mr Putin into a longer game. Now he is betting that European reliance on Russian gas exports will corrode western solidarity, leading to a degrading of sanctions and restored tolerance of Moscow’s territorial aggressions. To hasten that scenario, Russia has cut the flow of gas through the main east-west pipeline. The Kremlin’s message of strategic extortion is not subtle: go softer on the war and have a cosier winter; stay tough and freeze. European solidarity is just about holding. Earlier this week EU members agreed a deal to cut gas usage by 15% as part of a phased move away from reliance on Russian supplies. But the deal is diluted by opt-outs and exceptions for various countries. Hungary, the EU state that is cosiest with the Kremlin, has not signed up at all. The view in Brussels is that energy security is an issue that proves the importance of transnational collaboration and should add momentum to political, economic and strategic integration. That is true in theory. In practice, it brings new tensions between member states and aggravates old ones. Spain, for example, has invested in infrastructure to help it diversify its energy supply in ways that Germany has not. Viewed from Madrid, the demand for solidarity looks like a tax on foresight to pay for Berlin’s longstanding complacency about the strategic threat from Russia. French power supplies are mostly nuclear, but President Macron is an avowed European integrationist who fears a wider threat to the eurozone if the German economy is damaged by soaring gas bills. It is not only German consumers who are facing a shock. The country’s politicians are struggling to adapt to the new reality in which an attitude to Russia that they proudly thought of as reasonable and diplomatic now looks like a colossal geostrategic blunder. That vulnerability is compounded by Germany’s decision, in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima accident in Japan, to phase out all nuclear power use. The wisdom of that move is also being queried. The long-term solution to this challenge is clear enough. It requires an accelerated transition to renewable energy sources, which has the additional benefit of being something Europe and the rest of the world urgently needs to do anyway in order to avert a climate catastrophe. But pressures of the short term push in the opposite direction – towards reviving dirty coal-burning power plants and deals with other nasty authoritarian states that have hydrocarbon resources to export. Most dangerous is the way rising fuel bills bolster the school of populist denial that says the transition to green energy is an unaffordable luxury at a time of rising inflation and slower growth. That argument already has a purchase in many European countries. It is not yet a prominent feature of the current Tory leadership contest but it is there, cultivated by backbenchers and imposing a reluctance on the candidates to commit wholeheartedly to any meaningful green agenda. That is a symptom of dismal strategic myopia. Mr Putin’s cynical weaponisation of gas supplies makes the case for a new energy paradigm every bit as eloquently as the most passionate advocate of idealistic environmentalism – and in terms that speak to a more conservative audience. There are few win-win propositions in global affairs. But one that could be embraced as a cross-party consensus is the green energy route that simultaneously breaks the Kremlin’s pernicious influence and slashes carbon emissions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/sep/06/ingrid-pollard-three-drops-of-blood-review-honiton","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-06T10:16:01Z","webTitle":"Ingrid Pollard: Three Drops of Blood review – finding magic and myths among the ferns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/sep/06/ingrid-pollard-three-drops-of-blood-review-honiton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/sep/06/ingrid-pollard-three-drops-of-blood-review-honiton","fields":{"headline":"Ingrid Pollard: Three Drops of Blood review – finding magic and myths among the ferns","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"With the opening of her survey show, Carbon Slowly Turning, at MK Gallery in March (now running at Turner Contemporary, Margate, until 25 September), 2022 had already shaped up as a major year in the career of photographer and visual artist Ingrid Pollard. Then in April she was nominated for the Turner prize, commended by a jury “struck by bold new developments” in her recent work as well as for the way she has “for decades […] uncovered stories and histories hidden in plain sight”. In works ranging from The Cost of the English Landscape (1989), which connected romantic visions of the Lake District with references to the slave trade and nuclear power production at Sellafield, to Landscape Trauma (2001), where the geological structures of Northumbrian rock formations are writ large on vast photographic panels, Pollard has, for more than 40 years, reflected the inadequacy of simplistic narratives about England’s landscape and in contrast offered an artistic vision of engagement with the natural world that grasps, above all, its movement and complexity. A new series of kinetic sculptures will, in this vein, crown her contribution to the Turner prize exhibition that opens at Tate Liverpool in October. Until then, perhaps the best evidence around that here is an artist who, at 69, is only now coming into the peak of her creative powers, is to be found off the beaten track, at the Thelma Hulbert Gallery in Honiton, east Devon, where a new solo show, Three Drops of Blood, brings together Pollard’s recent engagement with 19th-century botanical collections and East Devon’s history as a former world centre of lace-manufacturing with her own enduring concern with questions of race and the legacies of empire. Curated by Devon-based Talking on Corners (AKA Ella S Mills, whose art historical research has focused on female figures of the British Black Arts Movements including Pollard, Sonia Boyce, Lubaina Himid and Claudette Johnson), the exhibition marks the culmination of two years’ research by Pollard across the county including at the Devon and Exeter Institution where, among other details, she unearthed folk histories of the fern. This element runs through the show connecting perfect reproductions of xylotheks – wooden boxes used for storing tree specimens – and classification-photography, with contemporary reflections by the Antiguan American writer Jamaica Kincaid on communing with people and plants in the Himalayas, and of ways other than colonial adventure of being in the world. The fern, it transpires, is part of our ancient landscape, dating back more than 300m years, and predating even the advent of dinosaurs, to the Carboniferous period. Its reproduction was for centuries a mystery – no flowers or pods – inspiring beliefs of magical agency. It was said, for example, that anyone who held invisible fern seeds would be invisible too, and that by shooting them into the sun with an arrow on midsummer’s day, three drops of blood would fall and anyone who caught the drops would “gain knowledge of all things” and could keep the devil at bay. This poetic resonance in the title also points to the way that imagination, in Pollard’s latest work, emerges as the substance that holds so many disparate elements together, transfiguring and transforming. Where a younger Pollard’s sometimes harsh, often ironic, juxtaposition of images or text and image, might lead us headlong into a chasm of contradiction that can be discerned in the heart of Englishness and England’s cultural mythology, here she emerges as a master of synthesis and humanism. She draws out the invisible threads that connect landscapes and histories and establishes a sense of liberated being that moves freely within space and time. Anonymous portraits of Africans, for example, are rescued from the pages of antiquarian books. While once these images may have spoken, through Pollard, to the violence of black voices erased by the colonial archive, here they are recast on black fabric patterned with white polka dots and become the centre of a visual dance that stimulates the eye and makes the spirit soar. An experience of transcendence is conveyed, bearing out Pollard’s own claim, in a text that accompanies the exhibition (drawing on a conversation with Sussex professor Divya P Tolia-Kelly), that this is “the most kind of dreamy piece of work” she’s ever done. Like a dream, it renders things forgotten and unseen and it lands with a sense of sublime restitution.

The Coryton complex in Essex dates back to 1895, and its use has changed over the years. Behind the lions loom the grey girders of a gas-fired power plant capable of generating electricity for up to 800,000 homes – and substantial profits for its owner. Debate is raging over the role of gas-fired electricity in the energy crisis. Coryton is one of a fleet of UK peaking plants, so-called because they tend to be fired up at peak consumption times, a backstop when other contributors to the grid, such as windfarms, underperform. But they also attract some of the highest rates per megawatt hour (MWh) of any power source, and those rates have jumped with the gas price since the invasion of Ukraine,leading to calls for their profits to be capped. Another source of controversy is that unlike oil and gas extraction, peaking plant income is not subject to the government’s windfall tax. The design of Britain’s energy market is under scrutiny as never before, as efforts to decarbonise collide with a need to keep the lights on during the Russian-inflicted gas shortage. Ofgem will soon publish proposals designed to prevent backup generators from raking in “excessive” profits as part of their licence conditions. Supporters argue they are an essential rapid source of electricity supplies, and cannot be relied upon to produce reliable profits; detractors say they are owned by sophisticated traders maximising returns when the market is tight. Last month National Grid paid a record £27m on a single day to get power stations to crank up supply at short notice, including £6,000 a MWh to fire up Rye House power station in Hertfordshire. Rye House belongs to VPI, a subsidiary of the Swiss trading multinational Vitol. Like many other peaking plants, it has passed into the hands of overseas investors as some of the biggest UK operators have exited the market. Coryton was owned by InterGen until last week. It now belongs to the Czech financier Pavel Hubáček’s Creditas investment group, which bought it from another Czech businessman and China Huaneng and Guangdong Energy. Yet another Czech billionaire, Daniel Křetínský, owns EP UK Investments, which has a power plant collection that includes South Humber Bank and Langage – formerly owned by Centrica. Known as the Czech Sphinx for his aversion to publicity, Křetínský has varied UK interests, including stakes in Sainsbury’s and Royal Mail. Prices paid for gas-powered electricity this winter are unprecedented. The average offer price for “balancing actions” – to align supply and demand – between the start of September and early January was £287 a MWh. Data from Elexon, which oversees the market, shows Rye House submitted the 20 highest winter bids – between £5,000 and £6,000 a MWh – for varying volumes of power on 12 December, setting new records. That day, VPI earned more than £11m, while InterGen received an estimated £12.6m from Coryton, according to figures from the market data platform EnAppSys. InterGen said a rise in demand had produced a “particularly pronounced spike” on 12 December, and that it always acted “in line with regulations and guidance issued to the market, to provide energy to balance the grid and keep the lights on across the UK”. Among the other plants bidding above-average winter prices were Uniper’s Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal-fired plant in Nottinghamshire and its gas power station Killingholme in north Lincolnshire, as well as Dinorwig, a pumped hydroelectric power plant in north Wales that is majority-owned by the French multinational Engie and is the fastest source of electricity in the UK. Cowes power station on the Isle of Wight and the Didcot plant in Oxfordshire both bid at £1,500 for small volumes in October. Controversially, none of these profits have been subject to the windfall tax introduced by Rishi Sunak when he was chancellor and expanded under Jeremy Hunt. Companies House records showed VPI Holding’s pre-tax profits surged from £44m in 2020 to £204m in 2021, on turnover that more than doubled to £2.1bn. Reuters reported in September that Vitol made more profit in the first half of 2022 than in the whole of 2021 – close to $4.5bn (£3.6bn), compared with a net record of just over $4.2bn in the 12 months before. The ‘electricity penalty shootout’ The country’s electricity supply industry is a complex jigsaw puzzle designed to encourage the generation of everything from wind, solar and nuclear power to biomass and gas-fired. Underpinning this is the “balancing market”, operated in effect by National Grid, which relies on offering the right prices to incentivise power plants to help balance supply and demand. Last winter, the network operator tripled its spend on balancing the grid to £1.5bn. The system is designed to prioritise renewable electricity ahead of nuclear, coal and gas. The electricity price in every half-hour period is set by the marginal cost of the last generating unit to be turned off to meet demand – usually gas-fired plants, which have the highest costs. While gas prices were low, there were few objections to this system, but the energy crisis has triggered repeated calls for gas and electricity pricing to be delinked. The supplier Good Energy draws the analogy with a penalty shootout in football: the best players (renewables) are selected first “but it’s the individual who steps up last who has the final say, deciding the fate of the result” – in this case, the cost. Gas-fired power still plays a significant role in Britain’s electricity makeup, accounting for 38% of generation last year – a three-year high as the single largest source of power and well ahead of a record 25.6% for wind. If peaking plants are used regularly, their role could be seen more as “baseload” than backup power. There are concerns about the tactics used by some generators. The energy regulator Ofgem said in November that last winter some generators had declared their plants unavailable to the grid, before later offering power at much higher prices. In 2020, Ofgem required InterGen to pay £37m after concluding that it “sent misleading signals to National Grid in 2016 about how much energy it would supply during peak winter hours to make a substantial profit”. The regulator found InterGen made £12.8m through “manipulation of the market”. At the time, the company said: “We deeply regret and sincerely apologise for the behaviour of former traders.” VPI said any suggestion it had made excessive profits was “not accurate” and that it operated “within the rules of the energy market”. It said peaking plants operated “less frequently, with costs to generate and pricing dependent on market conditions”. A spokesperson added: “VPI has invested to almost triple its generation capacity in the last two years and revenue has grown as a result.” Left out from the levy When Hunt extended the windfall tax last year from oil and gas producers to the excess profits from nuclear, solar and wind, he exempted gas peaking plants, warning of “unintended impacts” amid fears European gas supplies could fall short of demand, leading to blackouts. ScottishPower’s chief executive, Keith Anderson, condemned the decision. “The crisis has been made by gas and paid for by renewables,” he said, adding that it was “strange” for government to “cap the price of low-carbon generation and to leave gas generation untouched”. But Tom Glover, the UK country chair of RWE, which owns several gas-fired stations, said they could go for many years without making enough profit. “It’s important that when prices improve and allow them to make higher returns they are able to keep that profit so that they are incentivised to keep these power stations open during lower priced periods. These stations are like insurance policies for the whole market,” he said. A lengthy process designed to deink the price of electricity from gas has begun. Before that, authorities will have to decide whether to act or to stomach peaking plants making significant – if unpredictable – profits."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/feb/21/hawks-in-iran-and-israel-agree-bidens-bid-to-salvage-nuclear-deal-must-not-succeed","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-02-21T07:00:54Z","webTitle":"Hawks in Iran and Israel agree: Biden’s bid to salvage nuclear deal must not succeed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/21/hawks-in-iran-and-israel-agree-bidens-bid-to-salvage-nuclear-deal-must-not-succeed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/feb/21/hawks-in-iran-and-israel-agree-bidens-bid-to-salvage-nuclear-deal-must-not-succeed","fields":{"headline":"Hawks in Iran and Israel agree: Biden’s bid to salvage nuclear deal must not succeed","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"For sworn enemies, Iran and Israel have much in common. Both are regional powers, projecting their interests beyond their borders. Both are beholden, in different ways, to shifting US policy. Both have secretive nuclear programmes. And both are heading towards national elections – in Israel next month, in Iran in June – that could decide whether cold-hearted enmity turns into hot-blooded war. The stand-off over Iran’s alleged attempts, which are always denied, to acquire atomic bomb-making capacity has gone on for so long that its dangers are often underestimated. Yet the coming days are crucial. Iran has set 21 February as a deadline for an easing of unilateral US sanctions. If it is ignored, Tehran is threatening to ban snap UN inspections of its nuclear facilities and further ramp up proscribed atomic activities. That could sound the death knell for the 2015 nuclear deal that was negotiated by Barack Obama and European countries, which has slowly unravelled since Donald Trump reneged on it in 2018. Joe Biden says he wants to salvage the deal. Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s centrist president, has offered to negotiate. But each side, trapped by decades of hostility, is insisting that the other takes the first step. The escalating crisis has brought a flurry of diplomatic activity in recent days, involving Germany and Qatar who are acting as go-betweens. Crucially, the US accepted an EU invitation to join talks with Iran on returning to mutual compliance with the deal. In its response on Friday, Iran’s foreign ministry stuck to its previous position that all sanctions must be lifted before talks can begin This will not be the last word. But it is a reminder of the sobering – and alarming – reality that powerful individuals and factions on both sides are doing all they can to ensure the 2015 deal definitively collapses. In Iran, hardline candidates and members of the Majlis (parliament), focused on June’s presidential poll, oppose any kind of rapprochement with America. They include leading presidential hopeful Hossein Dehghan. He reportedly has the backing of Iran’s ultra-conservative supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has sworn never to talk to America. Dehghan accuses Biden of bad faith. “We still see the same policies … as we did from the Trump team: not lifting the oppressive sanctions against the Iranian people,” he told the Guardian Such scepticism reflects genuine distrust, and fear of another Trump-style stab in the back. But it is also the result of calculation, suggested analyst Saeid Jafari . “Biden’s victory [over Trump] came as a big disappointment to hardliners seeking to undermine Rouhani’s last-ditch effort to save the nuclear accord,” he wrote. They may try to scupper any talks. “They had hoped Trump’s re-election would help them oust reformist and moderate candidates in June … Now hardliners are taking every measure to pave the way for an extremist candidate to come to power … They are doing everything they can to prevent the revival of the nuclear deal.” Strong opposition to the deal, however Biden plays it, is evident in Israel, where the hard-right prime minister and close Trump ally, Benjamin Netanyahu, is fighting for his political life. Netanyahu encouraged Trump to ditch the pact, even as Israel has expanded its own nuclear facilities. He vehemently warns against resurrecting it as he woos Jewish supremacist parties in Israel’s fourth election in two years. Netanyahu’s stance is not controversial in Israel, where Iran is viewed as an existential threat. The argument is with Biden and Democrats in Washington. They have not forgiven the Israeli leader for undermining Obama’s peacemaking efforts. It was no accident Biden waited nearly a month after assuming the presidency before calling Netanyahu last week. The White House is said to privately hope Netanyahu loses. Jerusalem’s hawks have many supporters in Washington. The veteran neoconservative Elliott Abrams is one. He is urging an uncompromising “policy of deterrence” to subdue Iran, backed by armed force. Biden’s offer to talk has prompted accusations of “appeasement”. There has been fierce pushback in some quarters over Biden’s appointment of Robert Malley, an ardent advocate of diplomacy over force, as Iran envoy. Concern is also building that Biden’s deliberate distancing from the Saudi crown prince and suspected murderer, Mohammed bin Salman, a close collaborator with Trump and Netanyahu, will be another dangerous gift to Iran. Last week’s rocket attack on a coalition base in northern Iraq and Houthi drone strikes on Saudi Arabia from Yemen are cited by American and Israeli hardliners as proof that Iran and its allied militias will not halt their regional power-games – and that Biden is naive if he believes that fanatical fundamentalists would honour any settlement. Additional obstacles to progress include Washington’s wish to expand future negotiations to include Iran’s ballistic missiles, military presence in Syria, and support for Shia militias in Lebanon and elsewhere. Complicating matters, China and Russia will unhelpfully demand a say. Against all this must be set common sense. Trump’s maximum pressure policy failed miserably. It did not mitigate regional tensions or reduce proxy attacks. Rather, illegal US and Israeli assassinations of high-profile figures increased them. Sanctions have hurt Iranians, but did not topple the regime or change its behaviour. Iran is closer now to a nuclear weapon than in 2016. Biden’s instinct to try to break this impasse and find a diplomatic way through – supported by the UK, Germany and France – is the right one. But words are not enough. As a sign of good faith, he should swiftly relax some sanctions and unfreeze Iran’s Covid-related $5bn IMF loan request. Time is short. Proving peace works may be the only way to halt the fatal advance of warmongers in Israel and Iran."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/28/millions-of-households-pay-170-more-for-energy-due-to-tory-subsidy-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-28T05:00:45Z","webTitle":"Millions of households pay £170 more for energy due to Tory subsidy cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/28/millions-of-households-pay-170-more-for-energy-due-to-tory-subsidy-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/28/millions-of-households-pay-170-more-for-energy-due-to-tory-subsidy-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Millions of households pay £170 more for energy due to Tory subsidy cuts","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Millions of households are paying an extra £170 in bills because of cuts to subsidies for measures such as home insulation, according to analysis that comes during an impasse on the government’s energy strategy. One cabinet source said it was now likely the strategy – designed to tackle rising bills and boost energy security – would not be ready this week, amid cabinet splits over funding for nuclear power and the relaxing of planning rules concerning onshore wind. On Sunday one cabinet minister suggested the government was looking seriously at schemes to offer homeowners discounts on energy if they live near new windfarms or nuclear plants. “We’ve seen great examples of other people where if they build a nuclear power station, within a certain radius of that power station they get free power,” said the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi. Campaigners have said the strategy should include further measures to make homes more energy efficient, on top of the announcement last week that VAT would be cut on materials used for measures such as the installation of solar panels and heat pumps. Analysis highlighted by Labour found a fall in home insulation rates since 2012, when many subsidies were cut, meaning that at least 9 million households were now paying £170 a year more in electricity bills. The party has called for a national homes insulation programme, which the shadow climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, said would reduce energy consumption enough to nullify the amount of gas imported from Russia. Installations averaged 40,000 a month in 2012 under the previous government’s insulation programmes, the carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) and the community energy saving programme (CESP). But these ended at the end of 2012 and were replaced by other schemes, including a loan system that had low take-up. The analysis by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit suggests insulation rates subsequently fell by 92%. An additional 9 million households would be likely to have benefited from the energy-saving measures had they continued at pre-2012 levels. Labour has pledged £60bn of public investment to bring all homes up to the energy performance certificate (EPC) band C rating over 10 years, claiming it would save each family £400 a year on their energy bills and cut national gas imports by up to 15%. The average E-rated home is set to require an additional £320 a year for energy bills compared with a C-rated property. “The chancellor’s disastrous spring statement is unraveling because he failed to tackle the cost of living crisis that working people face,” Miliband said. “The government’s energy relaunch will have no credibility unless it finally delivers on energy efficiency – the best, most effective way to reduce energy bills, cut our demand for fossil fuels and bring down carbon emissions.” Sunak is expected to come under fire at the Treasury select committee hearing on Monday after a furious response to the spring statement, widely seen as not doing enough to ease the cost of living crisis. Johnson is expected to try to reconcile senior cabinet ministers this week amid fallout from the spring statement, and to resolve tensions over the energy strategy. A government source confirmed reports in the Sunday Times that Downing Street was looking at preliminary proposals for a new council tax rebate in the autumn, with consumers facing the possibility of further fuel bill rises in October. On Friday the energy price cap will rise by almost £700 to £1,971 – and it could rise to about £2,500 by October 2022 for the average dual fuel bill. Meanwhile, Zahawi hinted that the government could do more to help with the cost of living crisis. “I think he [Rishi Sunak, the chancellor] will continue to keep an eye on this, it’s only right,” he said. “It’s irresponsible for me to say ‘job done’ because energy prices are volatile, inflation remains high, so it would be absolutely irresponsible to say ‘job done’. But I think £22bn, in one year, of help when you’ve just spent £400bn is the right thing to do.” The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said Sunak had been “playing games” by announcing a future 1p cut to income tax in the statement while people were struggling this year. “Rishi Sunak absolutely had more room for manoeuvre in this spring statement and mini budget, but rather than acting in the interests of the British people, he was playing games,” Ashworth said. “He was acting in his own interest because he thinks by offering an income tax cut in two years, that’ll help him politically with Conservative MPs if there’s a leadership contest or that’ll fit the Tory election grid.” As well as a major expansion in energy efficiency measures, Labour has called for the chancellor to cut VAT on energy bills and to impose a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies, as well as cancelling the planned rise in national insurance from April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/aug/12/boris-johnson-says-uk-energy-bill-support-package-is-not-enough","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T14:31:03Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson says UK energy-bill support package is not enough","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/12/boris-johnson-says-uk-energy-bill-support-package-is-not-enough","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/aug/12/boris-johnson-says-uk-energy-bill-support-package-is-not-enough","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson says UK energy-bill support package is not enough","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has acknowledged that the package of support to help people pay surging energy bills is not enough, as the split deepens between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss over how to deal with the crisis. Amid forecasts that energy bills could hit £5,000 a year by next April, the prime minister made clear that he expected his successor to act. Asked if the current package of £400 off energy bills, plus a £650 cost-of-living payment for vulnerable households, was enough, Johnson said: “No, because what I’m saying what we’re doing in addition is trying to make sure that by October, by January, there is further support, and what the government will be doing, whoever is the prime minister, is making sure there is extra cash to help people.” Johnson said earlier this week that he was sure his successor would offer more help with the cost of living, but Truss has held off spelling out how she would act and repeatedly dismissed the idea of “Gordon Brown style” “handouts”. Her stance appears to have slightly softened, with her campaign suggesting help would be forthcoming. However, Thérèse Coffey, the work and pensions secretary and one of Truss’s key allies, said on Friday that the cost of bills would be “nowhere near” the levels predicted by independent analysts. Defending Truss, Coffey said: “She is absolutely an MP who knows what it is like for struggling households and that is why, quite rightly in a considered way, once Ofgem comes up with their price cap … all of government … and it will be a decision for the new prime minister to enact what changes could be made.” Sunak announced a £10bn package on Friday designed to help with energy bills this autumn, saying he could be open to “some limited and temporary one-off borrowing as a last resort to get us through this winter”. “People need reassurance now about what we will do and I make no apology for concentrating on what matters most,” Sunak wrote in the Times, which reported that he valued a cut to VAT on energy at £5bn. He was also said to have promised to find the same amount again to go towards helping those most in need, as he said: “You can’t heat your home with hope.” The former chancellor also highlighted Truss’s refusal to say whether she would maintain the windfall tax on oil and gas profits, which is expected to bring in more than £5bn from oil and gas giants making money out of high prices. In an interview with Times Radio, Sunak defended the windfall tax he had implemented as chancellor, saying it would “automatically raise more money” in tax to support struggling households as energy profits increase. The former chancellor added: “I think that is the right thing to do and I think Liz Truss last night said she opposed doing that, and actually didn’t believe in that policy, so I think that is a question for her to answer.” He also said his opponent’s plans to cut taxes would do “virtually nothing” for pensioners or the least well off. A Sunak campaign spokesperson added that Truss had “blown a further £5bn black hole in her plans” by not backing the windfall tax. Sunak also rejected the idea that Truss was the frontrunner and likely to win, saying that “lots of people have not made up their mind”. After Thursday’s hustings, Truss reiterated her belief that tax cuts should be the main response to soaring bills. Truss told an audience of Tory members in Cheltenham that this would always be her “first port of call”, followed by a focus on longer-term energy supply issues such as support for fracking and nuclear power. Truss said she could provide other assistance, but gave no details, saying she “can’t write the chancellor’s budget” before even being elected as prime minister. “If the answer to every question is raising tax, we will choke off economic growth, and we will send ourselves to penury, and I think that’s a massive problem,” she said. • This article was amended on 15 August 2022 to clarify that the government’s £400 and £650 payments are separate grants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/mar/03/ukraine-news-russia-war-vladimir-putin-biden-latest-live-updates-kherson-kyiv-kharkiv-refugees-russian-invasion","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T05:31:03Z","webTitle":"More than 500 international students trapped in Ukrainian town – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/mar/03/ukraine-news-russia-war-vladimir-putin-biden-latest-live-updates-kherson-kyiv-kharkiv-refugees-russian-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/mar/03/ukraine-news-russia-war-vladimir-putin-biden-latest-live-updates-kherson-kyiv-kharkiv-refugees-russian-invasion","fields":{"headline":"More than 500 international students trapped in Ukrainian town – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This liveblog is closing now but our coverage continues on this liveblog. Thank you for reading. It is 7.27am in Ukraine as Russia’s war on its neighbour enters its ninth day. Here is where the crisis stands: A fire broke out in a training building outside a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Friday, after being shelled by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said. An employee at the plant said Russian forces had fired on the facility and there was “a real threat of nuclear danger at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe”. After burning for at least four hours amid reports Russian troops had prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze, Ukrainian emergency services confirmed the blaze was extinguished at 6.20am local time. Fighting at the plant has also reportedly stopped, according to the mayor of Enerhodar, a town located south-east of the plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier said it had put its Incident and Emergency Centre in “full 24/7 response mode” due to the “serious situation” unfolding at Zaporizhzhia. However, US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm provided reassurance surrounding the Zaporizhzhia power plant reactors, saying there was no elevated radiation readings near the facility and the plant’s reactors are “protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy made another appeal to Europe for help following the attack on the nuclear plant. He said: We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism. British prime minister Boris Johnson called Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “reckless actions” a danger to the safety of Europe. Russian forces continue to control both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol. Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv. In a televised speech shortly after his 90-minute call with Macron, Putin claimed Russian military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. The president went on to accuse Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields” while providing no evidence. Ukrainian emergency services have confirmed a fire in the training building of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant has been extinguished after a blaze burned for at least four hours throughout early Friday morning. No casualties have so far been reported. An update published to the State Emergency Services official Telegram account reads: At 06:20 the fire in the training building of Zaporizhzhya NPP in Energodar was extinguished. There are no victims.” Home rental company Airbnb Inc is suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus, according to chief executive officer Brian Chesky. The mayor of Enerhodar, a town located about 150km south-east of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, has said fighting at the plant has stopped, according to BBC Ukrainian, citing a local broadcaster. The news comes after the plant reportedly sustained several hours of heavy shelling and a fire which broke out on the third, fourth and fifth floor of a building at the complex, according to Ukrainian emergency officials. Ukrainian emergency services have confirmed a fire in the training building of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant has been localised just before 6am local time. An update published to the State Emergency Services official Telegram account reads: At 05:55 a fire in the training building (size 60x40 m) of Zaporizhzhya NPP in Enerhodar was localised on an area of 2 thousand square meters.” Guardian reporters Calla Wahlquist and Donna Lu have compiled an explainer on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant with all the details you need to know. You can read their full report below. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says it has puts its Incident and Emergency Centre in “full 24/7 response mode” due to the “serious situation” unfolding at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. IAEA director general, Rafael Gross, added he was “deeply concerned” with the situation and had spoken with Ukraine’s prime minister Denys Shmygal to monitor and stay in close contact with Ukraine’s nuclear regulator and operator. https://twitter.com/rafaelmgrossi/status/1499595087432626176?s=20&amp;t=UvSEC6j6NoH1WTvVJ9ZfTg Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau has also confirmed he has spoken with Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy about the “horrific attacks “at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. “These unacceptable attacks by Russia must cease immediately,” Trudeau said. Ukrainian emergency services have confirmed rescue teams are currently on the site of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant to extinguish the fire which started earlier in the morning in the training building. Earlier, the agency said Russian troops has prevented emergency teams from attending to the blaze. However, in an update published to its official Telegram account just after 5.30am local time, the service said as of 5.20am, SES units had been deployed to put out the fire in the training building. Meanwhile, US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has provided more reassurance surrounding the reactors at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, confirming she had spoken with Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Galushchenko. In an update posted to Twitter, Granholm said: We have seen no elevated radiation readings near the facility. The plant’s reactors are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down.” Ukrainian emergency services are saying Russian troops are preventing them from extinguishing a fire that continues to burn at a nuclear power plant after it was struck by shelling. In an update published to its official Telegram account at 4am local time, the State Emergency Services said: The occupiers do not allow the SES units [Ukrainian public rescue teams] to start eliminating the consequences of the fire.” The agency said that one of the buildings of the plant’s training complex “continues to burn”, adding that “the fire covered 3, 4, 5 floors of a five-storey building.” Corroborating an early analysis from the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Julian Borger, reporter Donna Lu brings us another perspective from Tony Irwin, an honorary associate professor at the Australian National University. According to Iwin, the chances of explosion, nuclear meltdown or radioactive release from the Zaporizhzhya power plant are low. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, the largest in Europe, contains six 950 megawatt pressurised water nuclear (PWR) reactors. Irwin said the PWR reactors are “a lot safer” than the reactors at Chernobyl, and did not appear to be damaged yet. The reactors have large concrete contaminants and built-in fire protection systems, he said, adding: “Obviously, it’s not a good idea if you start shooting massive missiles at reactors. The PWR type is a much safer sort of reactor, because it’s a two-circuit design reactor. The water that keeps the reactor cool is on a separate circuit to the second one, which actually supplies the power to the turbine and the outside. The chance of a [radioactive] release from this sort of reactor is a lot lower. These reactors have back-up emergency cooling systems as well. In addition to the normal reactor cooling, they got a passive system, they’ve got high pressure injection systems, they’ve got low-pressure injection systems. The passive cooling systems work in the absence of electricity supply or diesel generators, Irwin said. “Ultimately if they disabled all the outside supplies [of electricity] and all the diesel generators, eventually there won’t be enough cooling and you’ll melt the core. But I think we’re a long way off from that at the moment. Irwin, who operated nuclear power plants in the UK for three decades, is a former manager of the open-pool Australian lightwater (OPAL) reactor, Australia’s only nuclear reactor. A shutdown of the Zaporizhzhya plant would lead to a “severe loss of power in Ukraine”, he said. A fire is reportedly still burning in Europe’s largest nuclear power plant located in Zaporizhzhia, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Services. Andriy Tuz, a spokesperson for the plant appeared on Telegram earlier in the morning around 3am local time, saying: “There is a real threat of a nuclear danger at the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe. We demand that they stop the heavy weapons fire at the energy blocks of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.” Video footage of the fire - which broke out early in the morning on Friday - can be viewed below. Here is an analysis on the significance of the nuclear power plant attack from the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Juian Borger. The confinement chambers of a nuclear reactor are built to withstand heavy impact and even bombing, while the VVER pressurised water reactor itself is designed to shut down in an emergency. VVER reactors are considered much safer than the type of reactor that blew up in Chernobyl in 1986, for example. But nuclear safety experts warned that any interruption to the power supply that affects the cooling system could start a chain of events that could lead to disaster, as could a direct hit on the spent fuel pools which are not as well protected as the reactors. “If the building is not damaged and if the reactors entered safe shut down, and have secondary or tertiary cooling systems then there should be little risk. If those conditions are not met, there is a significant risk,” Jon Wolfsthal, a former senior director for arms control and nonproliferation at the national security council, said on Twitter. The Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine – which houses six of the country’s 15 nuclear reactors – as well as the neighbouring town of Energodar, have been surrounded by Russian troops since the beginning of the week. Read the full story below. British prime minister Boris Johnson has spoken with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy after news broke about a fire at the nuclear power station in Zaporizhzhia, calling Putin’s “reckless actions” a danger to the safety of Europe. A Downing Street spokeswoman called the situation “gravely concerning”. PA Media reports the spokeswoman said: Both leaders agreed that Russia must immediately cease its attack on the power station and allow unfettered access for emergency services to the plant. The Prime Minister said the reckless actions of President Putin could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe. He said the UK would do everything it could to ensure the situation did not deteriorate further. The Prime Minister said he would be seeking an emergency UN Security Council meeting in the coming hours, and that the UK would raise this issue immediately with Russia and close partners. Both leaders agreed a ceasefire was crucial.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has made another appeal to Europe for help following the attack on Ukraine’s nuclear plant. Europe must wake up now. The largest nuclear station in Europe is on fire. Right now Russian tanks are shelling nuclear units. Those are the tanks that have thermal vision, so they know where they are shelling. They prepared for it. I address all Ukrainians and all Europeans to all people who know the word Chernobyl who know how much suffering and victims were caused by the explosion at the nuclear station. It was a global disaster. Hundreds of thousands of people fought against its consequences. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated. Russia wants to repeat it but six times harder. Europeans, please, wake up. Tell your politicians, Russian troops are shelling [the] Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, the city of Enerhodar. There are 6 energy unit. Six. One unit exploded in Chernobyl. We warn everyone that not a single nation ever shelled nuclear power stations. For the first time in the history of humankind, the terrorist state commits nuclear terrorism. Russian propagandists threatened to cover the world with nuclear ashes. Now it’s not a threat. It’s a reality. We don’t know how the fire at the station will end, when an explosion will happen, god willing, it won’t happen. Our guys always kept the station safe, so there were no provocations, so that nobody could seize the station, so that nobody could plant mines at the station then blackmail the whole world with a nuclear disaster. We must stop Russian troops. Tell your politicians: Ukraine is 15 nuclear units. If there will be an explosion, it will the end to all of us, the end of Europe, the evacuation of Europe. Only immediate action of Europe can stop Russian troops and prevent the death of Europe from the disaster at a nuclear station.” Our diplomatic editor has more on the call between Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the wake of the nuclear plant fire: Authorities at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant say the facility is secured and “nuclear safety is now guaranteed” after Russian military shelling starts fire, Agence France-Presse reports. US President Joe Biden has just spoken with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as the White House continues to monitor the fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. According to readout of the call published by the White House Press Office, Biden joined Zelenskiy in urging Russia to cease its military activities in the area and allowing firefighters and emergency responders to access the site. Biden also spoke with under secretary for nuclear security of the US Department of Energy and Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to receive an update on the situation at the plant. Andrey Tuz, spokesman for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, has said shelling has stopped for the time being, but the situation is extremely uncertain. Speaking to the BBC Russian Service, he said: They bombed everything they could, including blocks and everything else. Now the information is being clarified, it’s hard to say everything. [To the station] a white car, representatives of the Russian military, has left. It’s flashing with its headlights. Now it’s being determined whether they will be approached for negotiations, or how to proceed further.” A series of photos from the air and on the ground provide some more context as to the location and significance of the recent Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant fire. The Ukrainian State Emergency Service is reporting that radiation and fire safety conditions at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are “within normal limits”. An update on the agency’s official Telegram account reads: As of 02:26 in the city of Energodar at the Zaporizhzhia NPP, the third power unit was disconnected from the unified energy system (only Unit 4 is operating). Of the six power units, one is currently operating. Radiation and fire safety conditions at nuclear power plants are within normal limits. Fire condition at the NPP is normal.” The agency said a fire broke out in the training building outside the NPP, however the Guardian has been unable to verify these claims. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the Ukraine regulator told the agency there has been “no change” reported in radiation levels at the plant. Here’s exactly where the attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine took place early on Friday morning. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says they are aware of reports of shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and are in contact with Ukrainian authorities. According to a statement, the IAEE said Ukraine had informed the agency that a large number of Russian tanks and infantry “broke through the block-post” to the town of Enerhodar, a few kilometres from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). Director general Rafael Mariano Grossi appealed for an immediate halt to the use of force at Enerhodar and called on the military forces operating there to refrain from violence near the nuclear power plant. He added the IAEA continues to consult with Ukraine and others with a view to provide “maximum possible assistance to the country” as it seeks to maintain nuclear safety and security. The Guardian’s Julian Borger has spoken to Mariana Budjeryn, an Ukrainian expert at the project on managing the atom at Harvard University’s Belfer Center. Budjeryn said: Saying that a reactor building is hit doesn’t tell us much, because the most vulnerable [part of] this is the electricity and water supply. If the electricity is taken out, the back up generators kick in, but if those don’t kick in or their diesel fuel is set on fire, for example, the pumps can’t pump cold water into the reactor and into the spent fuel pools. That’s necessary to keep the nuclear reaction moderated. Otherwise the water will boil out and the core will go critical and explode. If the core explodes, there’s hope that the confinement chamber will capture the radiation from release into the environment. Confinement chambers are designed with withstand some level of impact even bombing. But of course we don’t know how they will stand to this intensity of shelling BUT spent fuel pools - the fuel there is not as active, but they are usually overstuffed - so less active but more tightly packed material, also dangerous for going critical if the cooling system fails. And spent fuel pools are not covered by hardened concrete confinement chambers. We learned about how vulnerable spent fuel pools are during Fukushima The backup generators failed and the water pumping system failed - it was lucky that ocean water flooded those and the reactor cores to provide cooling.” Alphabet Inc’s Google has said is has stopped selling online advertising in Russia, a ban that covers search, YouTube and outside publishing partners, Reuters reports. The move by the world’s top seller of online ads by revenue follows similar pauses in Russia by smaller internet companies Twitter Inc and Snap Inc. Ukraine’s foreign minister is now confirming reports of a fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, warning an explosion could have devastating consequences. In a tweet issued just after 2.30am local time, Dmytro Kuleba said: Russian army is firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Fire has already broke out. Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!” A fire has broken out in Europe’s largest nuclear power plant located in Zaporizhzhia, according to an announcement from plant employees and the mayor of the nearby town of Enerhodar. “As a result of continuous enemy shelling of buildings and units of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is on fire,” Enerhodar Mayor Dmytro Orlov said on his Telegram channel just after 1.30am local time, citing what he called a threat to world security. Orlov recorded a short video message which has now been shared my multiple local Ukrainian media outlets, urging Russian troops to immediately stop shelling the plant. The official earlier said Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops on the city’s outskirts and reported that a Russian military column was heading toward the nuclear plant. Loud shots and rocket fire were heard late Thursday. According to a Telegram message posted by an employee at the plant, Russian troops fired at the nuclear facility. Attention! Equipment of the Russian Federation is firing at the Zaporozhye NPP. There is a real threat of nuclear danger at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. We demand a ceasefire from heavy equipment at the Zaporozhye NPP! As of 2.30am local time, the employee added that firefighters have been unable to reach the scene of the fire, claiming the outbreak was a result of shots by Russian troops. Ukrainian news agencies UNIAN and Hromadske also report that a fire has started at the nuclear power plant. It remains unclear exactly where the fire is located within the plant or the damage inflicted so far. The city on the Dnieper River accounts for one-quarter of the country’s power generation. Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you as my colleague Maanvi Singh signs off. For any tips and feedback please contact me through Twitter or at samantha.lock@theguardian.com The UK’s defence secretary Ben Wallace has told the BBC that Russia’s military strategy is not going to plan. Wallace said logistics recovered from armoured vehicles show the Russian army is behind schedule - and that plans to appeal to Ukrainians as “liberators” have failed. President Putin on the other hand has insisted Russia’s invasion is “going to plan” in a televised address on Thursday. It is 1:30am in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand right now: Russian forces are in control of both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said. Russian forces appeared to be moving to cut Ukraine off from the sea via its key southern ports, claiming the capture of Kherson and tightening the siege of Mariupol. Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv. While a US defence official suggested it appeared to have “stalled”, there was also speculation that an estimated 15,000 troops attached to it may be regrouping and waiting for logistical supplies before an assault on Kyiv. Another key objective for Russian forces in the south-east was Zaporizhzhia and its nuclear power plant, Europe’s biggest. Russian troops were trying to break through a barricade to the plant erected by residents and territorial defence forces. At least 33 civilians had been killed in a Russian airstrike on a residential area in the northern city of Chernihivon Thursday, Ukrainian authorities say. The death toll across Ukraine is continuing to rise. Vladimir Putin has told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means he will continue to pursue his war in Ukraine, the Élysée Palace has said, adding: “We expect the worst is yet to come.” In a televised speech shortly after his 90-minute call with Macron, Putin claimed Russian military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. The president went on to accuse Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields” while providing no evidence. Ukraine and Russia agreed to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians in a second round of talks this afternoon, but the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the outcome of today’s talks had fallen short of Ukraine’s hopes. A third round of talks is set to take place at the start of next week, the Belarus state news agency Belta cited Podolyak as saying. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for direct talks with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, saying it was “the only way to stop this war”. Speaking at a press conference, Zelenskiy called on the west to increase military aid to Ukraine, warning that the rest of Europe would be under threat if Russia was allowed to advance. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has imposed sanctions on the Uzbekistan-born Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, whose commercial links to Everton football club have been suspended, and the Russian former deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, the Foreign Office has said. The Pentagon has established communication with the Russian ministry of defense, “for the purpose of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation”, a defense official told the AP. That such a “deconfliction” line has been established has not been officially announced yet, but multiple news organizations have confirmed the news. The line was reportedly established on 1 March. – Leonie Chao-Fong, Maanvi Singh According to GlobalCheck, a service that tracks Internet censorship in the CIS countries, the BBC is now blocked in Russia, as is Deutsche Welle: This comes after the EU blocked content from Russian state-backed RT and Sputnik. The UK, fearing an outright ban could lead to reciprocal action by Moscow against the BBC, instead asked Ofcom to monitor and investigate RT’s output. But the EU sanction de facto got RT off UK airwaves, because Sky received its RT broadcasts from Luxembourg. The Biden administration will allow Ukrainians in the US Temporary Protected Status, a designation that will them to continue living and working in the country for 18 months. Department of Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced the news today: Some 75,000 Ukrainians in the US will be eligible to apply. The move comes after immigrant advocates pushed for the US to quickly accommodate Ukranians already in the US as Russian began bombarding their home country. But the US has yet to extend similar protections for tens of thousands of Afghans in US prior to and following the chaotic evacuation last summer. Emmanuel Akinwotu, Julian Borger and Lisa O’Carroll report: More than 500 international students are trapped in Sumy, a town 40km from Ukraine’s northeast border that has been battered by days of shelling by Russian forces. Most of the students are Nigerian, while others are from Ghana, Ethiopia, Angola, Tanzania, Rwanda, Ireland, India, Lebanon and Turkey. They have all suddenly found themselves stranded in a war zone. Trains and buses have stopped running; roads and bridges out of the city have been destroyed and fighting has been reported in the city’s streets. The students have remained in five hostel buildings since the Russian invasion began last week, after advice from their university to stay behind – even as many Ukrainian students fled. Oluwaseun Adefemi, a Nigerian medical student who arrived in Sumy in January, said that food and water supplies were already running low and it was no longer safe to head to local stores. “We are hearing blasts every day. We have to run into our bunkers each time. Yesterday we heard the blasts at six or seven in the morning. When we hear them, we run to the basement – that’s our makeshift bunker,” he said, speaking by telephone late on Wednesday. “We are running out of food, we’re running out of water. What we have now is mainly soda water,” Adefemi said. While the conflict has so far mainly focused on the outskirts of the city, fears are rising that troops may soon enter the city. Read more: The fall of the first Ukrainian city to the Russian army bodes ill for the rest of the country. Russian forces, reports suggest, surrounded and starved the southern Dnieper River port of Kherson into submission. Kherson’s mayor told reporters that many citizens had been left dead and unrecognisable by high-calibre weapons used by the Russians to bombard his city. Vladimir Putin’s siege tactics, familiar to anyone who remembers Russia’s role in the 2017 battle for Aleppo in Syria, today amount to war crimes. Russian soldiers are threatening to destroy Ukrainian cities unless they surrender. The mayor of Mariupol, on the Black Sea, said that Mr Putin’s army was attacking rail lines and road bridges, as well as cutting off water and electricity, to prevent civilians from escaping the shelling. In 2014, Mr Putin described Kyiv as “the mother of Russian cities”. That his military is preparing to encircle the Ukrainian capital with enough firepower to leave it a charred ruin shows his potential descent into criminal folly. One can only hope that one day the Russian president will be sitting in a dock at The Hague where his ramblings can be exposed for what they are: no defence for the senseless killing of innocents. The criminality of Mr Putin’s invasion is staggering. He is sowing death and panic in Ukraine, with apparent little regard for civilian lives. His war is only a week old and Russian forces are already raining down cluster munitions on residential areas. Airstrikes, Ukrainian officials claim, hit schools and homes in the Chernihiv region. The French president’s assessment after talking to Mr Putin that the “worst is still to come” in Ukraine is unlikely to be a scare tactic. Some of Mr Putin’s own troops appear to have no stomach for an offensive war in Ukraine on the basis that they are, as Moscow claims, protecting Russia’s strategic interests. Instead the Ukrainian military casts opposing soldiers as hapless teenage invaders and wretched conscripts. Forcing poor young men to fight in an illegal war ought to be added to the list of charges Mr Putin might face. Read more: Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, has released a message to Ukrainians, saying that the Netherlands stands with them. Ukraine’s foreign affairs minister has accused Russia of staging humanitarian aid as troops advance of Kherson, a strategically important Black Sea port. And Lyubov Sobol, a member of the Russian Opposition Coordination Council, is echoing him. In justifying its war, Russia is investing a lot of time and effort in propaganda aimed at both Russians and Ukrainians. My Guardian colleagues reported earlier: US officials claim they have evidence of a Russian plan to make a “very graphic” fake video of a Ukrainian attack as a pretext for an invasion. The alleged plot would involve using corpses, footage of blown-up buildings, fake Ukrainian military hardware, Turkish-made drones and actors playing the part of Russian-speaking mourners. “We don’t know definitively that this is the route they are going to take, but we know that this is an option under consideration,” the deputy national security adviser, Jonathan Finer, told MSNBC, adding that the video “would involve actors playing mourners for people who are killed in an event that they would have created themselves”. Finer added: “That would involve the deployment of corpses to represent bodies purportedly killed, of people purportedly killed in an incident like this.” The Pentagon spokesman, John Kirby, said the video would have purported to show a Ukrainian attack on Russian territory or Russian-speaking people in eastern Ukraine and would be “very graphic”. He added that the US believed that the plan had the backing of the Kremlin. “Our experience is that very little of this nature is not approved at the highest levels of the Russian government,” Kirby said. Sobol tweeted that a fake pro-Putin rally is being organized by Russian troops in Kherson. The Pentagon has established communication with the Russian ministry of defense, “for the purpose of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalation”, a defense official told the AP. That such a “deconfliction” line has been established has not been officially announced yet, but multiple news organizations have confirmed the news. The line was reportedly established on 1 March. The line would allow US and Russian forces to avoid crossing paths along the Polish border and the Black Sea, for example, while Russia advances on ukraine. The US and Russia had set up a similar line of communication in the Syrian conflict after Russia began military action there. A week after invasion of Ukraine launched, ICC confirms it is gathering evidence of possible war crimes. Here’s what we know so far, from the Guardian’s Jon Henley and Samantha Lock: Earlier today, Poland warned its citizens to leave Russia and Belarus due to ongoing fighting in Ukraine, reported Reuters: The Polish foreign ministry said on Thursday Polish citizens should leave Russia and Belarus due to the situation in Ukraine. “We recommend Polish citizens staying on the territory of the Russian Federation should leave its territory using available commercial and private transport,” it said, adding travel options were limited due to flights between the two countries being suspended. It issued a similar recommendation regarding Belarus, adding: “In the event of a drastic deterioration of the security situation, a closure of borders or other unforeseen situations, evacuation may turn out to be considerably difficult or even impossible.” Ukrainian atomic energy authorities have posted video online showing tracer fire at Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, Zaporizhzhya. Here’s the video that was posted to Youtube: The Guardian’s Julian Borger wrote today about concerns from UN officials as Russian forces claimed that they had surrounded the nuclear plant: The UN nuclear watchdog has voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the Russian government had informed the agency that its troops had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine, the second biggest in Europe, housing six of the country’s 15 reactors. In their letter to the IAEA, Russian officials insisted that Ukrainian staff at the plant were continuing to “work on providing nuclear safety and monitoring radiation in normal mode of operation”. However, the Ukrainian state enterprise running the country’s nuclear industry, Energoatom, accused the Russian military of “openly terrorizing employees of the station and residents of its satellite city Energodar”.

Earlier today, US prosecutors charged a Russian television producer and described oligarch, Konstantin Malofeyev, with violating sanctions related to Crimea, reported Reuters: U.S. prosecutors on Thursday charged a television producer for Konstantin Malofeyev, described as a Russian oligarch, with violating Crimea-related sanctions, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York said on Thursday. John Hanick, a U.S. citizen, was arrested in February in London and the United States is seeking his extradition. Prosecutors said Hanick was charged with violating U.S. sanctions arising from Russia’s 2014 invasion of the Crimean peninsula. Malofeyev is closely tied to Russian aggression in Ukraine, Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement. Amnesty International has criticised the EU decision to limit its Temporary Protection Directive (TPD), which will grant immediate protection in EU countries to people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine, to Ukrainian nationals. On Thursday, EU member states watered down a proposal from the European commission that would have seen all long term residents given the protection. Eve Geddie, Director of Amnesty International’s EU office said: “Everybody fleeing conflict must be provided with protection and help to establish themselves and we welcome that Ukrainians will be swiftly protected. But by restricting that assistance principally to Ukrainians fleeing conflict, the Council has also exposed the limitations of Europe’s solidarity. “Today’s decision means that Ukrainians seeking safety in the EU will quickly get residence permits, be able to work, and be provided with suitable accommodation, welfare assistance, medical assistance, and education. It is now up to member states to decide if they will extend that to others fleeing Ukraine. We call on them to treat everyone fleeing this conflict equally. “The Council’s decision today is a reminder that Europe has long had the tools to protect people fleeing war and help new arrivals, and the usual ‘Fortress Europe’ approach is a politically motivated choice. That this is happening for the first time but principally for displaced Ukrainian nationals shows that the EU’s approach is riddled with double standards.” This just in: RT America, apart of the global RT network that is funded by the Russian government, is stopping production and laying off most of its staff, reports CNN’s Oliver Darcy: The production company behind the American version of the Russian state-funded network RT laid off most of its staff on Thursday, according to a memo obtained by CNN. Misha Solodovnikov, the general manager of the production company, T&amp;R Productions, told staff that it will be “ceasing production” at all of its locations “as a result of unforeseen business interruption events.””Unfortunately, we anticipate this layoff will be permanent, meaning that this will result in the permanent separation from employment of most T&amp;R employees at all locations,” Solodovnikov wrote in his memo to employees. The layoffs would mean an effective end to RT America. The network, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s main mouthpieces in the US, was dropped earlier this week by DirecTV. The satellite carrier was one of the two major television providers in the US to carry the network. This story is still developing. Read the article here. The UK culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, has written to TikTok, Twitter and Meta (the owner of Facebook and Instagram) asking them to block the online output of Kremlin-backed news services Russia Today and Sputnik. Writing to the platforms’ UK heads, she said: “I want to urge you to do everything you can to apply the approach you are taking across the EU to block access both to RT and to Sputnik’s online output (including the latter’s radio and audio services) on your UK services.” RT and Sputnik have already been blocked the platforms across the EU, while RT has already lost its Sky slot. The Guardian has approached TikTok, Meta and Twitter for comment. In a Twitter post, French president Emmanuel Macron said that during a conversation with Russian president Vladimir Putin this morning, Putin again refused to stop attacks against Ukraine. “I spoke to President Putin this morning. He refuses to stop his attacks on Ukraine at this point,” tweeted Macron. “It is vital to maintain dialogue to avoid human tragedy.” Macron said that he will continue communicating with Putin, adding that, “We must avoid the worst.” In a separate post, Macron continued: “Maintaining dialogue to protect the people, obtaining measures that will avoid human tragedy, putting an end to this war: this is the purpose of my commitment alongside President Zelensky and the international community,” ending his tweet by saying, “I am and will remain fully determined.” This just in: Ukraine and Russia have agreed to temporary, local ceasefires to allow the evacuation of civilians as well as aid deliveries via safe corridors. But some experts have warned that the creation of said “humanitarian corridors” and the backed ceasefires could be an opportunity for Russia to strategically resupply and regroup. More analysis on how Russia may use the ceasefire periods from Emma Beals, a senior adviser at the European Institute of Peace: Following up on newly announced sanctions against billionaire Alisher Usmanov and Russian former deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov by the UK, here’s a statement posted to Twitter from the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office on the additional penalties: The UK has imposed more sanctions on leading oligarchs. These associates of Putin are now cut off from their significant interests in UK. It is 9.18pm in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand right now: Russian forces are in control of both local and regional government buildings in the strategically important Black Sea port of Kherson, local authorities said.

More on the US’s announcement of additional sanctions targeting more Russian oligarchs... Here is an excerpt from the national security council fact sheet announcing the sanctions, with more context behind the additional penalties: Today, the United States, in coordination with Allies and partners, is targeting additional Russian elites and family members who continue supporting President Putin despite his brutal invasion of Ukraine... These individuals and their family members will be cut off from the U.S. financial system, their assets in the United States will be frozen and their property will be blocked from use. The Department of Treasury will share financial intelligence and other evidence where appropriate with the Department of Justice to support criminal prosecutions and seizure of assets. Today, the United States will sanction an expansive list of Putin’s cronies and their family members. One of the elites is Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, one of Russia’s wealthiest individuals and a close ally of Putin. His property will be blocked from use in the United States and by U.S. persons – including his superyacht, one of the world’s largest, and just seized by our ally Germany, and his private jet, one of Russia’s largest privately-owned aircraft. The United States will also sanction Dmitry Peskov, who as Putin’s spokesman is a top purveyor of Putin’s propaganda. The United States will also impose visa restrictions on 19 oligarchs and 47 of their family members and close associates. As President Biden said, [we] will continue to work with our Allies and partners to hold accountable the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who are profiting from this violent regime. The United States and governments all over the world will work to identify and freeze the assets Russian elites and their family members hold in our respective jurisdictions – their yachts, luxury apartments, money, and other ill-gotten gains. The US will be issuing additional sanctions targeting more Russian oligarchs, including the billionaire Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, the White House said today. Here is a list of who will be targeted in this newly announced round, according to a fact sheet provided by a spokesperson with the national security council: Nikolai Tokarev (his wife, Galina, daughter Mayya, and his two luxury real estate companies) Boris Rotenberg (his wife, Karina, and his sons Roman and Boris) Arkady Rotenberg (his sons Pavel and Igor and daughter Liliya) Sergei Chemezov (his wife, Yekaterina, his son Stanislav, and stepdaughter Anastasiya) Igor Shuvalov (his five companies, his wife, Olga, his son Evgeny and his company and jet, and his daughter Maria and her company) Yevgeniy Prigozhin (his three companies, his wife, Polina, his daughter Lyubov, and his son Pavel) Dmitry Peskov, President Putin’s press secretary Alisher Usmanov (his superyacht, one of the world’s largest and just seized by Germany, and his private jet, one of Russia’s largest privately owned aircraft) The US will also be placing visa restrictions on 19 oligarchs and 47 “family members and close associates”. The UK foreign secretary Liz Truss has sanctioned the Uzbekistan-born Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov and Russian former deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, the Foreign Office has said. Drone footage shows devastated town near Kyiv Drone footage shows debris and destroyed buildings as well as burnt-out Russian military vehicles in Borodyanka, a small town 60km north-west of Kyiv. Smoke can be seen pouring out of a residential building destroyed by the shelling and several houses appear to be heavily damaged in the fight as well as Russian military vehicles. The death toll from today’s shelling attack in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv has been updated to 33, the Ukrainian emergency services said. At least 33 bodies have been recovered from rubble in the wake of airstrikes by Russian forces on Chernihiv, it said in an online post. The previous estimate was 22. Rescue work has been temporarily suspended due to heavy shelling in the area, it said. Ukraine and Russia agreed to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians in a second round of talks this afternoon, negotiators on both sides said. In the aftermath of the talks that took place on the Poland-Belarus border, the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said talks with Russia had not yielded the results Kyiv hoped for. But Podolyak said both sides envisaged a possible temporary ceasefire to allow for the evacuation of civilians. That is, not everywhere, but only in those places where the humanitarian corridors themselves will be located, it will be possible to cease fire for the duration of the evacuation. Both sides also reached an understanding on the delivery of medicines and food to the places where the fiercest fighting was taking place. Without elaborating, Podolyak said the outcome of today’s talks had fallen short of Ukraine’s hopes. On the Russian side, Russia’s main negotiator and former culture minister, Vladimir Medinsky, said: The main question that we decided on today was the issue of saving people, civilians, who are in the zone of military clashes. Russia calls on civilians who find themselves in this situation, if military actions continue, to use these humanitarian corridors. Another Russian negotiator, the nationalist lawmaker Leonid Slutsky, said the agreements will be “implemented in the near future”. Today’s talks mark the first time Ukraine and Russia have agreed to any form of progress on any issue since Russia invaded Ukraine a week ago. A third round of talks is set to take place at the start of next week, the Belarus state news agency Belta cited Podolyak as saying. Here’s a bit more on Vladimir Putin’s speech this afternoon, where the Russian leader claimed military operations in Ukraine were going according to plan. Putin’s televised comments appeared designed to rebut statements by western governments and intelligence agencies that the Russian advance has faltered in the face of logistical problems, tactical mistakes and fiercer-than-expected resistance from Ukraine. I want to say that the special military operation is proceeding strictly in line with the timetable. According to plan. All the tasks that have been set are being successfully resolved. He went on to give a number of examples of Russian soldiers’ “heroic” actions and said the families of Russian soldiers who had been killed during the fighting would be compensated. Now on Ukrainian territory, our soldiers and officers are fighting for Russia, for a peaceful life for the citizens of Donbas, for the denazification and demilitarisation of Ukraine, so that we can’t be threatened by an anti-Russia right on our borders that the west has been creating for years. A missile appeared to hit a residential building in central Chernihiv, northern Ukraine, in footage captured on dashcam. The state emergency service of Ukraine said an oil depot in Chernihiv was also on fire after being hit by a shell. Interpol has rebuffed Ukraine’s request to exclude Russia from its organisation, despite backing from both Britain and Poland who requested Russia’s suspension. A spokesperson for the Interpol general secretariat told the Guardian: Only the general assembly, Interpol’s supreme governing body comprising representatives from each of its 195 member countries, can vote on issues relating to membership. The Interpol general secretariat continues to monitor the situation concerning Ukraine closely. The International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, is a supranational body providing investigational support to member states, primarily through its red notice system that flags suspects internationally. Continuing to include Russia within Interpol grants security services access to the red notice database and potential broader support, despite accusations that Russia is a major abuser of the red notice system. Rights groups point to the ability of authoritarian regimes to abuse Interpol’s red notice system in order to flag political dissidents or exiles. Critics also point to the opacity of Interpol’s internal affairs, including allowing Syria to rejoin the organisation last year after a decade-long suspension. Ukraine’s minister for internal affairs, Denis Monastyrsky, wrote to Interpol earlier this week demanding Russia’s expulsion following its invasion of Ukraine. “Russia should be expelled from Interpol for violating its basic principles and massive misuse of tools and services to cover up its crimes and persecute political enemies, particularly in Ukraine,” he wrote, according to the Ukrainian broadcasting organisation Hromadske. Britain and Poland both backed Ukraine’s efforts, although they demanded that Interpol suspend Russia rather than exclude it. The British home secretary, Priti Patel, told parliament: The Ukrainian government has today requested that the Russian government be suspended from its membership of Interpol and we will be leading all international efforts to that effect. Poland’s police chief, Gen Jaroslaw Szymczyk wrote an impassioned personal letter to Interpol’s general secretary, Jürgen Stock. I strongly believe that the world needs a clear, consistent and unambiguous message that we, police officers from all over the world, do not accept the warfare actions taken by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Dear Jürgen. We have known each other for many years. We have talked many times about our dream of a safer world, the need to protect victims and to definitely prosecute those who stand on the other side of the law and the good. This is a great responsibility. Today, dear friend, the world is telling us “I call”. It is time to turn words into actions.” In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson for the Interpol general secretariat said the organisation remained committed to ensuring that red notice requests from member states adhered to the organisations’ rules. In a Telegram group chat organised in answer to Ukraine’s government call for hackers to protect the country’s infrastructure from cyber-attacks and to conduct its own cyber missions, a hacking team called the Belarusian Cyber Partisans said it planned to target the Belarusian railway network, the news service reports. Belarus has been a critical staging point for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the country’s railway network being used to transport Russian soldiers, the Belarusian Cyber Partisans told Reuters. The “IT army” group chat also discussed targeting Russian telecom companies as well as Glonass – Russia’s satellite-based navigation system and alternative to GPS. “We need to mobilise and intensify our efforts as much as possible,” one post in the Telegram chat read. More than 237,000 people joined the Telegram channel in the days after Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, put out a call for the country’s hackers to join the cyberwar against Russia. “There will be tasks for everyone,” Fedorov tweeted. “We continue to fight on the cyber front. The first task is on the channel for cyber specialists.” A leader of Ukraine’s Muslim community, Sheikh Said Ismagilov, made an address to Russian Muslims serving as soldiers, asking: “Why did you come to kill us?” He said Ukraine does not need “saving” - as per Vladimir Putin’s rationale for his invasion - and asked Muslims around the world to support Ukraine’s fight for survival. Ukraine and Russia have agreed to hold a third round of talks soon, Reuters cites a Ukrainian negotiator as saying. The official said Ukraine did not receive the results it had counted on, but that both sides had reached an understanding on a joint provision of humanitarian corridors for evacuating civilians. Zelenskiy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted this : Ukrainian officials are warning that hackers have broken into local government websites to spread false reports that Ukraine has capitulated and signed a peace treaty with Moscow, Reuters reports. An undisclosed number of official websites of “regional authorities and local governments” have been hijacked and used to spread “lies” about a deal to end the fighting, Ukraine’s state service of special communication and information protection said. The agency said “the enemy” was responsible for the hacking spree. It was not immediately clear which websites it was referring to. Europe has already received one million refugees from Ukraine in the week since the war began and will receive millions more, the European commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson, has said. She was speaking as EU interior ministers agreed on a temporary protection directive to grant Ukrainian nationals the right to live, work, and access healthcare, housing and education immediately for up to one year, without the need to go through lengthy asylum procedures. If the conflict continued, or refugees could return safely, that status could be extended for a further two years. It would not offer any such rights to people from elsewhere who were in Ukraine as temporary workers or students. The European commission’s original proposal was watered down in relation to “third country” nationals who have long-term residence in Ukraine: national asylum laws will apply to them. It is understood that Poland and Hungary were the most vocal in opposing the initial proposal. Thousands of people in cities across Russia have been defying police threats and staging protests against the invasion of Ukraine. Authorities have a low tolerance for demonstrations and marches, and attending them can have serious consequences including fines, arrests and even imprisonment. Vladimir Putin has accused Ukrainian forces of using civilians as “human shields”. In a live address, the president described Russian soldiers as “real heroes”, and though he admitted to having “lost a few small towns”, he insisted that Russia’s special military operation was going “according to plan”. The “success” of the Russian army in Ukraine was an example of that “heroism”, Putin claimed. He said Ukrainians and Russians were “one people” but that Ukrainians were “threatened and brainwashed”. Putin went on to claim that Russian troops were providing humanitarian corridors for civilians to flee – in direct contradiction of what Ukraine has said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for direct talks with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, saying it was “the only way to stop this war”. Speaking at a press conference, the Ukrainian president addressed Putin: We are not attacking Russia and we do not plan to attack it. What do you want from us? Leave our land. Referring to the Russian leader receiving world leaders at a now-famous enormously long table, Zelenskiy said: Sit down with me. Just not 30 metres away like with [the French president, Emmanuel Macron]. He also called on the west to increase military aid to Ukraine, warning that the rest of Europe would be under threat if Russia was allowed to advance. If you do not have the power to close the skies, then give me planes! If we are no more, then God forbid, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia will be next. Believe me. Russia has drawn up plans for public executions in Ukraine as and when cities are captured by Russian troops, Bloomberg reports. Bloomberg cites a European intelligence official as saying that Moscow has drafted strategies to break morale in order to discourage Ukrainians from fighting back as cities fall under the Kremlin’s control. The official said Moscow plans to crack down on protest, detain opponents and potentially carry out public executions, the news agency writes. The death toll from today’s shelling attack in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv has now reached 22, the Ukrainian emergency services said. The bodies of at least 22 civilians had been recovered from the rubble in the wake of Russian airstrikes, they said in an online post. Rescue work was ongoing, they added, but did not specify where exactly the attack took place. Earlier we reported that the governor of Chernihiv said at least nine people were killed and four wounded after the airstrike hit two schools and private houses. Local press said there were several schools, kindergartens and a hospital in the nearby area. Russian forces are closing in on two key nuclear power plants in the south of Ukraine, the acting head of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear company Energoatom, Petro Kotin, said. Kotin said Ukraine still controls both plants including Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, but Russian troops have advanced to within 21 miles of the Zaporizhzhia plant and the South Ukraine power plant. The mayor of Enerhoda, in which the Zaporizhzhia plant is located, said Ukrainian forces were battling Russian troops for control of the south-eastern city. Russian troops were trying to break through a barricade to the plant erected by local residents and territorial defence forces, Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said. Another adviser, Vadym Denysenko, described the situation as alarming. Russian forces took the Chernobyl plant last week. Speaking in an interview with Reuters, Kotin described Russia’s capture of the defunct nuclear power plant as “nuclear terrorism”. Six people have been rescued after a cargo ship sunk off the coast of Odesa due to an explosion, a senior Ukrainian official told Reuters. Earlier we reported the Estonian-owned cargo ship, Helt, had sunk this afternoon, with two crew members in a life raft at sea and four others unaccounted for, according to the shipping agency’s managing director. Victor Vyshniov, deputy head of Ukraine’s maritime administrator, has now said six crew members have been picked up by Ukraine’s rescue service. The six have been taken to hospital in nearby Chernomorsk due to being in cold water. Vyshniov provided no further details about the cause of the incident. While FMQs in the Scottish parliament this lunchtime has been dominated by domestic issues, there was inevitable discussion of the Ukraine crisis, Libby Brooks writes. On the subject of refugees, Nicola Sturgeon told the Holyrood chamber that there was a “moral, humanitarian obligation” to help those fleeing the war, adding that she wanted to “appeal directly to the prime minister to follow the example of the European Union and allow anyone fleeing the horror of Ukraine entry to the UK if they wish and deal with the paperwork later”. Sturgeon also pledged action on oligarchs in Scotland, after the Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer challenged her about Vladimir Lisin, a close associate of Putin who has received hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of agricultural subsidies for his 1,210 hectare (3,000 acre) estate in Scotland. Sturgeon said there would be an immediate review of such schemes, adding: I have sought urgent advice on the maximum possible action the Scottish government can take against individuals or entities identifying as having close links with the Russian regime … including ending support from the public purse and freezing assets. She said her government was also writing to Scottish businesses encouraging them to review and sever links with Russia. A second round of talks between Ukraine and Russia have started, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has confirmed. Mykhaylo Podolyak said he and other officials had begun talks with Russian delegates in Belarus. The Ukrainian delegation’s agenda is to agree an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to leave frontline communities. A Canadian-Israeli ice hockey player has described his harrowing escape from Ukraine, as foreign athletes in both Ukraine and Russia face life-threatening decisions over whether to stay or go. Eliezer Sherbatov was with his team, HC Mariupol, of the Ukrainian Hockey League, in the Donetsk region last week preparing for a game against Kramatorsk when a bomb exploded outside their hotel. “At 5am, I’m sleeping and hear: ‘Boom!’ You never hear that strong of a sound,” Sherbatov told TSN. “And it starts shaking, everything is shaking. So, a couple of metres away, the war started.” Sherbatov said the team’s coach called a meeting at breakfast, where he explained: “Guys - the war has started. It’s unfortunate, but I would suggest you to stay put as a team. But if you choose to leave, it’s your decision.’” Ukraine’s parliament has approved a bill to allow the seizure of assets or property in Ukraine owned by Russia or Russian citizens. Under the law, the government can suggest assets for confiscation to the security council, which must then approve their transfer to state ownership, Reuters reported. An advance team left the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague on Thursday to start investigating possible war crimes in Ukraine, its top prosecutor told Reuters in an interview. Their departure came hours after the prosecutor Karim Khan said he would start collecting evidence as part of a formal investigation launched after Russia’s full-scale invasion, which began on 24 February. “Yesterday I formulated a team and today they are moving to the region,” Khan said. “It’s an advanced team, comprised of investigators, lawyers, but also those with particular experience in operational planning.” Khan said his office would be examining possible war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide – the offences under the court’s jurisdiction – by all parties in the conflict. Neither Russia nor Ukraine are members of the ICC, and Moscow does not recognise the court, which was established in 1997 by the Rome Statute and opened in The Hague in 2002. Though not a member of the ICC, Ukraine signed a declaration in 2014 giving the court jurisdiction over alleged grave crimes committed on its territory from 2014 onwards regardless of the nationality of the perpetrators. Vladimir Putin has told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means, in the French president’s words, “the worst is still to come” in Ukraine, saying Moscow was aiming to take “full control” by diplomatic or military means, according to the Elysée. As the number of refugees fleeing the conflict passed a million and Russian forces, backed by heavy shelling, advanced on cities and key ports in the south and east, Russia’s president said in a 90-minute call to his French counterpart he was “prepared to go all the way”, the senior French official said. Putin – who initiated the call – repeated that Moscow’s objective was the “neutralisation, demilitarisation and de-Nazification” of Ukraine, the official said, adding that Macron had responded that Putin was making a “major mistake” that would cost Russia dearly over the long term. “There was nothing in what President Putin said to reassure us,” the French official said. Macron had told the Russian president he was “lying to himself” and his country would end up “isolated, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time”. “‘You are lying to yourself,’” Macron told Putin, the official said. “‘It will cost your country dearly, your country will end up isolated, weakened and under sanctions for a very long time.’” • This post was amended on 3 March 2022. An earlier version mistakenly attributed the words “the worst is still to come” to Vladimir Putin, rather than Emmanuel Macron. Ukrainian negotiators have arrived by helicopter for talks with the Russian side in Belarus, the Russian state news agency TASS said. On Wednesday, Belarus’s foreign ministry posted a photo of a conference room, saying it had been set up to host a second round of talks. You may have seen a video on social media last week of a Ukrainian man removing a landmine with his bare hands, the cigarette dangling from his mouth reinforcing his apparent nonchalance. While his bravery was applauded, experts are worried about the message this and other similar videos send, Lizzy Davies writes. A spokesperson for the Halo Trust warns: We know from past experience that this doesn’t end well and we’re advising people to stay away. In order to try to raise awareness, the Halo Trust’s colleagues in the cities of Mariupol and Kramatorsk are putting up safety messages in bomb shelters aimed at those civilians who may be tempted to handle munitions and mines themselves. “These are deadly devices,” read the posters, which picture an array of munitions of different shapes and sizes. If you see anything like this or similar to this anywhere: DO NOT GO NEAR THEM. Do not pick them up. No matter what you see others do, these are not safe to touch. Call the local emergency authorities. At least nine people have been killed and four wounded after a Russian airstrike hit two schools and private houses in Ukraine’s Chernihiv region on Thursday, the governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said. In an online post, the Chernihiv governor said: Rescue work is ongoing. According to the state emergency services, there are for now nine people killed and four wounded. The Kyiv Independent reports that there were several schools, kindergartens and a hospital in the nearby area. A cargo ship has sunk off the Ukrainian port of Odesa after an explosion, Reuters is reporting. Two crew members of the Estonian-owned cargo ship Helt were in a life raft at sea, Igor Ilves, managing director of Tallinn-based manager Vista Shipping Agency, said. The four other crew members are missing, Ilves said. Ilves said: The vessel has finally sunk. Two of the crew are in a raft on the water and four others are missing. I don’t know where they are at the moment. Russian forces are attempting to prevent civilians in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol from evacuating, its mayor, Vadym Boichenko, has said. Local authorities say Russian troops are creating a “humanitarian catastrophe” by actively attacking rail links and bridges, as well as cutting off water and power supply, in a bid to prevent civilians from escaping shelling. Boichenko said in a video broadcast: The invaders are systematically and methodically trying to blockade the city of Mariupol. Constant attacks over the past 24 hours have meant the city has no light, water or heat and local authorities need a ceasefire to restore power, he said. Mariupol city council claimed the Russians are “hindering food supplies, blocking us like in Leningrad” in a statement. Russian soldiers are preventing authorities from evacuating the injured, women and children, the statement said. Boichenko added: We are being destroyed as a nation. This is the genocide of the Ukrainian people. These hypocrites came to ‘save’ Russian-speaking citizens of Mariupol and the region. But they arranged the extermination of Ukrainians -- Mariupol residents of Russian, Ukrainian, Greek and other origins. EU officials in Brussels have said they believe the Ukrainian figures in relation to the deaths of Russian soldiers are accurate, Daniel Boffey writes. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Thursday morning that 9,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in the fighting since the invasion started on 24 February. On Wednesday, Moscow said that 498 Russian troops had been killed in Ukraine and 1,597 others wounded as it announced its own death toll for the first time. Amnesty International has documented three attacks that killed at least nine civilians, including children, in the city of Kharkiv on 28 February. The human rights organisation described the attacks in Ukraine’s second-biggest city, which took place around the same time that talks between Ukraine and Russia took place in Belarus, as “possible war crimes”. One of these attacks, which took place at 12.30pm local time in North Kharkiv, included Russian-manufactured 300mm Smerch rockets with 9N235 cluster munitions, indicating that the attack was launched by Russia, Amnesty said. At least four civilians were killed by the attack, including a child and three people collecting drinking water. Another attack that same day also involved a 300mm Smerch rocket on the city’s central Klochkivska Street. The impact of the strike blew the leg off a woman who had gone shopping during a break in the curfew. She died soon afterwards. A Ukrainian delegation is travelling by helicopter to meet Russian counterparts for a second round of talks, Reuters cites a Ukrainian presidential adviser as saying. Talks between Ukraine and Russia will kick off in a couple of hours, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said in an online post. Earlier, Belarusian state news agency Belta quoted chief Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky as saying the second round of talks would start in Belarus at 1200 GMT. A Russian negotiator has previously said that a ceasefire was on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected. Russian forces have occupied the regional administration building in Kherson, regional governor Hennadiy Lahuta said, amid conflicting reports about the fate of the strategically important city. In a Facebook, Lahuta said staff had “not given up our duties”. The regional operational staff, which I head, continues to work and address pressing issues to help residents of the region. Russia’s defence ministry said it had captured Kherson on Wednesday but Ukraine has said its forces continue to defend the Black Sea port of about 250,000 people. Kherson’s mayor, Ihor Kolykhaiev, said in a Facebook post early on Thursday that Russian troops were in control of the city hall and that residents should obey a curfew imposed by what he called the “armed visitors”. Kolykhaiev said he had made “no promises” to the Russian forces and that he was “only interested in the normal life of our city! I just asked [them] not to shoot people”. Other restrictions imposed on the city include a curfew from 8pm until 6am with only cars transporting food, medicines and other necessities permitted to enter the city. Hello. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you again as we unpack all the latest developments on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. German authorities have reportedly seized the $600m (£450m) superyacht belonging to Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov in a Hamburg shipyard. Usmanov was on a list of billionaires to face sanctions from the European Union in response to Russia’s 24 February invasion of Ukraine. It came as the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said it had seized a yacht linked to Rosneft boss Igor Sechin in the Mediterranean port of La Ciotat. The finance ministry said the yacht was owned by an entity of which Sechin had been identified as the main shareholder. Usmanov’s 156-metre (512-foot) yacht Dilbar, valued at $600m and regarded as the largest motor yacht in the world by gross tonnage, was seized by German authorities on Wednesday, according to a Forbes report based on three sources in the yacht industry. The yacht has been in the yards of shipbuilding firm Blohm+Voss since late October. A spokesperson for shipbuilding firm Blohm+Voss declined to give a statement when contacted by the Guardian, but said that all projects by shipbuilder Lürssen would be treated “in accordance with the law”. The time is 1pm in Ukraine. Here is a round-up of the day’s main headlines so far: Ukraine’s defence lines were holding against the Russian attack, the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his latest video, adding there had been no respite in Moscow’s shelling of Ukraine since midnight. Russian shelling and attacks on civilian populations killed 34 civilians in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region in the past 24 hours between 2-3 March, the emergency services said. A second round of talks is reportedly set to take place today. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire was on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected. More than 1 million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency has said. The UK’s ministry of defence says the Russian advance on Kyiv has been delayed by “staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion” and remains more than 30km from the centre of the city. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said he believes some foreign leaders are preparing for war against Russia and that Moscow would press on with its military operation in Ukraine until “the end”. Lavrov also said Russia had no thoughts of nuclear war, The international criminal court (ICC) confirmed it is opening an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine and begun collecting evidence. The United States has accused Russia of launching a “full war on media freedom and the truth” by blocking independent news outlets and preventing Russians from hearing news of the invasion of Ukraine. The situation in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv is “difficult but under control”, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. Klitschko said there were no casualties overnight and that nighttime explosions were Ukrainian air defences striking down incoming Russian missiles. Russian troops are in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after forcing their way into the council building, the mayor said in an update late last night. There are conflicting claims over whether Moscow had made its first major gain by taking over a significant Ukrainian city. Ukraine’s southern port of Mariupol is surrounded by Russian troops, interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said. The council said it was seeking to create a humanitarian corridor for the city, as well as trying to restore infrastructure. “We are being destroyed as a nation. This is genocide of Ukrainian people,” it said. The UN nuclear watchdog has voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs. Russian and Belarusian athletes have been banned from the Winter Paralympic Games for their countries’ roles in the war in Ukraine, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has announced. Police in Moscow detained two women and five children holding a poster outside the Ukraine embassy that said “No to war”. Police allegedly threatened to strip the women of custody of the children. In St Petersburg, Yelena Osipova, an activist said to have survived the infamous wartime siege of Leningrad was detained for protesting against the war. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. I’ll be back at 2pm London time but my colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you the latest on Putin’s war in Ukraine. A missile or bomb hit a Bangladeshi-owned cargo ship at the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Olvia, killing one of its crew members, and efforts were under way to rescue the others from the vessel, the state-run ship’s owner said on Thursday. “The ship came under attack and one engineer was killed,” Pijush Dutta, executive director of Bangladesh Shipping Corp, told Reuters. “It was not clear whether it was a bomb or missile or which side launched the attack. The other 28 crewmen are unharmed,” he said without providing further details. The Bangladesh-flagged Banglar Samriddhi had been stuck at the port of Olvia after Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February and had been hit by a missile, a Bangladesh foreign ministry official said earlier on Thursday. Crowds of Ukrainians formed a barrier on Wednesday between Russian forces and a nuclear plant in the city of Enerhodar, blocking their advance. Footage shared on social media by a Ukrainian official shows people – some holding Ukrainian flags – assembled in front of and around barricades of cars, trucks, tires and sandbags. Enerhodar is home to Zaporizhzhia, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Ukraine’s southern port of Mariupol is surrounded by Russian troops, interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said on Thursday. “The occupiers want to turn it into besieged Leningrad,” he said, referring to Nazi Germany’s siege of the then-Soviet city, where about 1.5 million people died during two years of blockade. The European Union will take additional steps against Russia if the situation on the ground in Ukraine deteriorates, the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Thursday. The bloc is also preparing in case of Russian retaliation, including diversifying the bloc’s energy supplies, Reuters reported. “Our aim is to cut the Kremlin’s capacity to wage war on its neighbours,” Von der Leyen said after a meeting with the Romanian president, Klaus Iohannis. “We need to get independent from Russian gas, oil and coal. Our resolve to go forward in this case is stronger than ever,” she added. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said he believes some foreign leaders are preparing for war against Russia and that Moscow would press on with its military operation in Ukraine until “the end”. Lavrov also said Russia had no thoughts of nuclear war, according to a Reuters report. Offering no evidence to back up his remarks in an interview with state television, a week after Russia invaded Ukraine, he also accused the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, an ethnic Jew, of presiding over “a society where Nazism is flourishing”. He said he had no doubt that a solution to the crisis in Ukraine would be found, and a new round of talks were about to start between Ukrainian and Russian officials. But he said Russia’s dialogue with the west must be based on mutual respect, accused Nato of seeking to maintain supremacy and said that while Russia had a lot of good will, it could not let anyone undermine its interests. Moscow would not let Ukraine keep infrastructure that threatened Russia, he said. Moscow could also not tolerate what he said was a military threat from Ukraine, he said, adding that he was convinced that Russia was right over Ukraine. “The thought of nuclear is constantly spinning in the heads of western politicians but not in the heads of Russians,” he said. “I assure you that we will not allow any kind of provocation to unbalance us.” Russia did not feel politically isolated, and the question of how Ukraine lives should be defined by its people, he added. The situation in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv is “difficult but under control”, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Thursday. Klitschko said there were no casualties overnight and that nighttime explosions were Ukrainian air defences striking down incoming Russian missiles, Reuters reported. He said a heating system site damaged by Russian shelling on Wednesday would be fixed during the day. Every weekend for most of her youth, while other children were out playing, Natalia Toroshenko attended Ukrainian school, studying the country’s geography, language, its history and national heroes. “Ukraine, and being Ukrainian, is a deep part of me,” she said. “I wasn’t born there, but it’s my ancestral homeland.” Toroshenko grew up in Montreal, thousands of kilometres away from the country her father had left to flee famine and conflict. But, she like many other Ukrainian Canadians, has maintained strong connections to the country – and watched horrified as family and friends are trapped in war. Canada is home to 1.4 million people of Ukrainian descent – the world’s second largest Ukrainian diaspora after Russia. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians farmed the country’s west. The spires of their churches still dot rural landscapes and large cities. Prominent community leaders and politicians are of Ukrainian ancestry, including Canada’s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland. Those cultural and political ties are particularly prominent in the Canadian Prairies, where generations of Ukrainians have braided their culture and history into the vast landscape. China has denounced a report that it asked Russia to delay invading Ukraine until after the Beijing Winter Olympics as “fake news” and a “very despicable” attempt to divert attention and shift blame over the conflict. Foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin also repeated China’s accusations that Washington provoked the war by not ruling out Nato membership for Ukraine, the Associated Press reported. “We hope the culprit of the crisis would reflect on their role in the Ukraine crisis, take up their responsibilities, and take practical actions to ease the situation and solve the problem instead of blaming others,” Wang told reporters at a daily briefing. “The New York Times report is purely fake news, and such behaviors of diverting attentions and shifting blames are very despicable,” Wang said. The article cited a “western intelligence report” considered credible by officials. “The report indicates that senior Chinese officials had some level of direct knowledge about Russia’s war plans or intentions before the invasion started last week,” the Times wrote. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, met his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Beijing on 4 February, hours before the Games’ opening ceremony. Following that, the sides issued a joint statement in which they declared “friendship between the two states has no limits, there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation”. A war crimes investigation has been launched into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine after an unprecedented number of countries backed the move and Boris Johnson called the military intervention “abhorrent”. Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor for the international criminal court (ICC), said he would begin work “as rapidly as possible” to look for possible crimes against humanity or genocide committed in Ukraine. The referral for investigation by 39 countries – including the UK – will shave several months off the process because it allows Khan to bypass the need to seek the approval of the court in The Hague. It came as Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, braced for a siege and the Russian defence ministry claimed it was in “complete control” of Kherson, a southern port city near the Crimean peninsula. Khan said an “advanced team” of investigators was already travelling to Ukraine. The British lawyer told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the push for an inquiry by so many countries “allows us to jump-start investigations” and came on top of “evidence of international concern over events on the ground in Ukraine”. Germany is planning to deliver a further 2,700 anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine following a volte-face on its previously restrictive stance on exporting lethal weapons, German media reported on Thursday morning. The shoulder-fired “Strela” surface-to-air rockets, which once belonged to the old arsenal of the National People’s Army of Soviet-controlled East Germany, have been approved for export by Germany’s economic ministry but still await formal approval by the federal security council. The anti-aircraft missiles follow 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles that the German government announced over the weekend would be dispatched to Ukraine. In addition, the government of Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has green-lighted the delivery of weapons from Netherlands and Estonia that once belonged to East Germany. Meanwhile, the German foreign mMinister, Annalena Baerbock, called on Thursday for an urgent inquiry to investigate what she called human rights violations committed by Russia during its invasion of Ukraine. “We must stand up to this attack. Human rights are universal,” Baerbock said in a video message to the UN human rights ccouncil. Baerbock added that “we urgently need a commission of inquiry on Ukraine to investigate all violations of human rights that have been committed by Russia since its military aggression. We must stand strong on accountability.” A new UK visa scheme for the extended family members of British Ukranians comes into force from Friday, the Home Office has announced. The announcement came as security minister Damian Hinds denied there was a delay to the scheme, announced on Wednesday, which he said would help a “couple of hundred thousand” refugees. “There is absolutely no suggestion of any kind of delay here - people need help now,” he told Sky News. Asked how many visa applications had been submitted since last Wednesday, Hinds said: “So far a relatively small number - I can’t give you an exact number - but we expect that to grow rapidly.” The announcement was welcomed by British Ukrainians who have been trying to arrange visas for extended family fleeing the Russian invasion. Roman Lytwyniw, 25, who travelled to the Polish town of Przemyśl, near the border with Ukraine, to bring his 80-year-old grandmother back to the UK, said the family had been in limbo for two days, with embassy and Home Official officials unable to help with her visa application. Lytwyniw, a violinist from London, told the Guardian: “I’m not seeing anything yet from that [announcement]. Yesterday, they told me that I’m going to have to reapply for a visa because we didn’t meet the eligibility requirements. “I’ve just been to the British embassy here and they’ve told me that the best thing to do would be to travel to either Rzeszow or Warsaw. Because that’s where the nearest visa application centres are.” A petition calling on the UK government to waive visa requirements for Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion has now been signed by more than 100,000 people. EU leaders are expected to discuss and seek to find a common position on Ukraine’s membership application when they gather in Paris next Thursday for an informal summit, officials have said. Leaders will discuss “timing or the conditions”, with positions currently widely diverging among the 27 capitals. Georgia and Moldova are also expected to make formal applications “by the end of the week”, EU officials said. The EU must prepare for the arrival of millions of refugees as they flee war in Ukraine, the bloc’s top home affairs official said on Thursday. She added that she expected governments to agree a temporary protection scheme in the coming days. “Already, almost one million are here,” the EU home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, said, with women and children entering the European Union via Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, which all have land borders with Ukraine. Reuters reported that the bloc’s interior ministers were set to agree in principle at a meeting on Thursday to automatically grant those fleeing Ukraine a residence permit and access to employment, social welfare and housing for up to three years, they said. “Putin’s terrible war of aggression has had terrible consequences for people in Ukraine,” the German interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said as she arrived at the Brussels meeting. “Today it is about all EU members agreeing on a policy to be able to provide help in a non-bureaucratic way.” The protective measures, once formally approved by EU governments in the coming week, will be granted to Ukrainians and those who had long-term residency or refugee status in Ukraine without them having to go through lengthy asylum procedures. Mariupol city council said Russia was constantly and deliberately shelling critical civilian infrastructure in the southern Ukrainian port, leaving it without water, heating or power and preventing bringing supplies or evacuating people. “They are breaking food supplies, setting us up in a blockade, as in the old Leningrad,” the council said in a statement, reported by the Reuters news agency. “Deliberately, for seven days, they have been destroying the city’s critical life-support infrastructure. We have no light, water or heat again.” The council said it was seeking to create a humanitarian corridor for the city, as well as trying to restore infrastructure. “We are being destroyed as a nation. This is genocide of Ukrainian people,” it said. Frans Timmermans, the European commission’s first vice-president, has said the UK has followed the EU’s lead but that the government needs to heed British public opinion and go further. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: The UK is now following our lead... I think even parties who accepted funding from oligarchs should understand that they need to change course. Because, if I don’t misunderstand the mood in the UK, that’s what the British public want. On Wednesday, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, had questioned why Igor Shuvalov, formerly Vladimir Putin’s deputy prime minister, who now sits on the Russian security council, was not on the UK’s sanctions list but does appear on the EU equivalent. Russian anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny named Shuvalov as the owner of two luxury apartments in Whitehall Court. Damian Hinds, a minister in the Home Office, told the Today programme that “it is not a competition” when asked about the apparent failure of the UK government to go as far as its EU allies. A call by the Ukrainian embassy in Thailand for foreign volunteers to help fight against the Russian invasion has reportedly prompted dozens of inquiries. A Ukrainian embassy official told BenarNews that 40 people had turned up in person to ask about travelling to the country, while up to 100 people called to express interest on Wednesday. The embassy posted an appeal made by Volodymyr Zelenskiy for “friends of peace and democracy” to help Ukraine fight Russia. The statement, posted on its Facebook page, stated: “There is no greater contribution which you can make for the sake of peace.” The notice has reportedly struck a chord with Thais who participated in the pro-democracy protests that peaked in 2020. Among them is Chanaphong Phongpai, 28, who visited the Ukrainian embassy on Wednesday and spoke to Reuters about his reasons for wanting to fight for Ukraine. “They (Ukrainians) are also fighting for democracy and is now invaded by a superpower and a tyrant, so I asked myself what I can do for them,” he said. Thai government spokesperson Ratchada Thanadirek told Reuters that there is no law preventing Thai citizens from joining foreign volunteer forces, but cautioned that people should consider the grave danger they could face on the ground. The Ukrainian embassy did not immediately respond to a request by the Guardian for comment. It has also set up bank accounts for people to donate in Thai baht. The Thai prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, has declined to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, echoing the stance of many south-east Asian countries, which have issued mostly restrained statements on the matter. However, on Wednesday night Thailand was among 141 member states voted for a resolution deploring Russia’s actions and calling for the immediate withdrawal of its force. Ukrainian scientists have signed an open letter urging colleagues around the world to cut off collaboration with Russia. They are calling for an international boycott of scientific events inside Russia and say Russian researchers should be banned from accessing databases. More than 3,000 academics have signed the petition. Dmytro Chumachenko, an associate professor at the national aerospace university in the city of Kharkiv, now under Russian attack, shared the petition and asked his western colleagues to sign it. It reads: The Russian Federation has committed an insidious and completely shameful military attack on our country! In 2022, cruise missiles with cluster munitions and vacuum bombs that are banned in the civilized world are destroying residential areas, kindergartens, and hospitals in the very center of Europe! As of today, the number of dead civilians counts in hundreds (of which 16 are children), and thousands are wounded. The President of the Russian Federation threatens the world with nuclear weapons, which will obviously start the World War III. The armed forces and citizens defend Ukraine to the end! The whole world gives a worthy rebuff to the aggressor through the imposition of sanctions. At the same time, we believe that in this situation the progressive world scientific community should have its say. That is why we need your support right now. In our opinion, in the 21st century and 2022, perhaps the best answer to tanks, multiple rocket launchers, and rockets is closed access to high technologies, innovations, scientific research, and information support. Ukraine’s defence lines were holding against the Russian attack, the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his latest video on Thursday, adding there had been no respite in Moscow’s shelling of Ukraine since midnight. “We have nothing to lose but our own freedom,” Zelenskiy said, adding Ukraine was receiving daily arms supplies from its international allies. He said it had been two years since Ukraine recorded its first Covid case: “It’s been a week now that another virus attacked,” he said of Russia’s invasion. As reported by Reuters, Zelenskiy said Russia’s changing tactics and shelling of civilians in cities proved Ukraine was successful in resisting Moscow’s initial plan of claiming a quick victory through a land assault. It comes as the UN human rights office has said 227 civilians had been killed and another 525 injured in Ukraine since Russia’s military invasion began a week ago. Residents in the key Black sea port of Odesa were stepping up preparations to defend it against a potential Russian amphibious landing, amid sightings of a convoy of Russian warships, and US warnings that a landing to target Odesa could happen as early as Thursday. Residents in the city reported on Thursday a marked increase in Russian airstrikes on Wednesday as images emerged of beaches close to the city laid with mines, and other defences being prepared. Concern of surrounding a potential amphibious landing targeting Odesa mounted on Thursday escalated following images of a Russian naval convoy depicting at least eight ships visible off the coast. The convoy appears to include a number of 4,080 tonne Ropucha-class large landing ships and supporting vessels. Two weeks ahead of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, several Ropucha class ships – which can each carry ten main battle tanks – entered the Black Sea under the guise of conducting drills along with a larger Ivan Gren class landing ship which can carry 13 tanks or 40 smaller armoured vehicles. The loss Odessa, Ukraine’s biggest port city would be an economic catastrophe for Ukraine. Ekho Moskvy radio station, one of Russia’s last remaining liberal media outlets, has been dissolved by its board after coming under pressure over its coverage of the war in Ukraine, its editor said on Thursday. The station, one of the leading news and current affairs channels in Russia, had been taken off the air two days earlier, Reuters reported. “The Ekho Moskvy board of directors has decided by a majority of votes to liquidate the radio channel and the website of Ekho Moskvy,” the Ekho Moskvy editor-in-chief, Alexei Venediktov, said on the messaging app Telegram. The move came after the prosecutor general’s office demanded this week that access be restricted to Ekho Moskvy and the TV Rain online news channel over their coverage of the conflict. The prosecutor said its move was prompted by their websites’ “targeted and systematic posting ... of information calling for extremist activities, violence and deliberately false information about the actions of Russian forces as part of a special operation” in Ukraine. Russia rejects the term invasion, and says its actions are not designed to occupy territory but to destroy Ukraine’s military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists - a pretext rejected by Ukraine and the west as baseless propaganda. Ekho Moskvy said on Tuesday that the accusations against it were baseless and offensive, and it would fight them in the courts. Ukrainian diplomats formerly based in Moscow arrived in Latvia on Wednesday evening, Latvia’s foreign minister said. “Latvia welcomes Ukrainian diplomats who left Moscow and crossed Latvian-Russian border last night,” minister Edgars Rinkēvičs tweeted on Thursday. Latvia said on Saturday it would give refuge to the diplomats after receiving their plea for help, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Hungary has evacuated 32 people from its embassy in Kyiv, including some Hungarian embassy staff, two journalists, 10 South African and 10 Nigerian nationals, the Hungarian foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, said on Thursday. He said the evacuated embassy staff and foreign nationals crossed over into Hungary overnight. The Australian government has asked Facebook, Twitter, Google and other digital platforms to block content generated by Russian state media to curb “disinformation in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine”. Australia’s communications minister, Paul Fletcher, wrote on Thursday to Meta, which runs Facebook and Instagram, and a range of other digital platforms, asking them to take action “as a priority to suspend the dissemination on your platform[s] in Australia of content generated by Russian state media organisations”. The other recipients are Apple, TikTok, Twitter, Snap Inc, Reddit, Google and Microsoft. Fletcher cited “a significant volume of such content promoting violence, extremism and disinformation in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine”. Australia is not the first government to make the request, with the European Union’s own ban on Russian state media prompting a number of platforms to crack down on Kremlin-backed news outlets RT and Sputnik. Russian shelling and attacks on civilian populations killed 34 civilians in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region in the past 24 hours between 2-3 March, the emergency services said on Thursday. Separately, Reuters reported that the governor of the Ukraine-controlled eastern Donetsk region said the port city of Mariupol, one of the first targets of the Russian invasion, was without electricity or water supplies. The Lithuanian prosecutor general’s office said on Thursday it had begun investigating suspected crimes against humanity and war crimes in Ukraine following Russia’s invasion. “The investigation was launched with regards to the military aggression in Ukraine,” it said in a statement reported by the Reuters news agency. The probe will include “military attacks on civilians, doctors, destruction of homes, hospitals, educational institutions and other civilian facilities, which lead to deaths of adults and children,” it said. Here is a round-up of some of the images from the fallout of Putin’s war in Ukraine today. The Russian military is a “ruthless invading force” which poses a danger immediately to Ukraine, but also to “wider Europe and the world”. Damian Hinds, the UK’s security minister, told Sky News: How concerned am I? We are all desperately concerned. This is a ruthless invading force. When it comes to tactics and military strategy, I’m not going to second guess Vladimir Putin and what he might be thinking, what might be in his head. But we do know that this is a ruthless force, an extremely dangerous (force) obviously imminently right now for Ukraine, but actually dangerous for wider Europe and the world. The bravery, the tenacity of Ukraine, my God, we have all been taken aback and it is so important we do everything we can to support them in what they are doing and make sure - and this is where the sanctions, we’ve got the Economic Crime Bill, transparency and enforcement coming through on Monday in Parliament. It is why all these things are so important, why we absolutely need to make the regime hurt. Russian and Belarusian athletes have been banned from the Winter Paralympic Games for their countries’ roles in the war in Ukraine, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has announced. The U-turn comes less than 24 hours after the IPC said it would allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete when the Games open on Friday, but only as neutral athletes with colours, flags and other national symbols removed. The IPC received immediate criticism for its initial decision, the Associated Press reported. It soon became evident that many athletes would refuse to compete against Russians or Belarusians. IPC President Andrew Parsons, in announcing the initial measures Wednesday in a Beijing news conference, sympathised openly with the Ukrainian people but said his actions were constrained by his organisation’s rules and the fear of legal action. Parsons said almost the opposite in announcing his reversal, noting his constituents had pushed back. “In the last 12 hours, an overwhelming number of members have been in touch with us,” Parsons said in a statement. “They have told us that if we do not reconsider our decision, it is now likely to have grave consequences.” Parsons added: What is clear is that the rapidly escalating situation has now put us in a unique and impossible position so close to the start of the Games. Germany is considering supplying 2,700 anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine as it seeks to defend itself against an invasion by Russia, a government source said on Thursday. German news agency DPA reported earlier that the economy ministry had approved supplying the Soviet-made Strela missiles, part of the inventories of the former German Democratic Republic’s army. A source told Reuters that the Federal Security Council had yet to approve the move. “The missiles are ready to be transported,” the source said. That would come on top of 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles that Germany said on Saturday it would supply to Ukraine, in a shift of policy after Russia invaded its neighbour. Hello. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news on Putin’s war in Ukraine over the next few hours. It is 9.30am in Ukraine on the eighth day of Putin’s war. Here is where the crisis currently stands: A second round of talks is reportedly set to take place today. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire was on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected. More than one million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency has said. The UK’s ministry of defence says the Russian advance on Kyiv has been delayed by “staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion” and remains more than 30km from the centre of the city. The international criminal court (ICC) confirmed it is opening an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine and begun collecting evidence. The United States has accused Russia of launching a “full war on media freedom and the truth” by blocking independent news outlets and preventing Russians from hearing news of the invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s central bank has imposed a 30% commission on foreign currency purchases by individuals on currency exchanges, brokers told Reuters, citing a letter from the regulator. Russian troops are in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after forcing their way into the council building, the mayor said in an update late last night. There are conflicting claims over whether Moscow had made its first major gain by taking over a significant Ukrainian city. The UN nuclear watchdog has voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs. Explosions were reported in Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday following Russian airstrikes. Police in Moscow detained two women and five children holding a poster outside the Ukraine embassy that said “No to war”. Police allegedly threatened to strip the women of custody of the children. In St Petersburg, Yelena Osipova, an activist said to have survived the infamous wartime siege of Leningrad was detained for protesting against the war. More than 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. Hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed, it said. Ukraine claimed nearly 7,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion. Russia’s defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since the start of its campaign, its first statement on casualties. The UK’s ministry of defence says the Russian advance on Kyiv has been delayed by “staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion” and remains more than 30km from the centre of the city. The latest intelligence report reads: The main body of the large Russian column advancing on Kyiv remains over 30km from the centre of the city having been delayed by staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion. The column has made little discernible progress in over three days. Despite heavy Russian shelling, the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol remain in Ukrainian hands. Some Russian forces have entered the city of Kherson but the military situation remains unclear. The report added that the Russian defence ministry “has been forced to admit” that 498 Russian soldiers have already been killed and 1,597 wounded in Putin’s war, adding that the actual number of those killed and wounded “will almost certainly be considerably higher” and will continue to rise. Quick snap here from Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov. Suited up in khaki attire, the minister gave a tribute to the Ukrainian people. Hungary will not veto European Union sanctions against Russia and the unity of the 27-member bloc is “paramount” amid the war in Ukraine, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said. In an interview with news website mandiner.hu, Orban said: As far as sanctions are concerned, we will not veto, we will not prevent the EU from imposing sanctions on Russia. EU unity is now paramount.” Orban added that Hungary’s ties with Russia had been “balanced and fair” until the very recent past, but the war has created a new situation. He added, however, that there was no reason to cut energy ties with Moscow. If we abolished energy cooperation with the Russians, the overhead costs of all Hungarian families would triple in a single month. I therefore do not support this move, let Hungarian families not pay the price of the war.” Nearly 15,000 Russian tourists are stuck in the Dominican Republic due to travel restrictions imposed after Moscow’s invasion of its neighbour, the government in Santo Domingo said Wednesday, according to a report from Agence France-Presse. The Caribbean country said it had reached a deal with hotel chains to “guarantee” the tourists’ accommodation “until such time as a solution is found.” The 14,800 Russian tourists are mainly in the eastern province of La Altagracia, home to visitor hotspot Punta Cana. Some 1,900 Ukrainian visitors are also in the country and will remain in their hotels until a repatriation plan is in place. Ukraine’s honorary consul to the Dominican Republic, Ilona Oleksandrivna, has claimed there were some 3,000 of her countrymen and women in the country, of whom 1,200 had been kicked out of their hotels. AFP said they found no stranded foreigners in the main tourist areas. While Russian forces threaten new attacks, the basement of a Kyiv hospital has transformed into a maternity ward, where expecting and new mothers bring new life into a world violently upended by a Russian military invasion. Alina Shinkar is 32 weeks pregnant with her first child. She was admitted to one of Kyiv’s maternity hospitals two weeks ago because of pregnancy complications. “I woke up on the 24th of February, at 5 o’clock in the morning from the hit, that I heard. The explosion. And then I heard women started to cry and scream. The war started.’” Watch Alina’s story in the video below. Pro-Russian forces may launch targeted strikes on the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol unless Ukrainian forces there surrender, the Interfax news agency quoted Donetsk separatist commander Eduard Basurin as saying on Thursday. Russia and separatists say they have encircled the city of 430,000 located on the Azov Sea coast. However, an operational update published by the Ukrainian military this morning said the city remains in Ukrainian hands. The International Criminal Court earlier confirmed that it is opening an investigation into the situation in Ukraine. In a statement published to the ICC website, prosecutor, Karim AA Khan QC writes: On 28 February, I announced my decision to seek authorisation to open an investigation into the Situation in Ukraine, on the basis of my Office’s earlier conclusions arising from its preliminary examination, and encompassing any new alleged crimes falling within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (“ICC” or “the Court”). In the same statement, I indicated that active investigations by my Office would be significantly expedited if a State Party to the Rome Statute (the “Statute”) were to refer the situation to my Office, as provided in article 14 of the Statute... I have notified the ICC Presidency a few moments ago of my decision to immediately proceed with active investigations in the Situation. Our work in the collection of evidence has now commenced. In total, 39 ICC states have referred atrocities for investigation. German authorities reportedly seized the $600m superyacht belonging to Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov in a Hamburg shipyard on Wednesday. Usmanov was on a list of billionaires to face sanctions from the European Union in response to Russia’s 24 February invasion of Ukraine. A Forbes report based on three sources in the yacht industry said his 156-metre (512-foot) yacht Dilbar, valued at $600m and regarded as the largest motor yacht in the world by gross tonnage, was seized by German authorities on Wednesday. If you missed our earlier report you can read the full story below. The United States has accused Russia of launching a “full war on media freedom and the truth” by blocking independent news outlets and preventing Russians from hearing news of the invasion of Ukraine. The US State Department said in a statement as reported by Reuters: Russia’s government is also throttling Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram platforms that tens of millions of Russia’s citizens rely on to access independent information and opinions.” Russians also used social media to connect to each other and the outside world, it added. The agency called on Putin and the Russian government to immediately “cease this bloodshed” and withdraw troops from Ukraine. A compilation of video footage taken by those currently in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson show Russian troops patrolling the city streets. Kherson’s mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, confirmed Russian forces had landed in the city in a Facebook post written about 10pm on Wednesday. “There were armed visitors in the city council today. My team and I are peaceful people, we had no weapons or aggression on our side.” You can watch the footage below. The soaring cost of oil and other key commodities in the wake of the invasion threatens to unleash another bout of damaging inflation and supply shortages on the global economy. The price of benchmark Brent crude oil added another 3.4% in early trade on Thursday to climb to $116.80. The cost of other crucial commodities such as aluminum (2.62%), iron ore (7.75%), copper (1.6%) and wheat (7%) were also on an upward curve, thanks to tighter supplies but also bulk buying by the Chinese government, according to analysts. Tina Teng, markets analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, said commodity prices would keep rising. The Russia-Ukraine war has been pumping up global commodity prices, not only because of the supply disruption, but also resulting from hedging activities. Markets have priced in for a much tighter oil supply, with oil tankers and shippers in a standoff for Russia’s exports. China has also ordered the state-owned buyers to store major commodities, including oil, gas, iron ore and agriculture products. Crude oil futures are heading toward $US120 a barrel. There was also concern about stagflation, where growth falls and prices rise. Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at fund manager AMP in Sydney, said: Russia supplies around 30% of Europe’s gas and oil imports and accounts for around 11% of world oil production. In short, investors are worried about a stagflationary shock. Wrapping it all up, our economics editor looks at the threat of a global recession. The Ukrainian military claims Russian troops have been “unsuccessful in almost all directions in which they were advancing”, according to an operational update published this morning. The force added that shelling of residential neighbourhoods in major cities continued overnight while Russian troops pushed forward towards the northern outskirts of Kyiv and Mariupol. According to the Ukrainian military, some Russian troops are requiring the urgent replacement of equipment and personnel, however the Guardian has been unable to confirm these reports. The Russian Federal Security Service leaked information that alerted Ukraine to an assassination plot against president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, according to the cyber-hacking collective Anonymous. In a recently published tweet, the group said: Russian FSB leaked information alerted Ukraine to assassination plot against President @ZelenskyyUa. Now, we can expect an internal power struggle within the Kremlin to overthrow the Putin regime. In the meantime, let’s continue with the attacks,” the tweet read. Anonymous also claimed responsibility for taking down the Russian Space Agency website for a second time. Russia’s central bank has imposed a 30% commission on foreign currency purchases by individuals on currency exchanges, brokers have told Reuters, citing a letter from the regulator. There was no comment from the central bank but it follows a turbulent few days for financial markets in Russia in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. The rouble has plunged in value, forcing the central bank to double its key interest rate to 20% in order to protect the currency from speculation. The levy on forex also appears to be a move to prevent trade in the rouble and ringfence the Russian financial system. Russian troops are in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after forcing their way into the council building, the mayor said in an update late last night. According to the New York Times, the city northwest of the Crimean peninsula, has been captured by Russians. The city’s mayor, and US intelligence have contested that it has fully been overtaken. In a Facebook post written about 10pm on Wednesday, Kherson’s mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, said: There were armed visitors in the city council today. My team and I are peaceful people, we had no weapons or aggression on our side. We don’t have Ukrainian Armed Forces in the city, only civilians and people who want to LIVE here! The developments follow a day of conflicting claims over whether Moscow had made its first major gain by taking over a significant Ukrainian city. Kolykhaiev indicated he negotiated with the invading troops. I made no promises to them. I just have nothing to promise. I am only interested in the normal life of our city! I just asked not to shoot people. Other restrictions imposed on the city include aa curfew from 8pm until 6am with cars transporting food, medicines and other necessities permitted to enter the city. Public transport is set to restart soon and pedestrians are being told to “walk one by one, maximum two’. “The military will not be provoked. Stop at the first demand. They do not conflict,” Kolykhaiev said. We have shown that we are working to secure the city and are trying to eliminate the consequences of the invasion. So far this is how it is. Ukrainian flag above us. And to keep it the same, these requirements must be met.” Earlier, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said: “We’re not in a position to call it either way. It appears to us that the Ukrainians are certainly fighting over that town.” More than one million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency has said. Filippo Grandi said in a post over Twitter on Thursday: In just seven days we have witnessed the exodus of one million refugees from Ukraine to neighbouring countries. For many millions more, inside Ukraine, it’s time for guns to fall silent, so that life-saving humanitarian assistance can be provided.” It is the swiftest refugee exodus this century, the United Nations added. The UN nuclear watchdog has voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the Russian government had informed the agency that its troops had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine, the second biggest in Europe, housing six of the country’s 15 reactors. In their letter to the IAEA, Russian officials insisted that Ukrainian staff at the plant were continuing to “work on providing nuclear safety and monitoring radiation in normal mode of operation”. Read the full story below. Heartbreaking images have emerged of Ukrainians fleeing their country en route to Poland. More than one million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency has said. Many have made the journey by bus. Hello, I’m Samantha Lock and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. It is 7am in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand right now: More than one million people have fled Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country last week, the head of the United Nations refugee agency said. Russian troops moved in to the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson after forcing their way into the council building, the mayor said in an update late Wednesday. Explosions were reported in Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday following Russian airstrikes. Two blasts reportedly went off in the city centre, followed by two more near a metro station, as Russia steps up its offensive and moves forces closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it. The international criminal court (ICC) confirmed it is opening an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine and begun collecting evidence. The ICC process was sped up after 38 countries formally referred reports of atrocities to it, the largest referral the court has ever received. The strategically important Sea of Azov port city of Mariupol is reportedly surrounded by Russian troops. “We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from apartments, since the shelling does not stop,” its mayor said. Police in Moscow detained two women and five children holding a poster outside the Ukraine embassy that said “No to war”. Police allegedly threatened to strip the women of custody of the children. In St Petersburg, Yelena Osipova, an activist said to have survived the infamous wartime siege of Leningrad was detained for protesting against the war. Russian paratroopers landed in Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, following several days of bombardment that has killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Four more people died on Wednesday, local authorities said, adding the city was still under their control. More than 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. Hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed, it said. Ukraine claimed nearly 7,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion. Russia’s defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since the start of its campaign, its first statement on casualties. The UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to deplore Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces. On Wednesday, 141 of the 193 member states voted for the resolution, 35 abstained and five – Russia, Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea – voted against. A second round of talks is reportedly to get under way on Thursday. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire was on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected. Police in Poland warned that fake reports of violent crimes being committed by people fleeing Ukraine are circulating on social media after Polish nationalists attacked and abused groups of African, south Asian and Middle Eastern people who had crossed the border.

With opinion polls and bookmakers’ odds showing Truss the clear favourite to move into 10 Downing Street next week, officials are drawing up plans that would allow the new government to move quickly over bills and longer-term reforms of the energy market. Truss has said she wants to announce a package by the end of September but parliament will go into recess on 22 September for the party conference season. That would leave the chancellor, expected to be Kwasi Kwarteng, with little more than a fortnight to choose from a range of measures. The Treasury accepts that the £15bn package of support announced by Rishi Sunak in May will be inadequate given the subsequent rise in the cap on average household energy bills and likelihood of a further big increase in January. It has picked up signals from the Truss camp that she intends to do more to help households facing rocketing gas and electricity bills this winter. The new chancellor will be given a detailed briefing that will include forecasts for the cap, the likely impact on bills, the impact on different groups of households, and ways of targeting support. The mini package of measures would include cuts in national insurance contributions, the scrapping of planned increases in corporation tax, and temporary removal of green levies from energy bills – all of which have featured prominently in Truss’ campaign – plus additional measures thought necessary in view of the 80% increase in the energy price cap to more than £3,500 expected on 1 October. Truss’ tax pledges alone have been costed at £30bn. Sources said the civil service was examining proposals from the two Tory leadership candidates, with the government machine ready to respond “very quickly” once the new prime minister was chosen. Options will include making the scheme that Sunak announced in May more generous and more closely focused on low-income households. Choices also include changes to universal credit, and a scheme that was proposed by Stephen Fitzpatrick, the head of Ovo, Britain’s third largest largest energy provider, which would cut households’ energy bills for limited usage. Under this plan energy consumption above a certain level would be charged at a higher price; Fitzpatrick said the scheme would channel support towards poorer consumers because high-income households typically used more energy. The need for speed will probably mean a full budget will be pencilled in for later in the autumn, by which time the independent Office for Budget Responsibility will be ready with fresh forecasts for the economy and public finances. A date for the emergency budget has not yet been set, but 21 September has been mooted. If Truss wins the leadership contest she would be flying back from New York City on that day after attending a meeting of the UN general assembly. Kwarteng, at present the business secretary, has recently been in close contact with UK energy companies and has been looking at ways of tackling some of the structural problems with Britain’s wholesale energy markets. Two possible reforms have floated by the chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi. The energy regulator, Ofgem, announced this month it was changing the methodology of its price cap to enable suppliers to recoup wholesale energy hedging costs sooner – a move that will add several hundred pounds to bills in order to stop energy providers going bust. Zahawi said he was working with the Bank of England to “provide better liquidity in the wholesale market for energy”, which could help reduce the price cap by £400 to £500. Kwarteng is thought to support this initiative and a separate plan that would involve the renegotiation of contracts with some renewable energy suppliers to reflect the fact that their profit margins have soared during the crisis. Some industry watchers have suggested renegotiating existing “renewables obligations certificates” for nuclear power stations, windfarms and biomass projects in favour of contracts for difference, which would cut prices and offer long-term stable revenues for power producers. The industry body Energy UK said such a proposal could reduce energy bills for homes and businesses. In an interview with Sky, Zahawi said he was considering the option of an agreement with companies developing power from other sources, such as renewables, for “a voluntary contract for difference … at a lower price”, but said that would “not be ready until next winter”. Zahawi said: “There are no easy options. That’s the one thing we know.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/09/solar-panels-trial-wimbledon-berries-kent-hugh-lowe-farms","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-09T16:40:17Z","webTitle":"A greener greenhouse: solar panels trialled on Wimbledon berries farm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/09/solar-panels-trial-wimbledon-berries-kent-hugh-lowe-farms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jun/09/solar-panels-trial-wimbledon-berries-kent-hugh-lowe-farms","fields":{"headline":"A greener greenhouse: solar panels trialled on Wimbledon berries farm","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Tennis fans tucking into strawberries at Wimbledon this month may find their fruit has an unusual origin – a solar-powered greenhouse. Transparent panels have been attached to the sides of glasshouses in Kent as part of a trial to build up solar power supplies without using more land. Hugh Lowe Farms, which supplies fruit to the annual tennis tournament and major supermarkets, is hosting the study by researchers at the University of Greenwich. The trial, which has received £250,000 in government funding, began late last year and has taken on more significance since the energy crisis and the war in Ukraine threw a spotlight on domestic energy supplies. It is hoped the energy generated can be used to power automatic watering and temperature-control equipment, as well as housing for workers on farms. Ministers are keen for Britain to ramp up energy production, and have set a target of increasing solar output five-fold to 70 gigawatts by 2035. Dr Elinor Thompson, a photosynthesis researcher from the University of Greenwich who is leading the research, said the initiative was a “no-brainer”. “It looked like a great collaboration before the energy crisis. Over time it’s become incredibly pertinent to produce your own power. Farms are often in remote locations so it’s useful to have your own power source as well as helping the planet,” she said. The idea may also appease residents who object to the sight of solar panels covering the countryside, and allow farmers to use space that might have been allocated for panels to grow crops. Thompson said: “The public understandably never want to see land covered in solar panels so this is a pragmatic way to retrofit solar on to existing structures. “It’s helping farms to reduce their carbon footprint, which supermarkets are keen to see, and the government also wants the UK to reduce its carbon footprint as a whole.” The vertical photovoltaic panels are semi-transparent and affixed to the sides of the glasshouse, allowing some light through to the fruit, as well as through the roof. The trial will on Friday be extended to flexible panels attached to the side of polytunnels. The study concludes next spring and a further stage of research to prove the technology can replicated at a larger scale could follow. Thompson said the fruit was unaffected by the presence of the existing panels and that she hoped to ultimately study the impact of new coloured panels on the fruit. She said that light coming through orange-coloured panels could lead to leafier plants. Hugh Lowe Farms’ managing director, Marion Regan, said the company was attempting to cut its emissions. “Generating electricity in field while growing crops will help achieve our goals,” she said. The government’s energy security strategy, published in April, set out plans for a major acceleration in homegrown power through renewables including solar, onshore wind and nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/26/german-windfarm-coalmine-keyenberg-turbines-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-26T08:00:04Z","webTitle":"Stop dismantling German windfarm to expand coalmine, say authorities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/26/german-windfarm-coalmine-keyenberg-turbines-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/26/german-windfarm-coalmine-keyenberg-turbines-climate","fields":{"headline":"Stop dismantling German windfarm to expand coalmine, say authorities","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Governing authorities in Germany have urged one of the country’s biggest energy companies to stop dismantling a wind park to make way for an open-pit mine, after activists said the move symbolised a rollback of the government’s climate protection plans. Consisting of eight turbines, the Keyenberg wind park in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia is located about half a mile from the edge of a 48 km² surface mine, named after the local village of Garzweiler. One of the turbines was dismantled last week to make way for the mine’s expansion, with two others to be taken down in the first and last quarter of next year, said a spokesperson for WPD, which manages a portion of the wind park. A spokesperson for Energiekontor, which built and runs the rest of the windfarm, said a time limit to its operational permit meant it expected to have to dismantle the five remaining turbines by the end of 2023. Given that Olaf Scholz’s coalition government has pledged to expand energy production massively from renewable sources under its tenure, and with German citizens this winter worried about power cuts amid a decline in Russian gas deliveries, the energy company that owns the Garzweiler mine said it was aware that dismantling windfarms sent a confusing message. “We realise this comes across as paradoxical,” said Guido Steffen, a spokesperson for RWE. “But that is as matters stand.” Rebuilding the turbines to make way for the expanding mine was part of the original agreement that allowed the windfarm to be constructed in 2001, he added, and not a result of a recent change of German energy policy. Germany’s cabinet passed a decree last month to bring back idled brown coal capacity up to next summer to boost supply, as imports of Russian gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline ground to a standstill. Constructed more than 20 years ago, the turbines at the small Keyenberg wind park are less powerful than modern equivalents, with each producing about 1MW of energy per hour at a wind speed of 15 metres per second, roughly a sixth of the output of a more efficient state of the art turbine. Since windfarms in Germany are no longer eligible for subsidies after 20 years in operation, the park would probably have been “repowered” with new technology or wound down even if it were not for the nearby mine. Nonetheless, North-Rhine Westphalia’s ministry for economic and energy affairs on Monday urged RWE to abort its plans to dismantle the windfarm. “In the current situation, all potential for the use of renewable energy should be exhausted as much as possible and existing turbines should be in operation for as long as possible,” a spokesperson said. “We don’t currently see any necessity to dismantle the wind power plant by the L12 [country road] near the Garzweiler surface mine.” The ministry said it informed RWE of its opinion last week. This month, RWE and North-Rhine Westphalia’s Green-run economic ministry reached a deal for the energy company to turn off two power plants in 2030, eight years earlier than the current legal framework foresees. In exchange, RWE is allowed to extend the running time of two other plants until 2024. Climate activists have accused the Green party of betraying their cause. The dismantling of the turbine, activists said last week, was symbolic of the government reneging on its climate promises as it turned to fossil-fuels and coal in the face of a looming energy crisis. “While our politicians argue about the extension of nuclear power, Germany’s rollback in climate protection is going unnoticed,” said Alexandra Brüne of the local initiative Alle Dörfer Bleiben (All Villages Stay), an alliance of activists lobbying for the preservation of the villages on the edge of the Garzweiler mine. “Our region is being devastated, the climate is spiralling out of control – and now the wind turbines are being dismantled for more coal,” Brüne said. “We are seeing an energy transition rollback in the middle of the climate catastrophe, it’s absurd.” Shortly after being sworn in last December, Germany’s left-liberal “traffic light” coalition government announced its intention to boost renewables expansion after years of sluggish growth. The economic and energy ministry, led by the Green party, has committed Germany’s 16 federal states to provide 2% of their landmass for wind energy over the next 10 years. Nature protection laws have been trimmed with the intention of speeding up planning applications for wind parks near bird nesting sites. With the new rules still to trickle down to the country’s 16 federal states, wind energy companies say the effect of these changes has yet to materialise. About 365 turbines were built in Germany between January and September, a year-on-year increase of 5.5%. The number of wind projects that were approved over the same period has gone down, however 524 turbines were granted building permission, a year-on-year decrease of 16.2%. During his victorious campaign for the federal German vote last September, Scholz said it should be possible to build new windfarms in six months rather than six years. But as of 21 October this year, the planning application for a windfarm in Germany still takes 23 months on average. The German Wind Energy Association calculates that about 10,000MW of power from renewables are stuck in the administrative process. “These projects have to be quickly authorised by the end of the year so that expansion can be can gain new dynamism over the coming years,” said the chief executive, Wolfram Axthelm. • This article was amended on 27 October 2022 to correct the detail of the energy production of the Keyenberg wind park turbines."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/07/russia-targets-zaporizhzhia-with-kamikaze-drones-for-the-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-07T13:04:58Z","webTitle":"Russia targets Zaporizhzhia with ‘kamikaze drones’ for the first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/07/russia-targets-zaporizhzhia-with-kamikaze-drones-for-the-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/07/russia-targets-zaporizhzhia-with-kamikaze-drones-for-the-first-time","fields":{"headline":"Russia targets Zaporizhzhia with ‘kamikaze drones’ for the first time","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russia has targeted Zaporizhzhia with explosive-packed “kamikaze drones” for the first time, as the death toll from a missile strike on an apartment building in the city rose to 11. The regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones damaged two infrastructure facilities, in the city. He said other missiles also struck the city again, injuring one person. With its army losing ground to Ukraine’s counteroffensive, Moscow has started to deploy drones to attack Ukrainian targets. According to Ukrainian military officials, “kamikaze drones” are cheaper and less sophisticated than missiles but have proved effective at causing damage to targets on the ground. The Shahed-136 drones are able to remain airborne for several hours and circle over potential targets before being flown into enemy troops, armour or buildings and exploding on impact. On Monday, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanani denied supplying the drones to Russia, calling the claims “baseless”. However, the Ukrainian military said its forces had shot down more than 20 drones over the last 24 hours and that most were Iranian-made. On Wednesday, Russia allegedly deployed another six drones to bombard Bila Tserkva, a city about 55 miles (90km) from Kyiv, injuring one person, according to the regional governor. “This is a new threat for all the defence forces [of Ukraine] and we need to use all available means to try to counter it,” the Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said, comparing the drone’s small size with an artillery shell. Kyiv says Moscow started using Iranian drones in September, targeting electrical power stations, electricity transmission lines and waterworks with long-range weaponry. According to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, the Iranian drones are unlikely to significantly affect the course of the war. “They have used many drones against civilian targets in rear areas, likely hoping to generate non-linear effects through terror. Such efforts are not succeeding,” wrote analysts at the thinktank. Ukraine’s state emergency service said the death toll from missile strikes on Zaporizhzhia city on Thursday had increased to 11 after seven rockets were fired before dawn into residential buildings. At least 15 people are still missing, according to city officials. “There are neither military nor important objects near the hit site, only civilian buildings and apartment buildings,” Starukh said. Thursday’s attacks came a day after Russia said it considered the whole of Zaporizhzhia province, including Zaporizhzhia city, part of Russia. A law signed by Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, clarified that Russia was laying claim to all four regions it had annexed, illegally, in their entirety – despite the fact Russia does not wholly control any of them and is in retreat. Zaporizhzhia, close to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, has been the target of several fatal attacks in the past week. Last week, 30 people died and 88 were injured when a rocket hit the city. Some of the victims were waiting in a queue on the outskirts of the city to enter the occupied territories while others were waiting at a bus stop. In a separate development, at least five people were killed and as many injured after Ukrainian forces struck a bus while shelling a strategically important bridge in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, Russia’s Tass news agency has reported. Ukraine is continuing to make advances in the east and south of the country, with Russian troops retreating under pressure on both fronts. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced in his nightly address on Thursday that Ukrainian forces had liberated more than 500 sq km of territory in Kherson alone since the start of October. Russian-backed separatist forces however said on Friday they had captured ground in Donetsk, their first claim of new gains, saying they had captured a series of villages near the industrial town of Bakhmut, which has been under Russian shelling for weeks. “On the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic, a grouping of troops of the Donetsk and Lugansk republics, with fire support from Russian forces, liberated Otradovka, Veselaya Dolina and Zaitsevo,” the separatists said on social media. Putin appeared to admit to losses on Wednesday in a televised call with teachers, saying the Kremlin was “working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise”. In a video addressed to Russian troops on Friday, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, urged them to lay down their arms, promising them “life and safety” if they did so. “We guarantee life, security and justice to everyone who refuses to fight immediately,” Reznikov said. “And we will get a tribunal for those who gave criminal orders. You can still save Russia from tragedy, and the Russian army from humiliation.” Reznikov said Russian troops had been “deceived and betrayed” by the Kremlin, citing how Moscow’s soldiers were now paying “with blood for someone’s fantasies and false goals”. Military analysts say Russia is at its weakest point, having lost masses of equipment and fighters, and is unlikely to be able to regain any ground unless its mobilisation proves a success. Russia announced the partial mobilisation of 300,000 men in September after it lost control of half of Ukraine’s north-east Kharkiv province."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/apr/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-pounds-bakhmut-us-and-eu-welcome-chinas-call-with-zelenskiy","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-27T17:50:56Z","webTitle":"Forced deportation of children from Ukraine by Moscow is genocide, Council of Europe says – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-pounds-bakhmut-us-and-eu-welcome-chinas-call-with-zelenskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/apr/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-russia-pounds-bakhmut-us-and-eu-welcome-chinas-call-with-zelenskiy","fields":{"headline":"Forced deportation of children from Ukraine by Moscow is genocide, Council of Europe says – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As the time approaches 9pm in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, here is a round-up of today’s news. Russia said its patience should not be tested over nuclear weapons in another repeat of hardline rhetoric over their use. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that Russia will do “everything to prevent the development of events according to the worst scenario … but not at the cost of infringing on our vital interests”. Vladimir Putin has previously made comments saying he wants to avoid nuclear war, but his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told a UN hearing on Monday that the world was “possibly more dangerous” than during the cold war. The Kremlin said that relations with European countries are at their “lowest possible level” amid more expulsions of diplomats. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it welcomed anything that could hasten the end of the Ukraine conflict when asked about Wednesday’s phone call between the Chinese and Ukrainian leaders. Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg also welcomed the discussion between president Xi and president Zelenskiy and repeated the possibility of the war ending at the “negotiating table”. Stoltenberg said 98% of promised combat vehicles have now been delivered to Ukraine. This comprises 1,550 armoured vehicles and 230 tanks. This equates to nine new Ukrainian brigades. The parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe has voted that the forced detention and deportation of children from Russian occupied territories of Ukraine is “genocide”, at a session on Thursday. A resolution on “deportations and forcible transfers of Ukrainian children and other civilians to Russian Federation or to Ukrainian territories temporarily occupied: create conditions for their safe return, stop these crimes and punish the perpetrators” passed with 87 votes in favour, meaning an overwhelming majority. One representative voted against and another abstained. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed that its forces had taken four blocks in north-western, western and south-western Bakhmut, Russia state-owned news agency RIA reported. Russia’s foreign ministry has rejected a bid by the US embassy to visit the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in prison on 11 May. It said the measure was taken in response to Washington’s failure to process visas for “representatives from the journalistic pool” of the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, during his visit to the United Nations on Monday. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has invited Pope Francis to visit Ukraine during a visit to the Vatican. He asked the pontiff for help to return children from the east of Ukraine who have been forcibly taken to Russia by Kremlin forces. Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s former ambassador to Berlin – has said Germany was still failing to provide the support it should. “The Germans are helping much more than they were, and for that we Ukrainians are very grateful, but the government is only delivering as much as it feels it should,” he told Die Zeit in an interview in Kyiv. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner, has said he was joking when he said the mercenary group would suspend fire in Bakhmut to allow Ukrainian forces on the other side of the frontline to show the city to visiting US journalists. At least seven civilians were killed and 33 injured between Wednesday and Thursday, Ukraine’s presidential office has said, including one person killed and 23 wounded – including a child – when four Kalibr cruise missiles hit the southern city of Mykolaiv. Russia has reinforced its defences ahead of a much-expected counterattack by Ukrainian forces, analysts have suggested. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that the 500 miles (800km) of Russian lines protecting occupied Ukraine have been triple-fortified and included a “gush of manpower”. The timing comes as the usual winter freeze has begun to thaw and dry, making mobilisation more likely. Britain’s opposition Labour party has asked the government why there has been no new weapons announcement since February and no fresh update from ministers to parliament since January. That’s all for today. Thanks for following along. We’ll be back tomorrow. The parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe has voted that the forced detention and deportation of children from Russian occupied territories of Ukraine is “genocide”, at a session on Thursday. A resolution on “deportations and forcible transfers of Ukrainian children and other civilians to Russian Federation or to Ukrainian territories temporarily occupied: create conditions for their safe return, stop these crimes and punish the perpetrators” passed with 87 votes in favour, meaning an overwhelming majority. One representative voted against and another abstained. In its resolution, the assembly called for “immediate and urgent action to be taken to halt the practices of unlawful forcible transfer and deportation currently being carried out by the Russian Federation against the Ukrainian population, and especially its policy and practices relating to the removal of children from their families and homes and their subsequent absorption into Russian citizenship, identity and culture.” It added: “The assembly highlights the need for the recording and monitoring of individual cases, both in order to permit mechanisms for rapid redress, and to collect evidence of accountability in order to bring the perpetrators, at all levels of responsibility, to justice.” The assembly called for the practice to stop “immediately and unconditionally”. It also demanded Russia give access to NGOs and charities, as well as information about where the children now are. The international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin in March in relation to the “unlawful deportation” of minors. One was also issued for Russia’s children’s rights commissioner Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova who is believed to have 18 adopted children, including a teenager from Mariupol. The resolution claims that Russia began moving children from the occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk before its invasion on 24 February last year. In a report earlier this month, the Ukrainian government said it had collected reports of more than 19,000 children who had been deported. The Ukrainian security service has given details of eight men of military age who had tried to leave Ukraine to avoid serving in the armed forces. It said that a group was charging up to $7,000 (£5,600) to help people illegally cross the border, including with false documents. Ten have been arrested in total across Ukraine. One was a taxman in the Poltava oblast who sold fake medical certificates, and another in Kharkiv is suspected of helping people evade military service by posing as business travellers for defence firms. Other schemes to smuggle people out include disguising them as truck drivers, the SBU reports. Russia has reinforced its defences ahead of a much-expected counterattack by Ukrainian forces, analysts have suggested. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that the 500 miles (800km) of Russian lines protecting occupied Ukraine have been triple-fortified and included a “gush of manpower”. The timing comes as the usual winter freeze has begun to thaw and dry, making mobilisation more likely. The Russian defensive wall runs from Kherson, in Ukraine’s south, to the north-east of the country, spanning more than 500 miles. An autumn counterattack saw Ukrainian forces sweep across the south-east, retaking half of Kherson city. “These defensive lines consist of layered fortifications and trenches,” said Brady Africk at US thinktank American Enterprise Institute. They include anti-tank ditches, raised barriers, lines of pre-fabricated defences known as dragon’s teeth, landmines and trenches for personnel, he told AFP. The Russian objective is “to maintain control over occupied territory and to attempt to limit Ukraine’s ability to conduct a counteroffensive”, he said. Moscow’s strategy is to be able to “absorb any attack”, said Pierre Razoux at the Mediterranean Foundation of Strategic Studies, a French research body. “The attackers are likely to get stuck by the time they reach the second layer, and even if they get past it, the third is going to be very hard to breach,” he said. Russia will employ the time-honoured strategy of channelling attacking enemy troops onto ground of their choosing, said Andrew Galer at British strategy thinktank Janes. But Ukraine meanwhile gets to decide where to attack Russian lines, he said, adding that Kyiv may not have made its choice yet. Ukraine could well try to mislead Russia with a small-scale attack to pull defending forces there, and then direct the main attack elsewhere, he said. Vassily Kashin, at the HSE university in Moscow, said Ukraine could pick the region of Bakhmut where battles have raged for 10 months for its attack, but acknowledged that “the data we have are very limited”. Kashin said the balance of forces at the front is changing in favour of Russia. “Ukraine can try to change this with a last desperate blow,” he said. More from Vladimir Putin’s speech at the launch of a Russian-built nuclear power plant in Turkey on Thursday. Putin praised the leadership of the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ahead of an election where Erdoğan is running to be re-elected. Erdoğan, 69, suspended all campaigning for Turkey’s pivotal presidential and parliamentary elections on 14 May after falling ill while conducting a live TV interview on Tuesday. While a member of Nato and sending arms to Ukraine, Turkey has maintained ties to Russia during the war and has hosted discussions between both sides. The Russian president spoke virtually at the launch of a Russian-built nuclear plant in Turkey, using the opportunity to heap praise on Erdoğan, saying Moscow was ready to “extend the hand of friendship”. Putin said the construction of the Akkuyu nuclear power plant, Turkey’s first, was a “convincing example of how much you, President Erdoğan, are doing for your country, for the growth of its economy, for all Turkish citizens”. “I want to say it straight: you know how to set ambitious goals and are confidently moving towards their implementation,” he added. Putin stressed that Russia was one of the first countries to send rescue teams and medical personnel to Turkey in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in February. “We are always ready to extend the hand of friendship to our Turkish partners,” Putin added. Here’s a selection of photographs from the conflict in Ukraine on Thursday. The Ukrainian clamour for US-made F-16 jets has continued, with the country’s foreign minister and home office adviser tweeting on the subject earlier on Thursday. Dmytro Kuleba and Anton Gerashchenko said that F-16s would deter Russia rather than provoke it, and it would help ensure “protection of Europe”. Russia has destroyed a bridge in Chernihiv, according to the north-eastern oblast’s governor. Viacheslav Chaus told a telethon that Russian shelling had destroyed the crossing over the Sudost River. It connected the villages of Muravyi and Gremyach near Novgorod-Siversky. Serhii Serhienko, the head of the Novgorod-Siversky district military administration said: “For several weeks, the bridges over the rivers of the Novgorod-Siversk community have been shelled. This makes it impossible to provide services to the population in a normal format: to provide food and other things. And it limits movement to the central self-government bodies.” A former commander of Russia’s Wagner group who is seeking asylum in Norway has been convicted of carrying an air gun and being involved in a bar fight. Andrei Medvedev was given a two-week sentence which has been suspended for two years. He was acquitted of violence against the police, Reuters reports. “I want to thank the court for a fair ruling,” Medvedev told Reuters, adding he was looking to the future. “I am studying Norwegian and I hope I will get asylum.” He crossed the Russian-Norwegian border in January and has spoken out about his time fighting in Ukraine. On Tuesday, he pleaded guilty to fighting outside an Oslo bar in February and preventing a police officer from doing his or her duty. He also pleaded guilty to carrying an air gun in public on a separate occasion on 14 March. But Medvedev had pleaded not guilty to a fourth charge of committing violence against a police officer. He was acquitted on Thursday. Separately, Medvedev will continue to speak with Norwegian police about his time with Wagner. Russia denies accusations of war crimes in the conflict. “Now he can avoid jail and focus on what he came [to Norway] for: explain [about his time] in the war in Ukraine,” his lawyer, Brynjulf Risnes, told Reuters. At least seven civilians were killed and 33 injured between Wednesday and Thursday, Ukraine’s presidential office has said, including one person killed and 23 wounded – including a child – when four Kalibr cruise missiles hit the southern city of Mykolaiv (see 05.49). The governor of Mykolaiv province, Vitalii Kim, said 22 multi-storey buildings, 12 private houses and other residential buildings were damaged in the attack, Associated Press reports. Defence officials said the Kalibr missiles were fired from somewhere in the Black Sea. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s Wagner, has said he was joking when he said the mercenary group would suspend fire in Bakhmut to allow Ukrainian forces on the other side of the frontline to show the city to visiting US journalists. Prigozhin said in an audio message on Thursday: “A decision has been taken to suspend artillery fire so that American journalists can safely film Bakhmut and go home.” In a later audio message, however, he said: “Guys, this is military humour. Humour, and nothing more ... It was a joke,” Reuters reported. Wagner has been leading Russia’s assault on Bakhmut since the summer in the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, but Ukrainian forces have so far thwarted its attempts to take full control of the city. Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s former ambassador to Berlin – who was deeply critical of what he saw as Germany’s hesitancy over providing material support to Ukraine from the start of Russia’s invasion – has said Germany was still failing to provide the support it should. “The Germans are helping much more than they were, and for that we Ukrainians are very grateful, but the government is only delivering as much as it feels it should,” he told Die Zeit in an interview in Kyiv. Melnyk, who returned to Ukraine in October as deputy foreign minister, was perceived as something of a thorn in the side of the government of Olaf Scholz for his frequent interventions in debates on Ukraine, which he himself describes as “often undiplomatic”. He said he regretted he was no longer able to use his influence on Berlin. “A year ago we were powerful participants in the debate, and even steering it. But my successor does it differently,” he said. “Now we’re simply swimming with the current, letting ourselves go with the flow.... Our offensive is going to happen, and the Germans think: ‘We’ve delivered 18 Leopards (tanks), ticked that off the list, finito’. As if the war had been won with these tanks. The coalition government has … convinced the German public that regarding military help, everything is sorted. Which is not true.” Instead of “continuing to bang the drum”, his successor, Oleksiy Makeev, was “repeating mantra-like, ‘Thankyou Germany’,” Melnyk said, adding that he was “hardly” in touch with Makeev, due to their “very different points of view”. He denied his return to Ukraine – where his particular responsibility is relations with Latin America - was an attempt to rein him in. “My post there was long enough and it was a miracle that I was able to stay there when the war started,” he said. But he admitted he had not wanted to leave. “It is no secret that I left Berlin against my will. I would have liked to have continued, because I had the feeling that I could have achieved a lot more for Ukraine … despite the strong headwinds I faced. “Here in Kjiv the opposition was stronger still, because many didn’t understand why I was often acting in this very unconventional, often undiplomatic way in order to pull the government out of its lethargy.” Here’s some analysis of President Xi and President Zelenskiy’s call on Wednesday by our correspondent Helen Davidson in Taipei, and why it may have been hastened by problematic comments about sovereignty by a Chinese ambassador. A long-awaited phone call between Xi Jinping and Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been cautiously welcomed, but China analysts say the timing suggests it could be partly an act of damage control after controversial comments by China’s ambassador to France. Ambassador Lu Shaye, one of China’s “wolf warrior” diplomats with a history of fiery remarks, caused outrage across Europe this week when he denied the sovereignty of former Soviet states, saying they “did not have effective status”. The comments were roundly condemned, with several European nations summoning Chinese envoys for rebuke, and politicians suggesting it demonstrated China’s untrustworthiness as a neutral party in the Ukraine war. Beijing, which counts Russia as its closest major ally, has sought to present itself as neutral and a potential peacemaker and there have been signs that Xi was unhappy with Russia’s actions, but in practice China has largely supported Russia’s stance. “At a time when there is already significant concern about Russian ambitions and PRC [People’s Republic of China] support for them, Lu’s comments seemed to suggest that Beijing is open to continued, perhaps even expanded, Russian aggression,” said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore.

It said the measure was taken in response to Washington’s failure to process visas for “representatives from the journalistic pool” of the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, during his visit to the United Nations on Monday. Lavrov led a session of the UN security council on multilateralism, in which he said the world was at its most dangerous since the cold war. He had requested to bring journalists with him from Russia, but they were barred from entering the US. “It was particularly emphasised [to the US diplomat] that such sabotage, intended to prevent normal journalistic work, would not go unanswered,” the foreign ministry said in its statement. Gerschkovich has previously been visited by Lynne Tracy, the US ambassador to Russia. The visit would have taken place on 11 May. The Kremlin has said it is considering other retaliatory measures against the US over the rejection of visas. He was arrested last month in the city of Ekaterinburg by Russia. The 31-year-old has been charged with espionage, which he has denied, and appeared in court on Tuesday. The US has designated him as wrongfully detained by Russia. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has invited Pope Francis to visit Ukraine during a visit to the Vatican. He asked the pontiff for help to return children from the east of Ukraine who have been forcibly taken to Russia by Kremlin forces. “I invited His Holiness to visit Ukraine in person,” Shmyhal told reporters at the Foreign Press Association in Rome a few hours after the papal audience. He said he had discussed with the 86-year-old pope the peace plan proposed by Volodymyr Zelenskiy to end the war sparked by Russia’s invasion last year. This included “discussing in a little more detail the different steps the Vatican could take” to help Kyiv achieve its goals, the prime minister said, speaking through an Italian translator. “For example, I asked for the participation, the assistance from the Vatican, from His Holiness, for the return to Ukraine of children, some of whom were orphaned, who were taken away by force, mainly to Russia.” More than 16,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since the February 2022 invasion, according to Kyiv, with many allegedly placed in institutions and foster homes. Russia denies the allegations, saying instead it has saved Ukrainian children from the horrors of the war. In March, the international criminal court announced an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war crime accusation of unlawfully deporting Ukrainian children. The pope has repeatedly called for peace in Ukraine, although the Vatican’s attempts to mediate in the conflict have yet to yield any results. Shmyhal was in Rome on Wednesday for a conference on how Italian businesses could help with the reconstruction of Ukraine, when he also met with Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni. Russia is not planning to take the path of nuclear escalation in its standoff with the west over Ukraine but others should not test its patience, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. Her comments follow a flurry of warnings by senior Russian officials, including president Vladimir Putin, that western military support for Ukraine is increasing the risks of a catastrophic nuclear conflict. “We will do everything to prevent the development of events according to the worst scenario, but not at the cost of infringing on our vital interests,” Zakharova told a regular news conference according to Reuters. “I do not recommend that anybody doubt our determination and put it to the test in practice,” she added. Russia has strongly criticised the supply of western arms to Ukraine and the expansion of the Nato military alliance closer to its borders. Finland, which shares a long border with Russia, this month became the 31st member of Nato, while Ukraine itself also wishes to join, though it faces opposition from some countries. “They [the US] continue to deliberately infringe on our fundamental interests, deliberately generate risks and raise the stakes in the confrontation with Russia …,” said Zakharova. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, a close Putin ally, said earlier this week that the world was “quite probably on the verge of a new world war”. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed that its forces had taken four blocks in north-western, western and south-western Bakhmut, Russia state-owned news agency RIA reported. Reuters could not independently confirm the claim. Russian forces have been struggling for months to capture the city in eastern Ukraine. In the news conference Stoltenberg also welcomed the telephone conversation between Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Chinese president Xi Jinping on Wednesday– their first since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Beijing says it is neutral in the conflict and Xi has never condemned the Russian invasion. It has been thought he is trying to maximise potential political benefits from the conflict. The Chinese leader, who made a friendly visit to Moscow last month, has come under increased pressure from western nations to step in and mediate. He said he will send a peace delegation to Kyiv. “Maybe this war will end at the negotiating table,” Stoltenberg said. But he stressed that “it is for Ukraine to decide what are the conditions for talks and what format any talks should have”. In any case, Stoltenberg said, “any possibility for meaningful negotiations requires that Ukraine has the necessary military strength to send a very clear message to President Putin that he will not win on the battlefield”. Following earlier comments by Nato’s Jens Stoltenberg that nearly all promised combat vehicles have been delivered to Ukraine, Agence France-Presse (AFP) has details on how much has been sent. In a news conference, Stoltenberg said the total was made up of 1,550 armoured vehicles and 230 tanks. This equates to nine new Ukrainian brigades. “This will put Ukraine in a strong position to continue to retake occupied territory,” the secretary general said. Nato members have provided anti-aircraft systems and artillery while Poland and the Czech Republic have given Soviet-built MiG-29 aircraft. Training has also been given to thousands of Ukrainian soldiers. Stoltenberg emphasised this “unprecedented military support to Ukraine” but cautioned that “we should never underestimate Russia”. Moscow was mobilising more ground forces and was “willing to send in thousands of troops with very high casualty rates,” he said, adding that Nato members need to “stay the course”. Stoltenberg said that a Nato summit in July in Lithuania would set out plans for a “multi-year programme of support” for Ukraine. The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group said on Thursday it was suspending artillery fire in Bakhmut to allow Ukrainian forces on the other side of the frontline to safely show the city to visiting US journalists. Wagner has been leading Russia’s assault on Bakhmut in the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, but Ukrainian forces have so far thwarted its attempts to take full control of the city. Yevgeny Prigozhin, Wagner’s founder, said in an audio message published by his press service: “A decision has been taken to suspend artillery fire so that American journalists can safely film Bakhmut and go home.” Prigozhin in the same message warned the Ukrainian side not to try to bring in any extra forces under cover of the journalists’ visit. Reuters could not immediately independently verify whether Wagner had suspended its artillery fire or not. A day earlier, Prigozhin lambasted the defence ministry for not sending much-needed shipments of ammunition to his fighters. The EU is expected to agree to keep its markets open to tariff-free Ukrainian grain for another year on Friday, despite objections from central and eastern European countries hit by declining agricultural prices. A proposal to extend tariff-free access for Ukrainian grain into mid-2024 is expected to be approved by a majority of EU member states, overriding opposition from Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, according to a diplomatic source. MEPs on the European parliament’s international trade committee on Thursday voted to keep in place the suspension of import duties on Ukraine’s agricultural products for another year, paving the way for an agreement with EU member states. The EU dropped tariff barriers on Ukrainian farm produce following the Russian invasion and is now seeking to extend the policy, which expires on 5 June. But logistical bottlenecks have meant much of the grain has stayed in the EU, depressing prices and farm incomes in neighbouring countries. The European Commission last week proposed €100m in compensation payments for farmers in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, after three of those countries banned the import of grain and other food products. These countries will also be allowed to ban the sale of Ukrainian grain inside their borders, although foodstuffs can continue to travel onwards to other EU states and countries around the world. EU officials argue that Ukraine’s continuing grain exports are helping keep the country afloat at a time when the government in Kyiv risks running out of money. One senior EU official contrasted the €26bn Ukrainian businesses earned over the past 12 months from exports including grain, with the €18bn the EU intends to lend Kyiv this year to keep Ukraine’s public sector functioning. “If we didn’t have this €26[bn], [EU aid] would be even higher.” As the time approaches 2pm in Kyiv, here is a roundup of developments in the ongoing conflict. Relations with European countries are at their “lowest possible level”, the Kremlin has said, adding that each wave of expulsions of Russian diplomats was reducing the space for diplomacy. Germany is one of the latest country to send diplomats home, expelling 20 on Saturday. Russia responded by expelling 40. Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated that the Kremlin welcomed the call between China and Ukraine on Wednesday, adding: “We are ready to welcome anything that could hasten the end of the conflict in Ukraine and Russia achieving all the goals it has set itself.” Nato allies have delivered almost all their promised combat vehicles to Ukraine, the transatlantic defence alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. “More than 98% of the combat vehicles promised to Ukraine have been delivered,” Stoltenberg said at a news briefing, adding that Kyiv “now has the military capabilities it needs to recapture territory”. EU diplomats are still seeking to convince central and eastern European countries to extend Ukraine’s tariff-free access to the EU market for another year. The EU dropped tariff barriers on Ukrainian grain after the Russian invasion last year and is now seeking to extend the policy, which expires on 5 June. But logistical bottlenecks have meant much of the grain has stayed in the EU, depressing prices and farm incomes in neighbouring countries. A Russian missile strike hit apartment buildings in the Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv overnight and has killed one person and injured 23 more. The remains of an “unidentified aerial military object” have been found in northern Poland near the city of Bydgoszcz, Poland’s defence ministry and justice minister have said. The broadcaster RFM FM said the object, found near the city of Bydgoszcz, was an air-to-surface missile measuring several metres, with its head missing. Russian forces pounded the city of Bakhmut, the months-old focal point of their attempts to capture the eastern Ukrainian industrial region of Donbas, and the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force said Ukrainian troops were pouring in ahead of an “inevitable” counter-offensive. Britain’s opposition Labour party has asked the government why there has been no new weapons announcement since February and no fresh update from ministers to parliament since January. In an urgent question to the defence minister Andrew Murrison, the shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said: “I am concerned momentum behind our military help is faltering, and our UK commitment to Ukraine is flagging. “No statement on Ukraine from the defence secretary since January. No new weapons announced for Ukraine since February. No 2023 Action Plan for Ukraine, despite being promised last August. No priorities set for the London Ukraine recovery conference in June,” he told MPs. “The prime minister said in February the UK ‘will be the first country to provide Ukraine with longer-range weapons’. What? And when? The defence secretary said on Friday that ‘delivery is accelerating’ of military aid. How? And what?” The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was not present to give a response, but Murrison, one of his deputies, said the UK was “one of the leading providers of military support for Ukraine”. A total of 14,000 Ukrainian troops had been trained by the UK so far, and the total was expected to reach 20,000 this year, he added. Vladimir Putin will speak to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, later on Thursday, the Kremlin has said, before the two countries mark the inauguration of Turkey’s first nuclear power reactor, built by Russia. The Akkuyu nuclear power plant in Turkey’s southern Mersin province has been built by Russia’s state nuclear energy company Rosatom. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a regular news briefing that after their telephone conversation the two presidents would take part – virtually – in a ceremony marking the loading of nuclear fuel into the first power unit at Akkuyu. The $20bn, 4,800-megawatt project to build four reactors will allow Turkey to join the small club of nations with civil nuclear energy. Asked about alleged health problems that Erdoğan is having, Peskov said Moscow knew nothing of the issue. Turkey faces landmark presidential and parliamentary elections on 14 May. But Erdoğan cancelled his campaign rallies scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday for health reasons. While a member of Nato and sending arms to Ukraine, Turkey has maintained ties to Russia during the war and has hosted discussions between both sides. Relations with European countries are at their “lowest possible level”, the Kremlin has said, adding that each wave of expulsions of Russian diplomats was reducing the space for diplomacy. Countries including Moldova, Sweden and Norway have all expelled Russian diplomats in recent days. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said all such measures would be responded to in kind. The Kremlin said it welcomed anything that could bring the end of the Ukraine conflict closer when asked about Wednesday’s phone call between the Chinese and Ukrainian leaders, Reuters reports. The call between Xi Jinping and Volodymyr Zelenskiy had long been sought by Kyiv. Moscow added that still needed to achieve the aims of what it continues to call its “special military operation” in Ukraine. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was familiar with the details of what the two leaders had discussed and said their stances on the conflict were well known, according to Reuters. “We are ready to welcome anything that could hasten the end of the conflict in Ukraine and Russia achieving all the goals it has set itself,” Peskov said. “As for the fact that they communicated – that is a sovereign matter for each of these countries and a question of their bilateral dialogue.” Nato allies have delivered almost all their promised combat vehicles to Ukraine, the transatlantic defence alliance’s general secretary, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. “More than 98% of the combat vehicles promised to Ukraine have been delivered,” Stoltenberg said at a news briefing, adding that Kyiv “now has the military capabilities it needs to recapture territory”. He also welcomed Wednesday’s phone call between the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, their first since Russia invaded Ukraine, but said it “doesn’t change the fact that China has still not condemned” the Russian invasion. Jack Teixeira, the US Air National Guardsman accused of leaking military secrets and keeping an arsenal of weapons in his bedroom, appears in court for a detention hearing today (see 06.29). Reuters reports that federal prosecutors are expected to argue that Texeira, who was arrested on 13 April in Massachusetts and charged with violating the Espionage Act, should remain in custody as a national security risk. The 21-year-old is alleged to have leaked classified documents, including some relating to troop movements in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, to gamers on the messaging app Discord. He kept a gun locker two feet from his bed containing handguns, bolt-action rifles and a military-style rifle. FBI agents also found a gas mask, ammunition and what appeared to be a silencer in his desk drawer. “The defendant undoubtedly poses a danger to the US at large based on his ability to cause exceptionally grave danger to the US national security,” a motion filed by the office of US attorney Rachael Rollins said. “There is also evidence to suggest that the defendant may also pose a physical danger to the community.” The remains of an “unidentified military object” found in a forest in northern Poland (see 08.03) could be part of a missile stuck in the ground, Polish broadcster RMF FM has said. Reuters cites RFM as saying the object, found near the city of Bydgoszcz, was an air-to-surface missile measuring several metres, with its head missing. No sources were named. Poland has been on alert for possible spillover of weaponry from the war in Ukraine after two people were killed last November by what Warsaw said was a misfired Ukrainian air defence missile. The analyst Ulrich Speck has an interesting thread on what may lie behind Wednesday’s phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy (see 05.30), their first since Russia invaded Ukraine. For Xi, who said China would send special representatives to Ukraine and hold talks with all parties seeking peace, “the war in Ukraine is first and foremost an opportunity to advance his geopolitical agenda”, Speck argues. The Chinese leader aims to weaken Russia (though not too much), split Europe from the US by playing nice to the EU, and similarly weaken the US by isolating it from Europe, he says. “Making peace in Ukraine or defending its sovereignty is nowhere on the list,” Speck concludes. “It’s debatable whether Chinese interests as defined by Xi are helped more by an ongoing and even escalating war in Ukraine or by a ceasefire.” The Twitter thread begins here: EU diplomats are still seeking to convince central and eastern European countries to extend Ukraine’s tariff-free access to the EU market for another year, reports Politico. The EU dropped tariff barriers on Ukrainian grain following the Russian invasion last year and is now seeking to extend the policy, which expires on 5 June. But logistical bottlenecks have meant much of the grain has stayed in the EU, depressing prices and farm incomes in neighbouring countries. The European Commission last week proposed €100m in compensation payments for farmers in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, after three of those countries banned the impact of grain and other food products. These countries will also be allowed to ban the sale of Ukrainian grain inside their borders, although food can continue to travel onwards to other EU states and countries around the world. Officials hoped this emergency help for central and eastern Europe would ease the decision on extending Ukraine’s duty-free access for one year, but a deal is yet to be reached. Officials are still hopeful of finding a deal, with diplomats due to vote on the plans on Friday. A jailed former presidential hopeful in Belarus, which has been hit with western sanctions for allowing Russian troops to launch their invasion of Ukraine from its territory, has been transferred to hospital from prison, AFP reports. Viktor Babariko, 59, a high-profile candidate who wanted to challenge President Alexander Lukashenko in 2020 elections, is undergoing surgery in a hospital in Novopolotsk, authorities confirmed. Babariko was jailed in 2021 on charges of bribery and tax evasion and sentenced to 14 years in prison. Belarus has jailed or forced into exile all the leading political figures who contested Lukashenko’s re-election. A reminder that Alessio Mamo, one of several freelance photographers who have worked extensively with the Guardian in Ukraine since the start of the war, last night won the photojournalism category in Amnesty International’s media awards. Alessio won for this remarkable piece, with Guardian reporters Lorenzo Tondo, Emma Graham-Harrison and Isobel Koshiw, documenting the scale of the violence that has been integral to Russia’s campaign. A Russian missile strike hit apartment buildings in the Ukrainian town of Mykolaiv overnight, authorities have said (see 05.49), injuring 23 people. Here are some agency pictures of the aftermath of the strike that have just come through. The remains of an “unidentified aerial military object” have been found in northern Poland near the city of Bydgoszcz, Poland’s defence ministry and justice minister have said. Reuters reported that it was not immediately clear what the object was, where it came from, or how long it had been there. The justice minister said it was found in a forest. “The situation does not threaten the safety of residents. The location of the discovery is being investigated” by Polish officers and military police, the interior ministry said. The Globsec thinktank has published a report – you can read it here – on the “complex, costly and almost impossibly challenging” task Ukraine will eventually face in demining its territory and clearing it of deadly ordnance and explosives. About 30% of Ukraine’s territory (174,000 sq km) will require survey and clearance of vast amounts of ordnance, it says, making the country “the largest mined territory in the world, surpassing such former frontrunners as Afghanistan and Syria”. Much of the area affected is of course difficult or impossible to assess since fighting is still ongoing: around 18% of Ukraine’s territory remains under occupation. Russian troops are also “infamously creative in leaving mine-traps”, the report says, planting “victim-activated devices on animals and dead bodies, as well as double and even triple booby-traps on roads, fields and forests”. And it says the pace of demining work is cripplingly slow, with operations in areas controlled by Ukraine in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions between 2015 and 2021 succeeding in clearing only about 6% of potentially contaminated territory . That represents about 64 sq km a year, with most of the work done by the special services of Ukraine’s defence and interior ministries supported by international NGOs such as the HALO Trust. Reuters has taken a hard look at satellite imagery of Russia’s “vast network of fortifications, sweeping down from western Russia through eastern Ukraine and on to Crimea” and built in readiness for Ukraine’s expected counteroffensive. The news agency says it has examined thousands of defensive positions, both inside Russia and along Ukrainian front lines, and concluded Russia is most heavily defended in the southern Zaporizhzhia region and the gateway to the Crimean Peninsula. Military experts have told Reuters the extensive, layered defences, most built since Ukraine’s advance last November, could make things harder for Kyiv this time and that progress would hinge on Ukrainian forces’ ability to carry out complex, combined operations effectively. Neil Melvin of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) said: It’s not the numbers for the Ukrainians. It’s can they do this kind of warfare, combined arms operations? The Russians have shown they can’t do it and they’ve gone back to their old Soviet method of attrition. Analysts have said a Ukrainian counteroffensive could change the dynamics of the war, which has become a bloody battle of attrition, and believe the sheer length of the front could leave Russia’s defences severely exposed. But they warn that Ukraine is unlikely to receive any more armoured weaponry from the west for some time, meaning Kyiv is under pressure to retake as much land as possible in case military support begins to wane. Melvin added: We’ve cleaned out most of the stocks in the West. It’s going to take some years to rebuild. I think this is Ukraine’s big opportunity to press on. Hello, this is Jon Henley taking over from Helen Sullivan. I’ll be bringing you the latest news from – and related to – Ukraine as it happens, for the rest of the European morning. That’s it from me for now. My colleague Jon Henley will take you through the rest of the day’s news from Ukraine. Zelenskiy has posted a video showing the damage caused by a Russian strike on Mykolaiv overnight – the number of wounded has now risen to 23, including a child, he says. Zelenskiy wrote: The country-invader never ceases to prove that the main goal of this war is terror and the destruction of Ukrainians and everything Ukrainian. At night, Russia shelled Mykolaiv with four Kalibr missiles launched from the Black Sea. High-precision weapons were aimed at private houses, a historic building and a high-rise building. At the moment, it is known about 1 killed and 23 wounded, including a child. Eternal memory to the deceased and speedy recovery to the wounded. Federal prosecutors are urging a judge to keep behind bars a Massachusetts Air National guardsman accused of leaking highly classified military documents, arguing he may still have access to secret national defence information that he could expose, the Associated Press reports. In court papers filed late Wednesday, Justice Department lawyers said releasing 21-year-old Jack Teixeira from jail while he awaits trial would be a grave threat to US national security. Investigators are still trying to determine whether he kept any physical or digital copies of classified information, including files that haven’t already surfaced publicly, they wrote. “There simply is no condition or combination of conditions that can ensure the Defendant will not further disclose additional information still in his knowledge or possession,” prosecutors wrote. “The damage the Defendant has already caused to the US national security is immense. The damage the Defendant is still capable of causing is extraordinary.” The documents Teixeira is accused of leaking provided a wide variety of highly classified information on allies and adversaries, with details including Ukraine’s air defences: Brussels also welcomed the conversation Xi and Zelenskiy, thought to be their first call since Russia invaded Ukraine. “It is an important, long overdue first step by China in exercising its responsibilities as a member of the UN security council,” said European Commission spokesperson Eric Mamer. “China’s leadership needs to use its influence to bring Russia to end its war of aggression, restore Ukraine’s territorial integrity and respect its sovereignty, as a basis for a just peace.” The White House has welcomed Wednesday’s phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy but said it was too soon to tell whether it would lead to a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. John Kirby, White House national security spokesperson, told reporters that the call was a “good thing,” but regarding whether it would lead to a meaningful move toward peace, “I don’t think we know that yet.” The governor of the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv said Russian missiles had also hit an apartment building and a private house in the city of the same name. One person was killed and 15 were injured, Vitaliy Kim wrote on the Telegram messaging app. The Guardian was not able to verify battlefield reports. Russian forces pounded the city of Bakhmut, the months-old focal point of their attempts to capture the eastern Ukrainian industrial region of Donbas, and the head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force said Ukrainian troops were pouring in ahead of an “inevitable” counter-offensive. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces, in a report on Facebook, said fighting gripped Bakhmut and nearby areas. It said Russian forces had failed to advance on two villages to the north-west. At least a dozen localities came under Russian fire. Separately, Serhiy Cherevatiy, spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern group of forces, told national television on Wednesday that in the past 24 hours, Russian forces had attacked 324 times using artillery and multiple rocket launchers. “The Russians are destroying buildings in Bakhmut to prevent our soldiers from using them as fortifications,” Cherevatiy said. Cherevatiy on Tuesday said there had been a record number of attacks on a section of the front farther north – near the city of Kupiansk, in northeastern Ukraine. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest news as it happens. Our top story this morning: Russian forces are pounding the city of Bakhmut in Ukraine’s east. Serhiy Cherevatiy, spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern group of forces, told national television on Wednesday that in the past 24 hours, Russian forces had attacked Ukraine’s east and northeast 324 times using artillery and multiple rocket launchers. “The Russians are destroying buildings in Bakhmut to prevent our soldiers from using them as fortifications,” Cherevatiy said. Cherevatiy on Tuesday said there had been a record number of attacks on a section of the front farther north, near the city of Kupiansk, in northeastern Ukraine. And both the US and European Union have welcomed news of a call between Xi Jinping and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, with the EU calling the call, the first between the two leaders since the war began, “an important, long overdue first step by China in exercising its responsibilities as a member of the UN security council”. Here are the other key recent developments: China’s president, Xi Jinping, spoke to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Wednesday for the first time since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv had publicly sought such talks for months. Zelenskiy described the hour’s phone call as “long and meaningful”. Xi told Zelenskiy that China would send special representatives to Ukraine and hold talks with all parties seeking peace, Chinese state media reported. The White House welcomed the phone call, but said it was too soon to tell whether it would lead to a peace deal. Russia’s envoy to the UN in Geneva said no real progress had been achieved in resolving issues raised by Moscow over the Black Sea grain deal, which is due to expire next month. British fighter jets helped in a joint Nato response to intercept three Russian planes, including two SU-27 fighter jets, over the Baltic Sea on Wednesday. The head of Russia’s private Wagner militia said Ukraine was preparing for an “inevitable” counter-offensive and was sending well-prepared units to the devastated eastern city of Bakhmut, for many months the focal point of fighting. The Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny says he is being investigated on terrorism charges that could see him sentenced to 30 years in prison, Reuters has reported. The Kremlin critic is serving sentences totalling 11 and a half years on charges including fraud and contempt of court, which human rights groups say were made up to silence him. Italy has said it wants to play a major role in the reconstruction of Ukraine and urged EU bodies to back the rebuilding. Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, met the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, on Wednesday. A Ukrainian reporter working as a fixer for Italy’s daily newspaper Repubblica was shot dead by snipers in Kherson, while his Italian colleague was wounded, the newspaper said. “Our correspondent Corrado Zunino and his fixer Bogdan Bitik were victims of an ambush by Russian snipers today on the outskirts of Kherson, in southern Ukraine.” Russia is resettling poor citizens from its remote regions in the occupied east of Ukraine, according to Ukraine’s deputy defence minister. Hanna Mailar said the inward migration to Ukraine was mainly being seen in Luhansk. In a press conference, the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said there was “no use now in saying who is right” in the conflict. In a joint conference with the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, Lula said that “no one can doubt that Brazilians condemn Russia’s [invasion]. The mistake happened and the war started.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jan/14/france-edf-cap-household-energy-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-14T13:42:13Z","webTitle":"France to force EDF to take €8.4bn hit with energy bill cap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/14/france-edf-cap-household-energy-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jan/14/france-edf-cap-household-energy-bills","fields":{"headline":"France to force EDF to take €8.4bn hit with energy bill cap","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The French government will force EDF, the state energy giant, to take an €8.4bn (£7bn) financial hit to protect households from rocketing energy costs by limiting bill hikes to 4% this year. The company lost a fifth of its market value on Friday after the French government set out plans to cap rising energy bills, which include forcing EDF to sell electricity generated by its fleet of nuclear reactors to rival home suppliers at well below the current record high market prices. The move underlines pressure on governments across Europe to help households squeezed by the cost-of-living crisis. The UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been accused of being “missing in action” over soaring energy bills. He has been in talks with MPs and companies to agree a package of measures to soften the blow of the national energy crisis, but no decisions have been made. In Spain, the government introduced a windfall tax on electricity generators and gas producers that are able to profit from the record market highs to help keep home energy bills low. In Germany, the government has slashed a surcharge on bills used to support renewable energy schemes, which will instead receive extra state subsidies drawn from higher carbon taxes. EDF also told investors that its nuclear power generation for the year ahead would be about 10% lower than initially expected due technical problems at a handful of its nuclear reactors. The French government, which faced fierce public protest against fuel price hikes in 2018, has already cut some electricity taxes to help slow the rise in home energy bills at an estimated €8bn cost to the state. Governments across Europe are under pressure to intervene in the energy market to protect households against an unprecedented surge in wholesale market prices, driven by a global gas supply crunch that has lifted markets to all-time highs. Under the French government’s new measures, it has kept a tight lid on the regulated price that EDF is allowed to charge for its nuclear electricity, which will rise to €46.2 per megawatt-hour, from €42/MWh, despite a record surge in electricity market prices across Europe in recent months. EDF said the plan could hit its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by between €7.7bn and €8.4bn based on market prices in December and January. Barbara Pompili, France’s environment minister, said the government planned to help EDF withstand the blow but has offered no details on this. The nuclear power giant also told investors that its reactors would generate less electricity than expected this year. This is because of a string of faults at five of its nuclear plants which will require downtime to undertake maintenance work. EDF estimates that it will generate 300-330 terawatt-hours this year, down from 330-360 TWh previously. The company’s share price tumbled from €10.35 at Thursday’s close to €7.92 on Friday morning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/06/ukraine-residential-areas-in-zaporizhzhia-hit-as-russia-targets-cities","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-06T11:00:43Z","webTitle":"Residential areas in Zaporizhzhia hit as Russia targets cities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/06/ukraine-residential-areas-in-zaporizhzhia-hit-as-russia-targets-cities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/06/ukraine-residential-areas-in-zaporizhzhia-hit-as-russia-targets-cities","fields":{"headline":"Residential areas in Zaporizhzhia hit as Russia targets cities","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Seven rockets were fired into residential buildings in Zaporizhzhia before dawn on Thursday, killing at least three people, as Russia increased its attacks on Ukrainian-held cities amid losses by its troops on the battlefield. The strike flattened an apartment building, and videos published by the Zaporizhzhia regional administration showed rescue workers at the scene, with some people still believed to be under the rubble. The city’s mayor, Anatoliy Kuratyev, said 21 people had been saved, including a three-year-old boy. Further explosions in the city were reported mid-morning local time. Kuratyev said Russia had hit an “infrastructure object”, without specifying the nature of the target. Thursday’s attacks came a day after Russia said it considered the whole of Zaprorizhzhia region, including Zaporizhzhia city, part of Russia though it does not occupy it. A law signed by Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, on Wednesday clarified that Russia was laying claim to all four regions it had illegally annexed in their entirety – despite the fact Russia does not wholly control any of them and is in retreat. Upon announcing its intent to annex the areas, Russia’s leadership threatened to use nuclear weapons to respond to attacks on what it now considers its territory. Ukraine described it as “nuclear blackmail” and said it would not be deterred from continuing with its offensives. Zaporizhzhia, close to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, has suffered several fatal attacks in the past week. On Friday, 30 people died and 88 were injured when a rocket hit the city. The victims were waiting in a queue on the outskirts of the city to enter the occupied territories and others were waiting at a bus stop. Five other Ukrainian cities were hit on Thursday, in addition to civilian areas in the Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk regions close to the fighting. Russia launched two rockets at the central Ukrainian city of Khmelnytskyi, but both reportedly missed their targets. Elsewhere, Russia used what the Ukrainian authorities say were Iranian-supplied “kamikaze” drones to target the cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Odesa. Ukraine’s military said they managed to shoot down 18 additional drones before they reached Odesa and Mykolaiv. The Iranian drones are able to remain airborne for several hours and circle over potential targets, before being flown into enemy troops, armour or buildings and exploding on impact. Despite Ukraine’s authorities insisting civilians evacuate frontline areas, people are still living along the contact line; a mixture of elderly people as well as those who say they cannot afford to restart elsewhere. The deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said 14 of the 20 civilians killed in the last 24 hours were living in Ukrainian-controlled areas of Donetsk region. Ukraine has continued to advance in the east and south, and Russian troops have been retreating under pressure on both fronts. In his nightly address on Wednesday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukraine had retaken a further three villages as it pushed forward in the southern region of Kherson. Putin appeared to admit to severe losses on Wednesday in a televised call with teachers, saying the Kremlin was “working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise”. Military analysts say Russia is at its weakest point, having lost masses of equipment and men, and is unlikely to be able to regain any ground unless its mobilisation proves a success. Russia announced the partial mobilisation of 300,000 men in September after the collapse of their control of half of Ukraine’s north-east Kharkiv region. Russia’s retreats have prompted unusual criticism of its strategy from some of its top propagandists. Though they blame the Russian military leadership, instead of Putin, it is nevertheless reflective of how these losses have hurt Russia’s strongman narrative. “What have you been doing in this time?” asked Vladimir Solovyov on his talk show on Thursday. “Please explain to me what the general staff’s genius idea is now.” Part of the justification put forward by Solovyov was that Russia was fighting Nato-controlled mercenaries in Ukraine. “The Ukrainian army ceased to exist a long time ago,” he said. The British Ministry of Defence on Thursday said Russia was facing a dilemma in Kherson, the only region where forces have managed to acquire a regional centre since February: Kherson city. “Russia faces a dilemma: withdrawal of combat forces across the [Dneiper River] makes defence of the rest of Kherson oblast more tenable; but the political imperative will be to remain and defend,” read the ministry’s statement. Russian-installed officials in Kherson region have announced that children living in the occupied area will be sent to Crimea, the southern peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, for two weeks for an autumn camp because of the security situation. The announcement said that “educational events, exciting trips and meetings with interesting people” awaited the children. While this may be an attempt by the Russian authorities to shield the children from the rapidly moving frontlines, it follows a pattern of Russia seeking to immerse Ukrainian children living in the occupied areas in their propaganda narratives. Russia has also taken Ukrainian orphans in the occupied areas to Russia, which Ukraine’s authorities have described as kidnapping."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/26/russia-ukraine-war-latest-updates-anti-mobilisation-protests-in-dagestan-us-warns-of-decisive-nuclear-response","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-26T17:59:11Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Russian conscripts being sent straight to front, Kyiv says; UK sanctions Russians linked to ‘sham referendums’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/26/russia-ukraine-war-latest-updates-anti-mobilisation-protests-in-dagestan-us-warns-of-decisive-nuclear-response","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/26/russia-ukraine-war-latest-updates-anti-mobilisation-protests-in-dagestan-us-warns-of-decisive-nuclear-response","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Russian conscripts being sent straight to front, Kyiv says; UK sanctions Russians linked to ‘sham referendums’ – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Summary It’s almost 9pm in Kyiv. Here are the day’s key events across Ukraine, Russia and beyond. Nato air forces conduct drills over Baltic Sea. Member states including the UK, Germany, Italy took part in the military training, both over water and on land, in an effort to boost eastern defences. The Netherlands increases its military support for Ukraine. Prime minister Mark Rutte also announced new sanctions in response to Russia’s mobilisation and referendum. The US pledges to provide Ukraine with $457.5m in civilian security aid. The support is aimed at “saving lives” and “bolstering” Ukrainian law enforcement, secretary of state Antony Blinken said. The Russian Orthodox Church head says Russian soldiers who die on the battlefield will have their sins absolved. Patriach Kirill – a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and a staunch supporter of the Ukraine invasion – said the “sacrifice washes away all sins”. The UK announces 92 new sanctions in response to Russia’s regime of illegal referendums in Ukraine. The package of penalties target those behind the sham votes as well as oligarchs and board members. Germany debates whether it should grant asylum to Russian war refuseniks. The country is potentially prepared to give protection to deserters who face repercussions if they refuse to fight, but each case would be decided on an individual basis amid security concerns. The UN’s atomic energy watchdog says it was ready for talks about setting up a protection zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The International Atomic Energy Agency head met the foreign ministers from both Russia and Ukraine at the UN general assembly last week to discuss the possibility. Horrific consequences are in store if Russia follows through with its thinly-veiled threats to use nuclear weapons, the US warns. Secretary of state Antony Blinken said any use of the weapons would have a “catastrophic” impact across the world. Ukraine claims some Russian conscripts from the Kremlin’s mass mobilisation were being sent directly to the frontlines without training. Those included newly drafted personnel in Crimea as well as conscripts in the Luhansk region who have received draft summonses in recent days. A Russian man shoots the leader of the local military draft committee in a Siberian town after telling him he would refuse to fight in Ukraine. Video showed the gunman, dressed in camouflage, firing at the official from point blank range as other potential draftees for the Russian invasion fled the room. Long queues of vehicles form at the border crossing between Russia and Mongolia as people continue to flee the Kremlin’s mobilisation order. The head of a checkpoint in the town of Altanbulag said more than 3,000 Russians had entered Mongolia via the crossing since Wednesday. Volodymyr Zelenskiy vows to liberate the entire country as Russia presses on with its supposed referendum in occupied areas of Ukraine. The Ukrainian president said the country’s armed forces would throw out Russia’s forces and retaliate against “every strike of the aggressor”. The UK’s chief of defence staff hosted talks with the Russian defence attaché at the Ministry of Defence in London. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin and Colonel Maxim Elovik met as part of ongoing efforts to “strengthen military to military channels of communication” with Russia. A number of Nato member states have begun to conduct air force drills in the Baltic Sea. Over the next two days, air forces from the UK, Germany, Italy and others will take part in military training both over water and on land in an effort to boost eastern defences. “For the first time we are including both air- and surface-based integrated air and missile defence activities in our drills,” said exercise planner Squadron Leader Craig Docker from Combined Air Operations Centre Uedem. “This underlines how the allies are shielding the eastern flank and – at the same time – prepare for meaningful execution of NATO’s deter and defence concept in the Baltic region.” The Netherlands will increase its military support for Ukraine as well as impose new sanctions against Russia, its prime minister has said. Following a call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Mark Rutte announced he would step up the response to Russia’s mobilisation and referendum. The announcement came following a pledge from the US to provide Ukraine with $457.5m in civilian security aid. The support is aimed at “saving lives” and “bolstering” Ukrainian law enforcement, secretary of state Antony Blinken has said. The head of the Russian Orthodox Church has said Russian soldiers who die in the war against Ukraine will have their sins absolved. Patriach Kirill – a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and a staunch supporter of the Ukraine invasion – has previously criticised those who opposed the war “Many are dying on the fields of internecine warfare,” he said, in his first address since the mobilisation order. “The Church prays that this battle will end as soon as possible, so that as few brothers as possible will kill each other in this fratricidal war.” “But at the same time, the Church realises that if somebody, driven by a sense of duty and the need to fulfil their oath, goes to do what their duty calls of them, and if a person dies in the performance of this duty, then they have undoubtedly committed an act equivalent to sacrifice. “They will have sacrificed themselves for others. And therefore, we believe that this sacrifice washes away all the sins that a person has committed.” A suspected mass grave in an industrial chicken farm in Kharkiv is being investigated by Ukrainian forces, local officials have said. It is feared up to 100 bodies were buried in the site which was once used by Russian troops to shelter their tanks. The area was recaptured by Ukrainian soldiers who pushed Russian forces back over the border earlier this month, however demining teams have yet to sweep the area for unexploded shells. Summary It’s a little past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: The UK announced 92 new sanctions in response to Russia’s regime of illegal referendums in Ukraine. The package of penalties target those behind the sham votes as well as oligarchs and board members. The UN’s atomic energy watchdog said it was ready for talks about setting up a protection zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said he met the foreign ministers from both Russia and Ukraine at the UN general assembly last week to discuss the possibility. Horrific consequences will be in store if Russia follows through with its thinly-veiled threats to use nuclear weapons, the US warned. Secretary of state Antony Blinken said any use of the weapons would have a “catastrophic” impact across the world. Ukraine claimed some Russian conscripts from the Kremlin’s mass mobilisation were being sent directly to the frontlines without training. Those included newly drafted personnel in Crimea as well as conscripts in the Luhansk region who have received draft summonses in recent days. The Kremlin said no decisions have yet been made on closing Russian borders. President Vladimir Putin’s partial mobilisation has seen hundreds attempt to flee Russia prompting calls for a ban on military-aged men crossing the border. Ukraine’s mayor of Sievierodonetsk decried what he called the “lie and propaganda” of the “referendum from the Russian Federation”. Oleksandr Stryuk accused pro-Russian forces of bussing people in from Crimea to vote and to stage propaganda photographs. The UK has announced a package of sanctions in response to Russia’s regime of illegal referendums in Ukraine. The 92 sanctions target those behind the sham votes across the four Ukrainian regions, as well as individuals that continue to prop up Russia’s war. Among the 33 officials being sanctioned over the referendums are Sergei Yeliseyev, the head of the recently installed government in Kherson, Ivan Kusov, the minister of education and science in the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, and Yevhen Balytskyi, the supposed head of government in Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia. Sanctions have also been placed on oligarchs – including the “kings of Russian real estate” God Nisanov and Zarakh Iliev – with a net worth totalling £6.3bn, and board members from state organisations. “Sham referendums held at the barrel of a gun cannot be free or fair and we will never recognise their results. They follow a clear pattern of violence, intimidation, torture, and forced deportations in the areas of Ukraine Russia has seized,” the UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said. Russia’s Tass news agency is carrying some additional quotes from Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán, in which he suggests he will hold a national consultation in Hungary on whether the EU should continue sanctions against Russia. It quotes Orbán saying: The sanctions were introduced in an undemocratic way, because it was the decision of the bureaucrats in Brussels, for which the European people are paying. We need to know the opinion of the people. For the first time in Europe, in Hungary, we will ask for the opinion about sanctions. National consultations will be launched, within which the Hungarian people will be able to express their opinion whether they support them and whether they are in favour of introducing new ones. Tass reports that Orbán stressed he was in favour of “immediate peace talks and a ceasefire” between Ukraine and the Russian forces that invaded the country on 24 February. This is a reminder that later today the Guardian is hosting a livestream event featuring historian Timothy Snyder in conversation with the Guardian’s foreign correspondent Luke Harding talking about how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has changed the world. The event starts at 8pm BST, and you can find more details and book tickets here. Oleksandr Stryuk, Ukraine’s mayor of Sievierodonetsk, has posted to Telegram decrying what he called the “lie and propaganda” of the “referendum from the Russian Federation”. Stating it was “not a referendum”, Stryuk wrote: Realising that even this will not work and local residents will refuse to ‘vote’, the occupiers brought several buses of people from Crimea to Melitopol and Berdyansk the day before. They were supposed to help create an image for propagandist media. He went on to say: Another way of agitating people is intimidation, bullying, humiliation. During the period of martial law, 515 people were abducted, more than 200 of them still remain hostages. Also, the enemy continues to shell our free territory. The occupier creates unbearable living conditions for the civilian population by attacking power stations and social infrastructure. Do not respond to fakes and provocations of the occupiers. Let’s hold on! Believe in armed forces of Ukraine! The claims have not been independently verified. Mykhailo Fedorov, who is digital minister in Ukraine, has posted an image of telecommunications repair work being carried out in “recently liberated territories of Kharkiv region”. The UN’s atomic energy watchdog said it is ready to hold talks in Russia and Ukraine on setting up a protection zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, said he met the foreign minister from both countries at the UN general assembly last week to discuss the possibility of a protection zone. “This must be done, and I am ready to continue these consultations in both countries so we can protect this plant,” he said. “The work there will allow us to stabilise the situation that is simply unacceptable. And I’m convinced that it’s something we can do. He insisted there must be an end to the war and the IAEA must do everything in its power to prevent a nuclear accident that “would add tragedy to the suffering”. Germany is furiously debating whether, and if so, under what conditions, it should be giving asylum to some of the tens of thousands of Russian war refuseniks, conscientious objectors and deserters who are seeking asylum abroad. Interior minister Nancy Faeser said Germany is potentially prepared to give protection to deserters from anywhere in the world who face repercussions if they refuse to fight, but that cases would have to be decided on an individual basis amid security concerns. Experts are warning of the high likelihood that agents of the federal security service, FSB – successor to the KGB – might use the opportunity to infiltrate the country. Security expert Christoph de Vries has warned Vladimir Putin might use this chance to try to smuggle large numbers of Russian agents into Germany, but asylum experts have also urged the government to be wary of the fact that those who refuse to fight face persecution at home. The interior ministry has also been keen to point out that this legislation, recently introduced by the EU, will protect Germany from a huge flow of Russians entering the country. Berlin is keen for there to be a joint European stance, not least wary of the fact that if it officially signals its readiness to give asylum to Russian males, it could be inundated with hundreds of thousands of them and their families. Other European countries, such as Poland, have refused to do so, while Latvia and Estonia have introduced a ban on Russians entering their countries, and Finland is in the process of doing so, after 20,000 reportedly crossed over the border at the weekend. Slovakia meanwhile, has said it will decide very carefully on a case by case basis. Russian sanctions imposed by the European Union have backfired leading to increasing energy prices, Hungary’s prime minister has said. Criticising the action taken by the west, Viktor Orbán said it was no surprise governments across Europe were falling apart – in particular Italy, where far-right leader Giorgia Meloni is on course to become the country’s first female prime minister. Horrific consequences will be in store if Russia follows through with its thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine, the US has warned. While announcing the mobilisation of reservists last week, Vladimir Putin again warned nuclear arms were a possibility prompting the US to send back a private warning of its own. “We have been very clear with the Russians, publicly as well as privately, to stop the loose talk about nuclear weapons,” secretary of state Antony Blinken told CBS. “It is very important that Moscow hears from us and know from us that the consequences would be horrific. And we’ve made that very clear. “Any use of nuclear weapons would have catastrophic effects for the country using them but for many others as well.” Ukraine’s armed forces general staff has claimed some Russian conscripts from the Kremlin’s mass mobilisation are being sent directly to the frontlines in Ukraine without training. Amid warnings from the UK’s Ministry of Defence and other experts that many of those conscripted were likely to get little meaningful training – and faced the risk of “high rates of attrition” when deployed – men recently mobilised by pro-Russian occupation officials in Ukraine were also being readied for the frontline. Those included newly drafted personnel in Crimea as well as conscripts in the Luhansk region who have received draft summonses in recent days. The latest moves came as it was reported that Russia has also closed its border to occupied areas of Ukraine with the neighbouring Rostov region for entry and exit ordering locals to appear at military enlistment offices within three days The first wave of Russian conscripts have begun arriving for training in Russia amid widespread scepticism among outside western analysts over what impact the call up was likely to have on Russian capabilities in Ukraine. Following Ukraine’s success in retaking thousands of square kilometres of territory in the Kharkiv region, heavy fighting was reported on Monday morning including in the area of Lyman in the Donetsk region. Unconfirmed reports in the past 24 hours described Russian lines collapsing in some areas while video posted on social media was described as showing Ukrainian armour moving through at least one former Russian position littered with burned out vehicles. “The lack of military trainers, and the haste with which Russia has started the mobilisation, suggests that many of the drafted [Russian] troops will deploy to the front line with minimal relevant preparation,” said the UK MoD. The US based Institute for the Study of War was also highly dubious about how the likely effectiveness of the Russian mobilisation. Noting that the Kremlin “is unlikely to overcome fundamental structural challenges”. Decisions are yet to be made on whether to close Russia’s borders amid long queues of vehicles waiting to leave the country, the Kremlin has said. President Vladimir Putin’s partial mobilisation has seen hundreds attempt to flee Russia prompting calls for a ban on military-aged men crossing the border. In a call with reporters, spokesman Dmitry Peskov acknowledged some call-ups had been issued in error, and that mistakes would be corrected. A Russian man has shot the leader of the local military draft committee in a Siberian town after telling him he would refuse to fight in the war in Ukraine. The incident took place in the city of Ust-Ilimsk, a town of about 85,000 people in the Irkutsk region in Siberia. Video showed the gunman, dressed in camouflage, firing at the official from point blank range as other potential draftees for the Russian invasion fled the room. Reports say that at least three shots were fired. Protests against the Vladimir Putin’s partial military mobilisation order appeared to continue on Sunday in the Russian republic of Dagestan, with videos showing standoffs between police and the public. Video footage posted on social media showed police arresting demonstrators protesting against the order to draft 300,000 more Russians to the army for the war effort in Ukraine. Long queues of vehicles were at border crossing between Russia and Mongolia on Sunday as people continued to flee the Kremlin’s mobilisation order, AFP reported. The head of a checkpoint in the town of Altanbulag told the agency that more than 3,000 Russians had entered Mongolia via the crossing since Wednesday. Sergei Tsekov, a member of Russia’s upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, has called for the Russian border to be shut “to ban anyone who is of military age from traveling abroad”. The Russian news agency RIA Novosti is carrying some turnout figures for the widely derided “referendums” in occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson which began on Friday. The figures suggest that turnout has been sufficient for the proxy-Russian authorities to declare them legitimate, ranging from 77% in Donetsk to 49% in Kherson. Pro-Russian authorities have claimed that in Rubizhne in occupied Luhansk, a polling station had to be moved to a reserve location after shelling from Ukrainian forces hit the school where it was due to be held. Energoatom, the state-run nuclear enterprise in Ukraine which manages nuclear power stations including the occupied plant at Zaporizhzhia, has accused pro-Russian forces within Zaporizhzhia of staging the appearance that staff voted in the widelycondemned referendum being held in the region. Serbia will not recognise Russian annexation “referendums” in occupied Ukrainian areas. The Serbian foreign minister, Nikola Selakovic, said the referendums “completely contradict our state and national interests, our policy of dealing with territorial integrity, sovereignty and the principle of inviolability of borders”. Two drones launched by Russian forces into the Odesa region in Ukraine hit military objects causing a fire and the detonation of ammunition. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed to liberate the entire country as Russia pressed on with its supposed referendum in occupied areas of Ukraine and so-called election workers accompanied by masked gunmen knocked on doors to get people to vote. The Ukrainian president said the country’s armed forces would throw out Russia’s forces and retaliate against “every strike of the aggressor”. He vowed that Ukraine would regain control of the southern Kherson region and the eastern Donbas, saying: “Every murderer and torturer will be brought to justice.” Ukraine’s president renewed calls for western allies to cut Russian banks from Swift, the global banking system that allows banks to send messages to each other. “If we cut Russian banks from Swift, we need to cut all Russian banks from Swift,” he said. Zelenskiy has also claimed in a US television interview that Ukraine has discovered two more mass burial sites containing the bodies of hundreds of people in the north-eastern town of Izium. Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has said explicitly for the first time today that he founded the Wagner mercenary group and confirmed its deployment to countries in Latin America and Africa. Moldova’s president Maia Sandu has said that her country may revoke the citizenship of those who go to fight for Russia in Ukraine. Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko is meeting Putin on Monday in Sochi. Japan will ban exports of chemical weapons-related goods to Russia, and is “deeply concerned” about the possible use of nuclear weapons, chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said on Monday. Moldova’s president Maia Sandu has said that her country may revoke the citizenship of those who go to fight for Russia in Ukraine, according to a report from Reuters. Sandu said there was a risk that some people with dual Moldovan and Russian citizenship could be called up to fight. “To prevent that happening, we are analysing the possibility of applying the process of revoking Moldovan citizenship for those people (with Russian passports) who fight on the side of the aggressor,” Sandu said. “We are also looking at the possibility of making punishment harsher for Moldovan citizens (without Russian passports) … who are in the ranks of the aggressor’s armed forces,” she said. The Russian news agency RIA Novosti is carrying some turnout figures for the widely derided “referendums” in occupied Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. The figures suggest that turnout has been sufficient for the proxy-Russian authorities to declare them legitimate, ranging from 77% in Donetsk to 49% in Kherson. Ukraine’s authorities have described the process as a “propaganda show” and it is unlikely that the results will be recognised as official, or that the referendums will be deemed to have been free or fair in many places outside of the Russian Federation. Sergei Tsekov, a member of Russia’s upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, has, according to the RIA Novosti news agency, called for the Russian border to be shut “to ban anyone who is of military age from traveling abroad”. The agency quotes him also saying it is necessary to increase the fine for evading a summons from 3,000 to 50,000 roubles. Here is an image that has been issued of the meeting between Vladimir Putin and the Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko in Sochi in Russia. There are some quite punchy quotes being attributed to Lukashenko about the reports of an exodus of young men from Russia over the partial mobilisation that was announced last week. Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, said explicitly for the first time today that he had founded the Wagner mercenary group and confirmed its deployment to countries in Latin America and Africa. Reuters reports Prigozhin said in a statement from his company that he founded the group in order to send fighters to Ukraine’s Donbas region in 2014. He said: “From that moment, on 1 May 2014, a group of patriots was born, which later acquired the name BTG Wagner.” Prigozhin, dubbed “Putin’s chef” because of his Kremlin catering contracts, has previously denied links with Wagner. Last month, Pjotr Sauer reported for the Guardian how the group had become prominent during Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine. In an overnight interview broadcast by CBS in the US, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has claimed Ukraine has discovered two more mass burial sites containing the bodies of hundreds of people in the north-eastern town of Izium. Reuters quotes him telling viewers in the US: “Today I received more information. They found two more mass graves, big graves with hundreds of people. We’re talking about (the) little town of Izium.” Last week, Ukrainian authorities finished exhuming the bodies of 436 people in a mass grave in the town. The regional governor said the majority of them appeared to have died violent deaths, and there were preliminary indications that 30 of them had been tortured.” Reuters has a quick snap that state media in Belarus are reporting that the Belarus leader, Alexander Lukashenko, will meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin today. Russia used Belarus as a staging post for its latest invasion of Ukraine. In February 2022, despite Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying that Russian troops would be “pulled back to their permanent bases” after the conclusion of joint military drills with Belarus, Moscow instead launched its failed attempt to take Kyiv. Two days ago, Lukashenko appeared to rule out mobilisation in Belarus, saying: “The mobilisation is in Russia … there will be no mobilisation (here).” Gen Sir Richard Barrons, former commander joint forces command in the British army, has been interviewed on Sky News this morning in the UK. He told viewers that Russia’s newly mobilised recruits “won’t be very well trained and probably not very well equipped”, and that “they won’t necessarily be very enthusiastic”. He said: “Russia would have to invest in training and equipping these large numbers of people that would take them well into next year. And it just doesn’t look like they have the training machinery, the logistics, or the weapons to make this really work anytime soon.” On the battlefield, he said the approaching winter weather would make an impact, explaining: “It gets wet in October, which means that moving tanks and trucks and big loads of artillery ammunition becomes harder and slower. “And then as the cold comes in, simply living in the field is harder. Shorter hours of daylight mean something simple like using drones that don’t have night vision capability becomes more restricted. The weather will slow things down. But the war won’t stop just because it gets cold.” He was dismissive that the widely derided referendums being carried out would make a strategic difference to Ukraine, saying: “The key question though, is whether [the Ukrainians] can sustain that forward movement in the north and the south.” He added “[The referendum] is just a device that allows [Russia] to claim that this territory, this part of Ukraine is somehow now magicked into Russia, and therefore could be protected by the full force of the Russian state. It is going to make no difference to what Ukraine does. It should make no difference to what the west does in supporting Ukraine.” Energoatom, the state-run nuclear enterprise in Ukraine which manages nuclear power stations including the occupied plant at Zaporizhzhia, has accused pro-Russian forces within Zaporizhzhia of staging the appearance that staff voted in the widely-condemned referendum being held in the region. It said on Telegram: They staged another performance near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, pretending to be the staff of the nuclear plant as invited mobsters. A large group of men in civilian clothes waited for the end of the shift at the station and mingled with its staff who were leaving after the shift. Along the way, those lined up gave interviews to pro-Russian propaganda media and shouted words of support for Russia and the pseudo-referendum, after which they went to the bus in which the “voting” was held and demonstratively filled out the ballots. This fact once again proves that among the patriotic workers of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, no one volunteered to participate in the occupying farce, so the propagandists were once again forced to make a “good” picture for Russian customers. The claims have not been independently verified. Here is another image from inside occupied Mariupol, which shows the city’s mayor imposed by Russian authorities, Konstantin Ivashchenko, alongside an armed guard as “voting” takes place in the open air in the city. Andrew Roth reports for the Guardian from Moscow: A Russian man has shot the leader of the local military draft committee in a Siberian town after telling him he would refuse to fight in the war in Ukraine. The incident took place in the city of Ust-Ilimsk, a town of about 85,000 people in the Irkutsk region in Siberia. Video showed the gunman, dressed in camouflage, firing at the official from point blank range as other potential draftees for the Russian invasion fled the room. Reports say that at least three shots were fired. There are conflicting reports about whether the commandant, who also heads the local draft board, has died. Video showed him being carried from the building and placed on to a stretcher. He was not moving in the video. The Irkutsk regional governor, Igor Kobzev, wrote on the Telegram messaging app that the draft office head was in hospital in a critical condition, and that the detained shooter “will absolutely be punished”. According to a witness, the man shot the military commandant after he had given a “clumsy” pep talk for the men to go and fight in Ukraine. “Nobody is going to go anywhere,” the man said moments before opening fire, a witness told the Baikal People news outlet. It is the latest incident tied to Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a partial mobilisation that has resulted in hundreds of thousands of Russian men receiving their call-up papers. A half-dozen draft centres have been torched in arson attacks in the last week, and police made hundreds of arrests across the country in order to disperse local protests sparked by the announcement. Alex Rossi is the Sky News correspondent in Moscow. He has offered this analysis this morning, saying: We’re now five days into this [mobilisation]. It doesn’t seem to really have gone down very well. Bear in mind that Russia, of course, is a very heavily securitised police state where dissent isn’t tolerated, but there have been sporadic protests all over the country. The number of people that they’re trying to draft is 300,000. That’s almost double the initial invasion force. So it is a reflection of how badly things are going on the battlefield for the Kremlin, and just shows that they have a very significant manpower problem. How these protests continue, we don’t know whether they will grow, there’s certainly the possibility of a really significant domestic backlash. Although they are small, it is significant that they’re happening at all, and that will be a serious worry for Vladimir Putin going forward. The Tass news agency is reporting that in Rubizhne in occupied Luhansk, a polling station for the widely-derided referendum being held there by proxy Russian authorities has had to be moved to a reserve location after shelling from Ukrainian forces hit the school where it was due to be held. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia’s RIA Novosti agency is carrying a quote from Kirill Stremousov, who is one of the leaders of the Russian-imposed administration in the occupied Kherson region. It reports he says he anticipates Kherson becoming part of the Russian Federation at the earliest opportunity, saying: My personal opinion: this will happen in the near future, because the sooner we become part of the Russian Federation, becoming a full-fledged subject, the sooner we will be able to establish a peaceful life. The “referendums” organised by the occupying authorities in eastern Ukraine continue today. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, has posted a status update to Telegram of damage caused overnight in his region by Russian shelling. He claims that an attack was made on an industrial zone on the outskirts of the city and that more than 15 houses and a school were damaged in one village, while one two-story residential building and an agricultural enterprise in another were hit. No casualties have been recorded overnight. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog, and I will be with you for the next few hours. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Japan will ban exports of chemical weapons-related goods to Russia, and is “deeply concerned” about the possible use of nuclear weapons, chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said on Monday. Reuters reported that Japan also added 21 Russian organisations, such as science labs, to the list of entities subject to export bans. “Japan is deeply concerned about the possibility of nuclear weapons used during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” Matsuno told media, adding Japan will continue to work with the international society in supporting Ukraine and sanctioning Russia. The news that Giorgia Meloni has claimed victory in Italy’s elections, putting her on course to create the most rightwing government since the end of the second world war, is unlikely to be welcomed by Paris or Brussels. They are seeking to keep Europe united in the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine. Meloni has condemned Russia’s invasion and supported sending weapons to Ukraine, but it remains unclear whether her government will back the eighth round of EU sanctions being discussed in Brussels. Matteo Salvini, whose far-right League forms part of her coalition, has claimed the sanctions were bringing Italy to its knees. However, he never blocked any EU measures against Russia when in Mario Draghi’s broad coalition government, which collapsed in July. The initial tranches of men called up under Russia’s partial mobilisation have started arriving at military bases, according to the UK Ministry of Defence’s latest update. Many tens of thousands of call-up papers have been issued, according to UK MoD, which said Russia will faces an administrative and logistical challenge to provide training for the troops. Here is the UK analysis: Unlike most western armies, the Russian military provides low-level, initial training to soldiers within their designated operational units, rather than in dedicated training establishments. Typically, one battalion within each Russian brigade will remain in garrison if the other two deploy and can provide a cadre of instructors to train new recruits or augmentees. However, Russia has deployed many of these third battalions to Ukraine. Many of the drafted troops will not have had any military experience for some years. The lack of military trainers, and the haste with which Russia has started the mobilisation, suggests that many of the drafted troops will deploy to the frontline with minimal relevant preparation. They are likely to suffer a high attrition rate. The US has warned Russia privately of “catastrophic” consequences if it uses nuclear weapons, US officials said. Russian President Vladimir Putin made a thinly veiled threat to use nuclear arms in a speech last week as he announced the mobilization of reservists. “It’s very important that Moscow hear from us and know from us that the consequences would be horrific. And we’ve made that very clear,” Blinken said of Putin’s comments as he spoke to the CBS News program “60 Minutes”. Two drones launched by Russian forces into the Odesa region in Ukraine hit military objects causing a fire and the detonation of ammunition, according to a report by Reuters. “As a result of a large-scale fire and the detonation of ammunition, the evacuation of the civilian population was organised,” the South command of Ukraine’s forces said in a statement on the Telegram. “Preliminarily, there have been no casualties.” It’s just past 8.10am in Ukraine. Here are the latest developments: The United States and its allies will act “decisively” if Russia uses a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine, the US national security adviser said. Jake Sullivan told CBS on Sunday: “We have communicated directly, privately and at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the US and our allies will respond decisively, and we have been clear and specific about what that will entail.” Protests against the Vladimir Putin’s partial military mobilisation order appeared to continue on Sunday in the Russian republic of Dagestan, with videos showing standoffs between police and the public. Video footage posted on social media showed police arresting demonstrators protesting against the order to draft 300,000 more Russians to the army for the war effort in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed to liberate the entire country as Russia pressed on with its supposed referendum in occupied areas of Ukraine and so-called election workers accompanied by masked gunmen knocked on doors to get people to vote. The Ukrainian president said the country’s armed forces would throw out Russia’s forces and retaliate against “every strike of the aggressor”. He vowed that Ukraine would regain control of the southern Kherson region and the eastern Donbas, saying: “Every murderer and torturer will be brought to justice.” The UK prime minister, Liz Truss, has said its allies France and the US should continue to support Ukraine in the face of the Russian president’s increased threats and his military call-up. Truss said Vladimir Putin was escalating the war because he was not winning and had made a mistake. Long queues of vehicles were at border crossing between Russia and Mongolia on Sunday as people continued to flee the Kremlin’s mobilisation order, AFP reported. The head of a checkpoint in the town of Altanbulag told the agency that more than 3,000 Russians had entered Mongolia via the crossing since Wednesday. Serbia will not recognise Russian annexation “referendums” in occupied Ukrainian areas. The Serbian foreign minister, Nikola Selakovic, said the referendums “completely contradict our state and national interests, our policy of dealing with territorial integrity, sovereignty and the principle of inviolability of borders”. Zelenskiy has renewed calls for western allies to cut Russian banks from Swift, the global banking system that allows banks to send messages to each other. “If we cut Russian banks from Swift, we need to cut all Russian banks from Swift,” he said. Zelenskiy also said that Ukraine has received Nasams (national advance surface-to-air missile systems) air defence missiles from the US. In a TV interview, Zelenskiy thanked President Joe Biden and confirmed that Ukraine now had the systems in the country. Zelenskiy also said Russia’s military call-up was a tacit acknowledgment that its “army is not able to fight”. Thousands of Hassidic Jewish pilgrims flocked to central Ukraine to mark the Jewish new year on Sunday, ignoring international travel warnings as Russian forces attacked more targets from the air. The pilgrims, many travelling from Israel and farther afield, converged on the small city of Uman, the burial site of Nachman of Breslov, a respected Hassidic rabbi who died in 1810, Associated Press reported. The Ukrainian ambassador to the UK has issued a plea for continued “generosity” and “patience” from those offering a home to refugees in Britain. Vadym Prystaiko said Ukraine needed “much more” help from the UK as the country fought Moscow’s invasion, with the Kremlin’s military call-up amounting to “something formidable”. Israel will treat 20 Ukrainian soldiers who have been injured in the war with Russia, according to the Israeli ambassador to Ukraine. The first two patients would arrive on Sunday for treatment at Sheba Medical Centre near Tel Aviv, envoy Michael Brodsky said. Aiden Aslin, one of the five British nationals released by Russia last week, has given his first media interview after returning to the UK. He told the Sun on Sunday that he was kept in solitary confinement for five months and “treated worse than a dog”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/26/war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-visual-guide-ukraine-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T09:58:46Z","webTitle":"Impact of war on Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – visual guide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/26/war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-visual-guide-ukraine-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/26/war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-visual-guide-ukraine-russia","fields":{"headline":"Impact of war on Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – visual guide","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Where is the plant and how significant is it? The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is the largest in Europe and ninth largest in the world. It sits on the eastern bank of the Dnieper River, about 550km (340 miles) south-east of Kyiv. It was built between 1984 and 1995, and modernised over the last two decades with the help of European Union funds released in the wake of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. That programme meant to finish this year, but was disrupted by the Russian invasion. The plant has six nuclear reactors, and when all of them are online it can produce 5.7 GW, enough to power roughly 4 million Ukrainian homes. Two are operating at the moment but it is still a vital part of Ukraine’s electric grid. It has been in the news because of safety concerns after Russia troops took control of the area, stationed military vehicles inside turbine halls, and drew up a risky plan to disconnect it from Ukraine’s grid. What has happened at the plant since the outbreak of war? The Russian military took over the area in the early days of the war, although the plant is still run by Ukrainian workers. Here are some key dates since the outbreak of war. 24 February: Russia invades Ukraine, two of six reactors shutdown. 27 February: Fighting first reported in vicinity of the plant. 4 March: Russia seizes the plant after a battle during which a fire breaks out in a training area. Footage of the battle is captured on a security camera: There is global alarm at the prospect of fighting so close to nuclear reactors. Another reactor is shut down. Footage published the next day shows some of the damage: A photograph published on 17 March showed damage to an administrative building at the site: 5 July: Report that Russia has deployed military equipment to the plant, turning it into a base. Footage of Russian vehicles and personnel at the plant emerges in the weeks that follow: 5 August: One of three remaining reactors online is shut down after shelling. 6 August: Alarm over strikes near storage area for radioactive materials. 24 August: Ukraine’s nuclear chief says Russia has a plan to disconnect the plant from the grid, and has filled the turbine halls of two reactors that are still operational with military vehicles: 25 August: The plant is temporarily disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid for first time in nearly 40 years of operation, after final power line connecting the plant to the grid is cut twice by fires at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plan. How has war affected the plant and its workers? About 9,000 of a 11,000-strong workforce have chosen to stay on to keep the reactors operating safely, despite extremely difficult working conditions, including mass detentions and assaults. One worker was beaten to death, another so badly assaulted he spent three months in hospital and about 200 workers have been detained, Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, told the Guardian. They have chosen to stay on because without them the risks of some kind of accident that would affect not just the local area or Ukraine, but possibly many neighbouring countries, would be much higher. Although the plant was originally built to Soviet designs, updates to the system means Russian engineers do not know how to run it safely, Kotin said. What might happen next? Ukraine has warned that Russia is contemplating disconnecting the plant from Ukraine’s national grid and connecting it to Russia’s power network. This would be extremely dangerous, because the plant’s cooling systems rely on electricity to work, and if back up diesel generators fail the reactors could only operate safely for 90 minutes. This may be the biggest danger, but Kotin warned that Russia’s management of the site is reckless. Military trucks block access to the turbine halls next to reactors, so if a blaze broke out firefighters might struggle to tackle it. And even if Russia does not attempt a switch, three out of four main power lines to the site are down, along with two out of three backups. On Thursday, the last remaining power line was disrupted twice, leading the plant to be cut off from the national grid for the first time since reactors began operation nearly 40 years ago. All sides have called for a delegation from the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, to visit and inspect the site. Kotin said that could happen within one to two weeks, with all sides hammering out practical details. World leaders have urged Russia not to attempt the switch between grids, and called on Moscow to remove military equipment and personnel from the site."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/oct/23/unseen-and-underhand-putins-hidden-hybrid-war-is-trying-to-break-europes-heart","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-23T07:00:30Z","webTitle":"Unseen and underhand: Putin’s hidden hybrid war is trying to break Europe’s heart","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/23/unseen-and-underhand-putins-hidden-hybrid-war-is-trying-to-break-europes-heart","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/23/unseen-and-underhand-putins-hidden-hybrid-war-is-trying-to-break-europes-heart","fields":{"headline":"Unseen and underhand: Putin’s hidden hybrid war is trying to break Europe’s heart","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Nato planners have always worried about the Storskog border crossing in Finnmark, where Arctic Norway comes face to face with the cold reality of Russia. In Soviet times, the 121-mile frontier was a potential flashpoint. The Red Banner Northern Fleet’s nuclear-armed submarines are still based at nearby Murmansk, on the freezing Barents Sea. Reasons to worry afresh about the border are multiplying following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Norwegian police recently arrested several Russians, equipped with drones and cameras, who were showing unusual interest in oil and gas installations. Some of the suspected spies entered via Storskog. Since Russia cut energy supplies to Europe in retaliation for western sanctions – and following last month’s sabotage of the Nord Stream Baltic pipelines – Norway has become Europe’s biggest gas supplier. And while the Oslo government is not directly accusing Moscow, it knows that makes it a prime target for covert hybrid warfare operations. Particular concern centres on the Baltic Pipe, a gas pipeline connecting Norway to Poland and other EU countries, which was inaugurated last month. The obvious worry is that it could suffer Nord Stream’s explosive fate. Theoretically vulnerable, too, in this new era of Russia-Europe hostility, are vital pipelines supplying the UK. “We’re seeing the consequences of the new security situation in Norway,” justice minister Emilie Enger Mehl warned after the arrests. “We can’t rule out further cases.” Following reports of drones buzzing North Sea rigs, Norway and Denmark – plus Nato applicants Finland and Sweden – are all increasing security and maritime patrols. Finland even plans to fence parts of its border with Russia, fearing both an influx of spies and saboteurs and a maliciously orchestrated illegal migrant surge like that on the Belarus-Poland border in 2021. The Storskog route has become popular meanwhile with young Russian men dodging Putin’s mass mobilisation. Russian non-military hybrid warfare takes many forms, all with an identical aim: the execution of “active measures” to harm, confuse, frighten, enfeeble and divide target states while maintaining plausible deniability. Thus the EU and US strongly suspect Putin ordered the Nord Stream sabotage as part of his undeclared energy war on Europe. But he denies it, and they have produced no proof. As the realisation dawns that Russia’s president will stop at nothing, EU leaders wonder what he may do next to undermine support for Ukraine – and weaken their governments. Putin is losing on the battlefield and despite his nuclear threats, plainly fears a head-on conflict with Nato he knows he could lose. Thinking ahead, it’s logical – and prudent – to assume a desperate, heedless Putin will increasingly turn to hybrid attacks in Europe. Very little is off-limits. France worries transatlantic internet cables, essential for western security and communications, are in his sights. Its 2023 budget allocates €3.1m for “ocean floor” defence. An additional €11m has reportedly been earmarked for drones and underwater robots. “We have essential infrastructure which is beyond our territory – cables, satellites and oil and gas pipelines. We’ve been reinforcing their security since the start of the war,” President Emmanuel Macron recently revealed. Britain is playing catch-up. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, has promised the UK’s first “multi-role ocean surveillance ship” will be operational in 2023. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, chief of the defence staff, warned in January that severing of communications cables would be viewed as an act of war. But the UK looks unprepared. Adding to the jitters, the break in a subsea communications cable that left Shetland islanders isolated last week remains unexplained. The incident highlighted hybrid warfare’s potential domestic dimension. EU officials admit safeguarding everything from nuclear power plants, utilities and computer systems to airports and hospitals is impossible. This vulnerability was dramatically exposed when sabotage blamed on Russia shut down parts of Germany’s railway network this month. Russia’s hybrid options extend to covert use of special forces and proxy fighters, such as the “little green men” deployed in Crimea in 2014. They include deniable cyber attacks, as suffered by Estonia in August, fake news and disinformation campaigns, as during the 2016 US election and Brexit referendum, and concerted diplomatic deception. Use of “active measures” is hard to prove. Nato declared in 2016 that “hybrid actions” against one or more allies would be viewed as an attack on all under article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty. But the problem is one of definition – what constitutes such an attack? Another problem is agreeing who is responsible. “Hybrid methods of warfare … have long been used to destabilise adversaries. What is new about attacks seen in recent years is their speed, scale and intensity, facilitated by rapid technological change and global interconnectivity,” Nato said in June. “Counter-hybrid support teams” would provide assistance but it was primarily up to individual countries to protect themselves. Hybrid threats are adding to the already considerable political and social strains imposed on Europe by the Ukraine conflict. EU leaders are struggling to agree a gas price cap and other energy crisis measures, while France and Germany are at odds over future defence policy vis-a-vis Russia. A key government-to-government summit this week has been postponed. Macron’s administration is under siege from far-right and far-left opponents, strikers and street protesters angry at rising living costs. Germany’s unpopular chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is struggling to hold a fractious coalition together. Many of the problems they face stem directly from the ever-spreading impact of February’s invasion. Division, disruption, destabilisation: these are the fruits of Putin’s hidden hybrid war. He is losing on the ground in Ukraine. But is he winning the battle to break Europe’s will? Winter is coming – and winter will tell."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/29/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-65-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-29T10:51:44Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 65 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/29/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-65-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/29/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-65-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 65 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russia attacked western Kyiv with two cruise missiles late yesterday, as the UN secretary general visited the Ukrainian capital. Two loud explosions rocked Kyiv on Thursday evening, after António Guterres went to the site of massacres and mass graves on the city’s outskirts, and met Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces destroyed the production facilities of a space-rocket plant in Kyiv with high-precision long-range missiles. It is being reported that the journalist Vera Girich was killed in the missile strikes on the city. The ministry posted a video claiming to show cruise missiles being launched into Ukraine from a submarine of the Black Sea fleet. Ukraine hopes to evacuate civilians who are holed up in the Azovstal steel plant with the last fighters defending the southern city of Mariupol. “An operation is planned today to get civilians out of the plant,” Zelenskiy’s office said, without giving details. A checkpoint at the Russian village of Krupets in the Kursk region came under fire, according to Kursk’s governor, Roman Starovoyt. Russian gains in Donbas have come at a “significant cost” to its forces, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence report. The International Atomic Energy Agency says it is investigating a report that a missile had flown directly over a nuclear power station, adding it would be “extremely serious” if true. The US president, Joe Biden, called for a $33bn package of military and economic aid to Ukraine, more than doubling the level of US assistance to date. Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, who is often seen to be voicing the Kremlin’s views, accused the US of seeking to profit from the war while indebting future generations of Ukrainians. A British citizen has been killed in Ukraine and a second is missing, the Foreign Office has confirmed, amid reports that both were volunteer fighters. The Briton who died was understood to be Scott Sibley, a former soldier who had served in Iraq. The UK will send 8,000 soldiers to eastern Europe on expanded exercises to combat Russian aggression, in one of the largest deployments since the cold war. The UK is also sending experts to help Ukraine with gathering evidence and prosecuting war crimes, with a team expected to arrive in Poland in early May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2022/mar/04/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T21:00:05Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/04/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/mar/04/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"• An article should have described Dr Elizabeth Cooper as a co-curator, rather than curator, of the Sowing Roots exhibition.

But a lot of the analysis from this year’s federal election didn’t consider one important aspect: it was the first in which baby boomers were outnumbered by Millennial and Gen Z voters. According to the 2021 census, Millennials, aged 25-39, are neck and neck with the baby boomers as the largest generational group in Australia, each representing about 21% of the Australian population. A further 18% of the population are members of generation Z (10-24 years old). This is a significant voting bloc who have come of age at a time of economic uncertainty – either the global financial crisis or the Covid pandemic – growing inequality and an increase in extreme weather events, including bushfires and floods. Many of them rent, with homeownership largely out of reach for those without family wealth due to steep rises of property prices, while wages remain stagnant. There’s also rising living costs, which renders consuming the daily recommended vegetable and fruit intake a luxury. This is a demographic that is being closely watched in Victoria as the state heads to the polls in November. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, will say he’s got far too much to do than spend time analysing what the federal result means for the upcoming state poll – his usual refrain is that elections are “always close” with a “handful of votes and a handful of seats” determining the outcome. But he’s spent years courting the Millennial and Gen Z vote, largely by bypassing the media and communicating with them directly via social media. Andrews has even posted a Drake meme on Facebook then told reporters he didn’t know of the Canadian rapper’s songs. Most of his government’s recent announcements seem to be geared towards this cohort, including the introduction of an affirmative consent model, a landmark festival to celebrate LGBTIQ+ Victorians, a two-year trial of paid sick leave for casuals and free kinder. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor faces stiff competition though from the Greens, which earlier this week, the party announced a plan to increase the power of renters across the state and ensure they have access to long-term secure and affordable housing. The plan involves several initiatives, including capping rent increases in line with wage growth, establishing a housing ombudsman and better regulating estate agents. The Greens have also vowed to end new coal and gas projects in the state and move to 100% renewable energy by 2030, build more social housing, increase funding for the corruption watchdog and ban political donations from property developers, fossil fuel companies and gambling – all similar policies to ones that helped the teals and Greens sweep the federal election. They’re also looking to double representation by winning Albert Park, Northcote and Richmond in the lower house and the southern metropolitan region in the upper house. Climate 200, which provided crucial funding for the federal teals, last month polled Victorian voters and found potential support for similar independents in the Liberal-held seats of Brighton, Caulfield, Kew and Sandringham, and the Labor seat of Hawthorn. Independent candidates are also expected to stand in Benambra and the south-west coast, both held by the Liberals, and several Labor seats including Melton and Werribee. There is also a large field of micro-parties contesting upper house. The Coalition, meanwhile, announced last month it will legislate an emission reduction target of 50% by 2030 as well as a pathway to net zero by 2050, bringing it in line with Labor, in a move designed to secure support in inner-urban electorates. But its pledges to support LGBTIQ+ Victorians were affected by the Liberals’ preselection of Moira Deeming as an upper house candidate. The opposition’s integrity policy also came spectacularly undone by revelations leader Matthew Guy’s former chief of staff sought funds inappropriately. Labor has also endured several scandals since coming into office. Whether their policy pledges will be seen as cynical attempts to stop young people abandoning major parties in November remains to be seen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/24/five-predictions-for-the-next-six-months-in-the-war-in-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-24T13:03:07Z","webTitle":"Five predictions for the next six months in the war in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/24/five-predictions-for-the-next-six-months-in-the-war-in-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/24/five-predictions-for-the-next-six-months-in-the-war-in-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Five predictions for the next six months in the war in Ukraine","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"1. The war will probably run on for a year at least but is essentially deadlocked and its intensity is lessening Six months of war may have gone by, but neither Ukraine nor Russia are ready to stop fighting, despite the losses they have sustained. Ukraine wants its occupied territories back, and Russia wants to keep inflicting pain not just on its opponent but, by proxy, the west also. The Kremlin believes winter will play to its advantage. There have been no negotiations between the two sides since evidence emerged of the massacres at Bucha, Irpin and elsewhere in territories occupied by the Russians north of Kyiv. But movement in the frontlines has been minimal since the fall of Lysychansk at the end of June. Both sides are struggling for momentum and increasingly appear combat-exhausted. 2. Ukraine has no means of effective conventional counterattack, while guerrilla raids are an optimistic way to precipitate a Russian collapse Ukraine would like to retake Kherson, on the west of the Dnieper river, but a senior administration figure admitted in private that “we do not have enough capacity to push them back”. Kyiv has shifted its strategy to mounting long-range missile attacks and daring special forces raids on Russian bases deep behind the frontlines. The key presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the aim was to “create chaos within the Russian forces”, but while this will blunt the invader’s effectiveness, it is not likely it will lead to invaders collapsing in on themselves and voluntarily conceding Kherson, as some Ukrainian officials have hoped. 3. Russia still wants to pound its way forward but its attention is likely to be shifting to holding on its gains and annexing Ukraine territory Russia has no new offensive plan other than to mass artillery, destroy towns and cities and grind its way forward. It does this in part because it is effective, and in part to minimise casualties, having lost, on some western estimates, 15,000 dead so far. It continues to adopt this strategy around Bakhmut in the Donbas but progress is slow, partly because it has had to redeploy some forces to reinforce Kherson. The Kremlin may not have achieved what it hoped at the beginning of the war, but Russia now holds large swathes of Ukrainian territory in the east and south, and is actively talking about holding annexation referendums. With cooler weather fast approaching, it is likely to focus on consolidating what it has. 4. Winter will precipitate a fresh refugee crisis and create an opportunity for whoever can best prepare Winter is uppermost in strategic thinking for both sides. Ukraine is already anxious about humanitarian issues because there is no gas heating available for apartment blocks in Donetsk province and other frontline areas. One humanitarian official predicted there would be a fresh wave of migration in the winter, with perhaps as many as 2 million people crossing the border into Poland. Russians sees winter as an opportunity. Ukraine fears Russia will target its energy grid, making its heating dilemma more acute, and could simply turn off the vast Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. Moscow also wants to prolong the west’s pain over energy costs and has every incentive to rack up the pressure. Spring, though, could be the time for a renewed attack – each side will want to replenish and prepare for what is likely to be another fighting season. 5. The west needs to decide if it wants Ukraine to win or just hold on – and it needs to match humanitarian help to the huge need Ukraine would have been defeated without western military aid. But at no point so far has the west supplied enough artillery or other weapons, such as fighter jets, that would allow Kyiv to drive the invaders back. Politicians talk about the need to force Russia to the prewar borders but do not provide enough materiel to do it. At the same time, Ukraine’s humanitarian need is growing. There is, for example, nowhere near enough money for reconstruction – and many homes north-east and north-west of Kyiv remain ruined five months after the Russians left, often with despairing residents living in garages or temporary structures on site. People who are displaced internally often have to live in schools or kindergartens, temporary accommodation that people struggle to stay in for an extended period of time. Ukraine has a budget gap of $5bn (£4.2bn) a month because of the war; aid and reconstruction will cost many times that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-303-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-23T18:48:19Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 303 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-303-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/23/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-303-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 303 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"President Vladimir Putin has ordered his country’s defence industry chiefs to ensure the Russian army gets all the weapons, equipment and military hardware it needs “in the shortest possible timeframes” to fight in Ukraine. Putin’s remarks came just days after he pledged to give his army anything it asks for in a meeting with Russia’s top military officials. Russian forces have started demolishing a theatre in occupied Mariupol in southern Ukraine that was the site of a deadly airstrike believed to have killed hundreds of civilians, according to an aide to the city’s exiled Ukrainian mayor. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, said the move was an “attempt to hide forever the evidence of the deliberate killing of Ukrainians by Russians”. North Korea’s foreign ministry denied a media report it supplied munitions to Russia, calling it “groundless,” and denounced the United States for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, the North’s official KCNA news agency reported on Friday. Japan’s Tokyo Shimbun reported earlier that North Korea had shipped munitions, including artillery shells, to Russia via train through their border last month and that additional shipments were expected in the coming weeks. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, posted a video on Friday saying he was back at work in Kyiv after his landmark visit to Washington this week. “I am in my office. We are working toward victory,” he said in the video posted to his Telegram channel. Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to the White House confirmed that Ukraine and the US are “strategic partners” for the first time in history, the Ukrainian leader’s most senior adviser has said. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office, told the Guardian that the trip on Wednesday had cemented Zelenskiy’s bond with the US president, Joe Biden – and with senior US Republicans. Russian forces shelled the recently liberated Kherson region more than 60 times on Thursday, according to the head of the region’s military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych. Two civilians were killed by Russian shelling on the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine Friday morning, according to the regional prosecutor’s office. Two people were injured after a car bomb exploded in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol in south-eastern Ukraine, according to a local pro-Moscow official. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia province, described the incident as a “terrorist attack” carried out by “militants of the Kyiv regime” to the Russian state media. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, wrote on Telegram that eyewitnesses reported a car was “blown up”. A senior Russian diplomat has said that talks on security guarantees for Russia cannot take place while Nato instructors and “mercenaries” remain in Ukraine, and while western arms supplies to the country continue. In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency TASS, Alexander Darchiev, head of the Russian foreign ministry’s North America department, said talks would be premature “until the flood of weapons and financing for the [Ukrainian president Volodymyr] Zelenskiy regime stops, American and Nato servicemen/mercenaries/instructors are withdrawn”. Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, warned the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high” and compared US-Russia relations to an “ice age” in comments reported by the Russian state-owned Tass news agency. The Kremlin on Thursday accused the US of fighting a proxy war against Russia, after Washington boosted military support for Ukraine and hosted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the White House and Congress. The Kremlin has claimed that Russia has made significant progress towards “demilitarising” Ukraine – one of the initial goals of Russia’s invasion 10 months ago. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, was asked during a briefing about comments by President Vladimir Putin that Ukraine’s military-industrial complex “if not completely reset to zero, is getting there fast”. The top Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said on Friday that shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, had “almost stopped”. Speaking on Russian state television, Russian-installed regional governor Yevgeny Balitsky said that Russian troops would not leave the nuclear plant, and that it would never return to Ukrainian control. Australia’s financial intelligence agency has warned Russian paramilitary groups are soliciting cryptocurrency donations to buy weapons and that Australians have donated to terrorist organisations overseas. Senior executives at Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) also said cryptocurrency has become a “standard part of the money-laundering tool kit” for organised crime groups in Australia. Air raid sirens were sounding shortly before 7am in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, the regional governor Vitalli Kim indicated on Telegram, in a series of posts saying, “Air alarm”. Kherson governor Yaroslav Yanushevych also posted an air raid alarm, but shortly afterwards said that the alert was over. A Russian opposition politician has filed a legal challenge over President Vladimir Putin’s use of the word “war” to describe the conflict in Ukraine. Putin on Thursday publicly acknowledged the situation as a “war” for the first time since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February, after 10 months of calling his campaign a “special military operation”. The White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. The US is imposing fresh sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities over Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. Six of the entities targeted in the latest sanctions were designated for operating or having operated in both the defence and related material sector and the marine sector of the Russian economy, the US state department said on Thursday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the Patriot air defence the US was supplying to Ukraine was an old weapons system that Russia would be able to “knock down”. “The Patriot air defence is an outdated system,” Putin told reporters in Moscow, adding that Russia’s S-300 system outperformed it. A Russian-installed official in a part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region controlled by Russian forces was killed on Thursday in a car bomb attack, according to the pro-Moscow local administration. Andrei Shtepa, the pro-Russian head of the village of Lyubimovka in the Kherson region, reportedly died after a car blew up, it said, blaming “Ukrainian terrorists”. The report has not been able to be independently verified. German authorities said they arrested an employee of the country’s foreign intelligence service on suspicion of treason for allegedly passing information to Russia. The suspect, a German citizen identified only as Carsten L, was arrested in Berlin on Wednesday, federal prosecutors said in a statement. It comes just days after Austria said it had identified a 39-year-old Greek citizen it suspected of spying for Russia. Vladimir Putin called Israel’s prime minister-designate, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Thursday to congratulate him on forming a government and to discuss the situation in Ukraine, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. Netanyahu told Putin “he hopes a way will be found quickly to end the war [with Ukraine] and the suffering caused by it”, it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2021/may/01/new-york-nuclear-power-indian-point","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-01T15:02:10Z","webTitle":"End of an era: closure of nuclear plant is pointer for New York’s energy future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/01/new-york-nuclear-power-indian-point","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/may/01/new-york-nuclear-power-indian-point","fields":{"headline":"End of an era: closure of nuclear plant is pointer for New York’s energy future","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"America’s energy past and future was on display on Friday at Indian Point, a nuclear plant 25 miles north of New York City that has been producing electricity since 1962. At 11am the last of the ageing plant’s reactor turbines shut down, ending a long political standoff. At the same time, wind and sun over the Hudson River alongside the plant pointed to the state’s energy future. Environmentalists and politicians have described the plant as a threat to millions. Many welcomed the closure. “There are 20 million people living within 50 miles of Indian Point and there is no way to evacuate them in case of a radiological release,” Paul Gallay, president of the environmental group Riverkeeper, told the Associated Press. In part, the plant was doomed by the attacks on the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 – the pilots of the hijacked planes used the river for navigation, alerting politicians to the vulnerability of the reactors on the banks of the Hudson. “The plant was built to withstand an airplane crash in the 70s,” New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said recently. “Who knows what would happen now with Indian Point?” Furthermore, nuclear power has lost favour as the cost of clean-energy renewables declines. In 2019, Indian Point provided 13% of New York state power. According to operator Entergy, for New York City and the lower Hudson Valley that figure was about 25%. Under a 2017 agreement between Cuomo, Riverkeeper and Entergy, another reactor was shut down a year ago. On Friday in the town of Buchanan, the mood was dark. The plant has provided about 1,000 well-paid jobs and half the town’s tax revenue. A lengthy decommissioning process will cut jobs by two-thirds. “It’s a sad day, the end of an era, and it marks the loss of our largest employer and tax payer,” the mayor of Buchanan, Theresa Knickerbocker, told the Guardian. “I think people really didn’t understand nuclear and I’m hugely disappointed that a clean energy plant is being replaced by two gas plants. We talk about the environment and that’s not environmentally sound.” As the Biden administration pushes for a non-fossil fuel-dependent energy policy, there will inevitably be a period in which more electricity is produced using gas-powered systems, before wind and solar take up the slack. In the long battle over Indian Point, some have seen signs of political meddling. In 2017, the group Environmental Progress noted that two former Cuomo aides worked with a natural gas company, Competitive Power Ventures. The episode was detailed in a federal indictment filed by the then US attorney for the southern district in Manhattan. “Based on my review of publicly available documents and my interviews of witnesses, including employees of [Competitive Power Ventures], the importance of the [CPV Valley Energy Center] to the state depended at least in part, on whether [Indian Point] was going to be shut down,” Preet Bharara wrote. According to Nuclear New York, a group opposing closure, Indian Point produced 81% of downstate clean energy, with solar and hydro making up 2% and 4%. Fossil fuels accounted for 67% of all state production. “We’re going in the wrong direction,” said Pramila Malick, an activist with the group, adding that closing Indian Point and ramping up generation from fracked gas will increase state greenhouse gas emissions by 10%. “The community is being poisoned by particulates,” Malick said. Unions also oppose the closure. James Shillitto, president of UWUA Local 1-2, said it had “no upside, only downside”. “The governor’s for renewable energy,” he said, “which we support. [It] is not going to happen with a magic wand. There isn’t a piece of equipment in the water for offshore wind and there isn’t any utility-scale solar built yet.” More than 20 large-scale renewable energy projects will be under construction this year. Cuomo has promised 70% renewables by 2030 and 100% a decade later. “There are many hurdles to get that done,” Shillitto said. “Nimbyism is going to slow it down. So with the closure of this plant today we’re 1,000 megawatts in the hole. This closure is about fear, unrealistic fear, of a nuclear accident. The history here shows that after 58 years we haven’t had problems.” Critics have pointed to a safety history that includes faulty reactor bolts and radioactive tritium in groundwater onsite. Groups like Riverkeeper say Indian Point kills fish by taking in river water for cooling. Greg Jaczko, head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission under Barack Obama and a lecturer at Princeton, told the Guardian the carbon-free energy future will be “exclusively non-nuclear”. “The nuclear industry failed to become a viable solution for carbon-free electricity generation,” he said, noting that of four Obama-era approved plants, two have been abandoned and two are behind schedule and over-budget. “Nuclear is an expensive way to generate carbon-free electricity when there are viable new alternatives. It’s cheaper today to build out renewable generation than it is to continue to operate 40-year-old nuclear power plants.” But Jaczko did not dispute that fossil-fuel generation will increase in the short term. “There may be a period when the overall supply of electricity will see an increased dependence on natural gas,” he said, “but in the long term the trend is to reduce emissions significantly.” Indian Point now faces a 12-year, $2.3bn decommissioning run, subject to approval, by New Jersey-based Holtec International. In 2014, the company was cited by the Guardian for donations to Republican coffers after being granted significant subsidies by the state’s then governor, Chris Christie. According to Jaczko, decommissioning could present problems given the age of the plant and the propensity for reactors in general to present surprises. “My biggest concern is that sufficient resources are set aside because it’s not a revenue-generating business,” he said. “If existing funds do not cover that cost, or it’s not done right, you could end up looking to taxpayers to foot the bill.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/aug/01/like-an-alien-obelisk-space-debris-found-in-snowy-mountains-paddock-believed-to-be-from-spacex-mission","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-01T14:07:15Z","webTitle":"‘Like an alien obelisk’: space debris found in Snowy Mountains paddock believed to be from SpaceX mission","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/aug/01/like-an-alien-obelisk-space-debris-found-in-snowy-mountains-paddock-believed-to-be-from-spacex-mission","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/aug/01/like-an-alien-obelisk-space-debris-found-in-snowy-mountains-paddock-believed-to-be-from-spacex-mission","fields":{"headline":"‘Like an alien obelisk’: space debris found in Snowy Mountains paddock believed to be from SpaceX mission","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Australian Space Agency is investigating space debris found in farmland in the Snowy Mountains in southern NSW, after being notified by an astrophysicist who believes it to be from a SpaceX mission. Brad Tucker, an astrophysicist at the Australian National University, says he often gets calls from people who believe they’ve found space junk – and they are normally easy to rule out. “This was different,” he said. Tucker received a call last Thursday from Mick Miners and Jock Wallace, two sheep farmers in the small town of Dalgety, who reported having found a scorched object. Their report matched a SpaceX spacecraft which re-entered the earth’s atmosphere at 7am on 9 July, 20 months after its launch in November 2020. The farmers were connected to Tucker via ABC local radio, where he is a regular guest to talk about space. The SpaceX Dragon capsule was observed breaking apart above the area of Australia where the farmers found the debris. Its re-entry was seen and heard by people from Canberra to Bendigo, with many sharing it on social media. Tucker drove for two hours to Miners’ farm to see if the object they had found was the unpressurised trunk of the capsule – a structure that is needed for take-off but dumped prior to re-entry. His first impression, he said, was something that “kind of just looks like a burnt tree … and then you come up to it, it’s like this alien obelisk almost”. “I knew without a doubt this was a very real incident and a very real piece just sticking out of the ground.” Tucker said he could tell it was real because it was made of composite materials designed to withstand heat, including woven carbon fibre for insulation. It also showed clear signs of scorching due to re-entry. One of the panels of the debris appeared to have had a part number. “It’s a very easy way for SpaceX to confirm it because there’s a label on it,” he says. He documented the discovery on YouTube. SpaceX has not yet confirmed to Tucker that the debris belonged to SpaceX Dragon, and has not yet responded to a request from Guardian Australia. The debris has been assessed by the Australian Space Agency (ASA). A spokesperson from ASA told Guardian Australia their technical experts had “visited a remote part of the Snowy Mountains area of southern New South Wales, after the discovery of space debris”. “The agency is actively working to support formal identification of the objects, and is engaging with our counterparts in the US, as well as other parts of the commonwealth and local authorities as appropriate,” the spokesperson said. Tucker says space junk is intended to land in the ocean, and it’s a “super rare” occurrence for it to land in a populated area. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It’s only happened a handful of times,” he says. “In 1979, the US Space station Skylab crashed over Western Australia in the first instance. There was a nuclear power Russian satellite that crashed in Canada in the 80s. And then China had a rocket booster that crashed and landed in West Africa a couple of years ago. SpaceX had part of a booster crash in the US state of Washington last year. And now this.” It’s a short list, but the incidents are becoming more frequent. Dr Sara Webb, an astrophysicist at Swinburne University, agreed with Tucker’s assessment that the debris was consistent with a SpaceX mission. Webb said that this event and the Chinese booster rocket, which made an uncontrolled return to Earth on Saturday, underscored the importance of tracking space debris. The Chinese booster rocket was particularly large, she said. “Even if 80% of it burnt up, you’re still left with basically a car coming out of the atmosphere,” she said. The spokesperson for ASA said the organisation was “committed to the long-term sustainability of outer space activities, including debris mitigation”. “This includes the ongoing development of a Space Situational Awareness and Debris Mitigation roadmap, to guide opportunities in this important area,” the ASA said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jun/22/europe-told-to-get-ready-now-for-russia-to-turn-off-all-gas-exports-iea-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-22T15:33:55Z","webTitle":"Europe told to get ready now for Russia to turn off all gas exports to region","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/22/europe-told-to-get-ready-now-for-russia-to-turn-off-all-gas-exports-iea-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jun/22/europe-told-to-get-ready-now-for-russia-to-turn-off-all-gas-exports-iea-winter","fields":{"headline":"Europe told to get ready now for Russia to turn off all gas exports to region","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Europe needs to prepare immediately for Russia to turn off all gas exports to the region this winter, according to the head of the International Energy Agency, who has called on governments to work on reducing demand and keeping nuclear power plants open. Fatih Birol said reductions in supplies in recent weeks which the Kremlin has attributed to maintenance work could, in fact, be the beginning of wider cuts designed to prevent the filling of storage facilities in preparation for winter, as Russia seeks to gain leverage over the region. “Europe should be ready in case Russian gas is completely cut off,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times. “The nearer we are coming to winter, the more we understand Russia’s intentions. “I believe the cuts are geared towards avoiding Europe filling storage, and increasing Russia’s leverage in the winter months.” EU countries are racing to refill storage sites, with Germany hoping to reach 90% of capacity by November. Its stores are only half full. Member states have also been working to reduce their reliance on Russian fossil fuels, by sourcing gas from other countries, including the US, and speeding up the switch to renewable energy, although officials have conceded that the race to phase out Russian oil and gas would mean burning more coal and keeping nuclear plants going. Birol said emergency measures taken by European governments to reduce energy demand had probably not gone far enough, and urged countries to work on preserving energy supplies. “I believe there will be more and deeper demand measures as winter approaches,” Birol said. He added that gas supplies may need to be rationed, if Russia were to further reduce gas exports. Moscow has reduced or even cut off gas deliveries to several EU countries in recent weeks, in response to their decision to impose sanctions on the Kremlin over its invasion of Ukraine. Russian gas supplies to Europe received through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline – which runs under the Baltic Sea to Germany – have been falling. Last week, Russia’s state-controlled energy company Gazprom announced the second cut to gas transported via the pipeline, reducing supplies to just 40% of capacity. The Italian energy firm Eni has reported a halving of Gazprom’s gas supplies to Italy, which gets about 40% of its imported gas from Russia. Meanwhile, the French network operator GRTgaz said France had not received any Russian gas via Germany since the middle of May. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov last week blamed maintenance issues for the reductions in supply, a reference to earlier comments saying Russia was unable to secure the return of equipment sent to Canada for repairs. Europe’s benchmark gas price is trading at about €127 (£109) per megawatt hour – up more than 300% on its level a year ago. Analysts at RBC Europe said options are in “short supply” for European policymakers. It believes gas suppliers Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies stand to gain from the supply squeeze, as well as coal producer Glencore. Separately on Wednesday, Ineos Energy signed a deal with US company Sempra Infrastructure for the supply of 1.4m tonnes per annum of liquefied natural gas from North America for 20 years. Ineos, controlled by billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, intends to trade the gas and use it in its own industrial operations. The gas will be supplied from two projects in the US Gulf."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jan/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-calls-for-further-sanctions-and-more-weapons-after-latest-strikes","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-27T18:51:25Z","webTitle":"At least 10 civilians killed in new Russian shelling, Kyiv says; fierce fighting in eastern Donetsk battle – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jan/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-calls-for-further-sanctions-and-more-weapons-after-latest-strikes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jan/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-calls-for-further-sanctions-and-more-weapons-after-latest-strikes","fields":{"headline":"At least 10 civilians killed in new Russian shelling, Kyiv says; fierce fighting in eastern Donetsk battle – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is coming up to 7pm in London – 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the latest news: A new barrage of Russian shelling has killed at least 10 Ukrainian civilians and wounded 20 others in a day, the Associated Press (AP) reported, citing the office of Ukraine’s president. Regional officials said towns and villages in the east and in the south that are within reach of the Russian artillery suffered most. Six people died in the Donetsk region, two in Kherson, and two in the Kharkiv region, the AP quotes them as saying. A day earlier, missiles and self-propelled drones that Russian forces fired had hit deeper into Ukrainian territory, killing at least 11 people. Ukraine’s army claims to have killed 109 Russian soldiers and wounded a further 188 in one day during fighting around the village of Vuhledar in the eastern Donetsk oblast. Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern operational command of the Ukrainian armed forces, said the bloody death toll was recorded on Thursday, adding “Fierce fighting is ongoing. The enemy is indeed trying to achieve an intermediate success there, but thanks to the efforts of our defenders, they are unsuccessful.” Poland will send an additional 60 tanks to Ukraine on top of the 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks it has already pledged, the former’s prime minister has said. Mateusz Morawiecki has told CTV News “we are ready to send 60 of our modernised tanks, 30 of them PT-91. And on top of those tanks, 14 tanks, Leopard 2 tanks, from in our possession.” Belgium has announced a package of an additional €93.6m (£84.5m / $104.7m) in military aid for Ukraine. The prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said that, taking into account previous spending, it amounted to the biggest ever military aid package given to another country by Belgium. The package will include surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank weapons, machine guns, grenades and munition. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who visited Ukraine last week, said IAEA monitors reported powerful explosions near Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Thursday and renewed calls for a security zone around the plant. Ukraine’s state broadcaster reported that ten regions of Ukraine are using emergency power outages due to a power shortage in the network after Thursday’s Russian attacks, and the restoration of damaged facilities is ongoing. The Kremlin said on Friday that US President Joe Biden had the key to end the conflict in Ukraine by directing Kyiv to settle, but that Washington had so far not been willing to use it. “The key to the Kyiv regime is largely in the hands of Washington,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his usual daily briefing. “Now we see that the current White House leader ... does not want to use this key. On the contrary, he chooses the path of further pumping weapons into Ukraine,” he added. Lynne Tracy, the new US ambassador to Russia, will not improve ties between Washington and Moscow because the former is engaging in a “hybrid war” against the latter, the Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Friday. Zakharova said Tracy’s room for manoeuvre would be limited due to what she said was fierce anti-Russian bipartisan feeling in the United States. The European Union wants swift accountability for “horrific” crimes in Ukraine, EU justice ministers have said. But the member states differ over how to bring prosecutions, seek evidence or fund war damage repairs. The bloc’s 27 justice ministers met in Stockholm, where they discussed collecting evidence as well as setting up a new international tribunal to prosecute Moscow’s aggression. Hungary will veto any European Union sanctions against Russia affecting nuclear energy, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told state radio on Friday. Ukrainian government officials who shirk their duties during wartime will be quickly removed, a top aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday amid a crack down on corruption. More than a dozen officials have been removed this week after a series of scandals and graft allegations. Political analysts said Zelenskiy needs to show western partners and war-weary Ukrainians that he is serious about punishing misrule. Russia is violating the “fundamental principles of child protection” in wartime by giving Ukrainian children Russian passports and putting them up for adoption, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) chief Filippo Grandi has said. “Giving them nationality or having them adopted goes against the fundamental principles of child protection in situations of war,” Grandi said. Grandi said his agency was unable to estimate the number of children who had been given passports or put up for adoption, as access in Russia was extremely limited. Russia has said accusations Ukrainian children have been abducted are false. A 74-year-old Spanish man arrested over a spate of letter bombs sent to institutions including the prime minister’s office and the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid in late 2022 was trying to pressure Spain to drop its support for Ukraine, an investigating magistrate said on Friday. The man was remanded in custody as he was considered a flight risk to Russia. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has met the Eritrean president, Isaias Afwerki, during a tour of African nations to shore up support for Russia, focusing on the “dynamics of the war in Ukraine”, Eritrea’s information minister has said. Ukraine would not rule out boycotting the Olympic Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Games, its sports minister said. Russia’s communications regulator Roskomnadzor says it has blocked the websites of the CIA and FBI, accusing the two US government agencies of spreading false information. Ukraine is setting up drone assault companies within its armed forces that will be equipped with Starlink satellite communications, it has announced, as it presses ahead with an idea to build up an “army of drones”. According to Reuters, the general staff said the commander-in-chief Valeriy Zaluzhnyi signed off on the creation of the units in a project that will involve several ministries and agencies. “The most professional servicemen” have already been chosen to lead the companies, each of which will receive drones and ammunition, Starlink terminals and other equipment, it said on Facebook. “We are doing everything to provide soldiers with modern technologies.” Starlink is a satellite internet system operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company, and widely used both by civilians and the military in Ukraine. It will take about six months to train Ukrainian pilots for combat in western fighter jets, such as the US’ F-16, Kyiv has said, as it steps up its campaign to secure fourth-generation warplanes. Reuters reports that Ukraine got a huge boost this week when Germany and the US announced plans to provide heavy tanks to Kyiv, which is now hoping the west will also provide long-range missiles and fighter jets. Western military support has been vital for Kyiv and has rapidly evolved. Before the invasion, even the idea of supplying lethal aid to Ukraine was highly controversial, but western supplies have since shattered taboo after taboo. Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuri Ihnat said F-16s may be the best option for a multi-role fighter to replace the country’s current fleet of warplanes, which are older than modern Ukraine itself. He said Kyiv was using four types of Soviet-era planes. The pilots are saying it is not a problem to fly the F-16, they could learn it within several weeks. To fight with these planes is a very different thing, to use all types of weapons. Pilots say they could master it in about half a year. Ukraine uses its warplanes for intercept missions and to attack Russian positions. Germany’s €100bn (£87.7bn, $108bn) special defence fund is no longer enough to cover its needs, the country’s new defence minister Boris Pistorius has said during an interview with Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Pistorius, who took office last week after the resignation of his predecessor, said Germany would also need to raise its annual regular defence spending from the current level of around €50bn. Germany also needs to replenish its military hardware stocks, including replacements for the 14 Leopard tanks that Berlin agreed to send to Ukraine to help repel Russia’s invasion, the new defence chief said. Germany’s decision to suspend compulsory military service in 2011 was a mistake, he added, saying he was hesitant to place a burden upon young generations but was open to discussing a new model to strengthen the relationship between citizens and the state. Asked whether Germany would sent fighter jets to Ukraine, the next request from Kyiv after Germany approved earlier this week the delivery of Leopard 2 tanks, Pistorius said this was “ruled out”. Fighter aircraft are much more complex systems than main battle tanks and have a completely different range and firepower. We would be venture into dimensions that I would currently warn against. Ukraine will need an additional $17bn (£13.7bn) in financing this year for energy repairs, de-mining and to rebuild infrastructure, Reuters quotes the country’s prime minister Denys Shmyhal as saying. He told a government meeting five high-voltage substations in the central, southern and south-west regions were hit during Russia’s air attacks on Thursday. The energy sector has been severely damaged following four months of Russian missile and drones attacks. Shmyhal said the government hosted a meeting with western partners this week to coordinate financial support in a transparent and efficient way. This year, we need to finance a huge budget deficit of about $38bn. Another $17bn this year will be needed for fast reconstruction of the energy, humanitarian de-mining, rebuilding of the housing, critical and social infrastructure. The government also said it was setting up a state agency for infrastructure recovery and development. Mustafa Nayem, a prominent former journalist who had been a deputy infrastructure minister since 2021, would head the newly-created agency. Moscow has ordered Latvia’s envoy to leave Russia within two weeks, the former’s foreign ministry has said – following a similar decision by Riga earlier this week, Reuters reports. The ministry said it had summoned the Latvian chargé d’affaires to protest Riga’s decision to downgrade relations with Russia. Latvia has said it acted out of solidarity with Estonia after Tallinn also ordered out Russia’s envoy. The three Baltic states, which also include Lithuania, have been among a group of Nato allies arguing strongly for more western tanks to be sent to Ukraine. A new barrage of Russian shelling has killed at least 10 Ukrainian civilians and wounded 20 others in a day, the Associated Press (AP) reports, citing the office of Ukraine’s president. Regional officials said towns and villages in the east and in the south that are within reach of the Russian artillery suffered most. Six people died in the Donetsk region, two in Kherson, and two in the Kharkiv region, the AP quotes them as saying. A day earlier, missiles and self-propelled drones that Russian forces fired had hit deeper into Ukrainian territory, killing at least 11 people. Donetsk governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said the Russian military used fiercely-burning phosphorus munitions in its shelling of the village of Zvanivka, about 12 miles (20 km) north of Bakhmut; a city that has become the focus of a gruelling standoff in recent months. The shelling also damaged apartment buildings and two schools in the nearby town of Vuhledar, Kyrylenko said. The governor of the neighbouring Luhansk region Serhii Haidai said Ukrainian shelling hit two Russian bases in the occupied towns of Kreminna and Rubizhne, killing and wounding “dozens” of Russian soldiers. The AP said it could not independently verify his claim. Further south, Russian troops resumed shelling the town of Nikopol, across the river Dnieper from the Russia-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, damaging apartment buildings, gas pipelines, power lines and a bakery, the AP quoted officials as saying. A senior EU official has called for a “Radio Free Russia” to help independent Russian media distribute content in their home country and evade heavy censorship. Vĕra Jourová, the European Commission vice-president in charge of values and transparency, said the EU had a moral duty to support democratic ideals in Russia: We should not give up on the Russian society … regardless of how few or how many want to hear the real news, not Kremlin propaganda. During a speech at Estonia’s foreign ministry, Jourová called for a Radio Free Russia project to support independent Russian media that have been expelled or fled their home country. The project did not mean establishing a new radio station, she said, but supporting journalists in the EU, so they could “produce more content and distribute it more widely without any editorial interference”. She added: We need to create the conditions for them to work and tell the story of the EU they see and experience to their Russian audiences. It is not only a moral duty, it is in our self-interest. Ukraine’s army claims to have killed 109 Russian soldiers and wounded a further 188 in one day during fighting around the village of Vuhledar in the eastern Donetsk oblast. Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern operational command of the Ukrainian armed forces, said the bloody death toll was recorded on Thursday, adding “Fierce fighting is ongoing. The enemy is indeed trying to achieve an intermediate success there, but thanks to the efforts of our defenders, they are unsuccessful.” Poland will send an additional 60 tanks to Ukraine on top of the 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks it has already pledged, the former’s prime minister has said. Mateusz Morawiecki has told CTV News “we are ready to send 60 of our modernised tanks, 30 of them PT-91. And on top of those tanks, 14 tanks, Leopard 2 tanks, from in our possession.” Belgium has announced a package of an additional €93.6m (£84.5m / $104.7m) in military aid for Ukraine. The prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said that, taking into account previous spending, it amounted to the biggest ever military aid package given to another country by Belgium. The package will include surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank weapons, machine guns, grenades and munition. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who visited Ukraine last week, said IAEA monitors reported powerful explosions near Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Thursday and renewed calls for a security zone around the plant. Ukraine’s state broadcaster reported that ten regions of Ukraine are using emergency power outages due to a power shortage in the network after Thursday’s Russian attacks, and the restoration of damaged facilities is ongoing. The Kremlin said on Friday that US President Joe Biden had the key to end the conflict in Ukraine by directing Kyiv to settle, but that Washington had so far not been willing to use it. “The key to the Kyiv regime is largely in the hands of Washington,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his usual daily briefing. “Now we see that the current White House leader ... does not want to use this key. On the contrary, he chooses the path of further pumping weapons into Ukraine,” he added. Lynne Tracy, the new US ambassador to Russia, will not improve ties between Washington and Moscow because the former is engaging in a “hybrid war” against the latter, the Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Friday. Zakharova said Tracy’s room for manoeuvre would be limited due to what she said was fierce anti-Russian bipartisan feeling in the United States. The European Union wants swift accountability for “horrific” crimes in Ukraine, EU justice ministers have said. But the member states differ over how to bring prosecutions, seek evidence or fund war damage repairs. The bloc’s 27 justice ministers met in Stockholm, where they discussed collecting evidence as well as setting up a new international tribunal to prosecute Moscow’s aggression. Hungary will veto any European Union sanctions against Russia affecting nuclear energy, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told state radio on Friday.

In a press conference the prime minister, Alexander De Croo, said that, taking into account previous spending, it amounted to the biggest ever military aid package given to another country by Belgium. VRT, the public service broadcaster for Belgium’s Flemish community reports: Federal defence minister Ludivine Dedonder gave details about the nature of the military aid that Belgium is giving to Ukraine. This will include surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank weapons, machine guns, grenades and munition. Some of this will come from stocks held by the Belgian army, while the rest will be bought from Belgian arms manufacturers. Dedonder would not go into specific details about the quantities of arms that will be sent. The defence minister went on to say that armoured jeeps and lorries will also be given to the Ukrainians. All of the vehicles that will be sent to Ukraine are all in working order and in a good state of repair or will soon undergo a full service. A 74-year-old Spanish man arrested over a spate of letter bombs sent to institutions including the prime minister’s office and the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid in late 2022 was trying to pressure Spain to drop its support for Ukraine, an investigating magistrate said on Friday. Pompeyo Gonzalez Pascual is under formal investigation over two possible aggravated terrorism charges and four terrorism charges, the magistrate said during his first court hearing. Reuters reports he was ordered to be detained pending any formal charges and further hearings. The suspect used Russian messaging apps such as VK and the Swiss end-to-end encrypted email service Protonmail, which could indicate a risk of him fleeing to Russia, the magistrate added. The evidence suggests Gonzalez acted alone, the judge wrote. He said the suspect’s alleged actions showed his intent to give the impression they were carried out by people with ties with Russia as retribution for Spain’s and the United States’ support for Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion of the country. “There is no indication that the person under investigation belongs to or collaborates with any terrorist gang or organised group,” the statement said. Ukraine’s ruling party has kicked out a lawmaker as reports he travelled to Thailand during the war spark a public outcry. Mykola Tyshchenko was expelled from Servant of the People’s voting bloc after an announcement appeared briefly on the website of the Ukrainian embassy in Thailand saying he would meet members of the diaspora at a hotel there, according to the party’s spokesperson Yulia Paliychuk. Tyshchenko said on Facebook he had been on a business trip in Asia with approval of party leaders, “acting exclusively in the interests of Ukraine”. Parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk said he had approved no such trip. According to Reuters, the winter visit to south-east Asia came amid a crackdown by the president Volodymyr Zelenskiy aimed at projecting an image of greater accountability for officials. More than a dozen senior officials were fired or resigned this week – including a deputy prosecutor who had come under fire in the press for a holiday in Spain – in the biggest shakeup of the Kyiv leadership since the war began. Zelenskiy has announced a ban this week on private trips abroad by officials. Most Ukrainian men aged 18-60 have already been barred from leaving the country under martial law since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February last year. Ukraine’s army claims to have killed 109 Russian soldiers and wounded a further 188 in one day during fighting around the village of Vuhledar in the eastern Donetsk oblast. Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern operational command of the Ukrainian armed forces, said the bloody death toll was recorded on Thursday. Fierce fighting is ongoing. The enemy is indeed trying to achieve an intermediate success there, but thanks to the efforts of our defenders, they are unsuccessful. The information could not be independently verified. Russia has said its forces have made significant advances in the region in the last six days but UK military intelligence poured doubt on the claims in a briefing on Friday. It was suggested the Russians may have “conducted local, probing attacks” but added that it was “highly unlikely that Russia has actually achieved any substantive advances”. No evidence was provided for the UK military intelligence statement. Poland will send an additional 60 tanks to Ukraine on top of the 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks it has already pledged, the former’s prime minister has said. Warsaw, which has positioned itself as one of Kyiv’s staunchest allies, has pressed hard for Germany to send Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine and to allow other countries to do so as well; a demand to which Berlin agreed on Wednesday. Now, Mateusz Morawiecki has told CTV News: Poland sent 250 tanks as the first country half a year ago or even more than that. Right now, we are ready to send 60 of our modernised tanks, 30 of them PT-91. And on top of those tanks, 14 tanks, Leopard 2 tanks, from in our possession. Lynne Tracy, the new US ambassador to Russia, will not improve ties between Washington and Moscow because the former is engaging in a “hybrid war” against the latter, the Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson Maria Zakharova has said. Reuters reports the ambassador’s appointment comes as relations between Russia and the US are at historical lows because of Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Zakharova said Tracy’s room for manoeuvre would be limited due to what she said was fierce anti-Russian bipartisan feeling in the United States. She said she thought it would be progress if US-Russia relations did not sour even further, but said Moscow did not believe it would be possible to prevent a further deterioration. Last week, the Kremlin dismissed the idea that Washington and Moscow could turn their relationship around halfway through the US president Joe Biden’s term in office, adding that there was “no hope” for improvement in the foreseeable future. Russia’s communications regulator Roskomnadzor says it has blocked the websites of the CIA and FBI, accusing the two US government agencies of spreading false information, the state-run Tass news agency reports. In a statement carried by Russian news agencies and relayed by Reuters, it said: Roskomnadzor has restricted access to a number of resources belonging to state structures of hostile countries for disseminating material aimed at destabilising the social and political situation in Russia. Tass quotes Roskomnadzor as saying the two US websites have published inaccurate material and information that had discredited the Russian armed forces. There was no immediate comment from Washington or from the US embassy in Moscow. Reuters noted that the reports were produced in Russia, where the law restricts coverage of the military operations in Ukraine. Russia has made it a criminal offence to discredit its armed forces, a crime punishable by up to five years in jail, while knowingly distributing “false information” about the military carries a maximum sentence of 15 years. Since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February last year, Roskomnadzor has blocked a host of independent media outlets, some foreign news websites and social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. The European Union wants swift accountability for “horrific” crimes in Ukraine, EU justice ministers have said. But the member states differ over the methods in a debate about how to bring prosecutions, seek evidence or fund war damage repairs, Reuters reports. The bloc’s 27 justice ministers met in Stockholm ahead of the 24 February anniversary of Russia’s full-scale attack on Ukraine – a former Soviet republic and Moscow satellite that has sought to join the EU and Nato in recent years. Kyiv reports heavy fighting in the east of the country on Friday, capping a week when the west promised to provide Ukraine with modern battlefield tanks for the first time to help it fight back against Moscow. Reuters quotes Ireland’s Simon Harris as saying: There absolutely will have to be accountability for horrific international crimes and the brutality of what we’re seeing in Ukraine ... the clear and apparent war crimes. The ministers discussed collecting evidence as well as setting up a new international tribunal to prosecute Moscow’s aggression. Gunnar Strommer, Sweden’s justice minister, said: Nobody doing this kind of war crimes shall go free. It’s very, very important that we will find a way to hold responsible people accountable. The question is, how can we deal with this in a practical and efficient way. As the 27 EU countries debated the options, the Slovak minister spoke against starting a new body to carry out prosecutions, something his Belgian colleague Vincent van Quickenborne specifically called for. The latter was quoted as saying: These acts of aggression should be condemned not only by European countries or by the United States, but by a large majority of countries ... in Africa, Latin America and other places. The European Union hopes South Africa will use its good relations with Russia to convince it to stop the war in Ukraine, Reuters quotes the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell as saying. Speaking alongside South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, in the capital Pretoria, he told reporters: The EU isn’t asking South Africa to choose sides, just asking countries across the world to stand with the UN charter. The EU considers South Africa an important partner in the rules-based international order, he added. Pandor said: It is not just South Africa and other African countries that must play a role at seeking peace. The German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock has repeatedly sought to make clear that Nato must not become party to the war in Ukraine, says a ministry spokesperson, in response to uproar over a comment she made earlier in the week about fighting against Russia. At an event in Strasbourg on Tuesday, Baerbock said in English: “We are fighting a war against Russia, and not against each other.” Now, Reuters quotes the German ministry as saying: Russian propaganda continually takes statements, sentences, stances, positions of the government, our partners and uses them to serve their purposes. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has met the Eritrean president, Isaias Afwerki, during a tour of African nations to shore up support for Russia, focusing on the “dynamics of the war in Ukraine”, Eritrea’s information minister has said. Lavrov has been on a week-long charm offensive on the continent, starting in South Africa, which is planning joint military drills with Russia and China, and finishing off with a surprise trip to the reclusive Horn of Africa nation of Eritrea. South Africa is one of Russia’s most important allies on a continent divided over the invasion and western attempts to isolate Moscow because of its military actions. Eritrea is one of the few African countries that voted against a UN resolution condemning Russia’s 24 February invasion of Ukraine; although many abstained. hee Russian state news agency Tass quotes Lavrov as saying: We are thankful to Eritrean friends for their consistent support of Russian initiatives in the UN. He said Asmara had taken a “principled and balanced position on issues regarding the events in Ukraine and around it”, TASS reports, adding that he also invited his Eritrean counterpart, Osman Saleh, to visit Moscow soon. The talks in Eritrea also explored ways of enhancing ties in energy, mining, information technology, education and health, the information minister Yemane Meskel says. Both sides will conduct a joint study to establish the logistical and transit opportunities presented by the Red Sea port of Massawa and its airport, Tass reports, quoting Lavrov as saying: I would like to mention the possibility of using the logistical potential of the Massawa port and the city’s airport. The airport of Massawa looks interesting from the point of view of its transit possibilities. Lavrov’s visit to Africa coincides with others by senior US officials, who are crisscrossing the continent to shore up ties with its allies there. Speaking when he met Lavrov’s delegation on Thursday, the foreign minister Osman blamed the crisis in Ukraine on what he described as the United States’ “reckless policy of hegemony and containment” over several decades, Reuters reports. The sad fact is that Ukraine is both a pretext and victim of this policy. There was no mention of the conflict in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, where Eritrean troops fought alongside their Ethiopian federal counterparts against rebellious Tigrayan forces. A deal to end the fighting was signed last November but Eritrea was not party to the truce. Eritrean troops have started to leave some parts of Tigray, witnesses said. Ukraine’s state broadcaster reported that 10 regions of Ukraine are using emergency power due to a power shortage in the network after Thursday’s Russian attacks, and the restoration of damaged facilities is ongoing. Ukrainian civilians had raced for cover on Thursday as Russia fired a barrage of missiles and drones across the country, killing at least 11 people, a day after Kyiv won pledges of battlefield tanks to combat Moscow’s invasion from western countries. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who visited Ukraine last week, said IAEA monitors reported powerful explosions near Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Thursday and renewed calls for a security zone around the plant. The Kremlin said on Friday that US President Joe Biden had the key to end the conflict in Ukraine by directing Kyiv to settle, but that Washington had so far not been willing to use it. “The key to the Kyiv regime is largely in the hands of Washington,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his usual daily briefing. “Now we see that the current White House leader ... does not want to use this key. On the contrary, he chooses the path of further pumping weapons into Ukraine,” he added. Ukrainian government officials who shirk their duties during wartime will be quickly removed, a top aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday amid a crack down on corruption. More than a dozen officials have been removed this week after a series of scandals and graft allegations. Political analysts said Zelenskiy needs to show western partners and war-weary Ukrainians that he is serious about punishing misrule. Russia is violating the “fundamental principles of child protection” in wartime by giving Ukrainian children Russian passports and putting them up for adoption, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) chief Filippo Grandi has said. “Giving them nationality or having them adopted goes against the fundamental principles of child protection in situations of war,” Grandi said. “This is something that is happening in Russia and must not happen,” he added. Grandi said his agency was unable to estimate the number of children who had been given passports or put up for adoption, as access in Russia was extremely limited. Russia has said accusations Ukrainian children have been abducted are false. Tass is reporting that the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are to be ordered to use Moscow time instead of Kyiv time. Hungary will veto any European Union sanctions against Russia affecting nuclear energy, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told state radio on Friday. Ukraine has called on the 27-nation EU to include Russian state nuclear energy company Rosatom in sanctions but Hungary, which has a Russian-built nuclear plant it plans to expand with Rosatom, has blocked that. Reuters reports that Orbán reiterated in an interview that sanctions on nuclear energy “must obviously be vetoed”. “We will not allow the plan to include nuclear energy into the sanctions be implemented,” the Hungarian premier said. “This is out of the question.” Ukraine would not rule out boycotting the Olympic Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Games, its sports minister said. Plans by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to look at ways for those athletes to return to international competition would be opposed, the minister, Vadim Guttsait, said on social media late on Thursday. “Our position is unchanged: as long as there is a war in Ukraine, Russian and Belarusian athletes should not be in international competitions,” Guttsait wrote on his Facebook page. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. Kevin Rawlinson will be with you for the next few hours. Ukraine’s Marta Kostyuk said on Friday it “hurts a lot” to see Russian flags at the Australian Open despite the ban on them and was surprised by the lapse in security that allowed spectators to display the flags in and around Melbourne Park. Novak Djokovic’s father, Srdjan, said earlier on Friday he would not attend his son’s semi-final against Tommy Paul after a video emerged showing him posing at Melbourne Park with fans holding Russian flags. “It hurts a lot because there were specific rules, they were printed out outside that this is not allowed to bring flags,” Reuters reports Kostyuk told reporters after bowing out of the women’s doubles competition with Elena-Gabriela Ruse. “It’s not impossible, but you’re not allowed to bring out the flags and so on. It really hurts that they were there for quite some time. “They were there on the court, in the stands as well and I just don’t understand as well. It really hurts and I don’t understand how this can be possible.” Russia is violating the “fundamental principles of child protection” in wartime by giving Ukrainian children Russian passports and putting them up for adoption, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) chief told Reuters in an interview. Speaking at the UNHCR offices in Kyiv following a six-day tour of the country, Filippo Grandi said Ukraine’s president had asked his agency to “do more” to help children from occupied regions to whom this was happening. “Giving them nationality or having them adopted goes against the fundamental principles of child protection in situations of war,” Grandi said. “This is something that is happening in Russia and must not happen,” he added. Grandi said his agency was unable to estimate the number of children who had been given passports or put up for adoption, as access in Russia was extremely limited. “We are seeking access all the time, and access has been rather rare, sporadic and not unfettered, if you see what I mean.” Russia has said accusations Ukrainian children have been abducted are false. “We categorically reject unfounded allegations that the Russian authorities are kidnapping children,” Russian diplomat at the United Nations Dmitry Polyansky said in July. Tass is reporting that the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are to be ordered to use Moscow time instead of Kyiv time. It writes: According to the official Telegram channel of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation “Step-by-step synchronisation of Russian legislation continues after the admission of four new entities to it. In the near future, the Dontesk People’s Republic, Luhansk People’s Republic, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions will become part of the second time zone, where Moscow time operates,” the message says. The relevant bill has already been submitted to the government of the Russian Federation. “Recall that earlier all four regions lived according to Kyiv time, UTC + 2 (one hour less than in Moscow) and UTC + 3 in the summer. Currently, Moscow time de facto operates in the new regions, and the new bill fixes this. The Kremlin said on Friday that US President Joe Biden had the key to end the conflict in Ukraine by directing Kyiv to settle, but that Washington had so far not been willing to use it. “The key to the Kyiv regime is largely in the hands of Washington,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his usual daily briefing. “Now we see that the current White House leader ... does not want to use this key. On the contrary, he chooses the path of further pumping weapons into Ukraine,” Reuters reports he added. Here are some images of people ice fishing in Ukraine’s occupied region of Luhansk, which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne has reported on the latest energy situation. It writes on its official Telegram channel: Currently, ten regions of Ukraine are already using emergency power outages due to a power shortage in the network after yesterday’s Russian shelling, and the restoration of damaged facilities is ongoing. Ukraine would not rule out boycotting the Olympic Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Games, its sports minister said. Plans by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to look at ways for those athletes to return to international competition would be opposed, the minister, Vadim Guttsait, said on social media late on Thursday, Reuters reports. “Our position is unchanged: as long as there is a war in Ukraine, Russian and Belarusian athletes should not be in international competitions,” Guttsait wrote on his Facebook page. “Work is currently underway on further possible steps and first steps to continue sanctions and prevent Russians and Belarusians from international competitions,” he said. “If we are not heard, I do not rule out the possibility that we will boycott and refuse participation in the Olympics.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted a message to his official Telegram channel on Holocaust Memorial day. 27 January marks the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. In the message, Ukraine’s president writes: Today, as always, Ukraine honors the memory of millions of victims of the Holocaust. We know and remember that indifference kills along with hatred. Indifference and hatred are always capable of creating evil together only. That is why it is so important that everyone who values life should show determination when it comes to saving those whom hatred seeks to destroy. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. Stefano Sannino, secretary general of the European Union’s European external action service, has defended German and US provisions of military equipment to Ukraine, and criticised Russia’s President Vladimir Putin for waging a war on Nato and the west. Associated Press report that Sannino, speaking at a news conference in Tokyo as part of an Asia-Pacific tour, said Putin had “moved from a concept of special operation to a concept now of a war against Nato and the west.” He said German and US tank provisions are meant to help Ukrainians defend themselves in the war, rather than making them attackers. “I think that this latest development in terms of armed supply is just an evolution of the situation and of the way Russia started moving the war into a different stage,” Sannino said. He added that Russia is making “indiscriminate attacks” on civilians and cities and no longer military targets. The EU is not moving the war into a different stage but is “just giving the possibility of saving lives and allowing the Ukrainians to defend from these barbaric attacks,” Sannino said. Hungary will veto any European Union sanctions against Russia affecting nuclear energy, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told state radio on Friday. Ukraine has called on the 27-nation EU to include Russian state nuclear energy company Rosatom in sanctions but Hungary, which has a Russian-built nuclear plant it plans to expand with Rosatom, has blocked that. Reuters reports that Orbán reiterated in an interview that sanctions on nuclear energy “must obviously be vetoed”. “We will not allow the plan to include nuclear energy into the sanctions be implemented,” the Hungarian premier said. “This is out of the question.” Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne reports that the night passed in Sumy region without any shelling. The UK’s ministry of defence has published its latest intelligence briefing on how it sees the situation in Ukraine. It casts doubt on recent Russian claims of military advances in Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk, writing: Over the last six days, Russian online commentators have claimed Russian forces have made significant advances, breaking through Ukrainian defences in two areas: in Zaporizhzhia Oblast near Orikiv, and 100km to the east, in Donetsk Oblast, near Vuhledar. Russian units have probably conducted local, probing attacks near Orikiv and Vuhledar, but it is highly unlikely that Russia has actually achieved any substantive advances. There is a realistic possibility that Russian military sources are deliberately spreading misinformation in an effort to imply that the Russian operation is sustaining momentum. The claim is presented on social media without any supporting evidence being published. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. I will be with you for the next few hours. Oleskandr Musiyenko, head of the Military and Strategic Research Centre of Ukraine, says Russia is sending in more reinforcements to block Ukrainian advances. “They are mostly sending infantry and artillery forces into battle, made up mainly of conscripts. But they do not have the level of artillery and tank support they had on Feb. 24,” Musiyenko said in an interview with Ukrainian television. “They have fewer resources. They are relying on the numerical superiority of their troops.” Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese on Friday reiterated Australian support for Ukraine and criticised supporters of Russia’s invasion after a video emerged showing Novak Djokovic’s father posing at the Australian Open with fans holding Russian flags, Reuters reports. Police questioned four fans seen with “inappropriate flags and symbols” after a quarter-final match on Wednesday between Russia’s Andrey Rublev and favourite Djokovic, organisers Tennis Australia said. “I will make this point, that Australia stands with the people of Ukraine. That is Australia’s position and Australia is unequivocal in our support for the rule of international law,” Albanese told a news conference after a reporter asked if Djokovic’s father, Srdjan, should be deported after he was seen posing for pictures with fans holding Russian flags. “We do not want to see any support given to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, that is having a devastating impact on the people of Ukraine.” Albanese did not respond directly to the question about whether Srdjan Djokovic should be deported. Djokovic’s father could not be reached for comment by Reuters. An adviser to president Zelenskiy has issued a warning to fellow Ukrainian officials which appears to be related to the ongoing drive to stamp out corruption. More than a dozen Ukrainian officials have been removed this week after a series of scandals and graft allegations. Political analysts said Zelenskiy needs to show western partners and war-weary Ukrainians that he is serious about punishing misrule. “Everyone should understand their level of responsibility to the country and nation during the war. Whoever forgets about it receives a quick reaction,” said Andriy Yermak, head of Zelenskiy’s office. “This will happen to everyone who allows themselves to forget (their duties), regardless of names and offices,” Yermak wrote on Twitter. Among the most high-profile cases was that of a deputy defence minister who resigned following a report, which he denied, that his ministry paid inflated prices to feed troops. A presidential adviser who had been called out by local media for driving flashy cars also quit, as did a senior prosecutor who Ukrainian media reported had gone on holiday to Marbella in Spain, flouting martial law. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who visited Ukraine last week, said IAEA monitors reported powerful explosions near Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Thursday and renewed calls for a security zone around the plant. But Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the head of Rosenergoatom, the company operating Russia’s nuclear plants, said the comments were unfounded and called it a “provocation”. Russia has in the past reacted to Ukrainian successes with massed airstrikes that left millions without light, heat or water. On Thursday, it appeared to follow that pattern. Prime minister Denys Shmyhal said Russia’s attacks targeted energy plants. “I held an urgent meeting today about the energy situation – about the shortages that are occurring and repair work after the terrorists’ strikes. Repair teams are working in those sites,” Zelenskiy said on Thursday. The Kremlin said it saw the promised delivery of western tanks as evidence of growing “direct involvement” of the United States and Europe in the 11-month-old war, something both deny. In his nightly address following Thursday’s deadly missile strikes across, Zelenskiy called for further sanctions on Russia and for allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons. Ukrainian civilians raced for cover on Thursday as Russia fired a barrage of missiles and drones across the country, killing at least 11 people, a day after Kyiv won pledges of battlefield tanks to combat Moscow’s invasion from western countries. Zelenskiy said: This Russian aggression can and should be stopped only with adequate weapons. The terrorist state will not understand anything else. Weapons on the battlefield. Weapons that protect our skies. New sanctions against Russia, i.e. political and economic weapons. And legal weapons - we need to work even harder to establish a tribunal for the crime of Russian aggression against Ukraine. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments as they happen. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for further sanctions on Russia and more weapons for Ukraine, after Russian strikes on Thursday left 11 dead and 11 wounded. We’ll have more from Zelenskiy’s latest address shortly. In the meantime here are the other key recent developments: Ukrainian civilians raced for cover on Thursday as Russia fired a barrage of missiles and drones across the country, killing at least 11 people, a day after Kyiv won pledges of battlefield tanks to combat Moscow’s invasion from western countries. Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych criticised the International Olympic Committee on Thursday for considering allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to return to international competitions. Russia’s finance ministry has proposed scrapping liquidity restrictions for spending on “anti-crisis” investments from its national wealth fund (NWF), citing the need to support key sectors amid challenging geopolitical conditions. The UK hopes the Challenger 2 tanks it is supplying to Ukraine will arrive in the country at the end of March, defence department minister Alex Chalk said on Thursday. Russian authorities designated the independent news outlet Meduza an “undesirable organisation” on Thursday, effectively outlawing the site from operating in Russia and banning any Russian from cooperating with Meduza or its journalists. The Ukrainian central bank’s foreign currency reserves will stand at about $30bn at the end of January, Yuri Heletiy, the deputy governor told reporters on Thursday, according to Reuters. The arrest of a high-ranking Ukrainian intelligence agent accused of spying for Russia has highlighted the urgent need for a cleanout of the country’s key security service, a former deputy head of the agency has said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/20/ukraine-launches-fresh-strike-on-russias-black-sea-fleet-headquarters","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T14:40:35Z","webTitle":"Ukraine launches fresh strike on Russia’s Black Sea fleet headquarters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/20/ukraine-launches-fresh-strike-on-russias-black-sea-fleet-headquarters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/20/ukraine-launches-fresh-strike-on-russias-black-sea-fleet-headquarters","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine launches fresh strike on Russia’s Black Sea fleet headquarters","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ukraine has launched a fresh strike on Russia’s Black Sea fleet headquarters at Sevastopol, where officials in the annexed Crimean peninsula said that at least one drone had been shot down by air defences. The reported attack on Saturday morning – a day after explosions erupted near military bases in Russian-held areas of Ukraine and Russia itself – came on the same day that 12 civilians were reportedly wounded when a Russian missile hit a residential area of a Ukrainian town. Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, said that four children were among those wounded in an attack that damaged several private houses and a five-storey residential building in Voznesensk, about 19 miles (30km) from the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant. He added that a young girl had lost an eye as a result of the attack on Saturday. While there was no apparent major damage after the reported unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attack on Sevastopol, which has not been independently verified by the Guardian, observers said it demonstrated Ukraine’s ability to strike deep behind Russian lines at prestige targets. Video shared on Twitter appeared to show Russian air defences attempting to destroy the UAV and dark plumes of smoke rising from the city. Mikhail Razvozhayev, Sevastopol’s governor, wrote on Telegram that a drone had hit the roof of the headquarters on Saturday and said there were no casualties, reports the Russian news agency Tass. “I am at the [Black Sea] fleet’s headquarters now. A drone hit the roof here 25 minutes ago. Unfortunately, it was not downed … There are no casualties,” he wrote. Later on Saturday, Crimea’s governor, Sergei Aksyonov, contradicted the earlier statement by saying on Telegram that local air defences shot down the drone above the Black Sea fleet headquarters in Sevastopol. “Air defense systems successfully hit all targets over the territory over Crimea on Saturday morning. There are no casualties or material damage,” his boss, Sergei Aksyonov, said on Telegram. Authorities in Sevastopol reported on Saturday night that the city’s air-defence systems had been called into action again in the evening. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s defence ministry on Saturday said its forces had killed a total of 44,900 Russian personnel – a rise of 200 on the day before. On Friday, the US said for the first time that it would provide Ukraine with ScanEagle surveillance drones, mine-resistant vehicles, anti-armour rounds and howitzer weapons in a new £655m aid package to help its efforts to take back Ukrainian territory. “These capabilities are carefully calibrated to make the most difference on the battlefield and strengthen Ukraine’s position at the negotiating table,” Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said. There was cautious optimism on Saturday as two more grain ships left the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk , bringing the total number to leave Ukraine’s Black Sea under a UN-brokered deal to 27. Welcoming the sailings, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said on Saturday that governments and the private sector should cooperate to bring Russian food and fertilisers as well as Ukrainian grain to world markets under the deal agreed last month. “The other part of this package deal is the unimpeded access to the global markets of Russian food and fertiliser, which are not subject to sanctions,” Guterres told a news conference in Istanbul. “It is important that all governments and the private sector cooperate to bring them to market. Wednesday will mark six months of war in the region since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While Russia has made gains in the east, it has been put on the defensive in other regions as Ukraine scales up its attacks in the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which was seized by Russia in 2014. Last week, a total of nine Russian warplanes were reported destroyed at a Crimean airbase. Russian leaders have warned that such strikes indicate an escalation in the conflict, powered by the US and Nato allies. In its latest intelligence update on the conflict, Britain’s Ministry of Defence (MOD) said last week that it saw “only minimal changes in territorial control along the frontline”. In Donbas, it said Russian forces have approached the outskirts of Bakhmut, but have not broken into the city. In the south-west, it reported that neither Ukrainian or Russian forces had made advances on the frontline in occupied Kherson, but added: “Increasingly frequent explosions behind Russian lines are probably stressing Russian logistics and air basing in the south.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-joe-biden-urges-vladimir-putin-not-to-use-tactical-nuclear-weapons-after-setbacks-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-18T21:02:11Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: medics killed by Russian strike during evacuation of hospital, says Kharkiv governor – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-joe-biden-urges-vladimir-putin-not-to-use-tactical-nuclear-weapons-after-setbacks-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-joe-biden-urges-vladimir-putin-not-to-use-tactical-nuclear-weapons-after-setbacks-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: medics killed by Russian strike during evacuation of hospital, says Kharkiv governor – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s 11pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. “They’re not willing to scrap it,” one soldier said, recalling artillery with shrapnel damage and sometimes completely worn out from firing round after round against Russian troops, Reuters reports. The Ukrainian military said that Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. According to a Ukrainian military official who spoke to the New York Times, remnants of the Shahed-136 attack drones have been discovered on the ground during the counteroffensive that Ukraine launched in the northeastern regions of the country this month. The Ukrainian military has carried out 20 airstrikes in the last 24 hours against Russian strongholds, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Kyiv Independent reported on Sunday that Ukraine’s Air Force has successfully targeted 15 Russian strongholds and four sites, as well as seven control points. Georgian president Salome Zourabichvili levied heavy criticism against Russia on Sunday after the discovery of mass graves in Izium earlier this week. Zourabichvili condemned “in the strongest terms the atrocities committed by Russia in Izium,” adding that “these war crimes must be answered by justice,” the Kyiv Independent reports. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Sunday that the mass graves discovered in Ukraine was evidence of Russia’s war crimes in the country. “Obviously the UK and Canada have been two of the strongest countries in standing up in support of Ukraine and pushing back against Russia’s illegal actions,” Trudeau told reporters in London where he will be attending the funeral of Queen Elizabeth. Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. Reuters reports: Some members of a roughly 50-member repair team showed reporters images of damaged U.S.-provided arms, including M777 howitzers, that in the West would have long been considered beyond the scope of repair. Not in Ukraine. “They’re not willing to scrap it,” one soldier said, recalling artillery with shrapnel damage and sometimes completely worn out from firing round after round against Russian troops. But Ukrainians are managing to bring these weapons back into battle, thanks to guidance from U.S. forces and manufacturing prowess by Kyiv allowing it to reverse-engineer spare parts. Since the program began in June, more than a dozen teleconference channels have been set up with over 100 Ukrainian contacts. But priority support is being given to the M777s and to the high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), which have been central to Ukraine’s counter-offensive nearly seven months since Russian forces invaded. “Combat power for Ukraine is staying at the level it is because of America’s investment in the sustainment,” the soldier said. The Ukrainian military said that Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. According to a Ukrainian military official who spoke to the New York Times, remnants of the Shahed-136 attack drones have been discovered on the ground during the counteroffensive that Ukraine launched in the northeastern regions of the country this month. The weapon is a “kamikaze drone carrying a warhead of about 80 pounds” that can be launched from the back of a flatbed truck, the New York Times explained. According to Colonel Rodion Kulagin, the commander of artillery operations in the Kharkiv operations, the drone drops out from the sky without any warning. “It blew the triple-seven in half,” he told the Times, referring to the drone destroying an M777 howitzer supplied by the US to the Ukrainian military. “Instead of firing 100 artillery shells, it’s easier to release one of these drones” to search for a target, he added. The New York Times also reported Kulagin explaining that the drone is accurate enough to target a self-propelled howitzer in an area close to the turret where gunpowder stored. This in turn creates secondary explosions. “It’s a very serious problem,” he said, adding that without any countermeasures, the drones “will destroy all our military.” The Ukrainian military has carried out 20 airstrikes in the last 24 hours against Russian strongholds, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Kyiv Independent reported on Sunday that Ukraine’s Air Force has successfully targeted 15 Russian strongholds and four sites, as well as seven control points.

Zourabichvili condemned “in the strongest terms the atrocities committed by Russia in Izium,” adding that “these war crimes must be answered by justice,” the Kyiv Independent reports. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Sunday that the mass graves discovered in Ukraine was evidence of Russia’s war crimes in the country. “Obviously the UK and Canada have been two of the strongest countries in standing up in support of Ukraine and pushing back against Russia’s illegal actions,” Trudeau told reporters in London where he will be attending the funeral of Queen Elizabeth. “Those actions “increasingly, clearly include war crimes, include absolutely unacceptable crimes, whether we think of what we found in Bucha or the discovery of mass graves in the reclaimed territories by Ukraine,” he added. “There needs to be a proper investigation and transparency and Vladimir Putin, his supporters and the Russian military need to be held to account for the atrocities they have and are continuing to commit in Ukraine.” The first lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, paid her respects to the Queen lying in state at Westminster Hall on Sunday, before a reception with the Princess of Wales at Buckingham Palace. The top US general has cautioned that it is still unclear how Russia might react to the latest battlefield setbacks in Ukraine, calling for vigilance among US troops during a visit to a military base in Poland aiding Ukraine’s war effort. “The war is not going too well for Russia right now. So it’s incumbent upon all of us to maintain high states of readiness, alert,” US army general Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Warsaw following a visit to a base hosting US troops. Reuters was asked not to publish the name of the base or describe its location. Milley said he was not suggesting US troops in Europe were at any increased threat, but said they had to be ready. “In the conduct of war, you just don’t know with a high degree of certainty what will happen next.” Policy research organisation the Institute for the Study of War has published data suggesting Ukrainian forces are expanding positions east of the Oskil River and north of the Siverskyi Donets River that could allow them to envelop Russian troops holding the city of Lyman. They say: “The Russian defenders in Lyman still appear to consist in large part of Bars (Russian Combat Army Reserve) reservists and the remnants of units badly damaged in the Kharkiv oblast counteroffensive, and the Russians do not appear to be directing reinforcements to this area.” Jack Watling, a senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute, has written an analysis piece for the Guardian on Russia’s underperforming military capability, and why it could lead to its downfall. “Russia’s military was designed to fight short, high-intensity wars. Without full national mobilisation, it is too small, its units lack the logistical enablement and its equipment is ill-suited to a protracted war. When the Russian military issued orders to its troops in the autumn of 2021, it estimated a need for them to be deployed for nine months. They are now reaching that limit. The Ukrainians, by contrast, have been organising their military since 2014 for precisely this kind of war.” Our reporters Shaun Walker and Pjotr Sauer have spoken to Ukrainian teachers resisting occupation, who say there is “no way” they could work for the Russians. “We have neither a moral nor legal right to demand heroism from people living under occupation. Their main goals should be to save lives and not voluntarily collaborate,” said Ukraine’s education ombudsman. Others want to see all who collaborated punished. It is 6pm in Kyiv. Here is everything you might have missed: Four medics have been killed and two patients injured after Russian forces fired at a psychiatric hospital in the village of Strelechya, the governor of the Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, has said. The facility was in the process of being evacuated and medical staff were removing patients from the hospital while under heavy fire, Syniehubov said. He added on Telegram: “During the evacuation, the Russians started a massive shelling. According to preliminary data, unfortunately, 4 medical workers died, 2 patients were injured.” Vladimir Putin is “failing on all of his military strategic objectives”, the chief of the defence staff has said. Adm Sir Tony Radakin said the conflict was likely to “grind on for a long time”, despite recent successes by Ukrainian military forces. Asked about the situation in Ukraine, he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: “At the very outset, we said that this was a strategic error by President Putin and strategic errors lead to strategic consequences. And in this instance, it’s strategic failure. Putin is failing on all of his military strategic objectives. He wanted to subjugate Ukraine, that’s not going to happen.” Russia has reacted to its military setbacks in the past week by increasing its missile attacks on civilian infrastructure even if they do not have any military impact, according to the latest intelligence report from the British Ministry of Defence. It says in a post on Twitter that the move is intended to destroy the morale of the Ukrainian people. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of provoking fighting in Kherson after a video showed clashes in the centre of the occupied Ukrainian city on Saturday evening. The Ukrainian army is leading a counter-offensive to retake the southern city, which was seized by the Russian army in the first weeks of the invasion. Russian official media Vesti-Crimea broadcast a video on Saturday evening showing an exchange of fire around two armoured vehicles near Kherson train station. Prosecutors in an area of Ukraine where Russian forces recently retreated in the face of a Ukrainian counter-offensive are accusing Russia of torturing civilians in one freed village. Prosecutors in the Kharkiv region said, in an online statement, that they had found a basement where Russian forces allegedly tortured prisoners in the village of Kozacha Lopan, near the border with Russia, Associated Press reports. They released images showing a Russian military TA-57 telephone with additional wires and alligator clips attached to it. Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of using the Soviet-era radio telephones as a power source to electrocute prisoners during interrogation. Beloved Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has posted a message on her Instagram account asking the country’s justice ministry to list her as a foreign agent alongside her husband, Maxim Galkin. The post called for an end to “the deaths of our boys for illusory aims that make our country a pariah and weigh down the lives of its citizens”. Pugacheva’s message comes a day after Galkin – a comedian who has repeatedly spoken out against the war with Ukraine – was designated a foreign agent by Russia for political activities. Russia’s ministry of justice says that his source of foreign funding is from Ukraine. The US president, Joe Biden, urged his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, not to use tactical nuclear or chemical weapons in the wake of setbacks in Ukraine. Asked by CBS what he would say to Putin if he was considering using such weapons, Biden said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. It would change the face of war unlike anything since world war two.” Biden said the US response would be “consequential”, but declined to give detail. A total of 165 ships with 3.7 m tonnes of agricultural products onboard have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian infrastructure ministry has said. The ministry said 10 ships with 169,300 tonnes of agricultural products were due to leave Ukrainian Black Sea ports, reports Reuters. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a global food crisis aggravated by the war will be the focus of world leaders when they convene at the United Nations in New York this week. “It would be naive to think that we are close to the possibility of a peace deal,” said the UN secretary general, António Guterres, before the high-level meeting of the 193-member UN general assembly, which starts on Tuesday. “The chances of a peace deal are minimal, at the present moment.” The Czech Republic, which currently holds the EU presidency, has called for a “special international tribunal” after a mass grave was discovered in Izium, a town in north-eastern Ukraine. “In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent,” said Jan Lipavský, the foreign minister of the Czech Republic. Ukrainian officials have discovered more than 440 bodies, some found with their hands tied behind their backs. Satellite imagery has emerged of the recently discovered mass grave site near Izium. The images, taken from March to August this year and released by Maxar Technologies, show the entrance to the “forest cemetery” where many bodies have been discovered. One of the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant’s four main power lines has been repaired and is supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid two weeks after it went down, the UN nuclear watchdog has said. Even though the six reactors at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, have been shut down, the plant needs electricity to keep them cool. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, told Putin on Saturday that “today’s time is not a time for war” when the pair met during a regional Asia summit in Uzbekistan. Putin told Modi he knew of India’s “concerns” about the conflict, echoing language he had used with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, the day before. “We will do our best to end this as soon as possible,” Putin said, while accusing Kyiv of rejecting negotiations. Speaking to reporters later, Putin vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces targeted facilities in Russia. Putin said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. “We aren’t in a rush,” he said, after the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting in Samarkand. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told leaders at the summit that efforts were being made “to finalise the conflict in Ukraine through diplomacy as soon as possible”. Putin told Erdoğan, who has been a key broker in limited deals between Russia and Ukraine, that Moscow was keen to build closer ties with Turkey and was ready to “significantly increase” all exports to the country. The security service of Ukraine said Russia’s federal security service (FSU) officers tortured residents in Kupiansk, a city in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. The Kyiv Independent reports that when FSU officers were in then occupied Kupiansk, they tortured residents and threatened to send them to minefields and kill their families. Critical Threats and the Institute for the Study of War have created an interactive map that shows the progress Ukrainian military forces have made in taking back Russian-occupied territory. Peter Pomerantsev is an author and senior visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and writes for us today to argue that Despite his defeats, Putin still shapes our perceptions. Let’s fight him at his own game: The Ukrainians have (again) done what nobody believed they could. They have (again) defeated the supposedly mighty Russia on the battlefield, shown up the underlying incompetence and moral rot of the Putin system. It took them just six days to take back whole swaths of territory in north-eastern Ukraine that it took Russia six months to conquer. The Russian military, political and propaganda elites are all blaming each other: rifts that usually rumble under the surface are now visible to all. Putin looks shaken. Now it’s time for us to act as well. Not just by increasing help to Ukraine on the battlefield (which is paramount), but also by advancing along the other fronts in this conflict: energy, information, finance and diplomacy. Read more: Despite his defeats, Putin still shapes our perceptions. Let’s fight him at his own game Our colleague Luke Harding reports from Izium: Standing in the gloom, Maksim Maksimov pointed to the spot where he was tortured with electric shocks. Russian soldiers took him from his cell in the basement of Izium’s police station. They sat him on an office chair and attached a zig-zag crocodile clip to his finger. It was connected by cable to an old-fashioned Soviet military field telephone. And then it began. A soldier cranked the handle, turning it faster and faster. This sent an excruciating pulse through Maksimov’s body. “I collapsed. They pulled me upright. There was a hood on my head. I couldn’t see anything. My legs went numb. I was unable to hear in my left ear,” he recalled. “Then they did it again. I passed out. I came round 40 minutes later back in my cell.” Read more here: Izium: after Russian retreat, horrors of Russian occupation are revealed Beloved Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has posted a message on her Instagram account asking the country’s justice ministry to list her as a foreign agent alongside her husband, Maxim Galkin.

Our colleague Josh Butler reports: Australia won’t ban Russian tourists from entering the country as requested by Ukraine’s ambassador but is “assessing” whether to reopen the Australian embassy in Kyiv. The acting prime minister, Richard Marles, also said on Sunday that Australia was considering sending further military aid to Ukraine to bolster existing commitments. “We do need to be preparing ourselves for protracted conflict and on that basis, we get that we are going to need to provide support for Ukraine over the long term,” Marles told the ABC’s Insiders program. Read more here: Australia won’t ban Russian tourists but is considering reopening embassy in Kyiv These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. The BBC’s James Waterhouse has shared a video on Twitter of the final ovation, at the Kyiv Opera House, for ballet dancer Oleksandr Shapoval. He had performed for 28 seasons before volunteering to fight in the east. Waterhouse points out: “While Ukraine enjoys successes on the battlefield, his death is a reminder of the enduring, awful cost of this war.” Associated Press is reporting that Russian shelling hit cities and towns across a wide stretch of Ukraine during the night. The British Ministry of Defence has warned that Russia is likely to increase its attacks on civilian targets as it suffers battlefield defeats. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of provoking fighting in Kherson after a video showed clashes in the centre of the occupied Ukrainian city on Saturday evening. The Ukrainian army is leading a counter-offensive to retake the southern city, which was seized by the Russian army in the first weeks of the invasion. Russian official media Vesti-Crimea broadcast a video on Saturday evening showing an exchange of fire around two armoured vehicles near Kherson train station. The Russian-installed administration of Kherson said later in the day it had “destroyed” a group of attackers. “There was a clash in the centre of Kherson between sections of the Russian armed forces patrolling the streets of the city and an unidentified group of people,” the administration said on Telegram. On Sunday morning, the Ukrainian southern army command spokeswoman Natalia Gumeniuk said: “Yesterday’s shootings and explosions in Kherson are provocations by the occupiers.” The Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak blamed the shootings on “growing tensions” between different pro-Moscow factions preparing to flee amid news of the Ukrainian army’s advances. Kirill Stremousov, a pro-Moscow official in Kherson, said the city was “calm” on Sunday morning. Kyiv was “trying to attack but without any results”, he said. “We won’t say that everything is smooth and there is no problem in the Kherson region ... [but] everything will be fine.” There have been a series of targeted attacks against pro-Russian officials in Kherson and in other occupied areas in recent weeks. In Diary of an Invasion, the Ukrainian novelist Andrey Kurkov has documented Russia’s attack on his homeland. This morning, the Observer published extracts in which Kurkov recounts the first weeks of the conflict. “You have to get used psychologically to the idea that war has begun. Because from that moment on, war determines your way of life, your way of thinking, your way of making decisions.” Jack Watling, a senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute, writes for us that Russia’s underperforming military capability may be key to its downfall: Viewed purely in terms of the size of their formations and equipment, Russian ground forces in Ukraine still pose a serious threat on a number of axes. In practice, however, it is highly unlikely the Russian military can recover from its increasingly terminal trajectory on the battlefield, though its defeat will take time and bitter fighting. To understand why, it is necessary to examine the force beyond its equipment and personnel. The US assesses military capability through the abbreviation DOTMLPF. That senior US officers regularly try to roll this off the tongue as an acronym may exemplify military absurdity, but the abbreviation is somewhat redeemed by being fairly comprehensive. It stands for: doctrine, organisation, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities. Looking at the Russian military across these categories reveals why it is underperforming its potential and struggling to regenerate. Read more analysis from Jack Watling: Russia’s underperforming military capability may be key to its downfall Four medics have been killed and two patients injured after Russian forces fired at a psychiatric hospital in the village of Strelechya, the governor of the Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, has said. The facility was in the process of being evacuated and medical staff were removing patients from the hospital while under heavy fire, Syniehubov said. He added on Telegram: During the evacuation, the Russians started a massive shelling. According to preliminary data, unfortunately, 4 medical workers died, 2 patients were injured. The report could not be independently verified. In case you missed it, Ukrainian authorities said on Friday they have found a mass burial site of more than 440 bodies in the eastern city of Izium that was recaptured from Russian forces. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has likened the discovery to what had happened in Bucha, saying: “Russia leaves death everywhere, and must be responsible for it.” Russia has repeatedly denied it targets civilians or has committed war crimes It is 1pm in Kyiv. Here is what you might have missed: Vladimir Putin is “failing on all of his military strategic objectives”, the chief of the defence staff has said. Adm Sir Tony Radakin said the conflict was likely to “grind on for a long time”, despite recent successes by Ukrainian military forces. Asked about the situation in Ukraine, he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: “At the very outset, we said that this was a strategic error by President Putin and strategic errors lead to strategic consequences. And in this instance, it’s strategic failure. Putin is failing on all of his military strategic objectives. He wanted to subjugate Ukraine, that’s not going to happen.” Russia has reacted to its military setbacks in the past week by increasing its missile attacks on civilian infrastructure even if they do not have any military impact, according to the latest intelligence report from the British Ministry of Defence. It says in a post on Twitter that the move is intended to destroy the morale of the Ukrainian people. The US president, Joe Biden, urged his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, not to use tactical nuclear or chemical weapons in the wake of setbacks in Ukraine. Asked by CBS what he would say to Putin if he was considering using such weapons, Biden said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. It would change the face of war unlike anything since world war two.” Biden said the US response would be “consequential”, but declined to give detail. A total of 165 ships with 3.7 m tonnes of agricultural products onboard have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian infrastructure ministry has said. The ministry said 10 ships with 169,300 tonnes of agricultural products were due to leave Ukrainian Black Sea ports, reports Reuters. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a global food crisis aggravated by the war will be the focus of world leaders when they convene at the United Nations in New York this week. “It would be naive to think that we are close to the possibility of a peace deal,” said the UN secretary general, António Guterres, before the high-level meeting of the 193-member UN general assembly, which starts on Tuesday. “The chances of a peace deal are minimal, at the present moment.” The Czech Republic, which currently holds the EU presidency, has called for a “special international tribunal” after a mass grave was discovered in Izium, a town in north-eastern Ukraine. “In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent,” said Jan Lipavský, the foreign minister of the Czech Republic. Ukrainian officials have discovered more than 440 bodies, some found with their hands tied behind their backs. Satellite imagery has emerged of the recently discovered mass grave site near Izium. The images, taken from March to August this year and released by Maxar Technologies, show the entrance to the “forest cemetery” where many bodies have been discovered. One of the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant’s four main power lines has been repaired and is supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid two weeks after it went down, the UN nuclear watchdog has said. Even though the six reactors at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, have been shut down, the plant needs electricity to keep them cool. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, told Putin on Saturday that “today’s time is not a time for war” when the pair met during a regional Asia summit in Uzbekistan. Putin told Modi he knew of India’s “concerns” about the conflict, echoing language he had used with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, the day before. “We will do our best to end this as soon as possible,” Putin said, while accusing Kyiv of rejecting negotiations. Speaking to reporters later, Putin vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces targeted facilities in Russia. Putin said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. “We aren’t in a rush,” he said, after the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting in Samarkand. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told leaders at the summit that efforts were being made “to finalise the conflict in Ukraine through diplomacy as soon as possible”. Putin told Erdoğan, who has been a key broker in limited deals between Russia and Ukraine, that Moscow was keen to build closer ties with Turkey and was ready to “significantly increase” all exports to the country. The security service of Ukraine said Russia’s federal security service (FSU) officers tortured residents in Kupiansk, a city in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. The Kyiv Independent reports that when FSU officers were in then occupied Kupiansk, they tortured residents and threatened to send them to minefields and kill their families. Vladimir Putin is “failing on all of his military strategic objectives”, the chief of the defence staff has said. Adm Sir Tony Radakin said the conflict is likely to “grind on for a long time”, despite recent successes by Ukrainian military forces. Asked about the situation in Ukraine, he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: At the very outset, we said that this was a strategic error by President Putin and strategic errors lead to strategic consequences. And in this instance, it’s strategic failure. Putin is failing on all of his military strategic objectives. He wanted to subjugate Ukraine, that’s not going to happen. He wanted to take control of the capital, we saw that that was defeated earlier on. We saw that he wanted to weaken Nato. Nato is now much stronger, and we have Finland and Sweden joining. He wants to break the international resolve. Well, actually that strengthened over this period, and he’s under pressure, his problems are mounting. He added: He’s always had a problem in terms of crewing the equipment that he’s got. He hasn’t got sufficient manpower. His forces are thin on the ground. And we’re also seeing a magnificent Ukrainian armed forces who have been courageous, they’re fighting for their country, and they’ve embraced the international support that all of us are providing. A total of 165 ships with 3.7m tonnes of agricultural products onboard have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian infrastructure ministry said today. The ministry said 10 ships with 169,300 tonnes of agricultural products are due to leave Ukrainian Black Sea ports, reports Reuters. The ministry said in a statement: At 10am, eight ships left the ports of Great Odesa, and two more are waiting for their turn and favourable conditions. Ukraine’s grain exports slumped after Russia invaded the country and blockaded its Black Sea ports, driving up global food prices and prompting fears of shortages in Africa and the Middle East. Ukraine, a major global grain producer and exporter, shipped up to 6m tonnes of grain a month before the war. Three Black Sea ports were reopened under an agreement signed on 22 July by Moscow and Kyiv and the ministry has said these ports are able to load and send abroad 100-150 cargo ships a month. Reuters reports that Russian Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev will hold security consultations and meetings during a two-day visit to China starting Sunday, China’s foreign ministry said. Patrushev will attend the 17th round of China’s Russia strategic security consultations and the 7th meeting of the China-Russia law enforcement security cooperation during his visit, the foreign ministry said in a statement released on its website on Sunday. The meetings come after Chinese president Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held face-to-face talks in Uzbekistan on Thursday, their first since the outbreak of the Ukraine war. Our colleague Andrew Roth reports from Belgorod: The war has become impossible to ignore in Belgorod, southern Russia, just miles from the border with Ukraine. Russian soldiers retreating from the Ukrainian counterattack now roam the streets. Air defences boom out overhead several times a day. The city is once again filled with refugees. And, at the border, Russian and Ukrainian soldiers stand within sight of each other. Three Russian soldiers from Ossetia are wandering the unfamiliar streets past the grand Transfiguration Cathedral late one evening. They seem unsteady on their feet, perhaps drunk or tired. And they’re looking for a place to eat. Since February, they say, they have fought in Ukraine as part of the invasion force. They were stationed in the village of Velyki Prokhody, just north of Kharkiv, when the urgent signal came to flee back to Russia last week. Read more: ‘They won’t invade, will they?’ Fears rise in Russian city that Ukraine war could cross border Australia will not ban Russian tourists from entering the country as part of sanctions on Russia over the war in Ukraine, defence minister Richard Marles said today. Since the start of the conflict, Australia has sanctioned hundreds of Russian individuals and entities, Reuters reports. It has also supplied defence equipment and humanitarian supplies to Ukraine, while outlawing exports of alumina and aluminium ores, including bauxite, to Russia. Asked if Australia would also ban Russian tourists, Marles said sanctions were aimed at Russia’s government, “not the Russian people themselves.” He told ABC television: This is not something we are considering at the moment. Marles refused to be drawn on whether Australia would provide more Bushmasters and other protected vehicles to Ukraine after a recent request from the Ukrainian ambassador to Australia. Australia in July pledged 60 Bushmasters and 28 M113AS4 Armoured Vehicles to Ukraine. US president Joe Biden urged Russian president Vladimir Putin not to use tactical nuclear or chemical weapons in the wake of setbacks in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Asked by CBS what he would say to Putin if he was considering using such weapons, Biden said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. It would change the face of war unlike anything since world war two.” Biden said the US response would be “consequential,” but declined to give detail. Russia “would become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been,” Biden said. “Depending on the extent of what they do will determine what response would occur.” Russian government officials have dismissed Western suggestions that Moscow would use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, but it remains a worry for some in the west. And if you want to read more about this issue, our columnist Simon Tisdall has been thinking about it too: Russia has reacted to its military setbacks in the past week by increasing its missile attacks on civilian infrastructure even if it does not have any military impact, according to the latest intelligence report from the British Ministry of Defence. It says in a post on Twitter that the move is intended to destroy the morale of the Ukrainian people. Russia has launched several thousand long-range missiles against Ukraine since 24 February 2022. However, in the last seven days, Russia has increased its targeting of civilian infrastructure even where it probably perceives no immediate military effect. This category of mission has included strikes against the electricity grid, and a dam on the Inhulets River at Kryvyi Rih. As it faces setbacks on the front lines, Russia has likely extended the locations it is prepared to strike in an attempt to directly undermine the morale of the Ukrainian people and government. Welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be with you for the next hour or so. The main developments you need to know about are here: US president Joe Biden urged Russian president Vladimir Putin to not use tactical nuclear or chemical weapons in the wake of setbacks in Ukraine.

Catch up with the must-read news and analysis","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. The battle for Bakhmut rages as death toll rises Ukrainian authorities insisted they would continue to try to hold the eastern city of Bakhmut, in what has become one of the longest and bloodiest battles since the war began. Despite continuing rumours that a Ukrainian retreat is imminent, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy instructed the army to bolster the defence of the city, even as the death toll rises. Isobel Koshiw and Pjotr Sauer reported that Ukraine was suffering an estimated 100-200 casualties a day. Andriy, a deputy commander in the Donetsk region whose battalion is fighting in the Bakhmut area, told them that “positions are ready [for them] to retreat to. The reason they are still there is more of a political thing.” On the other side, a Moscow-based analyst with links to Russia’s ministry of defence estimated that 6,000-8,000 Russian troops had been killed, predominantly recently recruited convicts. However, the analyst noted it was very difficult to be precise because the “brunt” of the fighting was being carried out by Wagner mercenary forces. “Wagner doesn’t always retrieve the bodies of its fighters, while many of the former convicts fighting are not properly registered,” he said, on condition of anonymity. Despite the brutal conflict, many civilians remain in Bakhmut. Peter Beaumont met a police major who was attempting to persuade those caring for children to let them be evacuated. It is a search that has led to rumours that police are taking children from parents who refuse to leave, which has prompted some families to hide their sons and daughters, inexplicable as that might seem. “But it’s not correct,” the officer said. “The law says we can only take children with permission of the parents. If the children don’t have parents but have a guardian, we can get permission from social services to take them out.” Ukraine said on Tuesday that about 4,000 civilians had been killed in Bakhmut during Russia’s assault. Russia launches largest missile barrage in weeks At least nine people were reported killed on Thursday after Russia unleashed its largest missile bombardment against Ukraine in three weeks. Critical infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions across the country were hit. At least six of the dead were killed in a strike on a residential area in the western Lviv region, 700km from the frontline, Ukrainian emergency services said. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Six hypersonic missiles, able to evade air defences, were among those launched. Lorenzo Tondo in Kyiv reported that the attacks also briefly disconnected the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe’s biggest – from the grid. The UN’s nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the plant’s safety and security. Pro-Ukraine group may have sabotaged Nord Stream European and US intelligence officials obtained tentative intelligence to suggest a pro-Ukrainian saboteur group may have been behind the bombing of the Nord Stream gas pipelines last year, according to reports in the New York Times and German newspaper Die Zeit. German investigators believe the attack on the pipelines was carried out by a team of six people, using a yacht that had been hired by a company registered in Poland and owned by two Ukrainian citizens, according to Die Zeit. Dan Sabbagh, Philip Oltermann and Lorenzo Tondo reported that the information was shared between European intelligence agencies in an effort to establish more information about those who carried out the undersea bombings in September, an attack that had left western governments perplexed. Details about the intelligence remains sketchy and it is unclear what confidence the US intelligence community places in the theory, as well as who may have organised, funded and directed such a daring attack on the gas pipelines running between Russia and Germany. But it is suggested that the government of Kyiv did not direct the underwater strike. An unarmed PoW was allegedly shot dead by Russians Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed to “find the murderers” of an unarmed Ukrainian prisoner of war apparently shot dead by Russian troops in footage that spread rapidly across social media on Monday. In the graphic 12-second clip that first circulated on Telegram and was widely shared on Twitter, a detained combatant, named by the Ukrainian military as Tymofiy Mykolayovych Shadura, is seen standing in a shallow trench smoking a cigarette. The soldier, in uniform with a Ukrainian flag insignia on his arm, says “Glory to Ukraine” and is then apparently shot with automatic weapons. Lorenzo Tondo and Pjotr Sauer reported this story. Ukraine urged the international criminal court to investigate the footage. ‘Foreign agent’ law stirs anti-Russian sentiment in Georgia After two nights of widespread, violent protests, Georgia’s ruling party withdrew a draft law that had drawn comparisons with a 2012 law in Russia that has since been used to crack down on dissent and suppress western-funded NGOs and media. Pjotr Sauer reported that the proposed “foreign agent” bill faced criticism that it would limit press freedom and undercut the country’s efforts to become a candidate for European Union membership. Across two nights hundreds of police, many carrying riot shields, used water cannon and teargas in clashes in Georgia’s capital. More than 100 protesters were arrested during this week’s protests. Thousands had marched in the streets to rally against the proposed law that would require any organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from overseas to register as “foreign agents” or face substantial fines. Speaking on Wednesday evening as the protests were continuing, Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for “democratic success” in Georgia and voiced gratitude for Georgian support for Ukraine. “There is no Ukrainian who would not wish success to our friendly Georgia. Democratic success. European success,” he said. Rightwing Republicans rail against US aid for Ukraine Marjorie Taylor Greene, an influential far-right Republican in the US Congress, called for the US to stop aid to Ukraine, David Smith wrote, giving added voice to a grassroots revolt in the party that threatens bipartisan support for the war against Russia. The Georgia congresswoman is a notorious provocateur who has made racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic statements and promoted bizarre conspiracy theories. Yet she has emerged as a prominent voice in the House of Representatives after forging a bond with the speaker, Kevin McCarthy, who vowed that Republicans will not write a “blank cheque” for Ukraine. Pentagon accused of blocking effort to hand Russia war crimes evidence to ICC The Pentagon was accused of blocking the sharing of US intelligence with the international criminal court (ICC) about Russian war crimes in Ukraine, Julian Borger reported. The Biden White House and the state department have been a proponent of cooperation with the Hague-based ICC as a means of holding Russian forces accountable for widespread war crimes, but the defence department is firmly opposed on the grounds that the precedent could eventually be turned against US soldiers. Meanwhile, the top US intelligence official said Washington did not believe the Russian military could recover from its losses in Ukraine to make territorial gains there this year, but she warned that Vladimir Putin still believed time was on his side. The assessment, presented by the director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, at a Senate hearing on Wednesday morning, was noncommittal on whether Ukraine could take back significant amounts of occupied land in its planned counter-offensive this spring. War prompts Ukrainians to embrace their language Until last year Kyiv was largely a Russian-speaking city. A survey in January revealed that since Putin’s invasion a year ago, 33% of Kyivans have adopted the Ukrainian language. About 46% said they had been speaking Ukrainian for a long time. Another 13% remain Russian speakers, Luke Harding reported. Ukrainians are bilingual. Ukrainian has traditionally been spoken in the west of the country, with Russian more prevalent in the south and east. The most prominent switcher is Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who grew up in the central Russophone metallurgical city of Kryvyi Rih. As president, Zelenskiy addresses his citizens and foreign parliaments in Ukrainian or English. He speaks Russian only when urging Russian soldiers to surrender, or when pointing out Putin’s actions to Russian citizens, whose understanding of the war shaped by state TV bears little resemblance to reality. Kremlin critic Ilya Yashin speaks out from Russian prison Writing from a cell in a Russian jail known as the Bear, Ilya Yashin remained as defiant as ever, Andrew Roth reported from Moscow. In neat, blue-ink lettering, the opposition politician was able to express himself candidly despite his incarceration. Removing Vladimir Putin from power, he wrote, was a prerequisite to “avoiding the risks of a new world war”. “As long as Putin retains power, war, or at least the threat of war, will be permanent,” Yashin said in written answers to questions from the Guardian, delivered by his lawyers this week. “This man has gone mad from unlimited power and impunity, he has become a slave to his maniacal ambitions.” Yashin was sentenced last year to eight-and-a-half years in prison for a broadcast on his popular YouTube channel in which he accused the Russian army of a massacre of civilians in Bucha."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/14/labour-would-create-anti-opec-alliance-for-renewable-energy-says-miliband","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-14T06:00:33Z","webTitle":"Labour would create ‘anti-Opec’ alliance for renewable energy, says Miliband","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/14/labour-would-create-anti-opec-alliance-for-renewable-energy-says-miliband","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/14/labour-would-create-anti-opec-alliance-for-renewable-energy-says-miliband","fields":{"headline":"Labour would create ‘anti-Opec’ alliance for renewable energy, says Miliband","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The UK under a Labour government would form an “anti-Opec” alliance of countries dedicated to renewable energy, to bring down energy prices and promote clean technology, the shadow climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, has said. A clean power alliance would enable countries to cooperate to source components more cheaply, boost the expansion of wind, solar and other forms of low-carbon power, and potentially to share or export electricity across connected grids. Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Costa Rica and Kenya are potential partners, and Miliband will be drumming up further support at the Cop27 UN climate summit, which he is visiting for several days. Labour is committed to 100% low-carbon electricity by 2030. “This potential clean power alliance is like an anti-Opec,” said Miliband, referring to the group of oil-producing countries. “I say anti-Opec because Opec is a cartel, a group of countries that works together to keep prices high. This would be a way in which countries join together to be the vanguard and say, ‘We’re going to deliver on clean power and it will help to cut prices, not just for us but for others’.” He said the plunge in the price of renewable energy over the last decade was “the biggest source of optimism we should all have” about the climate crisis. “It is now cheaper to save the planet than to destroy it,” Miliband said in an interview with the Guardian at Cop27. “That is a message we should be shouting from the rooftops, because the implications of that message are profound.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has vowed to lift the current ban on onshore windfarms, which offer the cheapest form of renewable energy. Changes to the planning system under David Cameron have in effect prevented any new onshore windfarms being built in England since 2015. Labour would also stop granting new oil and gas licences in the North Sea. The Conservative government is planning to grant more than 100 such development and exploration licences. Miliband stopped short of pledging to revoke any licences granted, but pointed out that companies with exploration licences need further licences to develop fields, which Labour would not grant. He also wants three new nuclear power stations, in line with advice from the Committee on Climate Change. Generating power from biomass – burning trees – would have to be “carefully looked at”, he promised, to ensure that it was environmentally sustainable, and economically viable. Miliband, who attended Cops as secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2008 to 2010, accused the government of behaving as “climate chameleons”. He pointed out that, since hosting th lauded Cop26 climate summit, where nations agreed to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the government had returned – briefly – to fracking, mooted a new coalmine, granted new oil and gas licences, given tax breaks to fossil fuels, kept the ban on onshore wind, slashed aid to poor countries, failed on insulation and then snubbed Cop27, until Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, U-turned and came for a day. Alok Sharma, the cabinet minister who presided over Cop26, had done “an important and creditable job”, Miliband said. “I’m an admirer of Sharma, but he’s been undermined by a government that has been saying to people, ‘do as we say not as we do’. And that’s a big problem.” The UK had lost standing on the international stage as a result, he added. “The problem is, the government has made promises and then broken its promises, and that isn’t a good basis of trust.” Sunak’s original decision to snub the Cop27 summit, and to prevent King Charles from attending, had been “extraordinary” and “embarrassing”, said Miliband. “You don’t need to be a climate nerd to work out that Cop26 was a big deal and we hosted Cop26, and therefore Cop27, where we were handing over the presidency, is also a big deal,” he said. “And if [more than] 90 world leaders are going, you know you should probably be there.” He said Sunak “just doesn’t get this agenda. He doesn’t get that it’s the future, that this is the future of our economy … He’s at the margins. He sent a message internationally – regrettably – and domestically, with that original decision, which is ‘This isn’t my thing’.” Starmer had shown that Labour would lead on the climate and green jobs, as the central plank of the party’s vision of the future, he added. As well as targeting 100% renewables by 2030, the party would set up a national publicly owned energy company, GB Energy, and a wealth fund to invest in green technology and green jobs. “It’s at the centre of our agenda, because it’s the future of jobs, the future of the economy, lower bills, energy security and it’s the biggest issue we face as a country and a world,” Miliband said. Voices within the Tory party have raised doubts over net zero, he noted. “That means you’re saying, we want to carry on with more, dirty, expensive fossil fuels for our energy system, not greener cheaper renewable power,” he said. “That’s not a winning position. Anti-net zero is a very defeatable position.” For “the vast majority of people”, the climate was a “significant issue”, he said. “What they want to know is can this be done in a way that makes economic sense for us, particularly when people are facing a cost of living crisis, and the overwhelming answer is yes,” he said. Labour’s plan for clean power by 2030 would cut bills by £93bn, according to the party’s analysis, through measures including energy efficiency and home insulation programmes, boosting renewable power include more onshore windfarms, and a windfall tax on the excess profits of oil and gas producers. Miliband said pushing for clean energy would also improve people’s health and quality of life. “We’re a country that is racked by terrible fuel poverty, and by the killer of air pollution, and by a deep desire for big economic change,” he said. “As [US president Joe] Biden has shown, being a leader on climate is an answer to all those things.” • This article was amended on 16 November 2022. An earlier version said that “changes to the planning system under David Cameron have in effect prevented any new onshore windfarms being built in the UK since 2015”.

At least 150,000 Ukrainians had been living under Russian occupation in these areas for almost the entirety of the invasion. Maliar said that these were only the confirmed figures and that the real number of reoccupied territories in the Kharkiv region “is almost twice as much”. While Ukraine celebrates the tremendous gains its military has made in its dramatic counter-offensive, officials remain stoic about the challenges ahead in the newly reoccupied territory. Lesia Vasylenko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, spoke of discovering the beheaded bodies of Ukrainian military, human faeces everywhere, widespread looting and terrorised teenagers who were still too scared to leave their basements. “Liberation uncovers many crimes. It’s as if we are on the verge of hundreds, if not thousands Buchas, just of a smaller scale,” Vasylenko said, referencing the civilian mass graves and evidence of torture uncovered in Bucha when Ukrainian forces recaptured the Kyiv region. “But whatever the scale there will be tribunals, retribution and justice.” Ukrainian officials said there was a torture chamber set up by the Russian military in now liberated Balakliia. Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the Kharkiv Region National Police Investigation Department, said that 40 people had been detained during the occupation. Speaking of looting, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces warned that Russian forces were continuing to loot as they withdrew from occupied territories. On a stretch of highway heading into Russian territory, Ukrainian officials spotted civilian vehicles with license plates from the Kharkiv region, driven by Russian military and weighed down with looted belongings. In the south, there were reports of Russian occupants breaking the gates of private garages and taking cars, as well as removing furniture. Russian forces continued to hit a number of civilian and civilian infrastructure facilities today throughout the eastern and southern portions of Ukraine, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said. Via air attacks and missile strikes and high mobility artillery rocket systems, Russian force attacked settlements in the Luhansk oblast and the Donetsk oblast in the east, and the Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv and Cherkasy oblasts in the south.

The cable, signed by the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and released on Tuesday, cites a new intelligence assessment of Russia’s global covert efforts to support policies and parties sympathetic to Moscow. The cable does not name specific Russian targets but says the US is providing classified information to select individual countries. It is the latest effort by the Biden administration to declassify intelligence about Moscow’s military and political aims, dating back to ultimately correct assessments that Russia would launch a new war against Ukraine. Many of Joe Biden’s top national security officials have extensive experience countering Moscow and served in government when Vladimir Putin launched wide-ranging campaigns to influence the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. A senior administration official declined to say how much money Russia is believed to have spent in Ukraine, where President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his top deputies have long accused Putin of meddling in domestic politics. The official noted allegations of Russian influence in recent elections in Albania, Bosnia and Montenegro. Unlike declared efforts by foreign governments to lobby for preferred initiatives, Russia’s covert influence involved using front organizations to funnel money to preferred causes or politicians, the cable alleges. That includes thinktanks in Europe and state-owned enterprises in Central America, Asia, the Middle East and north Africa. The US has historically also covertly funded political groups and been responsible for efforts to topple or undermine foreign governments. The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity under rules set by the administration, rejected comparisons between Russia’s activities and current US financing of media and political initiatives. Russians left a ghost town behind in Bohorodychne. The AFP has this heartbreaking dispatch from the village, where just two people remained: Nina Gonchar and her son Mykola, standing in front of their shattered house, appear to be the last two residents still left in the village. Some of their family members were murdered, they told AFP. “The Russians came, they killed my brother and my sister-in-law,” says 58-year-old Mykola. Russian soldiers wanted to use his brother’s home as a base, but after he refused, they gunned the house down, killing the couple at the same time. Mykola says he wrapped the bodies in blankets and buried them himself. He and his frail 92-year-old mother “barely survived” the occupation thanks to food jars, a few poultry and some vegetables in the garden. “How can I describe it with words? It was difficult, I was afraid,” Mykola says. His mother, traumatised by the fighting, still goes back into hiding in the shelter her son dug in their garden, even though the area is back in the hands of Ukraine again. “I cry every day. They killed my son,” Nina says, wiping tears from her eyes with a veil. Luke Harding in Lviv and Dan Sabbagh report: Ukraine consolidated its control of the Kharkiv region on Tuesday, raising flags on towns and villages occupied by Russian troops for six months, and reclaiming areas seized by Moscow on the first day of Vladimir Putin’s invasion. The state border service in Kyiv said it had liberated the city of Vovchansk, a couple of kilometres from the international border. Russian soldiers left on Sunday, it added, after the stunning Ukrainian counter-offensive. In the space of a few days Ukraine has pushed the Russians out from more than 6,000 sq km of territory, including zones in the south of the country where a separate counter-offensive is ongoing to recapture the city of Kherson. Russian units have fled in disarray. Serhiy Hadai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said local partisans had raised the Ukrainian flag over the key town of Kreminna, which was “completely empty”. Its Russian occupiers had either left the area or were too scared to take it down, he suggested. Russian battalions have fallen back to new positions east of the Oskil River, about 10 miles from the freshly liberated city of Izium. The city was almost entirely destroyed and more than 1,000 residents killed during five months of occupation and in recent fighting, Kyiv says. Video confirmed the scale of the damage. It showed pulverised high-rise apartment blocs, trashed schools, blown up bridges, and burnt-out Russian military vehicles marked with the letter Z. The Kremlin used Izium as a garrison and arms depot in its operation to seize the Donbas. Ukrainian officials said there was a torture chamber set up by the Russian military in now liberated Balakliia. Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the Kharkiv Region National Police Investigation Department, said that 40 people had been detained during the occupation. The BBC has reported some graphic accounts of torture from local residents: Artem, who lives in the city of Balakliya in the Kharkiv province told the BBC he was held by Russians for more than 40 days, and was tortured with electrocution. The epicentre of the brutality was the city’s police station, which Russian forces used as their headquarters. Artem said he could hear screams of pain and terror coming from other cells. The occupiers made sure the cries could be heard, he said, by turning off the building’s noisy ventilation system. “They turned it off so everyone could hear how people scream when they are shocked with electricity,” he told us. “They did this to some of the prisoners every other day... They even did this to the women”. And they did it to Artem, though in his case only once. “They made me hold two wires,” he said. “There was an electric generator. The faster it went, the higher the voltage. They said, ‘if you let it go, you are finished’. Then they started asking questions. They said I was lying, and they started spinning it even more and the voltage increased.” Artem told us he was detained because the Russians found a picture of his brother, a soldier, in uniform. Another man from Balakliya was held for 25 days because he had the Ukrainian flag, Artem said. A school principal called Tatiana told us she was held in the police station for three days and also heard screams from other cells. We visited the police station, and saw the Lord’s Prayer scratched on the wall of one of the cramped cells, alongside markings to indicate how many days had passed. Ukrainian police officers say as many as eight men were held in cells intended for two people. They say locals were scared to even pass the station when the Russians were in charge, in case they were grabbed by Russian soldiers. Isobel Koshiw and Lorenzo Tondo in Balakliia report: The roads leading to Balakliia, a former frontline town in Kharkiv province recently recaptured by Ukraine, were littered with the detritus of war; carcasses of Russian tanks, crates of abandoned ammunition and destroyed vehicles were scattered along the sides. Three of the bridges into the town had been blown up. One had been replaced with a pontoon bridge, but that too was out of action after a truck turned on its side while crossing. Several houses on the outskirts were destroyed, as well as factories and farms Russian and Ukrainian forceshad used as bases. Locals said they heard explosions every day from late February onwards and spent most of the last seven months at home and in their basements. Around the beginning of last week, they said, they heard an increase in shelling and shortly after, the Russian forces just fled, some even on foot. Those on Balakliia’s streets on Tuesday, just a small part of the 6,000 square km Volodomyr Zelenskiy says Ukraine has recaptured during its counteroffensive, were mostly older middle-aged or elderly, wheeling bicycles. They said younger people who had children had mainly left for Europe. What the people of Balakliia experienced appears to have differed to the residents of towns in Kyiv region and other northern parts of Ukraine that came under Russian occupation at the beginning of the invasion, suffering well-documented atrocities in commuter towns such as Bucha. The first lady of Ukraine will be a guest of honor at the EU State of the Union on Wednesday, Reuters reports: Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska will be the guest of honor at Wednesday’s EU State of the Union, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Tuesday on Twitter. “The courage of Ukrainian people has touched and inspired the world. Europe will stand with you every step of the way,” she said. Von der Leyen is expected to unveil a package of measures to pull down soaring energy prices in the EU during her speech on Wednesday. Ukraine president Volodomyr Zelenskiy announced today that the country is in full control of more than 4,000 square km (1,500 square miles) of territory that was once held by Russia. Zelenskiy also said during an address on Tuesday that an additional 4,000 sq km was being stabilized, reported Reuters. Yesterday, he said Ukraine had retaken 6,000 sq km during its recent counter-offensive against Russia, but other Ukrainian officials have said that it is impossible to distinguish between recapturing a territory and ensuring it is totally safe. Two main power lines that power the city of Kharkiv were also restored, reports Reuters: Ukrainian repair crews have restored the two main power lines supplying the eastern city of Kharkiv and the surrounding region, power firm Ukrenergo said on Tuesday after Russian shelling caused blackouts. In a statement, Ukrenergo said repair work on other lines would continue, but gave no details. The director general of the UN nuclear watchdog announced that all three of the backup power lines are back up at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia power plant, reports Reuters. The power lines had gone down on Saturday, but have all since been restored. “One of them, a 750/330 kilovolt (kV) line, is now providing the ZNPP with the external electricity it needs for cooling and other essential safety functions. The 330 kV and the 150 kV lines are being held in reserve,” said the IAEA in a statement today. The International Atomic Energy Agency also announced that power had been restored to residents in Enerhodar, which suffered a complete blackout last week. The White House said today that it will likely announce an additional military aid package in the “coming days”, reported Reuters. “I do think you’ll see another one here in coming days,” said White House national security spokesperson John Kirby to reporters. So far, the US has given $15.2bn to Ukraine, announced the state department last week. There has been no additional information on how much more will be given in the most recent aid package. Since 6 September, Ukrainian forces have recaptured more than 300 settlements in the Kharkiv region, taking back more than 3,800 sq km (1,467 miles) of Russian occupied territory, said Hanna Maliar, Ukrainian deputy minister of defence. At least 150,000 Ukrainians had been living under Russian occupation in these areas for almost the entirety of the invasion. Maliar said that these were only the confirmed figures and that the real number of reoccupied territories in the Kharkiv region “is almost twice as much”. While Ukraine celebrates the tremendous gains its military has made in its dramatic counter-offensive, officials remain stoic about the challenges ahead in the newly reoccupied territory. Lesia Vasylenko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, spoke of discovering the beheaded bodies of Ukrainian military, human faeces everywhere, widespread looting and terrorised teenagers who were still too scared to leave their basements. “Liberation uncovers many crimes. It’s as if we are on the verge of hundreds, if not thousands Buchas, just of a smaller scale,” Vasylenko said, referencing the civilian mass graves and evidence of torture uncovered in Bucha when Ukrainian forces recaptured the Kyiv region. “But whatever the scale there will be tribunals, retribution and justice.” Speaking of looting, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces warned that Russian forces were continuing to loot as they withdrew from occupied territories. On a stretch of highway heading into Russian territory, Ukrainian officials spotted civilian vehicles with license plates from the Kharkiv region, driven by Russian military and weighed down with looted belongings. In the south, there were reports of Russian occupants breaking the gates of private garages and taking cars, as well as removing furniture. Russian forces continued to hit a number of civilian and civilian infrastructure facilities today throughout the eastern and southern portions of Ukraine, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said. Via air attacks and missile strikes and high mobility artillery rocket systems, Russian force attacked settlements in the Luhansk oblast and the Donetsk oblast in the east, and the Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv and Cherkasy oblasts in the south. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has said he is concerned Russia could try to “stir the pot” in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in order to distract from Ukraine. He added that Russia could also use its influence in the region to help “calm the waters”. A western official said it was “too early to say” if Ukraine’s success in regaining 6,000 sq km of territory in the Kharkiv region represented “a turning point” in the more than six-month-long war, playing down the significance of Kyiv’s recapture of Izium and Kupiansk. Nevertheless it was, the official acknowledged, “a moment that has power” and they confirmed that the amount of territory gained by Ukraine in the past week amounted to “half the size of Wales”. The official was speaking on condition of anonymity. Ukraine had succeeded in surprising Russia with its attack on the lightly defended Kharkiv region, partly by first attacking in the Kherson territory in the south of the country, diverting Moscow’s forces and attention. “In marked contrast to Russia, Ukraine has demonstrated impressive operational art and an adherence to the core principles of war. From late July, it (Ukraine) has presented multiple threats which led to Russia repositioning forces thereby creating areas of weakness. Ukraine then concentrated forces against that weakness,” the official said. The military development was “in strict military terms a withdrawal ordered and sanctioned by (Russia’s) general staff, the official added, but the professionalism displayed by retreating units varied considerably from orderly withdrawal to “apparent panic” abandoning “a significant quantity of operational vehicles, weapons and ammunition”. Russia was attempting to create a new frontline in the Oskil river, and the result of last week’s battle was painted partly as an attempt by Moscow to rationalise its long frontlines to protect its territory in the Donbas and the land bridge to Crimea. But there was praise for Ukraine’s “innovative and experimental” military strategy as compared to Russia, whose commanders were at times referring decisions to the Kremlin. “Moscow is operating with a long screwdriver,” the official added. Beheaded bodies of Ukrainian military, human faeces, terrorised teenagers too scared to leave their basement: this is just some of what Russian forces left behind when Ukrainian troops recaptured large swathes of the Kharkiv region, according to Lesia Vasylenko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament. At least 150,000 Ukrainians were living under Russian occupation for almost the entirety of the invasion. Since 6 September, Ukrainian forces have recaptured more than 300 settlements in the Kharkiv region, taking back more than 3,800 sq km (1,467 miles) of Russian occupied territory. “Liberation uncovers many crimes. It’s as if we are on the verge of hundreds, if not thousands Buchas, just of a smaller scale,” Vasylenko said, referencing the civilian mass graves and evidence of torture uncovered in Bucha when Ukrainian forces recaptured the Kyiv region. “But whatever the scale there will be tribunals, retribution and justice.” Information is trickling out now from the towns and villages that Ukrainian forces have recaptured – many of these areas have been under Russian occupation for almost the entirety of the invasion. Residents in these areas are now describing the horror of what life was like during those long months. One woman told a reporter: “It was just cruel when the Russians came. Neighbours betrayed each other. Many probably thought that the Russian soldiers would stay forever.” “Now it’s like seven months ago, only the other way around: neighbours tell each other who was particularly friendly to the Russians,” she said. “I just want peace again.” Russian forces have continued looting as Ukrainian troops push them further east, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in today’s daily briefing. Officials said that on a section of the highway running north and south between Starobilsk and Luhansk, they spotted about 300 civilian vehicles, mostly with the state license plates of the Kharkiv region, heading in the direction of Luhansk. Most of these vehicles had “trailers loaded with looted property” and were being driven by Russian military. In Polohy, a city in the Zaporizhzhia region in the south of the country, “Russian occupants break the gates of private garages, take private cars from locals,” the general staff said. Meanwhile in the Kherson region, the general staff said similar behaviour was noted in the removal of “furniture and household appliances from temporarily abandoned homes”. Russian forces hit a number of civilian infrastructure facilities today throughout the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said. Using air attacks and missile strikes and high mobility artillery rocket systems, Russian force attacked settlements in the Luhansk oblast and the Donetsk oblast in the east, and the Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv and Cherkasy oblasts in the south. “More than 25 settlements suffered artillery shelling,” the general staff said in its daily briefing. “In addition, the enemy intensified air reconnaissance.” Since 6 September, Ukrainian forces have recaptured more than 300 settlements in the Kharkiv region, taking back more than 3,800 square kilometres (1,467 miles) of Russian occupied territory, said Hanna Maliar, Ukrainian deputy minister of defence. Maliar said that these were only the confirmed figures and that the real number of reoccupied territories in the Kharkiv region “is almost twice as much”. Balakliya was one of the more than 20 towns and villages recaptured by the Ukrainian forces in the Kharkiv oblast over the past few days. Here is a look at some of the devastation left behind after the Russian troops withdrew: Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs is estimating that at least 53,000 Russian soldiers have been killed since the Russian forces invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has said he is concerned Russia could try to “stir the pot” in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in order to distract from Ukraine. Blinken has called for “an end to any military hostilities immediately” after fighting broke out near the two countries’ border in the worst escalation of hostilities since the 2020 war. “Whether Russia tries in some fashion to stir the pot, to create a distraction from Ukraine, is something we’re always concerned about,” Blinken told Reuters at an event in Indiana. He added that Russia could also use its influence in the region to help “calm the waters”. Izium was one of the cities in the Kharkiv oblast that had been under Russian occupation for almost the entirety of the invasion. After Ukrainian troops recaptured much of the region in a dramatic counteroffensive, the outside world is getting a clear look at what happened to these cities while they were under Russian control. As Ukraine calls for more weapons, pressure mounts on Germany to fulfil its commitment: To recap: When Russian forces first invaded Ukraine, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, shocked the world by announcing a historic 180-degree policy turn on defence spending and exporting lethal weapons. He committed Germany to sending missiles and anti-tank weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. Six months later, many of those weapons have yet to arrive. “Disappointing signals from Germany while Ukraine needs Leopards and Marders now – to liberate people and save them from genocide,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, tweeted. “Not a single rational argument on why these weapons can not be supplied, only abstract fears and excuses. What is Berlin afraid of that Kyiv is not?” Russian forces shelled Lozova, a city in the Kharkiv oblast, early this morning after letting up on their barrage of the region following two days of targeted attacks on its infrastructure that knocked out the power and water supply. Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv oblast, said on Telegram that authorities were still confirming the number of casualties from this morning’s strike. In yesterday’s shelling, one person was killed and six injured in Kharkiv city, according to the Centre for Emergency Medical Assistance. One person was injured in the Izium district. Two people were wounded in the Kharkiv district – one by a landmine in the village of Ruski Tyshky. Two civilians were killed in the Kupiansk district. Synehubov warned that even in recaptured territories landmine danger remains high and that civilians should remain vigilant. An ammonia gas deal that the United Nations is pushing Russia and Ukraine to agree could ultimately stabilise a landmark grain deal, a western diplomat briefed on the matter told Reuters. Under the proposed ammonia deal, ammonia gas owned by Russian fertiliser producer Uralchem would be brought via pipeline to the Russia-Ukraine border. There it would be purchased by US-headquartered commodities trader Trammo, the diplomat said. Trammo would then own the ammonia as it travels across Ukraine, paying Ukraine pumping fees and transit fees, and sell it onto world markets from Ukraine’s Black Sea, according to the proposal. “The actual financial flows are not insignificant,” the diplomat told Reuters. “By having a key Russian company export through the same Black Sea corridors that the Ukrainian grain is going through stabilises the arrangement and could lead to a longer term extension of the agreement,” the diplomat said. Earlier today, Turkey’s ministry of defence said seven more ships had left Ukraine under the Turkey-UN-Russia-Ukraine deal to facilitate grain exports. Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us from Ukraine on the newswires. Volodomyr Zelenskiy has just posted a response on his Telegram channel to the publication of that report co-authored by former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andrey Yermak. Ukraine’s president posted: The first yet crucially important step towards future security guarantees for Ukraine has been taken. During our meeting, Andrey Yermak and former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen presented the elaborated recommendations, which should become the basis of the Kyiv Security Compact. I am thankful to the Yermak-Rasmussen International Working Group for drafting this package of proposals. It is necessary that the Group continues its work and completes the project. Ukraine’s allies should commit to legally binding large-scale weapons transfers and multi-decade investment in the country’s defences, according to a report that looked at alternatives to Kyiv’s long-term aspirations to join the Nato alliance. The report was commissioned by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and co-authored by the former Nato secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andrey Yermak. The purpose of the report was to provide a security structure for Ukraine that guarantees Russia does not seek to invade again, and is separate from calls by Zelenskiy for the west to step up arms supplies to drive home the sudden advance by Ukrainian troops. Ukraine’s possible future membership in Nato was one of the issues that Russia claimed as justification for its February invasion. The report, the subject of wide diplomatic consultations, does not propose that Nato countries collectively should be required to offer their troops in defence of Ukraine’s sovereignty, but says there should be no restriction on the military diplomatic and economic help provided by Nato member countries through bilateral agreements. The level of support could be scalable according to the level of threat and should apply to all of Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders. The report argues the “strongest security guarantee for Ukraine lies in its capacity to defend itself against an aggressor … To do so, Ukraine needs the resources to maintain a significant defensive force capable of withstanding the Russian Federation’s armed forces and paramilitaries.” Read more of the report from diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour: Long-term military investment proposed as alternative to Ukraine joining Nato In the Russian-occupied regions of the Crimea and southern Ukraine, Russian proxies, intelligence officers and military commanders have begun to evacuate and “urgently resettle their families” back into Russian territory, the defence intelligence of Ukraine’s military of defence said. Ukraine is calling for more air defence and an overall increase in weapons deliveries, following two days of targeted attacks on Kharkiv’s electrical grid and repeated Russian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The call for more air defence comes as Ukrainian intelligence believes that Russia is preparing to renew its attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as part of the Kremlin’s efforts to target Ukraine’s infrastructure, specifically the country’s energy system. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, criticised Germany and its reluctance to move faster in sending over battle tanks and heavy weaponry. When Russian forces first invaded Ukraine, German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, surprised the world with his historic 180-degree policy turn on defence spending and exporting lethal weapons in committing to send missiles and anti-tank weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. But six months later, many of those weapons have yet to arrive. Tomorrow, Annalena Berbock, Germany’s foreign minister, will visit Ukraine, and “the issue of increasing military and military-technical assistance to Ukraine” will definitely be discussed. One day after municipal deputies from 18 districts of Moscow and St Petersburg signed a public statement demanding that Vladimir Putin resign, the Kremlin is coming out with a vaguely veiled threat. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the line between legally criticising Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine and falling foul of wartime censorship laws that carry penalties of up to 15 years in prison “is very, very thin”. Annalena Berbock, Germany’s foreign minister, will visit Ukraine tomorrow, hot on the heels of Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, rebuking Germany and its reluctance to move faster in sending over battle tanks and heavy weaponry. “The success of the Ukrainian defence forces in conducting a counteroffensive operation unites European political forces. Especially in Germany,” the main directorate intelligence of Ukraine’s ministry of defence said in a statement. The statement said “the issue of increasing military and military-technical assistance to Ukraine will be raised” during Berbock’s visit. “After all, this will help to continue the successful counteroffensive of the Ukrainian defence forces and liberate the territories captured by the Russian Federation.” Earlier, Kuleba had harsh words for Germany and chancellor Olaf Scholz, who surprised the world and Germany’s allies when he announced a historic 180-degree policy turn on defence spending and exporting lethal weapons in committing to send missiles and anti-tank weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. That was early in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Now, six months later, many of those weapons have yet to arrive. “Disappointing signals from Germany while Ukraine needs Leopards and Marders now – to liberate people and save them from genocide,” Kuleba tweeted. “Not a single rational argument on why these weapons can not be supplied, only abstract fears and excuses. What is Berlin afraid of that Kyiv is not?” In the Russian-occupied regions of the Crimea and southern Ukraine, Russian proxies, intelligence officers and military commanders have begun to evacuate and “urgently resettle their families” back into Russian territory, the defence intelligence of Ukraine’s military of defence said. Defence intelligence officials noted that Russian nationals were “secretly trying to sell their homes and to urgently evacuate their relatives from the peninsula”. In recently recaptured areas of the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian authorities are finding bodies of civilians displaying signs of torture, an echo of the war crimes uncovered after Ukrainian troops retook Bucha and other areas around Kyiv. Although the Ukrainian prosecutor general is still investigating, the implication is that Russian soldiers have once again committed war crimes – torturing and killing civilians – while the region was under Russian occupation. The Kremlin countered today by accusing the Ukrainian army of abusing civilians in the territories it had recaptured, The Kremlin, meanwhile, accused Kyiv’s army of abusing civilians in territory it had recaptured, Agence France-Presse is reporting. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesperson for the Kremlin, said that report have emerged out of Kharkiv of “outrageous” treatment of civilians. “There are a lot of punitive measures … people are being tortured, people are being mistreated and so on,” Peskov told journalists. The Russian military said on Tuesday that it responded to Kyiv’s dramatic counter-offensive with “massive strikes” on all frontlines in Ukraine, but it appears that at least some of whatever recent shelling took place was directed at civilian targets. “Air, rocket and artillery forces are carrying out massive strikes on units of the Ukrainian armed forces in all operational directions,” the Russian defence ministry said in its daily briefing on the conflict, according to Agence France-Presse. The defence ministry said in a statement it had launched “high-precision” strikes on Ukrainian positions around Slovyansk and Kostiantynivka in the eastern Donetsk region. In an attempt to convince even more Russian soldiers to give up, Ukrainian forces are launching shells filled with flyers ahead of their advance, said Hanna Maliar, Ukrainian deputy minister of defence. “Russians use you as cannon fodder. Your life doesn’t mean anything for them. You don’t need this war. Surrender to Armed Forces of Ukraine,” the flyers read. Ukraine is calling for more air defence and an overall increase in weapons deliveries, following two days of targeted attacks on Kharkiv’s electrical grid and repeated Russian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, had strong words for Germany and its reluctance to move faster in sending over battle tanks and heavy weaponry. When Russian forces first invaded Ukraine, German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, announced a historic 180-degree policy turn on defence spending and exporting lethal weapons in committing to send missiles and anti-tank weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. But six months later, many of those weapons have yet to arrive. “Disappointing signals from Germany while Ukraine needs Leopards and Marders now — to liberate people and save them from genocide,” Kuleba tweeted. “Not a single rational argument on why these weapons can not be supplied, only abstract fears and excuses. What is Berlin afraid of that Kyiv is not?” One day after municipal deputies from 18 districts of Moscow and St Petersburg signed a public statement demanding that Vladimir Putin resign, the Kremlin is coming out with a vaguely veiled threat: Yesterday, deputies from 18 Moscow and St Petersburg regions put forth issued a statement saying that Putin should resign because they believed his actions “harm the future of Russia and its citizens”. “Deputies are not yet forbidden to have an opinion. And it is also not forbidden to speak for the resignation of the president. He is not a monarch, but a hired worker, receives a salary from our taxes,” Ksenia Torstrem, the municipal deputy of the Semenovsky district of St Petersburg, told the Insider. “Our function is to represent the interests of the people, and we see that the people are not satisfied.” Ukrainian intelligence believes that Russia is preparing to renew its attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as part of the Kremlin’s efforts to target Ukraine’s infrastructure, specifically the country’s energy system. This comes after two days of Russian shelling knocked out power to much of Kharkiv. Any kind of attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest nuclear reactor, could have catastrophic results for the region. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country’s forces had taken back 6,000 sq km (2,400 sq miles) of Russian-held territory in the country’s south and east. Ukraine’s forces have continued to press their counterattack in Kharkiv, seeking to take control of almost all of the province. Ukraine’s troops headed north, reportedly recapturing towns all the way to the Russian border. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said fighting is still raging in Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv region. Hanna Malyar said: “The aim is to liberate the Kharkiv region and beyond – all the territories occupied by the Russian Federation. Fighting is continuing. It is still early to say full control has been established over Kharkiv region. Our strength stems from the fact that we are very motivated and that we plan operations thoroughly.” The Ukrainian military says it had freed more than 20 settlements in 24 hours. In recent days, Kyiv’s forces have captured territory at least twice the size of greater London, according to the British Ministry of Defence. Ukraine’s military says the Antonivsky Bridge across the Dnieper River near occupied Kherson in the south is now unusable by Russian military. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said Ukrainian forces had made important progress in their counteroffensive against Russian troops, although it was too early to predict the outcome. “Clearly we’ve seen significant progress by the Ukrainians, particularly in the north-east, and that is a product of the support we’ve provided, but first and foremost it’s a product of the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukrainian people,” Blinken told reporters in Mexico City. Ukraine’s state border service has issued a video that purports to show soldiers tearing down Russian banners and burning the Russian flag in Vovchansk, in the north of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region and very close to the border with Russia. Russia’s military commanders have stopped sending new units into Ukraine after the counteroffensive, the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said on its Facebook page on Monday. “The current situation in the theatre of operations and distrust of the higher command forced a large number of volunteers to categorically refuse the prospect of service in combat conditions.” Russian troops have left behind stockpiles of ammunition and other supplies following Ukraine’s counteroffensive in Kharkiv oblast, the Kyiv Independent reports. One analyst estimated that more than 300 vehicles, including tanks, self-propelled mortars and supply trucks, had been lost between 7 and 11 September. Russia responded to the counteroffensive by launching missile strikes that cut electricity and water supplies in Kharkiv city for a second time in less than 24 hours, knocking out both on Monday morning just hours after the city authorities had restored 80% of the utilities that had been cut overnight. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, appeared on state TV on Monday evening, chairing a meeting on the economy at which he made no reference to the military situation and said Russia was holding up in the face of western sanctions. “The economic blitzkrieg tactics, the onslaught they were counting on, did not work”. Germany is well-positioned to get through the winter despite reduced gas flows from Russia thanks to measures including extending two nuclear power plants’ lifespans, German chancellor Olaf Scholz will say on Tuesday. Russia detained a top manager of an aviation factory on suspicion of passing secret military information to Ukraine, Russian news agencies reported on Tuesday, citing the FSB federal security agency. Clashes have erupted between Azerbaijani and Armenian troops, according to Russian news agencies, in a resumption of decades-old hostilities linked to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian government said it would invoke a cooperation agreement with Russia and appeal to a Russia-led security bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, as well as the UN security council. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later today. Vivian Ho will be here shortly to guide you through the next few hours. Ukraine’s state border service has issued a video that shows soldiers ripping down Russian signs and burning the Russian flag in Vovchansk, which is in the north of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region close to the border with Russia. Volodomyr Zelenskiy has posted on social media to say that he has spoken to Italian prime minister Mario Draghi. Ukraine’s president said: Had a conversation with Prime Minister Mario Draghi. Informed him about the developments at the front. Noted the importance of defence cooperation with Italy. We should enhance it. Discussed the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The guarantee of its security is demilitarisation and return under Ukrainian control. Here is a video clip from Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s address last night when he declared that Ukraine has recaptured 2,300 sq miles (6,000 sq km) of territory. He urged allies to provide equipment to enhance his country’s ability to defend itself. Reuters is now carrying some additional quotes from its interview with Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar. It quotes her saying: Our strength stems from the fact that we are very motivated and that we plan operations thoroughly. Speaking on the road to Balakliia, a crucial military supply hub recaptured by Ukrainian forces late last week, she said Ukraine had taken the decision to press on with its operation in the Kharkiv region due to the successes notched up so far. Fighting is still raging in Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv region but Ukraine’s forces are making good progress because its forces are highly motivated and its operation is well planned, deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar told Reuters on Tuesday. “The aim is to liberate the Kharkiv region and beyond – all the territories occupied by the Russian Federation. Fighting is continuing. It is still early to say full control has been established over Kharkiv region,” Malyar said in an interview. Serhai Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has posted an update to Telegram on the situation on the ground in Donetsk. He claims that: The Russians have completely left Kreminna, but the armed forces have not yet entered the city. We are monitoring the situation in Lyman – the liberation of which is key for our region, fighting is still going on around the city. The large-scale de-occupation of Luhansk Oblast will begin from Kreminna and Svatove, the Russians have already begun to pull equipment closer to these cities. The main impact will be there. Today, Kreminna is completely empty – the Russian army has left the city. The Ukrainian flag raised by the partisans flies there. The situation in Starobilsk is somewhat similar. But in Svatove, the Rashists fled at first, but returned after some time. There is a shortage of fuel in the occupied territories due to the large-scale escape of the occupiers and collaborators. The claims have not been independently verified. Germany is well-positioned to get through the winter despite reduced gas flows from Russia thanks to measures including extending two nuclear power plants’ lifespans, German chancellor Olaf Scholz will say on Tuesday, according to reports from Reuters. Germany’s gas storage levels are higher than this time last year and will continue to be filled before winter, Scholz will say according to a copy of his speech for delivery at the German Employers’ Day. If you need a reminder, here is a map showing how rapidly the Ukrainian counteroffensive has been able to push back the Russian line of control in Kharkiv in the north-east of Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent is reporting that Kharkiv is again without electricity following Russian strikes on 11 September. Russia detained a top manager of an aviation factory on suspicion of passing secret military information to Ukraine, Russian news agencies reported on Tuesday, citing the FSB federal security agency. The FSB said a man was suspected of taking photographs of equipment from Russia’s fighter planes and sending them to a Ukrainian citizen who worked at a Ukrainian aviation plant, according to the reports. Reuters reports the FSB said it had opened a treason case against the suspect. Pavlo Kyrylenko, who is Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, has given a morning update on Telegram. He states that: In Slovyansk, at least one person was killed and one person was injured by shelling. The town of Hostre in the Kurakhivska community came under fire — fortunately, no one was injured. Avdiivka has been subjected to massive shelling at dawn for several days in a row. Today there were no casualties, we are clarifying the extent of the damage. Three people were injured as a result of the night shelling of Toretsk, and at least four houses were damaged. He also reported that several buildings were damaged during the attacks. The claims have not been independently verified. We reported earlier that there have been clashes between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The conflict over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region has been going on for decades. [See 5.36am] It appears the latest flare-up ended swiftly. Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan had called on Russian president Vladimir Putin, French president Emmanuel Macron and US secretary of state Antony Blinken to discuss the situation, but Reuters has a snap saying that there are local media reports that a ceasefire has been agreed. Azerbaijan borders Russia to the south. This is Martin Belam on the live blog now for the next few hours. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com With Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, set to meet Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Uzbekistan this week, a senior Chinese diplomat has said Beijing was willing to shape the international order together with Russia in a “more just and rational direction”. Agence France-Presse reports: China and Russia have drawn closer in recent years as part of what they call a “no limits” relationship acting as a counterweight to the global dominance of the United States. On Monday, the Communist party’s foreign affairs chief, Yang Jiechi, told Russia’s ambassador to China, Andrey Denisov, that China was “willing to work with Russia to continuously implement the spirit of high-level strategic cooperation between the two countries, safeguard the common interests of both sides, and promote the development of the international order in a more just and rational direction”. Russia has sought to bolster ties with Asian countries, particularly China, since being hit with unprecedented western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. Heightening tensions between China and the west, Beijing has not condemned Moscow’s interventions in Ukraine. Ukraine’s military says the Antonivsky Bridge across the Dnieper River near occupied Kherson is now unusable by Russian military, the Kyiv Independent reports. Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command also reported that Ukraine’s forces destroyed one tank, five 152 mm gun-howitzers, including one Msta-B and one Msta-S howitzer, and 12 units of armoured vehicles, among other Russian military equipment. As a result, 59 Russian troops were killed, the command said. A group of Ukrainian civil society leaders says sweeping electricity cuts are part of Russia’s strategy, urging the US to ramp up support to maximise recent gains before winter, Agence France-Presse reports. Much of eastern Ukraine was plunged into a blackout on Sunday, with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, blaming deliberate attacks by Moscow as Kyiv made startling gains on the battlefield. “Their approach is to have more cold before the winter season starts by destroying all critical infrastructure,” said Hanna Hopko, who heads the International Center for Ukrainian Victory, an umbrella group of civil society organizations. Hopko, addressing reporters at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said: “Putin really thinks that neither Ukraine nor Europe will survive this winter. That’s what he really hopes and that is actually the central pillar around which he now is developing his threats.” US leaders are being careful not to declare a premature victory after a Ukrainian offensive forced Russian troops into a messy retreat in the north, the Associated Press reports. Although there was widespread celebration of Ukraine’s gains over the weekend, US officials know Russian President Vladimir Putin still has troops and resources to tap, and his forces still control large swaths of the east and south. “I agree there should be no spiking of the ball because Russia still has cards it can play,” said Philip Breedlove, a retired US air force general who was Nato’s top commander from 2013 to 2016. “Ukraine is now clearly making durable changes in its east and north and I believe that if the west properly equips Ukraine, they’ll be able to hold on to their gains.” The UK’s Ministry of Defence says Russia could take years to rebuild one of its most prestigious tank units after the retreat from Kharkiv oblast. In its latest intelligence briefing on Twitter, the MoD said the 1st Guards Tank Army had been severely degraded, leaving Russia’s conventional forces “severely weakened”. As Russia’s forces retreat from the Kharkiv region, they are leaving behind hundreds of military vehicles, including tanks and trucks. Our picture editors assembled this series of striking images of abandoned equipment. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will speak with International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the plan told Reuters, as Ukraine continues to press the global lender for a full-fledged financing program. Ukrainian officials have said they are seeking an IMF program worth as much as $15bn to $20bn, although such a large amount is seen as unlikey to win IMF approval. The IMF Executive Board, at an informal session on Monday, discussed a plan that could offer Ukraine $1.4bn in emergency aid. Clashes have erupted between Azerbaijani and Armenian troops, according to Russian news agencies, in a resumption of decades-old hostilities linked to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan, which re-established full control over the territory in a six-week conflict in 2020, acknowledged casualties among its forces. Armenia made no mention of losses, but said clashes persisted overnight. The Armenian government said it would invoke a cooperation agreement with Russia and appeal to a Russia-led security bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, as well as the UN security council, Interfax reported. You can read the full story here: The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, says Ukrainian forces have made important progress in their counteroffensive against Russian troops, although it was too early to predict the outcome. “Clearly we’ve seen significant progress by the Ukrainians, particularly in the northeast, and that is a product of the support we’ve provided, but first and foremost it’s a product of the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukrainian people,” Blinken told reporters in Mexico City. “It’s too early to tell exactly where this is going. The Russians maintain very significant forces in Ukraine as well as equipment and arms and munitions. They continue to use it indiscriminately against not just the Ukrainian armed forces but civilians and civilian infrastructure as we’ve seen.” Good morning and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. It’s now 7.30am in Kyiv. Here are the latest developments. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said Ukrainian forces had made important progress in their counteroffensive against Russian troops, although it was too early to predict the outcome. “Clearly we’ve seen significant progress by the Ukrainians, particularly in the north-east, and that is a product of the support we’ve provided, but first and foremost it’s a product of the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukrainian people,” Blinken told reporters in Mexico City. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country’s forces had taken back 6,000 sq km (2,400 square miles) of Russian-held territory in the country’s south and east. Ukraine’s forces have continued to press their counterattack in Kharkiv, seeking to take control of almost all of the province. Ukraine’s troops headed north, reportedly recapturing towns all the way to the Russian border. The Ukrainian military says it had freed more than 20 settlements in 24 hours. In recent days, Kyiv’s forces have captured territory at least twice the size of greater London, according to the British Defense Ministry. Russia’s military commanders have stopped sending new units into Ukraine after the counteroffensive, the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said on its Facebook page on Monday. “The current situation in the theatre of operations and distrust of the higher command forced a large number of volunteers to categorically refuse the prospect of service in combat conditions.” Russian troops have left behind stockpiles of ammunition and other supplies following Ukraine’s counteroffensive in Kharkiv oblast, the Kyiv Independent reports.

The US-based Institute for the Study of War thinktank said that “Ukraine has turned the tide in its favour, but the current counteroffensive will not end the war”. Ukrainian authorities have said they are capturing so many Russian prisoners of war the country is running out of space to put them, the Associated Press reports. Municipal deputies from 18 districts of Moscow and St Petersburg have signed a public statement demanding that Vladimir Putin resign. “We, the municipal deputies of Russia, believe that the actions of President Vladimir Putin harm the future of Russia and its citizens,” read the statement published by Ksenia Torstrem, the municipal deputy of the Semenovsky district of St Petersburg."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/nov/13/poland-russia-defeat-ukraine-western-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-13T15:00:14Z","webTitle":"Why Poland may have most to gain from a Russian defeat in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/13/poland-russia-defeat-ukraine-western-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/13/poland-russia-defeat-ukraine-western-europe","fields":{"headline":"Why Poland may have most to gain from a Russian defeat in Ukraine","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If the outcome of the war could be determined by the toss of a coin, the camps would be clear: democracies would want Ukraine to win, autocracies would want it to lose. But real-world political outcomes are not so binary. They typically fall on a spectrum between annihilation and total victory. This leaves the democracies divided into at least three camps: the English-speaking, the western European and the eastern European minus Hungary. What Putin calls the “collective west” all want Ukraine to win. But not necessarily to the same extent. For Poland and the Baltic countries the matter is simple. They want Ukraine’s victory to be unequivocal. The advantages would be both material and psychological. Ukraine’s victory would soothe a centuries-old angst. For Poland, Russia has augured conquest, partitions, genocide, colonialism and communism. The obsession is mutual. In his 2021 essay arguing that Ukraine and Russia were historically one people, Putin included more than 30 references to Poland – some hinting that Ukrainian national identity was plotted by Poland’s elites. Over the past 600 years, Russia and Poland have waged more than a dozen wars. There is little love lost between them. Ukraine’s success would also entail a historic chance for the region to exit the status of the periphery and become a counterbalance to the EU’s big western member states. Victory in Ukraine would probably spill over into regime change in Belarus – the second missing piece in the historic project of the Intermarium, or a buffer of allied countries stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea to counterbalance Russia’s power. For Poland, such a scenario would be a double jackpot. For the first time since at least the 17th century, we would get over the problem of “the neighbourhood” – a comfort that most western Europeans have taken for granted since the end of the second world war. A united region across eastern Europe, with the human and economic capacity of more than 100 million citizens, could offset the dominance of the old Rhineland in the EU. This possibility is why the Kremlin systemically underplays the region’s potential. Its rhetoric treats Ukraine as nothing more than a repository of Slavic peasant folklore, a superpower only in handicrafts. In reality, Ukraine, birthplace of Sergei Prokofiev and Sergei Korolev, the father of Soviet space exploration, hosts swathes of unexploited natural resources, a potential for emissions-free electricity, some of the continent’s most fertile soils, a space and aviation industry that has built the world’s largest aeroplane, and political leaders who command respect across Europe. Tapping into that potential requires economies of scale, transparent institutions and capital investments. Some of this scale could come from regional integration with its allies. Curbing corruption and the power of the oligarchs was already very much on the agenda of the Zelenskiy administration. With victory, investment money would flow. Poland and Ukraine are much poorer today than France and Germany. How could they realistically become a countervailing force in the future EU? Like many postwar economic miracles – such as those of South Korea, Japan and West Germany – this one is also likely to be co-sponsored by a superpower with much to gain from the reconfigured political order. The US is already pumping money, technologies and thinktanks in to eastern Europe. In return, it expects influence and a clear stance on China. This is a price that seems too high to Europe’s west but not to its east. Lithuania was ready to risk trade relations with China to please the US, while Ukraine and the Czech Republic have pivoted to sourcing nuclear fuel from the US. Poland recently contracted with an American company to build its first nuclear power plant. Western Europeans might not be ready for the geopolitical centre of gravity to shift eastward – let alone at the price of increased US influence across the continent. After the cold war, western Europe became a reluctant ally of the US and the main beneficiary of a post-Berlin Wall triangulation: Russian energy, Chinese markets and American security. Now the first pillar is gone and the second may be the price to pay for the third. France and Germany currently endorse a policy of “strategic autonomy” for Europe, a defence and security idea that could one day lead to an EU army. Putin’s Russia has pushed the goal of a Eurasian union stretching “from Vladivostok to Lisbon”. What both strategies have in common is an aversion to “Anglo-Saxon” dominance in Europe. American and eastern European interests today seem aligned. There are two looming reasons why they may diverge. First, the US is way more afraid of a repeat of the chaos of the 1991 Soviet Union implosion, and the attendant risks to nuclear security. These security risks are not taken lightly in eastern Europe. But if you already live in an at-risk neighbourhood and there’s the possibility of major improvement, your perspective can be different. Second, there seems to be a residual hope in the US that, as long as Russia stands on its feet, it can eventually be pivoted towards the west and used against China – in a reverse Kissinger manoeuvre. In eastern Europe, this idea is greeted with horror. It has been tested many times with Putin (too many – if you ask eastern Europeans). The region fears that it could be tried again with Putin’s successor – especially if Russia, in lieu of major reforms, pulls out of a hat someone such as Alexei Navalny, aesthetically acceptable for the west but still wedded to Russia’s role as a great power. But these are opportunities and risks, not givens. Poland’s Law and Justice party – bogged down in a dignity-driven conflict with the EU over the rule of law – has forfeited the chance to effectively take Britain’s place in the EU post-Brexit. But it’s not missing the opportunity to be Ukraine’s reliable ally, nor is it losing sight of the geopolitical positives that may ultimately flow from this. Whether the ruling party is able to hold on to power past the 2023 elections or not, the country’s geopolitical course is steady. In March the Polish parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of granting Ukrainians special rights to Poland’s education, health and labour market. More than 80% of Ukrainians have a good or very good opinion of Poles. Three-quarters say their view has improved since Russia’s invasion. Despite troubled relations up to 1945, Ukrainians perceive Poles as the single most friendly society today. All major Polish parties support Ukraine but they also hope that, while the arc of the history is long, it will eventually bend towards a new geopolitical order. They want to see Ukraine emerge from this war as a star in the making, Europe’s centuries-old western orientation overturned – and Poland the undeclared winner.

A total of 185,000 of its upmarket A-Class, B-Class and all-electric EQA cars were assembled here last year in the factory, close to the French border. They are then taken by road, rail and ship to their new owners, perhaps to zip through European capitals, Chinese cities, or along California’s coastal roads. Mercedes-Benz Group (MBG) produces hundreds of thousands such vehicles a year from eight German factories: Rastatt is one of three in the state of Baden-Württemberg, near the company’s physical and spiritual home in Stuttgart. The carmaker lends its name to a whole area of this affluent city – the Benzviertel, where its headquarters and museum are located – and to its Bundesliga football club’s stadium. But Mercedes and the country’s wider economy now stand at a crossroads. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted a race to find new energy supplies amid sanctions and Russia’s throttling of gas pipelines – a crisis that has already forced Germany to extend the life of its three remaining nuclear power plants. The failure of diplomatic policy towards Moscow has also prompted much soul-searching in Germany over its choice of business partners, with questions now being raised over the wisdom of its reliance on China. As winter closes in and demand for energy increases, Mercedes and its rivals have had to adapt to ensure they can keep production facilities such as Rastatt running. Somewhat fortuitously, Mercedes says its decision last year to make its production carbon-neutral from this year left it well placed to respond. “We had a big advantage, because we finalised a large green energy contract for all of our factories last year,” says Jörg Burzer, the MBG board member responsible for production and supply chains. “This is a contract which focuses on wind, solar and hydroelectric power.” Germany’s businesses and households had grown accustomed to plentiful Russian gas and oil for many years. Russia accounted for more than half of the country’s natural gas supply in 2020. Mercedes is less dependent on these supplies than some of Germany’s energy-intensive industries, notably steelmakers, pharmaceutical companies and chemicals producers such as BASF, which said in October it would permanently “downsize” its European operations. However, the carmaker still relies on gas for certain production processes, particularly in its foundries. Burzer says MBG was able to effectively halve its gas usage by turning off the gas power plants at its sites and by ramping up renewables. “We are very strongly focused on green energy,” he adds, “but even without the mild start to the winter we would have been well placed to get through.” On a visit to the company’s enormous site at Sindelfingen, about 40 miles east of Rastatt, Burzer gestures out of the boardroom window at the sprawling plant where some 35,000 people are employed. “You can’t see it from here, but behind the chimney is the multistorey car park, the first one here where the roof has been completely covered with solar panels.” This is part of the company’s “thousand roofs” programme, launched this year, which will see solar panels on factory roofs across Germany and beyond. It recently announced plans to build a 100-megawatt windfarm on its test track at Papenburg, in northern Germany, which will cover more than 15% of the company’s annual electricity needs in Germany. Details of a large planned offshore wind development will soon be unveiled, Burzer adds. The energy shock to Europe’s industrial powerhouse has not been as extreme as initially feared: although smaller German firms have borne the brunt of soaring costs, gas storage facilities have been successfully filled before the onset of winter. The shift in the country’s diplomatic approach has been perhaps more seismic. Putin’s war has prompted the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to effectively break with the decades-long approach of Wandel durch Handel: the belief that social and political change in other countries can be brought about by trade. His predecessor, Angela Merkel, has come under fire for Germany’s diplomatic failures, but refuses to criticise the decision to facilitate even greater Russian gas supplies through the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, halted by Scholz just before the Kremlin’s troops poured into Ukraine. There has also been outcry over the role of former Social Democrat party (SDP) chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who led the country from 1998 to 2005 before monetising his friendship with Putin through lucrative roles on the boards of Nord Stream 2 and Russian state oil company Rosneft. Now another of the pillars of its economy is up for reassessment: its relationship with China. Germany is in the middle of a “structural shift” following the shocks of the war, the energy crisis and pandemic disruption to global trade, according to analysts, even if the business community has only belatedly started to adapt. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at the research arm of bank ING, believes corporate Germany has been slow to adapt by restructuring its supply chains and production processes. “There are two major shifts, one is energy,” he says. “Then there are global headwinds.” Germany’s largest manufacturers, including Mercedes and the other carmakers, have enjoyed booming sales in China, while the country’s Mittelstand of small and medium-sized engineering companies have powered Chinese production. China is by far Mercedes’s biggest market: it sold nearly 223,000 vehicles there in the third quarter of this year, representing 42% of its total sales in the period. Now Germany is working out how to recalibrate relations with Beijing. The three-way agreement between the members of the country’s ruling coalition – Scholz’s SPD, the Greens and the Free Democrats – has labelled the relationship with China a “systematic rivalry”. It also refers to human rights issues and Taiwan, as well as the need for economic diversification. Last month, accompanied by a high-powered economic delegation, Scholz was the first western leader to be granted a state visit to China since the outbreak of Covid and Xi Jinping’s moves to strengthen his power. Back home, Scholz has come in for criticism – including from coalition partners – for pushing through a deal allowing Chinese state-owned shipping company Cosco to buy a near-25% stake in three terminals at Germany’s largest port, Hamburg, the city where he was once mayor. “Germany needs to reinvent itself,” says Noah Barkin, an expert in Europe-China relations at US analysts Rhodium Group. “There is a realisation that Germany is too dependent on China, that its biggest companies are too reliant on the Chinese market. If you go back 10 years, that was seen as a strength, and now increasingly it’s seen as a vulnerability.” Mercedes has full faith in its recent strategic decisions, says Burzer. “We are very closely connected to China on the product and market side, and of course we are a promoter of global trade.” These decisions include its push towards more electric vehicles and “preparing products for the future and according to market conditions in China and the US, and our ‘luxury’ strategy”, Burzer says. “These are the correct decisions, which will also make us successful in the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/24/ukraine-war-heading-for-uncontrolled-escalation-says-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-24T15:35:05Z","webTitle":"Ukraine war heading for ‘uncontrolled escalation’, says Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/24/ukraine-war-heading-for-uncontrolled-escalation-says-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/24/ukraine-war-heading-for-uncontrolled-escalation-says-russia","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine war heading for ‘uncontrolled escalation’, says Russia","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has told western counterparts that the war in Ukraine is heading for an “uncontrolled escalation” amid evidence that the Kremlin is weighing how to respond to yet another anticipated battlefield defeat around the key southern city of Kherson. With Russian troops setting up new defences for a fresh Ukrainian offensive in Luhansk in the country’s east as well, Moscow appears to be preparing the ground for yet further escalation, with discredited claims that Kyiv may be preparing to use a dirty bomb as a “false-flag operation” to blame Russia. Refuting the Russian allegation, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in an interview on Monday: “The allegation that Ukraine is preparing to use dirty bombs in Ukraine is absurd.” Russian officials – including Vladimir Putin – have repeatedly hinted that the Kremlin may be prepared to use a nuclear weapon as part of its so-far failed brinkmanship to discourage Kyiv and its western allies, which have been supplying Ukraine with modern weapons, intelligence and training. However, the Kremlin continued to push the claim of a Ukrainian dirty bomb on Monday, with Igor Kirilov, head of the Armed Forces radioactive weapons unit, saying that troops had been mobilised to work in a radioactively contaminated environment. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the threat was real. “Their distrust of the information that has been provided by the Russian side doesn’t mean that the threat of using such a dirty bomb doesn’t exist,” he told reporters. Shoigu discussed the “rapidly deteriorating situation” in phone calls with his British, French and Turkish counterparts and also spoke by phone with the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, for the second time in three days. The Pentagon said Austin told Shoigu he “rejected any pretext for Russian escalation”. Without providing evidence, Shoigu said Ukraine could escalate by using a “dirty bomb” – conventional explosives laced with radioactive material. Analysts have noted that a “dirty bomb” would have little utility for Ukraine on the battlefield, not least when its forces are currently retaking large swathes of territory by conventional means, instead interpreting Russia’s claim as a pretext for its own planned escalation. In an overnight address, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the Russian accusation was a sign that Moscow was planning such an attack itself and would blame Ukraine. “If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this,” Zelenskiy said. “So when today the Russian minister of defence organises a phone carousel and calls foreign ministers with stories about the so-called ‘dirty’ nuclear bomb, everyone understands everything well. Understands who is the source of everything dirty that can be imagined in this war.” Shoigu’s comments fit a worrying pattern of escalatory actions by Moscow as the tide of the war has turned against it, most recently with its targeting of civilian infrastructure with missiles and “kamikaze” drones after Kyiv’s attack on the Kerch strait bridge in Crimea earlier this month. In a joint statement after the talks, Britain, France and the US said they were committed to supporting Ukraine “for as long as it takes” and rejected Russia’s warning about a “dirty bomb”. “Our countries made clear that we all reject Russia’s transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory,” they said. “The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation.” Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia and the International Institute for Strategic Affairs, commented on Twitter: “It’s Russia that is escalating: attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, apparent attacks on western connectivity infrastructure, and mining of Novaya Kakhovka dam. And playing with nuclear fire in Zaporizhzhiya [nuclear power plant] for months. “So [it’s] hard to see these calls as anything other than Shoigu either doubling down on Putin’s bluffs, or preparing way for Russian nuclear use. Yes, nuclear (ie fission [rather than a dirty bomb]). A dirty bomb would breach nuclear taboo but not achieve significant effects.” He added: “I worry there is too much motivated reasoning in dismissing possible Russian nuclear use. We don’t want it to happen, and/or we don’t see the point, therefore it won’t. But Russia faces logic of dwindling choices as it loses. Escalation of all kinds more likely.” The latest threats from Moscow come as Russian forces appear to be preparing to withdraw from the east bank of the Dnieper River near Kherson, ordering a fresh evacuation of civilians, and laying the ground for the potential loss of the city of Kherson itself. About 25,000 people have been transported from the area since Tuesday, the Interfax news agency said. However, Russia-installed authorities in Kherson reported insufficient vessels to ferry people across the river at one point on Sunday, blaming a “sharp increase in the number of people wishing to leave”. The Russian education minister, Sergei Kravtsov, said in a video message: “The situation today is difficult. It’s vital to save your lives. It won’t be for long. You will definitely return.” Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine’s military spy chief, warned that the reported transportation of civilians from Kherson was part of a Russian information campaign. While Russia is moving financial structures, equipment, vulnerable residents and wounded people from Kherson, he said, it is also reinforcing defences. “They are creating the illusion that all is lost. Yet at the same time they are moving new military units in and preparing to defend the streets of Kherson,” he told the Ukrainska Pravda online media outlet. On Monday, the region’s Russian-installed administration announced the formation of a local militia, saying that all men remaining in the city could join. Russia accused western countries of having “essentially stolen” its gold and foreign exchange reserves via sanctions. Asked by reporters about an EU proposal to transfer frozen Russian assets to Ukraine, Peskov said: “In general, a part large of our assets have been essentially stolen by specific western countries.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/06/iran-nuclear-talks-rocked-by-russian-demand-for-sanctions-exemption","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-06T17:22:07Z","webTitle":"Iran nuclear talks rocked by Russian demand for sanctions exemption","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/iran-nuclear-talks-rocked-by-russian-demand-for-sanctions-exemption","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/06/iran-nuclear-talks-rocked-by-russian-demand-for-sanctions-exemption","fields":{"headline":"Iran nuclear talks rocked by Russian demand for sanctions exemption","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Russia has been accused of trying to take the Iran nuclear deal hostage as part of its wider battle with the west over Ukraine, after it threw a last-minute spanner into plans for an agreement to lift a swathe of US economic sanctions on Tehran. After months of negotiations in Vienna, a revised deal was expected to be reached within days under which US sanctions would be lifted in return for Tehran returning to full compliance with the 2015 nuclear nonproliferation deal. But diplomatic efforts have been sent into a tailspin by Russia’s unexpected demand for written guarantees that its economic trade with Iran will be exempted from US sanctions imposed on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, at the weekend cited the “avalanche of aggressive sanctions [on Russia] that the west has started spewing out”, and said: “This meant Moscow had to ask the US for guarantees first, requiring a clear answer that the new sanctions will not affect its rights under the nuclear deal. “We requested that our US colleagues … give us written guarantees at the minimum level of the secretary of state that the current [sanctions] process launched by the US will not in any way harm our right to free, fully fledged trade and economic and investment cooperation and military-technical cooperation with Iran.” In a sign of how the imposition of sanctions will bite, Aeroflot flights from Moscow to Iran were cancelled on Sunday. If Lavrov’s demand is to require the US to exempt Russian-Iranian trade from sanctions, the west is almost certain to reject the demand since it would open a huge loophole in the sanctions regime. It would then be up to Moscow whether to veto the nuclear deal altogether. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, dismissed Russia’s demands as “irrelevant”, saying that sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine “have nothing to do with the Iran nuclear deal”. They “just are not in any way linked together, so I think that’s irrelevant,” Blinken told CBS News. The Vienna talks have for months been an oasis of diplomatic cooperation between Russia and the west as they painstakingly crafted a compromise acceptable to both Iran and the US. Russia’s chief negotiator at the Vienna talks, Mikhail Ulyanov, has been an indefatigable intermediary but now risks seeing his work being undone by Moscow’s confrontation with the west over Ukraine. Iranian officials criticised Russia’s intervention, saying “the Russians put this demand on the table at the Vienna talks two days ago. There is an understanding that by changing its position in [the] Vienna talks, Russia wants to secure its interests in other places. This move is not constructive for [the] Vienna nuclear talks.” Russia also has a short-term strategic interest in scuppering or postponing the deal. Iran produces more than 2m barrels of oil a day, and if these supplies were able to reach the markets, the upward surge in prices would be slowed. Russia, a large-scale oil producer, wants to drive the oil price up to turn the screw on western economies but also to boost its own revenues. Israel, a fierce opponent of a revived nuclear deal, will be the only major country privately welcoming Russia’s actions. The parties to the deal are Iran, the E3 (France, Germany and the UK), Russia and China. The US is present in Vienna, but Iran will not directly negotiate with the US delegation. Separately, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, was in Tehran this weekend trying to secure a deal on the future inspection regime. Grossi was hoping to resolve disagreements over the IAEA’s demand for access to four sites where suspicious nuclear activities were alleged to have taken place. Iran wants the IAEA to close down these investigations, claiming they are based on false Israeli intelligence. Mohammad Eslami, the head of the Iranian atomic energy association, has also sought assurances that what Iran regards as Israeli intelligence would not form the basis of future IAEA investigations into Iran. The two sides agreed to exchange documents by June, the likely date for the Iran deal to come back into force, but seemed to have left issues about the inspection regime unresolved. Meanwhile, the IAEA will continue with an inspection regime in which its surveillance cameras remain in place, and the memory cards of the cameras kept under joint seal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/feb/24/dining-across-the-divide-trident-hunting-eating-meat-cats","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-24T12:30:57Z","webTitle":"Dining across the divide: ‘Don’t scream at people outside supermarkets, take them for a veggie meal!’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/24/dining-across-the-divide-trident-hunting-eating-meat-cats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/24/dining-across-the-divide-trident-hunting-eating-meat-cats","fields":{"headline":"Dining across the divide: ‘Don’t scream at people outside supermarkets, take them for a veggie meal!’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Bill, 62, Edinburgh Profession IT consultant Voting record Bill has predominantly voted Conservative, but describes himself as a “liberal Conservative” rather than “a hang-’em-high, shoot-’em Conservative”.

Bill Helen is a far more generous person than I am; she’s just one of life’s good people. She does good stuff. The big beef Helen It was a veggie place – I had the veggie haggis, which was fab. He had hummus and olives, then the risotto. I’m vegetarian, and think it’s cruel to slaughter animals for meat when we don’t need it. Bill I enjoy meat. So long as the animal is well cared for, and killed humanely, then I’m fine eating it. Helen We had a conversation about battery hens. I think it’s appalling – all hens should be free to roam. Bill It would be better if hens were free range. But if you ban battery farming – which is obviously cheaper – you take away choice from poorer people, who then can’t afford so many eggs. As a liberal Conservative, I like choice. Helen I would ban hunting altogether.

Bill Hunting is part of controlling vermin, and animals that prey on farm animals. You want to control foxes, because they worry sheep and chickens.

Authorities said seven rockets hit the city early on Thursday morning. Other residents are trapped under rubble, the regional governor and emergency services said. Rescue workers at the scene said they saved one three-year-old girl. More explosions were reported in the city at mid-morning Kyiv time, but there were no further casualties. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to admit severe losses in Ukraine, conceding the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals and insisting Russia would “stabilise” the situation in four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. “We are working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise,” Putin told Russian teachers during a televised video call on Wednesday. The UN nuclear agency chief is en route to Kyiv to discuss creating a security zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after Putin ordered his government to take it over. “On our way to Kyiv for important meetings,” International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi wrote on Twitter, saying the need for a protection zone around the site was “more urgent than ever”. Grossi is also expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant. The IAEA said it had learned of plans to restart one reactor at the plant, where all six reactors have been shut down for weeks. Ukraine’s forces are pushing their advance in the east and south, forcing Russian troops to retreat under pressure on both fronts. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s military had made major, rapid advances against Russian forces in the past week, taking back dozens of towns in regions in the south and east that Russia has declared annexed. Military experts say Russia is at its weakest point, partly because of its decision not to mobilise earlier and partly because of massive losses of troops and equipment. Ukraine has extended its area of control in the Kherson region by six to 12 miles, according to its military’s southern command. Zelenskiy confirmed the recapture of the villages of Novovoskresenske, Novohryhorivka and Petropavlivka, saying the settlements were “liberated from the sham referendum and stabilised,” in an address on Wednesday. Kherson region’s Moscow-appointed governor, Kirill Stremousov, said the withdrawal was a tactical “regrouping” to “deliver a retaliatory blow”. The extent of Russia’s retreat remains unclear. Moscow’s forces have left behind smashed towns once under occupation and, in places, mass burial sites and evidence of torture chambers. In Lyman, which was retaken by Ukrainian forces on Sunday, more than 50 graves have been found, some marked with names, others with numbers, the Kyiv-based outlet Hromadske reported on Wednesday. Leaders of 44 European countries on Thursday in Prague will send a clear signal of Russia’s isolation and try to create a new order without Moscow, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said this morning. “The meeting is looking for a new order without Russia,” he told reporters. Russia has submitted preliminary objections to a genocide case against Moscow brought by Ukraine. The International Court of Justice, which is the UN’s highest court for disputes between states, has tweeted that it had received the objections on 3 October, but these have not been made public. The filing signifies a change in Moscow’s attitude to the ICJ case. Russia is now engaging with the court, whereas it has previously skipped hearings and not filed documents directly. The UN has warned Russia’s claimed annexation of Ukraine territory will only exacerbate human rights violations. Christian Salazar Volkmann, said UN experts had documented “a range of violations of the rights to life, liberty and security” and warned the situation would only worsen as Russia pushes forward with the annexation of some Ukrainian regions. Attempts to play down retreats in Ukraine are no longer washing inside Russia with the latest military failures spilling on to local television screens. “Why do we advance metre by metre when they advance village by village?” Olga Skabeyeva, the country’s top state-TV host, asked a Russia-appointed official in Luhansk in a recent broadcast. Pro-war military bloggers and journalists are also criticising the Kremlin and painting a bleak picture of deteriorating Russian morale. Roman Saponkov, a prominent war correspondent, described his despair over the pullback in Kherson on his Telegram channel: “I really don’t know what to say to you. The retreat … is catastrophic.” Poland says it has asked to have US nuclear weapons based on its territory, amid growing fears that Putin could resort to using nuclear arms in Ukraine. The request from the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, is widely seen as symbolic and appears to be the latest example of nuclear signalling to deter Putin. The White House, however, said it had not received such a request. The car bombing that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of prominent Russian political figure Alexander Dugin, was allegedly authorised by elements within the Ukrainian government, according to US intelligence sources who spoke with the New York Times and CNN. The United States took no part in the attack, either by providing intelligence or other assistance, the officials said. A SpaceX rocket carrying Russian cosmonaut, Anna Kikina, the only female cosmonaut in service, soared into orbit from Florida on Wednesday. The International Space Station crew comprising Kikina, two Americans and a Japanese astronaut flew together in a demonstration of US-Russian teamwork in space despite Ukraine war tensions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/may/10/donald-trump-china-hurricanes","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-10T21:40:38Z","webTitle":"Trump inquired if China could make hurricanes to harm US, ex-officials say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/10/donald-trump-china-hurricanes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/10/donald-trump-china-hurricanes","fields":{"headline":"Trump inquired if China could make hurricanes to harm US, ex-officials say","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As president, Donald Trump repeatedly asked aides if China could be manufacturing hurricanes and sending them to damage the United States, three unnamed former senior officials told Rolling Stone on Tuesday. Trump also reportedly wanted to know if using such a “hurricane gun” would constitute an act of war, and if so, whether the US could retaliate militarily. China is a major nuclear power. “It was almost too stupid for words,” one source told the magazine, which said the speaker was “intimately familiar with the then sitting president’s inquiry”. “I did not get the sense he was joking at all,” the source added. The news comes on the tail of former defense secretary Mark Esper’s claim, in a new book, that Trump wanted to hit “drug labs” in Mexico with missiles and then deny responsibility, and other hair-raising accounts of near foreign policy disaster. Rolling Stone quoted a second former official as saying: “I was present [once] when he asked if China ‘made’ hurricanes to send to us. [Trump] wanted to know if the technology existed. One guy in the room responded, ‘Not to the best of my knowledge, sir.’ “I kept it together until I got back to my office … I do not know where the [then-]president would have heard about that … He was asking about it around the time, maybe a little before, he asked people about nuking hurricanes.” In August 2019, the website Axios reported that in a briefing on hurricanes, Trump told top officials: “I got it. I got it. Why don’t we nuke them?” Trump was reportedly told that aides would “look into” the notion of destroying large storms with nuclear weapons, which in 2016 National Geographic called “a really bad idea” with “a surprising history”. Trump called the Axios story “ridiculous”. But his interest in hurricanes reared its head again the following week, in what would come to be known as “Sharpiegate”. At an Oval Office briefing on Hurricane Dorian, Trump held up a National Hurricane Center map that appeared to have been altered with a Sharpie pen, to show the storm hitting Alabama – a baseless claim previously made by Trump. Trump did not comment to Rolling Stone about its “hurricane gun” story. Stephanie Grisham, his press secretary at the time of Sharpiegate and his reported remark about “nuking” hurricanes, told the magazine she did not hear conversation about China making hurricanes, but it would not have surprised her if she had. “Stuff like that was not unusual for him,” Grisham said. “He would blurt out crazy things all the time, and tell aides to look into it or do something about it.” “His staff would say they’d look into, knowing that more often than not, he’d forget about it quickly – much like a toddler.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/29/green-tory-back-johnson-call-successor-invest-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-29T15:47:21Z","webTitle":"Green Tories back Johnson’s call for successor to invest in renewables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/29/green-tory-back-johnson-call-successor-invest-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/29/green-tory-back-johnson-call-successor-invest-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Green Tories back Johnson’s call for successor to invest in renewables","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Leading green Conservatives have backed Boris Johnson’s call for his successor to invest in renewable energy, amid concern that the Tory leadership frontrunner Liz Truss could rely more on fossil fuels to combat soaring prices. In one of his final speeches as prime minister, Johnson is set to warn against focusing on short-term solutions and neglecting both renewables and a wider shift towards net zero. While officials say details of the speech are still to be worked out, they say Johnson will stress that growth in sources such as wind power, as well as new nuclear power stations, would protect the UK from future energy crises. Truss and her rival in the Conservative leadership race, Rishi Sunak, have both called for more nuclear energy. However, they have been notably sceptical at times in their comments and planned policies on renewable sources. Sunak has pledged to make it even harder to get permission for onshore windfarms, while Truss spoke out vehemently against solar panels being installed on agricultural land. The foreign secretary will reportedly issue dozens of oil and gas drilling licences if she is elected prime minister next week. She will invite applications for licences to explore new fields and up to 130 are set to be issued, sources told the Times. The most recent figures from Offshore Energies UK estimate that there are 15bn barrels of oil and gas still under the North Sea. Truss has faced criticism for delaying her announcement on addressing soaring energy prices until after the leadership election concludes on Monday. Chris Skidmore, a Conservative former minister who set up the Net Zero Support Group within the parliamentary party and has become a leading Tory voice on green issues, said he was keen for Truss and Sunak to understand the need to invest in renewables. “The reason why I wanted to ensure every candidate in the leadership contest committed to net zero was not just to ensure that the UK maintained its international leadership on climate change – it was precisely because net zero isn’t just about reducing emissions but determining our future energy security and economic growth,” the MP for Kingswood told the Guardian. “The private sector and international markets already understand that investing in the energy transition is the way forward for future growth. “Net zero is now our way out of this cost of gas crisis. We have reached a tipping point where renewables are now far cheaper than fossil fuels and I genuinely believe that 2022 will be viewed by historians as the year that we recognised from this crisis that the world woke up to the need to deliver energy sovereignty through renewable and clean power.” Sam Hall, the director of the Conservative Environment Network, which has the support of 133 Tory MPs, half the parliamentary party backbench, said a commitment to net zero was “essential if we’re to tackle our dependency on dubious regimes for energy”. He said: “Boris Johnson is right that delivering net zero goes hand-in-hand with tackling the root causes of the energy crisis. Putin is weaponising Europe’s reliance on international gas markets for his illegal invasion of Ukraine, hoping that sky-high energy bills will weaken our resolve. “By rolling out more clean energy such as offshore wind and insulating Britain’s draughty housing stock, we will become less dependent on expensive gas which is putting up people’s energy bills. “Boris Johnson deserves a lot of credit for turbocharging the UK’s clean energy sector during his time in office. Because of these policies we’re buying less expensive gas than we would have been otherwise. “The next prime minister must make good on their pledges to expand cheap renewables and boost energy efficiency, as well as providing direct support to households and businesses to help them get through this winter. Doubling down on net zero is essential if we’re to tackle our dependency on dubious regimes for energy.” While Truss and Sunak are seeking to appeal to Conservative members, who will select Johnson’s successor, Tory voters appear less dogmatic on energy measures. Almost half of them now support the nationalisation of UK energy firms, according to a YouGov poll for the Times. Truss has pledged to suspend green levies, which fund energy efficiency schemes, placed on energy bills, and has said she backs fracking for shale gas if it has local support. She is also resistant to new onshore wind projects, and during one leadership hustings event said that seeing solar farms on what was farmland was “one of the most depressing sights” of the modern UK. A source in Truss’s campaign said she was “absolutely committed to green energy”, and had been vocal about the need to increase the supply from sources including wind and tidal power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/01/energy-industry-backs-plan-to-save-businesses-and-homes-up-to-18bn-a-year","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T16:41:01Z","webTitle":"Energy industry backs plan to save businesses and homes up to £18bn a year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/01/energy-industry-backs-plan-to-save-businesses-and-homes-up-to-18bn-a-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/01/energy-industry-backs-plan-to-save-businesses-and-homes-up-to-18bn-a-year","fields":{"headline":"Energy industry backs plan to save businesses and homes up to £18bn a year","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The energy industry has thrown its weight behind a plan it says could save homes and businesses up to £18bn a year, by reducing the prices charged for electricity generated from sources other than gas. Energy UK, the trade body for the sector, said its proposals could cut £18bn a year from energy bills, including £11bn for businesses. This could deliver a saving for households of between £150 and £250 a year. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is understood to have met members of Energy UK to discuss the proposal and is said to be considering it seriously as an option to present to the next prime minister. The Conservative party will announce the result of a vote for its new leader on Monday, with Liz Truss widely expected to win the mandate. The voluntary scheme would work by separating the cost of electricity from sources such as nuclear, solar and windfarms from the sky-high prices being paid for electricity generated by burning gas in power stations. Gas prices have more than tripled since Russia began reducing the volumes pumped into Europe in the months before its invasion of Ukraine. At the moment, the way electricity auctions are designed means the price of all electricity is closely pegged to the price of gas. Under the proposals – first suggested by the UK Energy Research Centre – nuclear power stations and renewable electricity generators would be encouraged to sign up to a new type of contract. These contracts for difference (CfDs) would mean selling their electricity at a lower price, but one that was fixed and guaranteed over a number of years. Many older nuclear, solar and wind generators are on renewable obligation (RO) contracts, under which they sell at the current wholesale rate. The market structure has led to those on RO contracts benefiting from higher prices, potentially making windfall profits. Energy UK is urging ministers to make it possible for RO contracts to be exchanged for CfDs. Adam Berman, Energy UK’s deputy director, said: “The current energy market doesn’t allow customers to fully benefit from the cheapest form of electricity – domestically produced low-carbon generation. “This scheme would be a significant first step to decoupling gas from retail electricity prices. “Removing the link between gas and retail electricity prices will be complex and take time, but this solution provides a quick fix for up to 40% of our generation capacity.” The energy industry regulator, Ofgem, is also looking to reform the market in the long term to delink the price of electricity from gas. Several European countries are considering a similar move. The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, said on Thursday the Treasury was examining several options to help consumers this winter. This could also include the Bank of England providing support to energy suppliers for hedging costs, which could allow consumer bills to be reduced. The energy supplier Ovo has put forward an alternative solution which would involve reducing the price of energy for domestic users, but only for a limited amount of units per household. Energy consumption beyond that level would be charged at a higher price. Why is the price of electricity pegged to gas? Typically, electricity prices reflect gas prices. This is because the types of energy needed to produce electricity for the UK are ranked, with renewables and nuclear prioritised ahead of coal and gas. The price of electricity is set every half hour by the margin cost of the last generating unit to be switched off to meet demand, typically gas. This pushes up electricity prices when wholesale gas prices rise. What is an energy contract for difference? Under these contracts, electricity plants are paid a flat rate for what they produce over 15 years. That rate is the difference between the “strike price” – an agreed price which reflects the investment in green technology – and the “reference price”, which is a reflection of the wholesale market price for electricity in the UK. If the market price is higher than the strike price, the Low Carbon Contracts Company, which is wholly owned by the government, ensures these savings are passed on to consumer bills. If the market price is lower, the LCCC makes up the shortfall. The government uses this system, introduced in 2017, to support the development of low-carbon electricity generation projects with high upfront costs and long lifetimes to protect developers from volatile wholesale prices. However, only about 15% of the total fleet of renewable power projects have a CfD; most are remunerated through the older Renewables Obligation Certificate payments. What are renewables obligation certificates? Under the renewables obligation model, designed for wind and solar, power generators receive the value of their electricity on the wholesale market, as well as an additional subsidy. Therefore, generators on these contracts have benefited from the soaring gas prices so far this year. • This article was amended on 1 September 2022. Based on incorrect information provided to the Guardian, an earlier version reported that Energy UK had estimated the plan would save homes and businesses up to £29bn a year; Energy UK later clarified its estimate was up to £18bn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/dec/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-drone-attack-hits-kursk-airfield-in-russia-says-governor-further-strikes-in-zaporizhzhia-region","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-06T19:00:31Z","webTitle":"Russia claims Ukraine shelling Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-drone-attack-hits-kursk-airfield-in-russia-says-governor-further-strikes-in-zaporizhzhia-region","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/dec/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-drone-attack-hits-kursk-airfield-in-russia-says-governor-further-strikes-in-zaporizhzhia-region","fields":{"headline":"Russia claims Ukraine shelling Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. The drone attack came a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. For Kyiv the strike represented an unprecedented operation to disrupt the Kremlin strategy of trying to cripple the Ukrainian electrical grid to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe in a country on the verge of winter. Shelling by Ukrainian forces killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city on Tuesday, according to the Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin. The head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling had killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council, Maria Pirogova. Russian and Ukrainian authorities confirmed the exchange of 120 people in a prisoner swap. According to the Russian defence ministry, 60 servicemen were returned from “Kyiv-controlled territory”. Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, said Andrii Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, said. Ukraine’s health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts. In a statement, the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. The Kremlins spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”. A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said that Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, as a result of diplomatic pressure and Iran’s own internal political turmoil. Mikhailo Podolyak told the Guardian that Russian forces currently had enough of its own cruise missiles in its stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure like the salvo fired on Monday. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, told the Guardian he had been unable to leave Donetsk after spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine because he did not have any identity papers. Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds. Earlier Viktor Orbán’s government was accused of “holding hostage” funds for Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungary confirmed on Tuesday that it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage in separate disputes over Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds. Ukrainian embassies have received more “bloody packages”, according to its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had been targeted with packages soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. Latvia has revoked a broadcast licence for TV Rain, the independent Russian TV station broadcasting from exile, following a scandal over its coverage of the war in Ukraine. The channel had been charged with failing to provide Latvian subtitles in its coverage and for having displayed a map that showed Crimea, the peninsula occupied by Russian forces in 2014, as part of Russia. The European Commission is reportedly considering a ban on new investments in Russia’s mining sector as part of a fresh package of sanctions against Moscow, aimed at further eroding the Kremlin’s ability to fund its war against Ukraine. Sources have told the Financial Times that the mining investment ban is part of a ninth EU sanctions package, which officials aim to discuss with member states and have agreed by the end of next week. If approved, the ban, which the paper writes will exempt some specific products, would mark the first time Brussels has directly targeted Russia’s metals sector. The FT said the new sanctions package could also include export controls on civilian technologies that Brussels believes Russia is using to support its arms factories, a ban on transactions with three more Russian banks, and targeted sanctions against another 180 individuals. Ukraine’s health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts as a result of Russian missile strikes targeting the country’s critical infrastructure. In a statement, the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where people have been marking the country’s Army Day today. Earlier we reported that the chair of Latvia’s broadcasting regulator, Ivars Abolins, said it had cancelled the licence of the exiled Russian independent television station, TV Rain, “in connection with the threat to the national security and public order”. TV Rain, or Dozhd in Russian, moved to broadcasting from Latvia in July, when it was forced to shut its Moscow studio after accusations by Russia’s communications watchdog that it was spreading “deliberately false information about the actions of Russian military personnel” in Ukraine. The station was earlier this month fined €10,000 by the Latvian regulator for displaying a map of Russia which included the occupied Crimea peninsula. It was also forced to apologise to viewers and fired a presenter, Alexei Korostelyov, on Friday for comments he made on air, after he said he hoped that the station’s efforts would help provide Russian soldiers with basic equipment and amenities. The network, which was founded in 2010 as the main opposition channel in Russia, has also been accused of failing to ensure Latvian language translation, local media reported. Abolins told reporters today that Latvia’s counterintelligence and internal security service had informed his office that the station represented a threat to the country’s security. TV Rain dismissed the accusations as “unfair and absurd” and said its programmes could still be seen on YouTube, which is where most of its audience watches its content. Its founder, Natalya Sindeeva, posted a video this afternoon describing Korostelyov’s firing as “the worst thing we could have done in that situation”. The move comes as Latvia faces a growing rift between the country’s Latvian majority and its Russian-speaking minority. A quarter of the population of two million in Latvia are Russian speakers. The charity Reporters without Borders called the move a “serious blow to freedom of information”. Several other Russian newsrooms have also found refuge in the Latvian capital, including Novaya Gazeta Europe and Deutsche Welle’s Moscow branch. The city has also hosted independent news website Meduza since 2014. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the move showed foreign states were no freer than Russia. He told reporters today: Some always think that elsewhere is better than home. And some always think that freedom is elsewhere and there is no freedom at home. This is one of the clearest examples that demonstrate the fallacy of such illusions. Moldova’s prime minister, Natalia Gavrilița, has pledged to boost cooperation between her country and Ukraine during a visit to the towns of Bucha and Irpin. In a series of tweets, Gavrilița said justice would be carried out for “the innocent victims that died, were tortured and hurt during this cruel and unjust war unleashed by Russia”. She added: Ukraine is fighting for us all – for the freedom of the entire European continent. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, tweeted about his meeting with his Moldovan counterpart, saying that the pair had agreed to cooperate in air defence, energy and customer control. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said.

In a statement, it said it was repelling the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, and that an analysis indicated it was a “planned and large-scale” attack. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, was detained on 10 June by Russian occupying forces in the Ukrainian city of Kherson, where he had been living for more than three years. After spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine, he told the Guardian on Monday that he had been released by the Moscow-backed Donetsk separatists on 28 October. Murekezi said he had been unable to leave Donetsk because he did not have any identity papers. In a phone interview from the city of Donetsk, the capital of the Russian-annexed Donetsk region, Murekezi said: I am very happy to be free. But I don’t know what to do next. The Russians never gave me back my passport, and I feel trapped here. Murekezi spent most of his time in two different jails with a group of international foreign fighters, including the British nationals Aiden Aslin, John Harding, Andrew Hill and Dylan Healy, who returned to the UK after a prisoner swap in September. But unlike the foreign fighters, Murekezi and his close friends and relatives said he did not participate in any fighting in Ukraine, to where he moved about four years ago, eventually settling in Kherson. “It became clear early on to the Russian authorities that I had nothing to do with the fighting, but they just kept me in jail anyway,” he said. Read the full story here: The Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin, said shelling by Kyiv’s forces had killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city today. Kulemzin wrote on social media: Preliminary data shows that today six civilians were killed as a result of shelling in Donetsk, the number of wounded is being specified. Separately, the head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling had killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council. Maria Pirogova, who Pushilin said had been involved in the separatist movement since 2014, was “the epitome of kindness” whose life was ended “in its prime”, according to a tribute he wrote on his Telegram account. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. A $60 (£50) a barrel ceiling on purchases of Russian oil came into force on Monday. Companies in the EU, the UK, US, Canada and Japan as well as Australia are banned from providing services enabling maritime transport, such as insurance, in cases where the price cap has been breached. The G7 nations – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and US – provide insurance services for 90% of the world’s cargo while Greece, an EU member state, is a major player in the shipping industry. The cap is aimed at maintaining the flow of oil to countries such as China, India, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, which have not banned Russian oil imports, while maintaining economic pressure on the Kremlin. A traffic jam of oil tankers built up in Turkish waters on Monday as Turkey’s government demanded proof of insurance cover. Read the full story here: Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds. The European Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters that the EU must keep its promises to Ukraine. He said: Ukraine is a country at war. It desperately needs our support and we just cannot allow one member state to derail or delay this financial support. Earlier Viktor Orbán’s government was accused of “holding hostage” funds for Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungary confirmed on Tuesday that it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The EU has promised to underwrite €18bn in cheap loans to Kyiv to keep Ukraine’s government afloat in 2023. The EU’s 26 other member states will now study how to move ahead without Hungary, although hope Budapest can be persuaded to change its mind. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage in separate disputes over Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds. Hungary, which has angered other member states with its sharp criticism of EU sanctions against Russia, may now find it harder to unlock EU funds. The Czech finance minister, Zbyněk Stanjura, who chaired the meeting, said Budapest’s decision on €18bn for Ukraine would be considered alongside EU member state approval of Hungary’s coronavirus recovery plan. He added: The money will go to Ukraine: either it will be 27 or 26 member states that take part. We have to be able to send the money to Ukraine. The Green MEP Daniel Freund, a persistent critic of Hungary’s government, accused Orbán of abusing the veto like no one ever before. He said: He even takes funds for Ukrainian hospitals hostage for this … The EU will find ways to support Ukraine even without Hungary. But that means: more time, more effort, more costs. Viktor Orbán could not have given Putin a nicer present today. The centre-right Romanian MEP Siegfried Mureşan said the Hungarian veto was disappointing, adding: It is hard to regard this as anything other than cynical obstructionism. An American national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in July has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, was detained on 10 June by Russian occupying forces in the Ukrainian city of Kherson, where he had been living for more than three years. After spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine, he told the Guardian on Monday that he had been released by the Moscow-backed Donetsk separatists on 28 October. Murekezi said he had been unable to leave Donetsk because he does not have any identity papers. A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said that Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, as a result of diplomatic pressure and Iran’s own internal political turmoil. Mikhailo Podolyak told the Guardian that Russian forces currently had enough of its own cruise missiles in its stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure like the salvo fired on Monday. Russia has sought to replenish its arsenal with an offer to buy Iranian missiles. The secretary of the security council, Nikolai Patrushev, visited Tehran in November and was reported to have had missiles on his shopping list. But Podolyak said the deal had not gone through yet. “Iran has come under huge diplomatic pressure and the protests have also raised pressure on the government,” he told the Guardian in his Kyiv office. “The government is starting to lose its grip on Iranian society and their inner domestic problems are growing. That’s why they just don’t have time for dealing with Russia. It’s not their priority.” Podolyak said he believed talks were still under way between Moscow and Tehran on missiles, and that as part of its bargaining position the Russian government had offered its own “cut-throats”, referring to experts in crushing dissent, to suppress the nationwide anti-government protests. “So the negotiations are ongoing, but as of today, no missiles have been transferred to Russia,” he said. Podolyak said Ukrainian forces had become adept at defending against Russian missile attacks, claiming to have shot down an estimated 60 of 70 missiles fired on Monday. He said the country, with foreign help, was also working towards making its power grid more resilient, redesigning it to make it easier for one region with access to power to help another that had been cut off. Podolyak, a close aide to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was also fiercely critical of remarks from Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, in which the French president suggested the west should offer Vladimir Putin security guarantees if he agreed to peace negotiations. “It’s quite weird when you’re not trying to help the victim – and it’s very clear who’s the victim here – but you’re thinking of how to satisfy the murderer,” he said. Russia ran out of Iranian-made drones between two and three weeks ago and is now “anticipating a resupply”, according to western officials. My colleague Dan Sabbagh quotes officials as saying that there are still no signs that Iran has been supplying missiles to Russia. Iran has acknowledged that it had given Russia drones, but said they were sent before the war in Ukraine broke out. The Guardian has seen evidence that at least some of the Iranian-made drones used by Russia in its war were probably supplied after Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February. Hungary has vetoed an €18bn aid package for Ukraine, forcing the European Commission and EU countries to seek an alternative way to ensure aid can keep flowing to Kyiv in the new year. The move by the Hungarian government has widely been seen as a way for its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to use his approval for Ukraine aid as leverage to secure his country’s share of EU recovery funds. The EU has sought to hold back some funds destined for Budapest because of rule-of-law breaches. The commission will now look at how to “provide the necessary solution to Ukraine already as of January”, the EU’s budget commissioner, Johannes Hahn, said during a public session of the bloc’s finance ministers. Today’s Hungarian veto means decisions on other files on the finance ministers’ agenda – including a minimum corporate tax rate (which Budapest is also blocking), the Hungarian recovery plan and connected €5.8bn in grants, and the decision to freeze €7.5bn of EU funds for Hungary over corruption issues – were also postponed. The Czech finance minister, Zbyněk Stanjura, said: We were not able to adopt the package as a whole but we will not be discouraged. Our ambition remains that we will start disbursements to Ukraine in January. He asked the council to work on “a solution supported by 26 member states”, which would get around Hungary’s veto. The EU’s 27 nations have until 19 December to make a decision. Ukrainian embassies have received more “bloody packages”, according to its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had been targeted with packages soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. Kuleba said Ukraine’s embassies in Romania and Denmark received such packages today. As of Friday, Ukraine said 17 embassies had been targeted, indicating that another was delivered on Saturday. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said the packages had been delivered to its embassies in Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Croatia and Italy, to general consulates in Naples and Kraków, and the consulate in Brno in the Czech Republic. On Monday, Spanish police said they had intercepted three more envelopes containing animal eyes addressed to Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid and its consulates in Barcelona and Málaga. A Ukrainian embassy employee in Madrid was injured on Wednesday by a letter bomb, which was addressed to Ukraine’s ambassador to Spain. A further four letter bombs were sent on Wednesday to addresses in Spain, including to a Spanish arms manufacturer that has produced rockets donated to Ukraine, as well as Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the US embassy in Madrid. In an interview with CNN on Friday, Kuleba described what followed the Madrid attack as “more weird” and “even sick”. Asked who he thought was behind the packages, Kuleba said he “feels tempted to name Russia” as it benefits from sowing fear among Ukrainian diplomats. But he added that it could also be someone who sympathises with Russia, so he would await the findings of ongoing investigations. A drone attack set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, western Russia, 175 miles from the Ukrainian border. The governor of the region, Roman Starovoyt, said there had been no casualties and that the fire was “localised”. On Monday, Ukraine appeared to launch drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. Kyiv has not directly taken responsibility for the attacks, but a senior Ukrainian official told the New York Times the drones involved on Monday were launched from Ukrainian territory. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has confirmed that Moscow and Kyiv exchanged 60 prisoners of war in the latest series of swaps. Among those who were returned to Ukraine included dozens who had defended the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the port city of Mariupol, he said. The Russian state-owned bank VTB said it was hit by an “unprecedented cyber-attack from abroad”, which it said was the largest cyber-attack in its history. In a statement, it said it was repelling the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, and warned of temporary difficulties in accessing its mobile app and website. The statement reads: The bank’s technological infrastructure is under an unprecedented cyber attack from abroad. The largest not only this year, but in the whole time the bank has operated. It added: An analysis of the DDoS attack indicates that it was planned and large-scale, and its purpose has been to interfere with the operations of banking services, VTB indicates. The majority of requests for bank services during the attack have generated from foreign segments of the internet, though there has also been malicious traffic from Russian IP addresses. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been visiting troops close to the frontline in the eastern Donbas region. Zelenskiy was pictured meeting soldiers and handing out awards to mark Ukraine’s armed forces day. In a Telegram post, the president thanked troops for their “resilience and strength”, describing them as “an outpost of Ukraine’s independence”. He added: I believe that next time we will meet in our Ukrainian Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia and Ukraine are set to exchange 60 soldiers each in a prisoner swap today, according to Russian officials. Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), wrote on Telegram: Another 60-60 exchange with Kyiv is taking place today. Shamsail Saraliev, deputy of the Russian state duma, wrote on his Telegram account: The Russian Ministry of Defence is conducting another exchange of prisoners of war today. Sixty Russian servicemen are returning home. The Russian defence ministry said it had returned 60 soldiers “who were in mortal danger”. My colleague Isobel Koshiw shares a video originally posted by the mayor of Bakhmut, Oleksii Reva, showing the extent of destruction in the key eastern Ukraine town. Russian opposition politicians are appealing to President Vladimir Putin to issue a decree to end the “partial mobilisation” that has seen hundreds of thousands of men called up to fight in Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry announced in October the end to the military mobilisation order that Putin declared the previous month, but legal activists and media noted that only the Russian leader had the authority to end the mobilisation. The Kremlin said Putin would not sign any order, in effect allowing for future waves of mobilisation. The absence of a formal decree to cancel the mobilisation meant those already drafted could not leave the armed forces, according to Emilia Slabunova, an opposition councillor in Karelia in northern Russia. Military lawyers told Reuters that there were at least two cases where commanders refused to discharge servicemen. Slabunova said appeals against these refusals led nowhere, with courts siding with the commanders. She said: We, as councillors, represent our constituents and these appeals from us are the result of numerous appeals from citizens. Similar appeals were seen from opposition deputies in the Moscow, St Petersburg, Pskov and Veliky Novgorod regions, Reuters reports. All are members of the liberal opposition Yabloko party. The appeals said the lack of a decree “creates legal uncertainty” and “allows military commanders to deny citizens their discharge from service”. Speaking to reporters during his regular briefing, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal yesterday, Blinken said President Vladimir Putin “started this war; he could end it tomorrow” and that there was “always an off-ramp” to end the war in Ukraine. He said: President Zelenskiy has said, we’ve said, others have said, that at some point this will end and it will end almost certainly with diplomacy, with a negotiation. But what I think we have to see is a just and durable peace, not a phony peace. And by that, I mean this: if Russia doesn’t succeed in its current gambit of trying to, in effect, get the Ukrainian people to throw up their hands – and again, they won’t succeed. In response to Blinken’s comments, Peskov said: That the outcome should be a just and durable peace – one can agree with this. But as for the prospects for some sort of negotiations, we do not see any at the moment. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”. Peskov was also asked about reports that Russia is set to launch a new wave of mobilisation of men to fight in Ukraine. As the BBC’s Will Vernon notes, the Kremlin spokesperson did not deny the reports. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here, taking over the live blog from Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest from Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s news so far: A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor has said, a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, said on the Telegram messaging app there were no casualties from the attack and the fire was “localised”. The power deficit caused by the latest wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine will be significantly reduced by Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in televised comments. Missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday destroyed homes and knocked out power in some areas. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv, Reuters reported. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. The oil price rebounded on Tuesday after plunging by more than 3% in the previous session, as the implementation of sanctions on Russian seaborne crude oil eased concerns about oversupply, Reuters reports. The Group of Seven set a top price of $60 a barrel on Russian crude, aiming to limit Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine, but Russia has said it will not abide by the measure even if it has to cut production. At least four people were killed on Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, amid Russian strikes during which 60 of 70 missiles were shot down. The strikes targeted Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, the air force said. Energy workers had already begun work on restoring power, said Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. Officials said airstrikes destroyed homes in the south, knocked out power in the north and killed at least two people. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukrainian drones attacked two airbases at Ryazan and Saratov in south-central Russia, killing three servicemen and wounding four, with two aircraft damaged. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for what would represent the deepest strikes inside the Russian heartland since Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Spanish police intercepted three more envelopes containing animal eyes addressed to Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid and its consulates in Barcelona and Málaga, police sources close to the investigation said. Last week, Ukraine said a series of “bloody packages” were sent to its missions across Europe, soon after a letter bomb detonated at Ukraine’s embassy in Spain and police defused others sent to, among others, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. Canadian-made parts were found in “kamikaze” Iranian drones used by Russia to attack Ukraine, according to an investigative project from the NGO Statewatch. It said components from 30 European and American companies, including antenna parts from Tallysman Wireless, a Canadian manufacturer, were used in Shahed 136 drones.

The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv, Reuters reported. Ukraine denies shelling the facility, which has been under the control of Russian forces since the first days of the war, and has accused Russia of firing on it. “Our units are taking all measures to ensure the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,” Shoigu told his military chiefs in a conference call, an abridged transcript of which was published by the defence ministry. “In turn, the Kyiv regime seeks to create the appearance of a threat of a nuclear catastrophe by continuing to deliberately shell the site,” he added. Shoigu said Ukraine had fired 33 large-caliber shells at the plant in the last two weeks. Most had been intercepted by Russian air defences, he said, though “some still hit objects that affect the safe operation of the nuclear power plant”. “We classify these attacks by Ukrainian troops as nuclear terrorism,” he added. Reuters was unable to independently verify the claims. Both Moscow and Kyiv blame each other for attacks on the facility. Kyiv has also accused Moscow of using the plant as a de facto weapons depot. A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor has said, a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, said on the Telegram messaging app there were no casualties from the attack and the fire was “localised”. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. At daybreak a large column of black smoke was still visible above the site. The power deficit caused by the latest wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine will be significantly reduced by Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in televised comments. Missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday destroyed homes and knocked out power in some areas. Ever since Russia launched its brutal war in Ukraine the Kremlin has banked on American conservative political and media allies to weaken US support for Ukraine and deployed disinformation operations to falsify the horrors of the war for both US and Russian audiences, say disinformation experts. Some of the Kremlin’s most blatant falsehoods about the war aimed at undercutting US aid for Ukraine have been promoted by major figures on the American right, from Holocaust denier and white supremacist Nick Fuentes to ex-Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Fox News star Tucker Carlson, whose audience of millions is deemed especially helpful to Russian objectives. On a more political track, House Republican Freedom Caucus members such as Paul Gosar, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Scott Perry – who in May voted with 54 other Republican members against a $40bn aid package for Ukraine, and have raised other concerns about the war – have proved useful, though perhaps unwitting, Kremlin allies at times. Pro-Moscow video materials from the network RT (formerly Russia Today), which early this year shuttered its US operations, have been featured on Rumble, a video sharing platform popular with conservatives that last year received major financing from a venture capital firm co-founded by recently elected Republican Ohio senator JD Vance and backed by billionaire Peter Thiel. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. Israeli satellite imaging company ImageSat International shared images it said showed burn marks and objects near a Tu-22M aircraft at the Dyagilevo airbase in Russia. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. The Russian Bastion systems, which have missiles with a flight range of up to 310 miles, were deployed on the island of Paramushir, the Russian defence ministry said on Monday. “Coastal servicemen of the Pacific fleet will keep a round-the-clock watch to control the adjacent water area and strait zones,” it said. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, told a Tuesday news conference that the government will closely monitor the Russian military activity, adding it has been intensifying in the far east regions in tandem with Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls the invasion a “special operation”. Ukraine is working to restore power after Russia’s latest wave of missile strikes on Monday caused power disruptions across the country, as winter frost builds and temperatures plunge, AFP reports. Out of the 70 missiles launched by Moscow, most were shot down, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, but the barrage still hit Ukraine’s already battered infrastructure. Fresh power cuts were announced in all regions “due to the consequences of shelling”, national electricity provider Ukrenergo said on Telegram. The head of Ukrenergo said he had “no doubt that Russian military consulted with Russian power engineers during this attack”, judging by where the missiles landed. “The time that Russians chose for this attack was connected with their desire to inflict as much damage as possible,” Volodymyr Kudrytskyi told a Ukrainian news programme, explaining the attacks were launched as the country enters a “peak frost” period. “Our repairmen will be working on the energy system restoration.” The oil price rebounded on Tuesday after plunging by more than 3% in the previous session, as the implementation of sanctions on Russian seaborne crude oil eased concerns about oversupply, Reuters reports. The Group of Seven set a top price of $60 a barrel on Russian crude, aiming to limit Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine, but Russia has said it will not abide by the measure even if it has to cut production. The price cap, to be enforced by the G7 nations, the European Union and Australia, comes on top of the EU’s embargo on imports of Russian crude by sea and similar pledges by the United States, Canada, Japan and Britain. While the market weighs the impact of sanctions on Russian supply, it was also watching a traffic jam of oil tankers off the coast of Turkey on Monday, with Ankara insisting on new proof of insurance for all vessels. A researcher at the investigative news outlet Bellingcat has posted video showing smoke rising from Kursk, Russia, where Ukraine launched strikes damaging an oil storage tank, according to the local governor on Telegram. The Guardian could not independently verify the footage or report of an attack. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday, 6 December. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Below are the photographs originally posted by Starukh: Starovoyt did not specify where the drone originated. On Monday, Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine “attempted to strike” the Dyagilevo airfield in the Ryazan region and the Engels airfield in the Saratov region with “Soviet-made drones”. The drones were intercepted but debris fell and exploded on the airfields, the ministry added. It said that three soldiers had been killed and four others injured. The Guardian has not independently verified the report. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest news as it happens for the next few hours. A drone attack on an airfield in Russia’s Kursk region set fire to an oil storage tank, a local governor said on Tuesday. “There were no casualties. The fire is localized. All emergency services working at the site,” Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the region, said on the Telegram messaging app. Yesterday, Russia’s defence ministry said Ukrainian drones attacked two airbases at Ryazan and Saratov in south-central Russia, killing three servicemen and wounding four, with two aircraft damaged. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for what would represent the deepest strikes inside the Russian heartland since Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February.

The White House has said the latest Russian strikes against Ukraine are a reminder of Vladimir Putin’s brutality. John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, also told reporters that an oil price cap would not have any long-term impact on global oil prices, Reuters reported. Moldovan police on Monday found fragments of a missile in a northern region near the border with Ukraine, state information portal Prima Sursa quoted the police as saying after Russia carried out missile strikes. Russia’s recent mobilisation increased its military threat in Ukraine, with better-trained soldiers arriving at the frontline, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces said. But Russia was using a lot of old equipment because it had no other way of replenishing supplies, and the Russians had made only slow progress around Bakhmut, one of the main battle zones in eastern Ukraine, Reuters reported. Vladimir Putin has driven across the Kerch Bridge linking Russia and the Crimean peninsula that was damaged by a truck bomb in October. The Russian president spoke to workers and a senior government official, Reuters reported. India gave a list of its products to Moscow for access to Russian markets, foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said, as his country seeks to narrow a growing trade deficit with Russia at a time when Moscow faces acute shortages of some crucial materials after western sanctions. The Kremlin has warned the new western price cap on Russian oil will destabilise global energy markets, but claimed it would not affect its invasion of Ukraine. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was preparing its response to the move by the G7 and allies. The Chinese foreign ministry has said it will continue energy cooperation with Russia after the G7, EU and Australia imposed the price cap. China, which said it would continue on the basis of respect and mutual benefit, has increased its purchases of Russia’s Urals oil blends this year. Olaf Scholz has warned the west to avoid creating a new cold war by dividing the world into blocs. Writing in an opinion piece for Foreign Affairs magazine, the German chancellor called for every effort to be made to build new partnerships."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/feb/03/this-is-bullying-how-much-of-your-money-are-gas-suppliers-holding","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-03T13:43:00Z","webTitle":"‘This is bullying’: How much of your money are gas suppliers holding?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/03/this-is-bullying-how-much-of-your-money-are-gas-suppliers-holding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/feb/03/this-is-bullying-how-much-of-your-money-are-gas-suppliers-holding","fields":{"headline":"‘This is bullying’: How much of your money are gas suppliers holding?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Mark Wilson was furious on receiving a message asking him to bring his energy account “back on track”. Ovo, which had taken on his supply after acquiring SSE’s retail arm, was proposing to increase his monthly direct debit from £102 to £168. Wilson* had built up £500 in credit, and had even reduced his direct debits previously as his regular payments were overshooting consumption. “This is the most outrageous and terrifyingly abusive email,” he wrote to Ovo. “How can I need to get back on track when I am not off track, never have been, and am not likely to leave the rails? This is bullying.” Wilson was not the only one to receive a nasty shock this winter, as some companies sought to increase customer direct debit payments – even for those who had built up healthy credit balances. It emerged last week that while Britons were sat indoors in woolly hats with the heating off to save on bills, suppliers had hoarded an estimated £9bn of customer cash by November last year, more than four times previous calculations. In Wilson’s case, Ovo later said readings passed on by SSE were wrong, apologised, and offered to reduce his direct debit payments. Typically energy customers on direct debits will build up credit during summer, when usage is low, and suppliers will run that down over the pricey winter months. However, the surge in wholesale gas prices, which began in 2021, has tested existing norms and exposed some of the cascade of suppliers that went bust while using customer money to fund their business. An industry row over whether customer deposits should be ringfenced ensued. Ofgem accused suppliers of using customers “like an interest-free company credit card” but later stopped short of ordering full ringfencing. Now – with energy suppliers already in the crosshairs over their treatment of often-vulnerable prepayment customers – there are fears this situation could be repeated as energy rationing and high prices play havoc with billing. The Guardian asked Britain’s biggest energy suppliers how they were treating customer credit balances. Centrica (British Gas) Total residential customers: 7.3 million Direct debit customers: About 3.75 million Centrica, which has been most vociferous in calling for ringfencing, said it has about £400m in customer deposits held in a separate account, holding about £130 per customer. The company’s division supplying household energy is expected to make a loss in the second half of its financial year, but a surge in wholesale gas prices has led the group to upgrade profit expectations three times as its finances are boosted by soaring wholesale gas prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “The real question is whether customers can be repaid [their credit balances] on demand. We can, as this money is not being used for working capital. It is only used to buy energy,” a spokesperson said. Chief executive Chris O’Shea has also expressed concerns that suppliers are being paid government money upfront to cut bills, risking going bust while holding taxpayer cash. O’Shea was under pressure this week after it was alleged that agents working on behalf of British Gas had broken into homes to fit prepayment meters when there were signs that young children and people with disabilities lived in the properties. Eon Total customers: 5.6 million Direct debit customers: About 2 million Eon expressed dismay at Ofgem’s decision not to ringfence customer credit balances after the failure of about 30 energy suppliers, which ultimately cost customers billions. The supplier, which took overNpower’s retail arm in 2019, has called for a social tariff to prevent vulnerable customers from paying high energy bills. Eon declined to give an average customer credit balance or say how much in customer credit it held. Chief executive Michael Lewis told the Guardian: “Ofgem’s own report says companies were allowed to enter this market on a ‘free bet’, with the cost ultimately getting picked up by customers around the country. “Our view is that this ‘free bet’ has to end. It can’t be acceptable that new suppliers are allowed to gamble with customers’ money, which is why we’re disappointed Ofgem has changed its mind on ringfencing credit balances.” Ovo Energy Total customers: Nearly 5 million Direct debit customers: Undisclosed At the start of the pandemic, Ovo received an £8.9m fine from Ofgem for communications and billing issues. The regulator found inaccurate annual statements were sent to more than 500,000 customers over a period of three years and Ovo underestimated consumption over one winter, meaning customers were under or overcharged. More recently, customers have reported issues with their Ovo bills, including one who was told she owed £44,800 for two months’ supply to her one-bedroom flat. The supplier is understood to have argued against ringfencing customer money. Ovo declined to give an average customer credit balance, say how much in customer credit it held or comment for this article. EDF Total customers: 5.2 million Direct debit customers: About 2 million The energy supplier, which is owned by the French state and runs Britain’s nuclear power stations, said all of its customers are in credit and debit to it at different points in the year, depending on usage. It is understood EDF held typically held about £300m of residential customer credit during 2021, but was owed more than £1bn by customers through the year on average. EDF said it is “supportive” of Ofgem’s efforts to improve the financial resilience of energy suppliers. A spokesperson said: “We don’t use credit balances to fund our business growth. We support targeted, risk-based measures that ensure suppliers are financially responsible and protect customers.” EDF said it reviews each account twice a year to assess the risk of getting into debt or building up too much credit based on their usage and prices in the market. EDF declined to give an average customer credit balance. Octopus Energy Total customers: 3.4 million (“almost all” direct debit customers) Octopus vehemently opposed the proposition to ringfence customer deposits. It has argued it instead favours an insurance policy for credit balances, comparable with the kind provided by holidaymakers through the ATOL scheme, as this would provide the same level of protection but cost five to 10 times less than ringfencing credit balances. The supplier stated that it “does not use customer credit balances to fund its business operations” and said that, for nine months of the year, customers owe the firm more money than is owed to them. Octopus said “whilst our customer credit balances were £660m at the end of November, at the same time our customers owed us £510m for energy they had used and not yet paid for” – meaning it held £150m in the month at which credit balances are their highest, at the start of winter. On average, it held £44 per customer. The company, which also owns Bulb, said it has used the £1bn of funding it has raised from investors, including Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management to invest and grow. ScottishPower Total customers: Nearly 5 million Direct debit customers: About 3 million The Glasgow-based supplier, which is owned by Spain’s Iberdrola, reviews customer accounts every three months. It said its customers “see the benefit of spreading the cost of their energy over the year” to protect against high winter bills. The company’s chief executive, Keith Anderson, has been vocal during the energy crisis, with concerns over the number of Britons falling into fuel poverty. “As the UK’s only integrated electricity company, investing £10bn in the UK by 2025, ScottishPower does not rely on credit balances for working capital,” a spokesperson said. ScottishPower declined to give an average customer credit balance or say how much in customer credit it held. Christine Farnish, a former Ofgem board member, has said that “firms are collecting more than they absolutely need”. Darren Jones, chairman of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee which studied ringfencing, says: “On first look, it makes sense to ringfence customer balances because it’s customers’ money and a few companies that went bust last year had such bad practice relying on spending other people’s money that they didn’t run their business well enough, and walked away with millions of customers money. “But, in reality, if you do ringfence it gives an advantage to larger listed players over privately owned and smaller companies because they can draw down capital more cheaply, which would result in higher prices for customers with smaller companies.” Ofgem suggests consumers who believe suppliers have amassed too much of their money contact the firm to ask for their money back. Last July, Ofgem accused five suppliers of “moderate or severe” weaknesses in the way they charge customers direct debits. It ordered suppliers that had increased direct debits by more than 100% to review them, affecting more than 500,000 customers. With consumers rationing their energy use, predicting and calculating bills has become difficult for suppliers. With bills expected to remain much higher than historical averages for some time, that situation is unlikely to let up. *Name has been changed"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/06/us-conservatives-pushing-russian-spin-ukraine-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-06T09:00:06Z","webTitle":"Top US conservatives pushing Russia’s spin on Ukraine war, experts say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/us-conservatives-pushing-russian-spin-ukraine-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/06/us-conservatives-pushing-russian-spin-ukraine-war","fields":{"headline":"Top US conservatives pushing Russia’s spin on Ukraine war, experts say","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ever since Russia launched its brutal war in Ukraine the Kremlin has banked on American conservative political and media allies to weaken US support for Ukraine and deployed disinformation operations to falsify the horrors of the war for both US and Russian audiences, say disinformation experts. Some of the Kremlin’s most blatant falsehoods about the war aimed at undercutting US aid for Ukraine have been promoted by major figures on the American right, from Holocaust denier and white supremacist Nick Fuentes to ex-Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Fox News star Tucker Carlson, whose audience of millions is deemed especially helpful to Russian objectives. On a more political track, House Republican Freedom Caucus members such as Paul Gosar, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Scott Perry – who in May voted with 54 other Republican members against a $40bn aid package for Ukraine, and have raised other concerns about the war – have proved useful, though perhaps unwitting, Kremlin allies at times. Pro-Moscow video materials from the network RT (formerly Russia Today), which early this year shuttered its US operations, have been featured on Rumble, a video sharing platform popular with conservatives that last year received major financing from a venture capital firm co-founded by recently elected Republican Ohio senator JD Vance and backed by billionaire Peter Thiel. As Republicans will control the House in 2023, the influence of these Ukraine aid critics in Congress and Moscow-friendly media on the right led by Carlson is expected to increase. But analysts say they’re unlikely to block a Biden administration request to Congress in mid-November for over $37bn in emergency aid for Ukraine, although they may try to pare it back. Republican House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, who looks poised to become speaker in January, threatened pre-election that if the GOP won the majority, it wouldn’t back a “blank check” for Ukraine. There are signs that the conservative wing of the Republican party and its media allies are already ratcheting up their criticism of US backing for Ukraine. For instance, Perry, the chair of the rightwing Freedom Caucus, in October floated the idea of Republicans using their anticipated control of the House to investigate the Biden administration’s efforts and policies involving Ukraine-Russia peace talks. Moscow’s political friends on the far right have also become more vocal in pushing falsehoods and have hosted some Freedom Caucus members to showcase their influence. Fuentes infamously dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last month despite his long record of cozying up to Russian president Vladimir Putin and his antisemitic and white supremacist remarks. Back in March, Fuentes said on his podcast: “We continue to support czar Putin in the war effort.” Fuentes also falsely claimed the Russian war in Ukraine was “not aggression” and its goals were “not unreasonable”, repeating the Kremlin line that Moscow is trying to denazify Ukraine. In a similar, albeit somewhat less inflammatory vein, Carlson’s pro-Moscow spin and distortions about the war have been palpable since the start and seem to have increased in recent months. Russian media often rebroadcasts the Fox News host’s comments and praises Carlson. “We’ve entered a new phase, one in which the United States is directly at war with the largest nuclear power in the world,” Carlson with considerable hyperbolic license warned his audience in late September. Disinformation experts note that in the run-up to the US midterm elections, conservative media stars such as Carlson, as well as Greene and other far-right members of Congress, became more vocal about blocking Ukraine assistance, and calling for audits of American assistance. “Marjorie Taylor Green’s introduction of a resolution to audit aid to Ukraine is entirely unsurprising given the pervasively negative messaging about Ukraine coming from the right flank of the GOP over the past three months,” Bret Schafer, a senior fellow with the Alliance for Securing Democracy, said. Prior to the 8 November elections, he noted that “of the 100 most retweeted tweets about Ukraine posted by GOP candidates for the House since August, roughly 90% opposed continued support for Ukraine. Though much of that messaging plays to simple pocketbook concerns – essentially saying, ‘Why are we supporting Ukraine when Americans are struggling to pay their bills?’ – there is also a strain of anti-Ukrainian disinformation that colors some of their commentary.” Schafer added that “although most members of Congress support Ukraine, the loudest members do not, and their voices are dominating online spaces”. John Sipher, who served in the CIA’s national clandestine services for 28 years with a stint leading its Russia operations, said that Putin is using a playbook that he honed during his long career with the KGB to influence policy and Russian opinion. “I think Putin’s weakness is that he is not a strategic thinker but reverts to what he knows – using covert means to influence and undermine others,” Sipher said. “He cannot win on the battlefield so he uses threats and intimidations to influence and scare western leaders into backing down or pushing Ukraine to the negotiating table.” Sipher noted that historically Putin “has weaponized energy, information, refugees, food and nuclear threats to get his way. I think his nuclear threats are just a means to sow unease and dissension among supporters of Ukraine, and suspect that the discussion of a ‘dirty bomb’ is meant to signal to his domestic audience that Ukraine is a real threat, and the population should support Putin’s tough measures.” In the US the audiences receiving pro-Putin messages have been boosted by Rumble, the video sharing platform, which has featured RT content including an interview with two Americans captured in Ukraine who were badly beaten by Russians and later released, as the New York Times last month reported. One of the two American men in the video clip told his interviewer while he was in custody that he had been deceived to fight in Ukraine by “propaganda from the west” that reported that Russians soldiers were “indiscriminately killing civilians”. Megan Squire, a deputy director for data analytics with the Southern Poverty Law Center, noted that Rumble has also been busy recycling pro-Putin and anti-Ukraine material from multiple figures on the right. “Alt-tech platforms such as Rumble are actively peddling the anti-Ukraine talking points of their heavy users, many of whom have been deplatformed elsewhere,” Squire said. “A simple search for ‘Ukraine’ in Rumble today shows that the top search results are for a Steve Bannon video where he promotes Marjorie Taylor Greene’s demands for an audit of Ukrainian relief funds, and junk news site Post Millennial, which is using Rumble to promote clips from a similar story from Tucker Carlson.” But for overall influence with American audiences, veteran Russia experts say Carlson’s big Fox megaphone still dwarfs other propaganda tools favorable to Moscow. “The audience for Fox News commentators like Tucker Carlson, who frequently spreads pro-Russian narratives, is obviously orders of magnitude bigger than that of new niche players like Rumble that often carry Russian disinformation,” said Andrew Weiss, a vice-president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Such platforms are far more impactful than the more sneaky techniques that the Russian propaganda apparatus employs these days.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/04/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-254-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T10:47:52Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 254 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/04/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-254-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/04/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-254-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 254 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"G7 foreign ministers have agreed on the need for a coordination mechanism to help Ukraine repair, restore and defend its critical energy and water infrastructure, a senior US state department official has said. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on Friday that he had agreed with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that grain sent under the Black Sea export deal should go to poor African countries for free. “In my phone call with Vladimir Putin, he said ‘Let’s send this grain to countries such as Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan for free’ – and we agreed,” Erdogan said in a speech to businesspeople in Istanbul. German chancellor Olaf Scholz is visiting China, and while there has urged Putin to extend the Black Sea grain deal when it expires on 19 November. Dmitry Medvedev, long-term ally of Vladimir Putin, current deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, and previously both president and prime minister of Russia, has issued a broadside this morning claiming that Russia’s war has “a sacred purpose” and that “The goal is to stop the supreme ruler of hell, no matter what name he uses – Satan, Lucifer or Iblis.” The mayor of Kyiv, Vitaliy Klitschko, has said 450,000 residents in the Ukrainian capital are without electricity on Friday morning. “This is one and a half times more than in previous days,” he said, adding the power system is overloaded. The UN nuclear watchdog said Thursday it had found no sign of undeclared nuclear activity at three sites in Ukraine that it inspected at Kyiv’s request, in response to Russian allegations that work was being done on a “dirty bomb”. “Our technical and scientific evaluation of the results we have so far did not show any sign of undeclared nuclear activities and materials at these three locations,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement, adding that environmental samples taken would be analysed. In southern Ukraine, a Russian-installed occupation official said Wedensday Moscow was likely to pull its troops from the west bank of the Dnipro River, signalling a huge retreat that, if confirmed, could be a major turning point in the war. “Most likely our units, our soldiers, will leave for the left [eastern] bank,” said Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-installed deputy civilian administrator of the Kherson region, in an interview with Solovyov Live, a pro-Kremlin online media outlet. Ukraine said it was wary that Moscow could be setting a trap by feigning a pull-out from the Kherson region and maintained its forces were still fighting in the area. Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command, said it could be a Russian trap. “This could be a manifestation of a particular provocation, in order to create the impression that the settlements are abandoned, that it is safe to enter them, while they are preparing for street battles,” she said in televised comments. “We continue fighting, also in the Kherson direction, despite the fact that the enemy is trying to convince us that they are leaving the settlements and creating the effect of a total evacuation.” US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, said Thursday he believes that Ukrainian forces are able to retake Kherson, calling their work “methodical” and “effective”. Ukraine has described the forced relocation of its citizens in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as “deportations” and “war crimes”. Russian authorities in Kherson have been relocating civilians, claiming it is for their safety as Ukrainian forces move closer. One week after Russian authorities relocated 70,000 civilians from the right bank of the Dnipro River to the left bank, Russian authorities said they were moving 70,000 civilians from the left bank to be “temporarily resettled deep into the Kherson region, as well as to other regions of the Russian Federation,” citing “possible damage to the dam of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station”. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has again been disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged the remaining high voltage lines, leaving it with just diesel generators, Ukraine nuclear firm Energoatom said Thursday. The plant, in Russian hands but operated by Ukrainian workers, has 15 days’ worth of fuel to run the generators, Energoatom said. Due to low morale and reluctance to fight, Russian forces have probably started deploying units threatening to shoot their own retreating soldiers, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. An intelligence report released early this morning described these Russian units as “barrier troops” or “blocking units” used to compel offensives. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has said that yesterday in Izium a 69-year-old man was blown up by a mine and hospitalised with moderate injuries. In a message on Telegram, he said that in the last day Ukrainian forces had neutralised “471 explosive objects” in the region. The Russian ambassador to the UK has claimed UK special forces were involved in a Ukrainian drone attack on Moscow’s Black Sea fleet. Andrei Kelin told Sky News: “We perfectly know about [the] participation of British specialists in [the] training, preparation and execution of violence against the Russian infrastructure and the Russian fleet in the Black Sea. We know that it has been done.” Kelin added: “This is a warning actually that Britain is too deep in this conflict. It means the situation is becoming more and more dangerous.” Another 107 Ukrainian service personnel were freed from Russian captivity in a prisoner of war swap, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed. “Many of them were wounded, and very seriously,” he said in his latest national address. Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered a one-time payment of 195,000 roubles (£2,800) for contract soldiers and those who have been mobilised to fight in Ukraine, the Kremlin said on Thursday. Last week Moscow said the “partial mobilisation” of 300,000 reservists was over but conceded there had been problems Volodymyr Zelenskiy has confirmed that he will not attend the G20 summit taking place in two weeks in Bali if Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation will be participating in the conference. US embassy officials in Russia visited jailed basketball star Brittney Griner on Thursday. The White House said officials were continuing to work toward a prisoner swap offer with Russia for the release of Griner – but elaborated no further on what that meant, or how soon that could take place."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jun/08/state-and-federal-energy-ministers-to-discuss-supply-issues-amid-soaring-power-costs","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-08T09:35:57Z","webTitle":"Bowen says ‘no silver bullet’ to lower prices as energy market operator given power to buy and store gas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/08/state-and-federal-energy-ministers-to-discuss-supply-issues-amid-soaring-power-costs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jun/08/state-and-federal-energy-ministers-to-discuss-supply-issues-amid-soaring-power-costs","fields":{"headline":"Bowen says ‘no silver bullet’ to lower prices as energy market operator given power to buy and store gas","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australian governments have agreed to set up a new gas storage reserve, proceed with plans to build up spare electricity capacity, and develop a national transition plan to reduce greenhouse gases. The changes were among 11 agreements reached during the first meeting of energy ministers since the election of the Albanese federal government. The gathering of state, territory and commonwealth ministers on Wednesday came about a week after a gas shortage in several states prompted the market operator to cap prices. A deep cold snap also helped send wholesale electricity prices soaring in the National Electricity Market. The video-linked meeting was described by participants as “very collegiate”, and “very different” from previous meetings held during the Morrison government. Among the priorities was an agreement to order the Australian Energy Market Operator to be begin work on buying and storing gas “for situations exactly like the ones we faced last week”, federal climate and energy minister Chris Bowen said. “Australians might be surprised to learn that that power did not exist, that [Aemo] could not procure some gas and keep it in reserve to be released for urgent and crisis situations,” Bowen said, adding it was technically possible with storage facilities “around the country”. No timetable was given, but Aemo had the power to act “expeditiously”. It won’t be immediate “but it will give us the capacity and the tools necessary to manage this crisis going forward, and to avoid crises like this into the future”, Bowen said. The Energy Security Board along with the Australian Energy Markets Commission were also asked to develop a brief “at pace” on plans for a so-called capacity market for the electricity supply in the eastern states. Western Australia has operated a similar back-up reserve of power generation capacity since 2006. “From opposition, I said that we supported the principle of a capacity mechanism provided it was consistent with net zero and encouraged new technology,” Bowen said, adding ministers had “endorsed effectively” that approach, a draft of which should be produced by regulators “within coming days”. In a nod to the new government’s emphasis of climate change, the ministers also agreed to work on a National Transition Plan on how the economy would be weaned off fossil fuels. They would prepare more work on this scheme in time for their next meeting planned for July. The new agreement “could reframe and reset existing priorities, frameworks and governance to ensure the sector can chart the course out of the current challenges, and set the sector up for a stable transformation towards decarbonisation,” the meeting’s communique said. Another agreement involved enhancing the powers of the regulators to ensure they have full transparency, particularly in the gas market, and to ensure that all behaviour is in the best interest of the market and consumers, Bowen said. There were, however, “no silver bullet, no magic answers” to lowering energy prices, he said, adding a lack of planning in the past had led to the crisis facing the sector. “We need more transmission, we need more renewables, we need more storage,” Bowen said. Coal-fired power plant reliability was also an issue discussed at the meeting, with ministers agreeing to work with rail authorities to secure black coal supplies “and with power station operators to get generation back online as quickly as possible”. Prior to the meeting, senior energy policy adviser for the Ai Group, Tennant Reed, said Australia was facing an “acute crisis”. Last week, market regulators had to intervene to put a limit on gas prices in Victoria and the Sydney market at $40 a gigajoule, or about four times the standard price. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered a jump in global energy prices, and the exit of a gas retailer, Weston Energy, in late May sent companies scrambling for supplies, propelling local prices higher. With electricity prices partly set by the cost of gas, wholesale power markets have also risen several times the $87/megawatt-hour average during the March quarter in the eastern states. The lengthy cold weather snap has also elevated demand. A report by energy expert Hugh Saddler and published by the ANU Institute for Climate, Energy &amp; Disaster Solutions on Wednesday showed average wholesale power prices had been steady until March 2021 but had taken off since. “[O]ver the 12 months from May 2021 to May 2022, monthly median spot wholesale prices increased by over five times in Victoria and South Australia, six times in Tasmania and New South Wales, and seven times in Queensland,” the report said. Ahead of the meeting, scheduled for 4pm AEST, Victoria’s energy and environment minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, highlighted the need for changes to federal settings on gas, saying not enough was being reserved for Australian use. Western Australia sets aside 15% of production for domestic use but there are no formal limits for the eastern states. Discussions of gas reserves, however, were a national responsibility, Bowen said, indicating the subject was not subject to energy ministers’ approval. “Energy ministers agreed governments must be ready to act to implement further measures should they be deemed consistent with both our domestic and international commitments,” according to the communique from the meeting. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Ai Group’s Reed said the change of federal government should usher in closer coordination across states, territories and the commonwealth. “The early signs are that there’s a good new set of relationships,” he said. “And that is promising.” The coordination will also extend to senior officers working together and reporting back to ministers “on the potential for the aggregation of renewable energy and storage projects across the nation”. “ This would help identify significant supply chain and onshoring opportunities for manufacturing, minerals processing, and to manage global equipment supply and cost issues,” the communique said. The ESB had already begun work on post-2025 energy market design, including the proposed development of a capacity mechanism. According to the communique, advancing work on a capacity mechanism was “a priority to bring on renewables and storage to support stability for the national energy market”, with no mention of coal or gas. In a nod to energy retailers who are struggling to stay in business as they are caught between rising gas and electricity costs and fixed contracts with consumers, the Australian Energy Market Commission was asked to prepare an urgent review by July of the Retailer of Last Resort scheme. The aim is “to improve resilience in the system and better manage retailer failures”. Reed said “you could make a case for a capacity mechanism” but it was important that the design not lock in high cost and potentially high emission sources of energy. It would also not provide any near-term benefit to the market and would have to be designed to minimise disruption and avoid scaring off investors. Bowen’s comments on Wednesday echo those he made at a conference last October, where he said an Albanese government would set several tests for any proposal to lock in extra capacity and improve grid reliability. These implied it would not support a system which extended the life of coal power plants. “Firstly, it must be consistent with our emissions reductions ambitions, including net zero by 2050 and a strong roadmap to get there,” he said. “Secondly, it must encourage investment in renewable energy, rather than chilling it as many fear. “Third, it must be a bridge to dispatchable technologies like hydrogen, batteries and pumped hydro, not an indefinite subsidy for old technologies,” Bowen said. “And fourth, it must actually ensure that generators dispatch when needed.” Bowen noted that commonwealth-owned Snowy Hydro had recently refused to dispatch electricity from its Colongra gas plant below the market price cap of $15,000, an act he said was “reprehensible”. New National party leader, David Littleproud, meanwhile, earlier renewed his calls for the Albanese government to consider support for nuclear energy and even convene a national energy summit – issues not expected to get much heed at Wednesday’s meeting. “Small scale modular nuclear power should be included in that conversation as a source of reliable energy and a way of reducing the emissions,” Littleproud said. “A national energy summit that convened pre-eminent scientists, energy experts, economists as well as political leaders would be a positive contribution for policy development,” he said. Littleproud said his party was “not advocating large scale nuclear power plants”, rather smaller ones, but wanted “an agnostic debate on all energy sources available to Australia”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/dec/18/russia-ukraine-war-power-restored-to-6-million-ukrainians-after-strikes-says-zelenskiy-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-18T18:26:30Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: ‘fragile morale’ among Russian forces, says UK – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/18/russia-ukraine-war-power-restored-to-6-million-ukrainians-after-strikes-says-zelenskiy-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/dec/18/russia-ukraine-war-power-restored-to-6-million-ukrainians-after-strikes-says-zelenskiy-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: ‘fragile morale’ among Russian forces, says UK – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We are closing this blog now but you can read all our Ukraine coverage here. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Sunday proposed holding a global peace summit this winter, in a video message Kyiv was hoping would be broadcast ahead of the World Cup final in Qatar, although it appeared unlikely Fifa would allow the move.It was reported on Friday that Zelenskiy had asked world soccer’s governing body to let him share a message of peace before the final. “We offered peace formula to the world. Absolutely fair. We offered it because there are no champions in war, there can be no draw,” Zelenskiy said in a video message issued by his office. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “opened the gates of hell”, unleashing “every evil” force worldwide from murder and rape in occupied territory to famine and debt in Africa and Europe. Welby, the highest-ranking cleric in the worldwide Anglican communion, travelled to Ukraine last month to meet church leaders and Christians as well as those displaced by the conflict. He said he had been struck by the “size of the mass graves in Bucha, the photos of what had been done to the people there, the rape, the massacres, the torture by the occupying Russian forces”. Fragile morale almost certainly continues to be a significant vulnerability across much of the Russian force, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said in its latest defence intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine. In its daily briefing posted on Twitter, the MoD said soldiers’ concerns primarily focus on very high casualty rates, poor leadership, pay problems, lack of equipment and ammunition, and lack of clarity about the war’s objectives. Heating has been fully restored to Kyiv after the latest Russian bombardment that targeted water and power infrastructure, the capital’s mayor said on Sunday. Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app: “The city is restoring all services after the latest shelling. In particular, the capital’s heat supply system was fully restored. All sources of heat supply work normally.” Ukraine worked to restore electricity and water supplies on Saturday after Russia’s latest wave of attacks pitched multiple cities into darkness and forced people to endure sub-zero temperatures without heating or running water. Agence France-Presse reported that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Saturday that while electricity had been restored to almost 6 million Ukrainians, there were ongoing problems with heat and water supplies and “large-scale outages” in many regions. Russian president Vladimir Putin has held meetings with his military commanders and sought their proposals on how Russia’s campaign in Ukraine should proceed, during a visit to the operation’s headquarters, the Kremlin said. Russia has claimed its mass strikes against Ukraine on Friday were part of preventing foreign weapons being delivered to Ukraine. On Friday, “military command systems, the military-industrial complex and their supporting energy facilities of Ukraine were hit with a mass strike with high-precision weapons”, Russia’s defence ministry said in its daily briefing. The attacks have prompted accusations from Ukraine’s allies of war crimes. This is the drone video footage showing the explosions in Bakhmut, eastern Ukraine, which has been verified by the Guardian and Reuters. Moscow has denied it plans to increase the period of mandatory military service from six months to a year. A video showing Lieutenant Colonel Mikhail Fotin initially making the claim was later deleted, Sky News reported. The Russian defence ministry said it is “not considering any changes to the legal code of the Russian Federation”, adding this is “concerning changes to the length of military service by conscription”. It has been more than three months since two of the UK’s most senior judges sifted through thousands of pages of evidence and heard opposing arguments from some of the country’s lawyers about whether or not the government’s controversial plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda are lawful. On Monday at 10.30am, at the Royal Courts of Justice, they will deliver their judgment. Hayat (not his real name) an asylum seeker from Eritrea, lost both his parents when he was a child. He tried to find safety first in Ethiopia and then Sudan before managing to reach Russia in 2018 and then travelling on to Ukraine, where he claimed asylum. But no decision had been made about his case when Russia invaded Ukraine in February so, unlike Ukrainian citizens who were eligible to apply for a visa to come to the UK, he fled to France and arrived in the UK using the dangerous small boat route. “They have accepted thousands of Ukrainian refugees – so what about us? We are from the same place, so why are we being treated differently?” he asked. Here is my colleague Jon Henley’s coverage of the restoration of heating to Kyiv, announced this morning by the city’s mayor. Heating has been fully restored to Kyiv after the latest Russian bombardment, the city’s mayor has said, as Moscow unveiled plans to deploy musicians to the frontline in Ukraine in a drive to boost morale among its troops. Vitali Klitschko said on Sunday morning the capital was successfully “restoring all services after the latest shelling” and that “in particular, the capital’s heating supply system is fully restored. All sources of heat supply work normally.” Russia fired more than 70 missiles targeting Ukraine’s water and energy infrastructure on Friday in one of its heaviest barrages since the beginning of its invasion on 24 February, causing power blackouts and removing access to heat and water. Temperatures in Kyiv and across the country were below freezing on Sunday and forecast to fall to -6C (21.2F) by evening. Up to a third of the capital’s population of 3 million were still without electricity overnight in what officials called a “difficult and critical” situation. Full story is here: The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has posted images on Twitter of Ukrainian soldiers training in the north of England. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Sunday proposed holding a global peace summit this winter, in a video message Kyiv was hoping would be broadcast ahead of the World Cup final in Qatar, although it appeared unlikely Fifa would allow the move. It was reported on Friday that Zelenskiy had asked world soccer’s governing body to let him share a message of peace before the final. “We offered peace formula to the world. Absolutely fair. We offered it because there are no champions in war, there can be no draw,” Zelenskiy said in a video message issued by his office. “I announce the initiative to hold a global peace formula summit this winter. The summit to unite all nations of the world around the cause of global peace. Stadium stands get empty after the match, and after the war cities remain empty,” he said. Zelenskiy had wanted to appear via video link before Argentina take on defending champions France at Doha’s Lusail Stadium for the final with an expected global audience of hundreds of millions, it was reported. Fifa did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but it appeared unlikely to give Zelenskiy a platform given its stance on political messages at the World Cup. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter that Fifa “shows a lack of understanding of the disaster that the Russian federation is dragging the world into by starting a war in Ukraine”. My colleague Julian Borger has written a piece on the role of computer software in the war in Ukraine – a “decisive weapon” in the effort to force back the Russian invasion. He writes: Inside, the weapon glows from a dozen computer screens – a constantly updated portrayal of the evolving battlefield to the south. With one click on a menu, the map is populated with hordes of orange diamonds, showing Russian deployments. They reveal where tanks and artillery have been hidden, and intimate details of the units and the soldiers in them, gleaned from social media. Choosing another option from the menu lights up red arrows across the southern Zaporizhzhia region, showing the progression of Russian columns. Zooming in shows satellite imagery of the terrain in sharp detail. It is called Delta, a software package developed by Ukrainian programmers to give their armed forces an advantage in a contest of which side can see the battlefield more clearly and therefore predict the enemy forces’ moves and strike them faster and more accurately. While many scenes from the war in Ukraine look like a throwback to the first world war, with muddy trench networks and blasted landscapes, the conflict is also a testing ground for the future of warfare, where information and its dissemination in instantly usable form to individual soldiers will be critical to victory or defeat. Read the full article here: Significant fighting is taking place in the eastern Donetsk city of Bakhmut in Ukraine. Once home to 72,000, the civilian population has dwindled to 12,000 over the past six months, surviving in basements and supplied by mobile grocery trucks that enter the city when they can. Here are images uploaded today from the city. Russian military forces on Sunday shelled the centre of Kherson, the major city that Russian soldiers retreated from last month in one of Moscow’s biggest battlefield setbacks in Ukraine, AP reports. Three people were wounded in the attacks, said presidential deputy chief of staff Kyrylo Tymoshenko. The southern city and its surrounding region have come under frequent attack since the Russian pullback. Volunteers in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv have made a Christmas tree out of camouflage nets, the BBC reports. After the holidays, the nets will be donated to soldiers fighting on the frontline. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine, has posted an image of the tree on Twitter. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “opened the gates of hell”, unleashing “every evil” force worldwide from murder and rape in occupied territory to famine and debt in Africa and Europe. Welby, the highest-ranking cleric in the worldwide Anglican communion, travelled to Ukraine last month to meet church leaders and Christians as well as those displaced by the conflict. He said he had been struck by the “size of the mass graves in Bucha, the photos of what had been done to the people there, the rape, the massacres, the torture by the occupying Russian forces”. And he said the repercussions of the invasion were also being felt far beyond Ukraine’s borders. “Effectively we’re in the same struggle at one remove. When Ukraine was invaded at the decision of President (Vladimir) Putin, the gates of hell were opened and every evil force came out across the world,” he told BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuennsberg. “I was in Mozambique the week before I was in Ukraine where there is famine all the way up the East African coast,” he said. “There is inflation … there’s an energy crisis, there’s suffering, there’s shortages of drugs, everything evil has been unleashed and until there is withdrawal and ceasefire we can’t make progress on reconciliation,” he added. In the UK, he said, rising food and fuel prices at least partly driven by the conflict had resulted in a 400% rise in the past 18 months in people seeking help from food banks. “We are seeing debt rising, pressures on families just at all sorts of levels,” he added. Welby has been publicly critical of Russia’s war on Ukraine, calling its invasion in February “an act of great evil”. Visiting Mozambique the week before his Ukraine trip, he travelled to the jihadist-hit Cabo Delgado region where he met survivors of the insurgency there. Earlier this month, the US committed a further $2.5bn in food assistance to Africa, pledging to help the continent cope with rising prices blamed in part on Russia’s invasion of breadbasket Ukraine. The Horn of Africa has been hit especially hard after successive failed rainy seasons, with the United Nations saying that aid has staved off fully fledged famine in Somalia. Four people in the southern Russian region of Belgorod near the border with Ukraine were wounded by shelling on Sunday, the governor of the region said, Reuters reported. “Our air defence system was activated over Belgorod and the Belgorod region,” Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. “Four people are known to have been injured. Medical teams are taking them to hospital,” he said. Gladkov gave no further details of the incident. Three witnesses told Reuters that loud blasts were heard in the city on Sunday. Belgorod is one of several southern Russian regions where targets such as fuel and ammunition stores have been rocked by explosions since the start of what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine on 24 February. Fragile morale almost certainly continues to be a significant vulnerability across much of the Russian force, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said in its latest defence intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine. In its daily briefing posted on Twitter, the MoD said soldiers’ concerns primarily focus on very high casualty rates, poor leadership, pay problems, lack of equipment and ammunition, and lack of clarity about the war’s objectives. It said the establishment of two frontline “creative brigades” tasked with raising the morale of troops through providing entertainment and musical instruments among other things is “unlikely to substantively alleviate these concerns”. See the full briefing below: The people the Greeks called Scythians were formidable warriors and nomads who dominated the Eurasian steppe for more than 1,000 years from about 800BC – long before the creation of national borders. The fabulous gold weapons and ornaments they left behind ended up in museums across the region, many of them in Ukraine. Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine in February, however, much Scythian gold – along with millions of other priceless artefacts – has been looted or “evacuated”. Serhii Telizhenko, of the National Institute of Archaeology in Kyiv, who has been monitoring the wave of destruction, said he realised there would be losses after the invasion, “but I could not imagine the scale”. The time is approaching for a negotiated peace in Ukraine to reduce the risk of another devastating world war, but dreams of breaking up Russia could unleash nuclear chaos, the veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger said. Kissinger, an architect of the cold war policy of detente towards the Soviet Union as secretary of state under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, has met Vladimir Putin multiple times since he first became president in 2000. The Kremlin says Kyiv must acknowledge Moscow’s annexation of southern and eastern regions. Ukraine says every Russian soldier must leave its territory, including Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. “The time is approaching to build on the strategic changes which have already been accomplished and to integrate them into a new structure towards achieving peace through negotiation,” Kissinger wrote in The Spectator magazine. “A peace process should link Ukraine to Nato, however expressed. The alternative of neutrality is no longer meaningful,” Kissinger wrote in the Spectator magazine in an article entitled “How to avoid another world war”. Kissinger, 99, suggested that if it proved impossible to return to the status quo established in 2014, internationally supervised referendums in territory claimed by Russia could be an option. He warned that desires to render Russia “impotent”, or even seek the dissolution of Russia, could unleash chaos. Neither Ukraine nor any western state has advocated either path. “The dissolution of Russia or destroying its ability for strategic policy could turn its territory encompassing 11 time zones into a contested vacuum,” Kissinger said. “Its competing societies might decide to settle their disputes by violence. Other countries might seek to expand their claims by force. All these dangers would be compounded by the presence of thousands of nuclear weapons which make Russia one of the world’s two largest nuclear powers.” Russia may attempt to re-enact a version of its original invasion plans, Ukrainian military officials believe, as Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned this weekend that Vladimir Putin still has enough missiles to order more heavy strikes. The Ukrainian president was speaking in the aftermath of the latest wave of missiles to target his country’s critical energy infrastructure after Russia launched 98 rockets at 20 cities and towns on Friday. Officials said on Saturday, however, that repairs had been speedy with water supply restored throughout Kyiv and two-thirds of the capital now connected to electricity while the country’s second-biggest city, Kharkiv, had been reconnected to the grid after suffering a total blackout. The infrastructure update arrived as a Ukrainian military commander warned Russia may again attempt to seize Kyiv after invading from Belarus in the north, potentially around the late February anniversary of when Putin first ordered his troops to invade. Mark Townsend and Isobel Koshiw in Kyiv report here: Germany has inaugurated its first liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, built in record time, as the country scrambles to adapt to life without Russian energy. The rig in the North Sea port of Wilhelmshaven was opened by the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, at a ceremony on Saturday onboard a specialist vessel known as an FSRU, named the Hoegh Esperanza. He said from the boat: It’s a good day for our country and a sign to the whole world that the German economy will be able to remain strong. Agence France-Presse also reported that the Hoegh Esperanza sounded its horn as the chancellor, dressed in a hi-vis jacket, approached. The ship has already been stocked with gas from Nigeria that could supply 50,000 homes for a year, and the terminal is set to begin deliveries on 22 December. Germany plans to open four more government-funded LNG terminals over the next few months as well as a private terminal in the port of Lubmin. Together, the terminals could deliver 30bn cubic metres of gas a year from next year, or a third of Germany’s total gas needs – if Berlin can find enough LNG to service them. LNG terminals allow for the import by sea of natural gas that has been chilled and turned into a liquid to make it easier to transport. The installation of a protective dome has begun over the spent-fuel storage area at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, an official from the province’s Moscow-installed authorities said. Vladimir Rogov said the dome would protect against fragments of shells and improvised explosive devices carried by drones, Associated Press reported. The Russian-occupied plant in south-east Ukraine – Europe’s biggest nuclear power station – has been repeatedly shelled and its six reactors have been shut down for months. The International Atomic Energy Agency recently announced plans to station nuclear safety and security experts at Ukraine’s nuclear power plants to prevent any nuclear accident. The UN nuclear watchdog has already deployed a permanent mission to the Zaporizhzhia plant. Officials have reopened a popular Kyiv pedestrian bridge that had been damaged during an earlier air strike and were setting up a smaller-than-usual Christmas tree in a central square in the gloomy winter haze on Saturday. The vast space in front of the centuries-old St Sophia Cathedral is traditionally anchored by a hulking evergreen at Christmas, Reuters reported. But officials this year opted for a 12-metre (40ft) artificial tree festooned with energy-saving lights powered by a generator. Orthodox Christians make up the majority of Ukraine’s 43 million people. Klitschko said the tree was funded by donors and businesses and that no public celebrations would take place. Kyiv resident Iryna Soloychuk, who arrived with her daughter to see the tree just hours after another round of air-raid alerts wailed across the country, said: I doubt this will be a true holiday. But we should understand that we’re all together, that we should help one another. Here are some of the latest Ukraine images coming in on the wires. Heating has been fully restored to Kyiv after the latest Russian bombardment that targeted water and power infrastructure, the capital’s mayor said on Sunday. Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app: The city is restoring all services after the latest shelling. In particular, the capital’s heat supply system was fully restored. All sources of heat supply work normally. Reuters also reported that Ukrainian officials said Russia fired more than 70 missiles on Friday in one of its heaviest barrages since the start of its invasion, forcing emergency blackouts nationwide and cutting access to heat and water. Temperatures in Kyiv and many places across Ukraine were below freezing on Sunday morning, with forecasts expecting them to dip to -6C (21.2F) in the capital by the evening. Kyiv is by far the largest city in Ukraine with an estimated population of about 3 million, with up to 2 million more in the Kyiv region. As of late Saturday, a third of the city remained without power. Sergei Kovalenko, chief executive of Yasno, which provides electricity for Kyiv, said late on Saturday that access to power has been increasing with each hour. He said on his Facebook account: The situation remains difficult and critical. Ukraine worked to restore electricity and water supplies on Saturday after Russia’s latest wave of attacks pitched multiple cities into darkness and forced people to endure sub-zero temperatures without heating or running water. Agence France-Presse reported that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Saturday that while electricity had been restored to almost 6 million Ukrainians, there were ongoing problems with heat and water supplies and “large-scale outages” in many regions. He said in his nightly address: The main thing today is energy. There is still a lot of work to do to stabilise the system. In Kyiv, the metro had stopped running so that people wrapped in winter coats could take shelter at underground stations. But mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Saturday the service had resumed, while water supply had also been restored and 75% of the city’s population had heating back. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, power had also been fully returned, regional governor Oleg Sinegubov said on Saturday, after the strikes had left Ukraine’s second city without electricity. Ukraine’s national energy provider Ukrenergo had imposed emergency blackouts in response to the strikes, warning the extent of the damage in the north, south and centre of the country meant it could take longer to restore supplies than after previous attacks. The country’s energy system “continues to recover”, it said on Saturday. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, inspected the country’s troops involved in Moscow’s “special military operation” in Ukraine, the defence ministry said on Sunday. The ministry said on the Telegram messaging app: The head of the Russian military flew around the areas of deployment of troops and checked the advanced positions of Russian units in the zone of the special military operation. Reuters also reported the ministry said Shoigu spoke with troops “on the frontline” and at a “command post”. However, it was not immediately clear when the visit took place or if Shoigu had visited Ukraine itself. A short video posted with the statement showed Shoigu in a military helicopter and a couple of aerial shots of empty swathes of land. The announcement comes a day after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, held a meeting with the country’s top brass, including Shoigu, seeking proposals on how they think Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine should proceed. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Adam Fulton and here’s a brief look at the latest news as it approaches 8.10am in Kyiv. Power has been restored to nearly 6 million Ukrainians after Friday’s barrage of Russian missile strikes against the country’s infrastructure, including its electricity generating systems. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address on Saturday: Repair work continues without a break after yesterday’s terrorist attack. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram on Saturday that heat had been restored for three-quarters of the capital’s residents and engineers were continuing to work to stabilise supply. However, half of the Kyiv province still lacked electricity on Saturday, regional governor Oleksiy Kuleba was quoted as saying, with snow and rain complicating efforts. In other recent developments: Russian president Vladimir Putin has held meetings with his military commanders and sought their proposals on how Russia’s campaign in Ukraine should proceed, during a visit to the operation’s headquarters, the Kremlin said. Russia has claimed its mass strikes against Ukraine on Friday were part of preventing foreign weapons being delivered to Ukraine. On Friday, “military command systems, the military-industrial complex and their supporting energy facilities of Ukraine were hit with a mass strike with high-precision weapons”, Russia’s defence ministry said in its daily briefing. The attacks have prompted accusations from Ukraine’s allies of war crimes. Rescuers have recovered the body of a one-and-a-half-year-old boy from the rubble of Friday’s Russian strike on a three-storey residential building in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipro region, the region’s governor said. In total, four people were killed in the attack on Kryvyi Rih, Valentyn Reznichenko said. Thirteen others, including four children, were injured. Russia has denounced a decision by Moldova to temporarily ban six television channels as “political censorship”. Moldova accused the channels of airing “incorrect information” about the country and Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. Moldova has reached a short-term energy deal that will help wean it off its dependence on Russian natural gas, a senior official said on Saturday. The Moldovan deputy prime minister, Andrei Spînu, said the state gas firm Moldovagaz would buy 100m cubic metres of gas from domestic supplier Energocom this month. Russia’s campaign of strikes against Ukrainian critical infrastructure has largely consisted of air- and maritime-launched cruise missiles but has almost certainly also included Iranian-provided drones, according to the UK’s Ministry of Defence. In its latest intelligence update it also said Russia was probably concerned about the “vulnerability” of Crimea. A Ukrainian military commander has said Russia may try to invade from the north, potentially around the anniversary of when Vladimir Putin first ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. Maj Gen Andrii Kovalchuk told Sky News the fiercest fighting might be ahead and appeared particularly focused on the possibility of Russian troops invading via Belarus, on Ukraine’s northern border, in order to target the capital. A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said it is “unrealistic” to expect Kyiv to come to an agreement with Russia to end the war. “War must end only with its defeat,” Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter, saying Ukraine would act with “required proportions of artillery, armoured vehicles, drones and long-range missiles”. A 36-year-old man was killed inside his car after Russian forces shelled the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Saturday morning, the regional governor, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said. A 70-year-old woman was also injured after Russian troops struck a western district of the city with artillery and multiple rocket launchers, Yanushevych wrote on Telegram."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/13/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-202-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-13T10:15:10Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 202 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/13/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-202-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/13/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-202-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 202 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country’s forces had taken back 6,000 sq km (2,400 square miles) of Russian-held territory in the country’s south and east. Ukraine’s forces have continued to press their counterattack in Kharkiv, seeking to take control of almost all of the province. Ukraine’s troops headed north, reportedly recapturing towns all the way to the Russian border. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said fighting is still raging in Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv region. Hanna Malyar said: “The aim is to liberate the Kharkiv region and beyond – all the territories occupied by the Russian Federation. Fighting is continuing. It is still early to say full control has been established over Kharkiv region. Our strength stems from the fact that we are very motivated and that we plan operations thoroughly.” The Ukrainian military says it had freed more than 20 settlements in 24 hours. In recent days, Kyiv’s forces have captured territory at least twice the size of greater London, according to the British Ministry of Defence. Ukraine’s military says the Antonivsky Bridge across the Dnieper River near occupied Kherson in the south is now unusable by Russian military The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said Ukrainian forces had made important progress in their counteroffensive against Russian troops, although it was too early to predict the outcome. “Clearly we’ve seen significant progress by the Ukrainians, particularly in the north-east, and that is a product of the support we’ve provided, but first and foremost it’s a product of the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukrainian people,” Blinken told reporters in Mexico City. Ukraine’s State Border Service has issued a video which purports to show soldiers tearing down Russian banners and burning the Russian flag in Vovchansk, which is in the north of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region and very close to the border with Russia. Russia’s military commanders have stopped sending new units into Ukraine after the counteroffensive, the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said on its Facebook page on Monday. “The current situation in the theatre of operations and distrust of the higher command forced a large number of volunteers to categorically refuse the prospect of service in combat conditions.” Russian troops have left behind stockpiles of ammunition and other supplies following Ukraine’s counteroffensive in Kharkiv oblast, the Kyiv Independent reports. One analyst estimated that more than 300 vehicles, including tanks, self-propelled mortars and supply trucks, had been lost between 7 and 11 September. Russia responded to the counteroffensive by launching missile strikes that cut electricity and water supplies in Kharkiv city for a second time in less than 24 hours, knocking out both on Monday morning just hours after the city authorities had restored 80% of the utilities that had been cut overnight. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, appeared on state TV on Monday evening, chairing a meeting on the economy at which he made no reference to the military situation and said Russia was holding up in the face of western sanctions. “The economic blitzkrieg tactics, the onslaught they were counting on, did not work”. Germany is well-positioned to get through the winter despite reduced gas flows from Russia thanks to measures including extending two nuclear power plants’ lifespans, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will say on Tuesday. Russia detained a top manager of an aviation factory on suspicion of passing secret military information to Ukraine, Russian news agencies reported on Tuesday, citing the FSB federal security agency. Clashes have erupted between Azerbaijani and Armenian troops, according to Russian news agencies, in a resumption of decades-old hostilities linked to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian government said it would invoke a cooperation agreement with Russia and appeal to a Russia-led security bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, as well as the UN security council. The US assesses that Russia has largely ceded its gains near Kharkiv and many retreating Russian soldiers have exited Ukraine, moving over the border back into Russia, a senior US military official said on Monday. However, the US-based Institute for the Study of War thinktank said that “Ukraine has turned the tide in its favour, but the current counteroffensive will not end the war”. Ukrainian authorities have said they are capturing so many Russian prisoners of war the country is running out of space to put them, the Associated Press reports. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich did not specify the number of Russian prisoners, but said the PoWs would be exchanged for Ukrainian service members held by Moscow. Military intelligence spokesperson Andrey Yusov said the captured troops included “significant” numbers of Russian officers. Municipal deputies from 18 districts of Moscow and St Petersburg have signed a public statement demanding that Vladimir Putin resign. “We, the municipal deputies of Russia, believe that the actions of President Vladimir Putin harm the future of Russia and its citizens,” read the statement published by Ksenia Torstrem, the municipal deputy of the Semenovsky district of St Petersburg. “Deputies are not yet forbidden to have an opinion. And it is also not forbidden to speak for the resignation of the president. He is not a monarch, but a hired worker, receives a salary from our taxes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/06/boris-johnson-to-attack-corrosive-cynicism-on-net-zero-at-cop27","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-06T22:30:31Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson to attack ‘corrosive cynicism’ on net zero at Cop27","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/06/boris-johnson-to-attack-corrosive-cynicism-on-net-zero-at-cop27","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/06/boris-johnson-to-attack-corrosive-cynicism-on-net-zero-at-cop27","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson to attack ‘corrosive cynicism’ on net zero at Cop27","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Boris Johnson will attack the “corrosive cynicism” on net zero that is hampering UK, and global, efforts to tackle the climate crisis, in a speech at the UN Cop27 climate summit on Monday. In a swipe at members of his own Conservative party, the former UK prime minister will contrast the success and spirit of optimism at Cop26 in Glasgow last November with the failures of governments – including the UK – to follow through on promises since. “Because the spike in oil and gas prices – and the consequent global inflation, the hikes in the cost of fertiliser and food, have had an impact here and everywhere, they have led some naysayers to a corrosive cynicism about net zero,” he will warn. Soon after the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow ended last November, some rightwing members of the UK’s ruling Conservative party – including many who originally backed Johnson for prime minister in the 2019 general election, but combined to help push him out of office in July – began to try to use the climate emergency as a “culture war” issue. They argued against the UK’s goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and set up a net zero scrutiny group of MPs to advocate for relaxing or reneging on the legally binding target. Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, which sent already rising gas prices soaring to record levels, added fuel to their efforts. Johnson, whose supporters have long claimed him as a green champion, will tell an audience at Cop27 on Monday: “We must end the defeatism that has crept in since last year, we must end Putin’s energy blackmail, we must keep up our campaign to end global dependence on hydrocarbons, and if we retain the spirit of creative and Promethean optimism we saw at Paris and Glasgow, then we can keep [the] 1.5C [limit on global temperature rises] alive.” Johnson is attending Cop27 as the guest of the Egyptian hosts. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak will also attend the Cop27 summit, having U-turned on his initial decision to snub the summit, which 110 world leaders will attend. He will hold meetings with French president, Emmanuel Macron, Italy’s prime minister, Georgia Meloni, and President William Ruto of Kenya. He is also expected to raise with the Egyptian government the issue of Alaa Abd El-Fattah, a British-Egyptian democracy activist and blogger who is on hunger strike in an Egyptian jail. Sunak will commit the UK to triple its funding for countries to adapt to the effects of extreme weather, from £500m in 2019 to £1.5bn in 2025, but there will be no new money for climate finance – the spending will come from the £11.6bn budget already agreed before Cop26. Sunak will say: “The world came together in Glasgow with one last chance to create a plan that would limit global temperatures to 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels]. The question today is: can we summon the collective will to deliver on those promises? I believe we can. By honouring the pledges we made in Glasgow, we can turn our struggle against climate change into a global mission for new jobs and clean growth. And we can bequeath our children a greener planet and a more prosperous future. That’s a legacy we could be proud of.” He is expected to herald progress on a UK initiative to conserve the world’s existing forests, and on ways to help communities where many jobs are currently dependent on fossil fuels to move to clean energy, the so-called “just transition”. Sir Keir Starmer, who is not at Cop27, will also mark the start of the conference by setting out proposals for clusters of net zero industry centred on steel, cement, ceramics and chemicals in areas including Humber and Teesside, Merseyside, Grangemouth and south Wales. Labour’s proposals would result in at least £1bn more invested in greening industry in the UK than under Conservative plans, Starmer will say. The money would come from a proposed National Wealth Fund. Labour accused the government of “dragging its feet on climate at every turn”, leaving British industry behind in the race for the clean and efficient technology of the future. Ed Miliband, shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said: “The Tories have shown us over the past 12 years that they simply do not understand the scale of the [climate] emergency. If Rishi Sunak can’t provide leadership on the world stage, we cannot expect him to lead at home.” Labour’s policies include an energy price freeze, paid for by a more effective windfall tax, along with a green prosperity plan for a national wealth fund and a national energy champion, GB Energy, to invest in renewable energy and nuclear power. Miliband said: “This is a plan that will drive jobs, support industries, tackle the cost of living, and protect our home for future generations by tackling the climate crisis. There is a global race on for the jobs of the future, and Britain under the Tories is falling behind.” About 110 heads of state and government are expected to gather in Sharm El-Sheikh on Monday for a two-day world leaders’ summit at the start of the fortnight of climate talks. The negotiations got off to a difficult start when countries stayed up to the early hours of Sunday morning wrangling over what should be on the agenda for the conference. The vexed issue of loss and damage will be an official agenda item at the talks, which will allow discussions on how poor countries can be helped to recover from the ravages of extreme weather that they are already experiencing. On Sunday, the UK formally handed over leadership of the global climate talks, a position it has held since the Cop26 summit in Glasgow last November, to Egypt. Egypt’s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, who will chair the Cop27 talks, said Egypt was determined to hold countries to account for their promises to tackle the climate crisis. He said: “We must not go beyond the point of no return [on the climate]. We must preserve our planet for future generations.” Security has been tight in Sharm El-Sheikh, as world leaders began to arrive on Sunday night, and there are concerns among climate activists that their voices will not be heard at the talks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/jun/27/isy-suttie-interview-peep-show-baby","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-27T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"Isy Suttie: ‘I was like: are they just here to see Dobby?’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jun/27/isy-suttie-interview-peep-show-baby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/jun/27/isy-suttie-interview-peep-show-baby","fields":{"headline":"Isy Suttie: ‘I was like: are they just here to see Dobby?’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In one very important sense, motherhood is an exercise in mitigating risk: you are the cautious and dutiful protector of society’s most vulnerable. But what if you’re also a natural-born thrill-seeker who lives for transgressive fun? What then? In Jackpot, her new standup show, Isy Suttie explores precisley this contradiction. As a teenager growing up in the picturesque spa town of Matlock in Derbyshire, her life revolved around the pursuit of excitement: some of her weirder escapades included touring multiple house parties in a single evening with her Ouija board, and jumping off a 30ft bridge for a £1 bet. Now, her life has all the hallmarks of measured domesticity – she has a seven-year-old daughter and three-year-old son with her partner, fellow comic Elis James – and yet “the element of me that does want to take risks” remains, she explains over a flat white in a south London coffee shop that is full of mothers conscientiously attending to babes in buggies. It is something the 43-year-old still finds herself drawn to. In Jackpot, she recounts the time she encouraged her kids to explore a disturbingly spooky campsite in the woods near her house (they were terrified), and how, with them gone, she engaged in some light trespassing at a nuclear power station with a couple of friends from mum yoga (the police became involved). Jackpot is Suttie’s return to standup after a very long break: she has not toured for a decade. Instead, she has been busy writing books (in 2016 she published a memoir, The Actual One, and last year, a novel called Jane Is Trying), podcasting and acting; her CV includes recurring roles in Shameless, Man Down and Jo Brand’s social work sitcom Damned. But it’s as Dobby, the on-off girlfriend of Peep Show’s uber-relatable loser-geek Mark Corrigan, that she remains best loved. Nerdy, vivacious, kind and sharp-witted, Dobby is one of the most distinctive female roles in British TV comedy history. In her teens, Suttie says, she used to “dream” of playing Sally Phillips’s giggling receptionist in I’m Alan Partridge; in sitcom character terms, I’d say she ended up going one better. Yet as great as Dobby was, the role did end up derailing Suttie’s standup career. At drama school she had harboured ambitions to become a serious actor and/or musician. “Me and my college boyfriend Tom used to sit up all night going: ‘I’m going to be in a Mike Leigh film, then I’m going to be in a Ken Loach film, then I’ll tour with Théâtre de Complicité.’ There was no talk of: ‘I’ll do theatre in education for a year then I’ll get turned down for an advert,’” she recalls, with an enthusiastic appreciation of her own ridiculousness. Yet after graduating to zero work, she discovered London’s standup scene, and soon found herself performing musical comedy on the gay club circuit. Her material included a song about Geri Halliwell’s dog, a lullaby for Katie Price, and one about a man putting his penis into a chip fryer. “The chorus was: ‘Eh, come on love, what’s the matter / Have you never seen sausage in batter?’ In a northern accent,” recounts Suttie, trying and failing to keep a straight face. As much as her camp, celebrity-centric material chimed with the gay scene, it was also a “real baptism of fire”. She struggled to win over audiences, and soon migrated to the mainstream standup circuit. There, she thrived. In 2007, a Chortle review of her first solo Edinburgh show, a one-woman romcom musical set in a Matlock supermarket titled Love Lost in the British Retail Industry, hailed her as a “modern-day Victoria Wood”. The following year she made her Peep Show debut; she knew she had nailed the audition thanks to the “tingly” ASMR-related sensation she experienced afterwards. On the set of her first series on the show, she was “really scared all the time. I was aware of how good it was and I was very quiet and shy.” Off set, she found that Dobby had supercharged her standup career – not always for the better. She was promoted to the top of bills, and gigs were advertised on her Peep Show credentials. “I got a bit inside my own head and was like: ‘Why are people here? Are they here to see Dobby? What do they expect?’” She worried that audiences would presume it was her first foray into standup. The stress was exacerbated by the fact she believed her Edinburgh show that year wasn’t up to scratch, having felt pressure to do the fringe regardless as a rising comedian. “It can feel like a really long Edinburgh where you have to do a show every day and you’re not happy with it,” she says. Her new work is clearly not born of the same sense of Fomo: Suttie wasn’t planning on returning to standup when Jackpot’s concept came to her. It taps into a very different cultural zeitgeist than the irreverent, Heat magazine-adjacent spirit of the late 00s. Jackpot is part of a wave of comedy that muses, very amusingly, on the ways motherhood and identity intersect (see also: the work of standups Ali Wong and Jessica Fostekew, books by comedians Lucy Beaumont and Ellie Taylor and sitcoms Motherland and Better Things). It’s a theme that also runs through Suttie’s next TV project, The Baby, which tackles the topic of motherhood in a marginally more disturbing fashion. The horror-comedy follows Natasha (Michelle de Swarte), a contentedly childfree thirtysomething gradually losing all her friends to parenthood who is targeted by a homicidal infant: the child latches on to a new “mother” each time he kills his previous caregiver (and plenty of others along the way). Suttie plays Natasha’s newly pregnant best friend Rita – another deserter – and filming the show took her back to her pre-kids days. “I really, really related to Michelle’s character feeling bereft of friends when everyone around you starts having kids,” she says. “My first book was about that, really. In a way you do lose your friends when they have kids if you don’t have them, because it’s boring as hell to hear someone talk about their baby and be preoccupied, and not have a proper conversation with you.” The Baby is laugh-out-loud funny but also genuinely disturbing; one field-based scene literally gave me nightmares. Best of all, it’s packed with subtle, blisteringly evocative allegories for the specific hell – the boredom, the sleep-deprivation, the mania, the crushing sense of responsibility – that is caring for a very small child. One of the cleverest elements of the early episodes is the way Natasha turns into a martyr: she won’t let anyone else look after the baby lest it murders them, a neat parallel for the exhausting instinct many new mothers have to control everything. It’s something Suttie can relate to. “I remember not letting anyone else wash [her daughter] Beti’s bottles,” she says. “You’re so out of control of so many elements of it, like when they sleep, that you’re scrabbling to control what you can.” In fact, Suttie’s attempts to do it all after the birth of her daughter in 2014 took its toll in a dramatic way: she developed a condition called migraine-associated vertigo, partly because of the stress she was under. “I did the book tour, I was filming a lot, I was away the whole time – and I was spending a lot of time with her. I wasn’t sleeping much. Both Elis and I would be filming and we’d meet at a service station and swap Beti over into a different car. In the end it was like, ‘One of us has to pull back a little bit.’” Suttie ended up taking three months off work, even though, being “a perfectionist and a workaholic”, she didn’t particularly want to. During those months she realised not working wasn’t “right for me, but I shouldn’t be working as much. So it was a case of: what do I really want to do?” The answer seems to be a bit of everything. After our interview, I leave Suttie behind in the baby-garlanded coffee shop; she is staying to catch up on her reading in preparation for the new series of the Penguin books podcast she presents. It’s just one component of a life that takes in writing, acting, parenting, standup, podcasting and, of course, the odd foray into a haunted campsite or nuclear power plant. It may not be everyone’s idea of a good time, but Suttie has clearly worked out how to hit her own personal jackpot. Jackpot tours from 22 August, starting at London’s Soho theatre; The Baby airs on Sky Atlantic in July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/06/russia-ukraine-war-ukraine-retakes-more-settlements-in-kherson-zelenskiy-says-un-nuclear-chief-heads-to-kyiv-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-06T18:04:19Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Putin must lose or he will invade other European countries, Zelenskiy says – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/06/russia-ukraine-war-ukraine-retakes-more-settlements-in-kherson-zelenskiy-says-un-nuclear-chief-heads-to-kyiv-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/06/russia-ukraine-war-ukraine-retakes-more-settlements-in-kherson-zelenskiy-says-un-nuclear-chief-heads-to-kyiv-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Putin must lose or he will invade other European countries, Zelenskiy says – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s been a comparatively quiet day for news relating to the Ukraine invasion, but there have still been some important developments. The EU has imposed a new round of sanctions on Russia, expanding import and export bans and blacklisting individuals over Moscow’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions. Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told European heads of state gathered in Prague that Ukraine must win so that Russia does not “advance on Warsaw or again on Prague”. Ukrainian emergency services said three bodies have been pulled from rubble after a Russian rocket strike destroyed a five-storey apartment block in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia. The Kremlin denied reports that 700,000 Russians had fled the country since Moscow announced a mobilisation drive it said would call up hundreds of thousands to fight in Ukraine. Thank you for following the blog today. We’re closing it for now but will see you again tomorrow. Leaders of the European Union, the United Kingdom and Turkey met on Thursday to discuss the security and energy crises resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in a symbolic summit seen as underlining Moscow’s isolation. The gathering in Prague was the inaugural meeting of the European Political Community (EPC), the brainchild of French president, Emmanuel Macron, and was intended to unite the EU’s 27 member states with 17 other European countries. The meeting at the ancient Prague Castle was perceived as a grand show of solidarity for a continent grappling with multiple crises - from the security implications of the war in Ukraine to energy shortages and a looming recession. “This meeting is a way of looking for a new order without Russia,” the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said, adding that Moscow may not always be excluded but for now, President Vladimir Putin’s Russia “does not have a seat”. Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addressing the meeting via video link, urged leaders to turn the new political community into a “European community of peace”. “Let today be the starting point. The point from which Europe and the entire free world will move to guaranteed peace for all of us. It is possible,” he said, calling on leaders to “direct all possible powers of Europe to end the war” in Ukraine. The Guardian’s foreign correspondent Peter Beaumont has penned a dispatch from the Kherson region, shedding light on residents’ experiences of returning to their homes in newly liberated villages. Unlike the wooded hills of the Donbas, the land here is flat, broad fields sectored by tree lines of acacia and oak, poplars and eucalyptus. They provided meagre cover for the Russian armoured vehicles that can be see burned out in the distance, sometimes several together. Razor-sharp shrapnel fragments litter the road’s surface. Lines of Russian anti-tank mines, strung together to close access to the road, have been defused and pulled to one side of the carriageway. Everywhere the skeletal remnants of missiles that once carried cluster bombs stand like tree-stumps in the fields. One meadow is cratered every 20 metres by the dozen or so munitions that flew into it. Beyond that, the road is heavily damaged. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has said it was “obvious” the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant belonged to Ukraine during a visit to Kyiv on Thursday. In a press conference, Grossi said: For us it is obvious that since it is a Ukrainian facility, the ownership is Energoatom [the Ukrainian state nuclear agency]. With the safety and the security of the plant – and technical operation – we will continue to be guided by the agreements we have with Ukraine. We are an international organisation guided by international law and, as you know very well, annexations are not accepted under international law. Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ordered his government to take over operations at Europe’s largest nuclear power station in southern Ukraine this week. Shelling has hit the vicinity in recent months, with Ukraine and Russia blaming each other for the attacks that have raised fears of a nuclear disaster. US president, Joe Biden, has said he would not rule out meeting with Vladimir Putin during the G20 summit next month in Asia. “That remains to be seen,” the US leader told reporters when asked if he’d use the G20 gathering in Bali, Indonesia, as an opportunity to talk directly with Putin. However, travel plans for both men remain unconfirmed and the White House has said that if Putin attends the G20 summit, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, should also participate, even if Ukraine is not a member of the group. It is unclear whether Putin will attend the summit. Liz Truss has said she considers Vladimir Putin to be the shared foe of Europe for threatening democracy and pushing up energy prices, while her French counterpart, President Emmanuel Macron, is a “friend”. Truss’s comments during the Tory leadership race, when she declined to say whether Mr Macron was a “friend or foe”, were widely criticised. She told broadcasters in Prague, where she is attending the inaugural summit of the European Political Community and will meet with the French president: I work very, very closely with President Macron and the French government and what we’re talking about is how the UK and France can work more closely together to build more nuclear power stations and to make sure that both countries have energy security in the future. We’re both very clear: the foe is Vladimir Putin who has, through his appalling war in Ukraine, threatened freedom and democracy in Europe and pushed up energy prices which we’re now all having to deal with. Asked if Macron was then a friend, Truss said: “He is a friend.” A Russian-installed official in Ukraine has suggested President Vladimir Putin’s defence minister should consider killing himself because of the shame of the defeats in the war in Ukraine, representing an astonishing public insult to Russia’s top brass. After more than seven months of war in Ukraine, Moscow’s most basic war aims have still not been achieved, while Russian forces have suffered a series of battlefield defeats in recent months, forcing Putin to announce a partial mobilisation. In a four-minute video message, Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-installed deputy head of the annexed Kherson region, followed suit, publicly lambasting the “generals and ministers” in Moscow for failing to understand the problems on the front. Stremousov said: Indeed, many say: if they were a defence minister who had allowed such a state of affairs, they could, as officers, have shot themselves. But you know the word ‘officer’ is an incomprehensible word for many. Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza is being investigated for treason, according to his lawyer. State-owned news agency RIA has quoted lawyer Vadim Prokhorov as saying a criminal case for treason – which carries a sentence of up to 20 years – had been opened against Kara-Murza in connection with three of his public speeches. They included an address to the Arizona House of Representatives in which he said Vladimir Putin was bombing Ukrainian homes, hospitals and schools. Moscow says it does not deliberately target civilians, but thousands have been killed in Ukraine. On Thursday, at least three people died when a Russian missile destroyed an apartment block in the city of Zaporizhzhia. The EU has imposed a new round of sanctions on Russia, expanding import and export bans and blacklisting individuals over Moscow’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions. AFP reports: The measures, which came into force with their publication in the bloc’s official administrative journal, also pointed the way to an oil price cap on Russian crude transported around the world but only after details are worked out within the G7 group of nations. The EU regulation said the sanctions were in response to Russia’s “further aggression against Ukraine, the organisation of illegal sham ‘referenda’ in the parts of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions that are currently illegally occupied ... the illegal annexation of those Ukrainian regions ... as well as the mobilisation in the Russian Federation and its repeated threat to use weapons of mass destruction”. Thirty individuals and seven entities were added to the EU blacklist, including singers Yulia Chicherina and Nikolay Rastorguev, among others deemed pro-war “propaganda” artists. Other listings were Russia’s electoral commission and its head, proxy Russian officials in the annexed regions, and Russian defence officials and defence-affiliated companies. The regulation also introduced a “circumvention” list on which individuals or companies helping banned Russian entities get around the EU sanctions would be placed. It was the eighth packet of sanctions the EU has imposed on Russia since the Kremlin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February. The last couple of sanction packets have been losing steam compared with earlier ones, as leading Russian trade, energy, banking, military and political sectors have already been hit. The headline measure in the latest sanctions was meant to be an oil price cap on Russian crude transported around the world. But the legal text published on Thursday did not set out how that would work, leaving it to future deliberations by the European Commission and EU member states in consultation with the G7. The sanctions include expanding a ban to all Russian cryptocurrency transactions, regardless of amount, and the widening of an existing ban on Russian imports, and broadening a prohibition on weapon sales to include personal arms. Also, electronic components that can go into Russian weapons, such as transistors, electronic integrated circuits, controllers, and aerial surveillance cameras are banned for sale to Russia. Additionally, the EU is barring service providers in several sectors from exporting to Russia, including in the fields of legal advice, architecture, engineering and IT consultancy. The Guardian’s foreign correspondent, Peter Beaumont, has shared his impressions from a road towards Kherson today, where he has observed what appears to be the remnants of a big fight, including burnt-out Russian armoured vehicles and cluster munitions. He saw a little farmhouse that had been occupied by three different groups of Russians, which was “smashed to bits and an absolute pigsty”. He could hear Ukrainian artillery far in the distance. He added: This doesn’t feel to me like a small straightening of their line and regrouping but a rout. US Aid has announced $55m (£49.3m) to repair pipes and infrastructure destroyed by Russian troops, to help keep up to 7 million Ukrainians warm this winter. Many recently liberated villages no longer have energy supplies, and residents have been forced to cook their meals outside around open fires. Temperatures are still relatively mild in Ukraine, though they are beginning to fall, and winters are notoriously harsh. An article in today’s Bild looks into a surprising story, in which a local dentist in the recently liberated village of Pisky-Radkivski claims that teeth contained in a horror photo posted by Ukraine’s defence ministry stating they came from a torture chamber are in fact those from his cabinet, and had gone missing after his house was looted by Russians. The dentist, named as Sergey, said: These teeth look like the ones from my collection that was looted here. I’m the only dentist here. So if they were found here, they must be mine. Nearby residents reported to me that Russians apparently used this to scare people. The report adds that although this claim may be untrue, it is certain that torture did take place in the village. Volodymyr Zelenskiy is speaking at the first meeting of the European Political Community today. He has told European heads of state that Ukraine must win so that Russia does not “advance on Warsaw or again on Prague”, according to reporting by Agence France-Presse. Zelenskiy called on Western capitals to supply his army with more weapons “to punish the aggressor”. Ukraine’s general staff has reported that the armed forces liberated 93 settlements since 21 September in north-east Ukraine, while the armed forces advanced 55km (34.1 miles) deep into Russian-occupied territory and took control of more than 2,400 sq km. Norway’s government will restrict access for Russian fishing vessels to its ports in the latest tightening of security after last week’s discovery of significant leaks from the Nord Stream gas pipelines. Russian trawlers will from now on only be allowed to visit three ports and must undergo security checks when they do so, Anniken Huitfeldt, the Norwegian foreign minister, told a news conference. Many more details need to be worked out within the G7 and the European Union before a price cap for Russian seaborne oil deliveries to third countries could take effect, EU officials have said. Reuters reports: The EU agreed this week to the eighth package of sanctions against Russia for waging a war in Ukraine, including an oil cap that would align the bloc with the US and the G7 group of the world’s most industrialised countries, including EU members France, Germany and Italy. But many details are yet to be agreed including the actual pricing mechanism, said the officials, who spoke under condition of anonymity. That means the EU’s decision is more of a first step towards putting in place an oil cap, rather than actually already implementing it. The officials said: Discussions on how the pricing will be set are still needed. They added there was “some time pressure” to figure out the more nuanced approach compared with the EU’s previously agreed blanket ban for European firms on providing insurance and banking services to Russian oil shipments that would otherwise kick in from December. Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the UK’s Labour party, has issued the following statement on Liz Truss’s visit to Europe: I think it’s very important that the opportunity is taken to reassert and re-emphasise the unity of response that we have in relation to [Vladimir] Putin’s aggression and imperialism and I think that’s the single most important thing in relation to the meeting today. Whatever other issues we have with the government, in the UK, I’ve made it clear there will be no political divide in our support for Ukraine, and standing up against Putin’s imperialism. The Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has reassured his Ukrainian counterpart that Athens is in lockstep with its EU and Nato allies in strongly condemning Russia’s illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. Using the inaugural meeting of the European Political Community in Prague to hold talks with Denys Shmyhal, Ukraine’s prime minister, Mitsotakis said Greece would never recognise the change in borders, which he insisted was “in flagrant violation of international law”. Instead, he said, Greece saw the regions as an integral part of Ukraine and fully backed today’s EU council decision to impose a new package of economic and individual sanctions against Russia. Mitsotakis and his centre-right government have said persistently that Greece has elected to be on the “right side of history” by supporting Ukraine after Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion on 24 February. Support has included using the strategic port of Alexandroupolis, in north-east Greece, for the shipment by US armed forces of military material to Ukraine. What were once traditionally strong ties with fellow Orthodox Moscow have been badly strained in the process. This week, Greece’s anti-money laundering authority confirmed it was also investigating what the Kathimerini newspaper described as the “suspicious transfer” of large funds from Russia to the all-male monastic republic of Mount Athos, where monies had been directed to Moscow-friendly monasteries and monks. Several senior Russian officials have visited the Mount in recent months. Reuters has a quick snap that Volodymyr Zelenskiy has asked Ukrainian parliament to approve banker Andriy Pyshnyi as the new chairman of the country’s central bank. Earlier today, the parliament formally accepted the resignation of Kyrylo Shevchenko, who abruptly submitted his resignation on Tuesday, citing health reasons. Ukrainian emergency services said that a total of three bodies have been pulled from rubble after a Russian rocket strike destroyed a five-storey apartment block in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia. Other residents are trapped under rubble, the regional governor and emergency services said. Russia has submitted preliminary objections to a genocide case against Moscow brought by Ukraine. The International Court of Justice, which is the UN’s highest court for disputes between states, has tweeted that it had received the objections on 3 October, but these have not been made public. Parties can file preliminary objections if they believe the court does not have jurisdiction in a case. In a letter to the UN in March, Moscow argued that the ICJ did not have jurisdiction because the genocide convention does not regulate the use of force between states. The filing signifies a change in Moscow’s attitude to the ICJ case. Russia is now engaging with the court, whereas it has previously skipped hearings and not filed documents directly with the court. Ukraine filed a case with the ICJ shortly after Russia’s invasion began, saying Moscow’s justification, that it was acting to prevent a genocide in eastern Ukraine, was unfounded. The next step in the case will be a hearing on the objections against the jurisdiction of the court. No date has been set yet, but it is expected to take place in several months’ time. Reuters has a report on the problems that Russians opposed to the war in Ukraine or fearful of being sent to fight have encountered upon fleeing to Kazakhstan. Worries about money, sudden large increases in housing costs in response to the Russian influx, and scarce jobs are compounded by pressures from family back home – some have even been accused by relatives of betraying their country. And the scale of the exodus has given rise to concerns from some Kazakhs who see the incoming Russians as a potential economic burden and even a security risk. Rents have soared in Kazakhstan and other central Asian nations – as well as Georgia, where some landlords have started adding a “no Russians” clause to their rental ads. The Kazakh government said this week that more than 200,000 Russians had entered the country since Putin’s announcement, and 147,000 had since left. No data is available on their final destinations, though some are thought to have headed to neighbouring former Soviet republics. About 77,000 have registered in Kazakhstan’s national ID system, a prerequisite for getting a job or a bank account. Uzbekistan’s government said on Tuesday it was strengthening border controls, with border guard troops to be involved in vehicle and cargo checks alongside customs officials. Some Kazakh businesses have publicly announced job offers for those fleeing the Russian draft, but some of those offers explicitly stated they were aimed only at ethnic Kazakhs. Reuters has posted a helpful summary of its Ukraine-related reporting from today: Ukraine said its forces have retaken more settlements in Kherson, one of four partially Russian-occupied regions that President Vladimir Putin formally incorporated into Russia in Europe’s biggest annexation since the second world war. A Russian rocket strike destroyed a five-storey apartment block in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, killing at least one woman and leaving other residents trapped under rubble, the regional governor said. The bodies of two Russian soldiers lay bloating in trees on opposite sides of the road, close to the blasted hulks of the cars and the van in which Ukrainian army officers said the dead men’s unit was retreating into the eastern town of Lyman. Dozens of firefighters doused blazes in a town near Kyiv after multiple strikes caused by what officials said were Iranian-made loitering munitions, often known as “kamikaze drones”. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the battlefield reports. Putin signed laws admitting the Donetsk People’s Republic, the Luhansk People’s Republic, Kherson region and Zaporizhzhia region into Russia in the biggest expansion of Russian territory in at least half a century. He also said Russia would stabilise the situation in the regions, indirectly acknowledging the challenges it faces to assert its control. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, accused Russia on Thursday of “nuclear blackmail” over its seizure of the Zaporizhzhia power plant in southern Ukraine. The Kremlin said it was preparing to welcome the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to Moscow soon. Putin said he expected sanctions pressure on the Russian economy to intensify, in televised remarks from a meeting with government officials. The European Union gave its final approval for a new batch of sanctions, the bloc’s executive arm said. They include more limits on trade with Russia in steel and tech products, and an oil price cap for Russian seaborne crude deliveries through European insurers to align the EU with Washington. A crime scene investigation of the damages on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines has strengthened suspicions of “gross sabotage”, Swedish security police. Alexander Novak, the Russian deputy prime minister, said Moscow might cut oil production to offset negative effects from price caps imposed by the west over Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Europe may limp through the cold winter months with the help of brimming natural gas tanks despite a plunge in deliveries from Russia, only to enter a deeper energy crisis next year, the head of the International Energy Agency said. The Kremlin denied reports that 700,000 Russians had fled the country since Moscow announced a mobilisation drive to call up hundreds of thousands to fight in Ukraine. US intelligence agencies believe parts of the Ukrainian government authorised a car bomb attack near Moscow in August that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist, the New York Times reported. The Opec+ group of leading oil producers decided to reduce output by 2 million barrels per day to stabilise the market, according to a Kremlin spokesperson. Dmitry Peskov also said that by agreeing to reduce output, Opec+ has confirmed its credentials as an organisation responsible for market stability. The Saudi-led Opec+ cartel at a Vienna meeting on Wednesday ignored pleas from the White House to keep oil flowing and agreed the cut, its deepest since the Covid-19 pandemic. Separately, Peskov said that the Kremlin is preparing to welcome the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic energy agency (IAEA), to Moscow soon. The visit is likely to focus on the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, located in southern Ukraine in territory that Russia has proclaimed its own. He added that he understands there are no plans to invite Moscow to join an investigation into Nord Stream gas leaks. Nevertheless, Russia considers it is impossible to conduct such an investigation without Moscow’s participation. The Kremlin has denied reports that 700,000 Russians have fled the country since Moscow announced a mobilisation drive that it said would call up hundreds of thousands to fight in Ukraine. In a briefing with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he did not have exact figures for how many people had left the country since Vladimir Putin’s announcement on 21 September of a “partial mobilisation” that has called members of the general public up to the military. During today’s Kremlin briefing, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was asked about Wednesday’s New York Times report, which revealed that United States intelligence agencies believed parts of the Ukrainian government authorised the car bomb attack near Moscow in August that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist. The report said that US officials feared this was an element of a covert campaign that could widen the conflict. Peskov’s response was that Russian intelligence had always argued that Ukraine was behind the August killing of Darya Dugina so it was “positive” that the United States appeared to share that assessment. Kyiv on Thursday rejected the claims it was involved in the attack. Rachel Hall here taking over the blog – if there’s anything we’ve missed, do drop me a line. Russia hit the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia with seven rockets, flattening an apartment building early on Thursday morning. The city’s authorities told Ukraine’s public broadcaster, Suspilne, that at least two had died and at least another five were trapped under the rubble, although later reports revised the death toll down to one. Rescue workers at the scene said they saved a three-year-old girl. Zaporizhzhia’s branch of Suspilne reported more explosions in the city at mid-morning Kyiv time. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to admit severe losses in Ukraine, conceding the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals and insisting Russia would “stabilise” the situation in four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. “We are working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise,” Putin told Russian teachers during a televised video call on Wednesday. The UN nuclear agency chief is en route to Kyiv to discuss creating a security zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after Putin ordered his government to take it over. “On our way to Kyiv for important meetings,” the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head, Rafael Grossi, wrote on Twitter, saying the need for a protection zone around the site was “more urgent than ever”. Grossi is also expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant. The IAEA said it had learned of plans to restart one reactor at the plant, where all six reactors have been shut down for weeks. Ukraine’s forces are pushing their advance in the east and south, forcing Russian troops to retreat under pressure on both fronts. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukraine’s military had made major, rapid advances against Russian forces in the past week, taking back dozens of towns in regions in the south and east that Russia has declared annexed. Military experts say Russia is at its weakest point, partly because of its decision not to mobilise earlier and partly because of massive losses of troops and equipment. Ukraine has extended its area of control in the Kherson region by six to 12 miles, according to its military’s southern command. Zelenskiy confirmed the recapture of the villages of Novovoskresenske, Novohryhorivka and Petropavlivka, saying the settlements were “liberated from the sham referendum and stabilised”, in an address on Wednesday. Kherson region’s Moscow-appointed governor, Kirill Stremousov, said the withdrawal was a tactical “regrouping” to “deliver a retaliatory blow”. The extent of Russia’s retreat remains unclear. Moscow’s forces have left behind smashed towns once under occupation and, in places, mass burial sites and evidence of torture chambers. In Lyman, which was retaken by Ukrainian forces on Sunday, more than 50 graves have been found, some marked with names, others with numbers, the Kyiv-based outlet Hromadske reported on Wednesday. Leaders of 44 European countries on Thursday in Prague will send a clear signal of Russia’s isolation and try to create a new order without Moscow, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said this morning. “The meeting is looking for a new order without Russia,” he told reporters. The UN has warned Russia’s claimed annexation of Ukraine territory will only exacerbate human rights violations. Christian Salazar Volkmann said UN experts had documented “a range of violations of the rights to life, liberty and security” and warned the situation would only worsen as Russia pushes forward with the annexation of some Ukrainian regions. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I am handing over to Rachel Hall. I will be back later on. Here is a video clip showing some of the scenes in Zaporizhzhia after today’s attacks. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Nato to “demonstrate that they are not afraid of Russia”. During a video-link interview with the Lowy Institute in Australia on Thursday, Zelenskiy was asked whether he had received any response from Nato, and how quickly he expected the alliance to act on the application. He said his key message was: “You don’t need to be afraid of anyone.” Zelenskiy said it was important to build “security guarantees for the whole world so that nobody would have even a thought to become autocratic, and even if you’re autocratic that you shouldn’t have even a single thought that you can conquer the other territories or other nations”. “For that, you must have to be united. And I think that without Ukraine, Nato is not such a strong alliance, particularly the European continent. I believe for the strength in the east of Europe this is a very important step. We can offer this chance to Nato. We are grateful for their support to Nato. We are giving this opportunity at a very important moment.” Zelenskiy appealed for his Nato partners to show resolve. “Not only Ukraine has to demonstrate its strengths to Russia, but the alliance has also to demonstrate that they are not afraid of Russia. It’s a question to Nato. But I know that everyone realises that security guarantees for Ukraine are something that is necessary. And I think we are on that path. We shall definitely take this path. How fast it’s going to be, unfortunately, it depends not only on Ukraine.” Zelenskiy announced last week that Ukraine was officially applying for membership of Nato, after Vladimir Putin said he was annexing four Ukrainian provinces. Maria Zakharova is giving her weekly press briefing for Russia’s foreign ministry. So far she has stated that it would be impossible to investigate the damage to the Nord Stream pipelines without Russian involvement, and accused Denmark of being unwilling to cooperate and said that the west was creating obstacles to the repair work. She criticised Ukraine’s contribution to the grain export deal, saying it was depriving grain exports to poorer countries, and denied claims that Russia had damaged grain silos or agricultural land, reiterating that the armed forces of the Russian Federation only target military infrastructure. Reporter Kateryna Malofieieva is in Zaporizhzhia and has posted to say that rescue work in the Ukrainian city is being interrupted by air-raid sirens that force first responders to shelter. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has commented on this morning’s attacks on Zaporizhzhia, saying: Overnight, seven Russian missiles have hit people sleeping peacefully at their homes in Zaporizhzhia. More have struck during the day. Russians keep deliberately striking civilians to sow fear. Russian terror must be stopped — by force of weapons, sanctions, and full isolation. Here are some of the images of the aftermath from today’s attack on the city of Zaporizhzhia by Russian forces. The UK’s ministry of defence has published this map today of how it assesses the latest territorial situation on the ground. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, has said overnight Russian forces shelled across the front line in multiple locations. He reported that one civilian was wounded and that houses were damaged in several settlements. The claims have not been independently verified. Donetsk is one of the regions that Russia claims to have annexed without fully controlling the territory. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said he hopes a vote at the UN general assembly next week condemning Russia’s purported annexation of Ukrainian territory will be “as unanimous as possible”. Zelenskiy is addressing the Sydney-based Lowy Institute by video link on Thursday. In his opening remarks, Zelenskiy urged Australia to help secure an overwhelming UN vote against Russia’s actions: “I’m asking Australia to use all of its influence to convince as many countries as possible not to remain neutral and to vote for international law and against a Russian annexation.” Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, Oleksandr Starukh, has issued an update on the strikes in Zaporizhzhia this morning, revising the death toll down to one for now. He writes: So far it is known about the death of one woman. The death of another person has not been confirmed. Thanks to the doctors, her life was saved. Seven people were injured of varying degrees of severity, they were treated, including one three-year-old child. The rescue operation is still ongoing. The number of victims may vary. The number of victims could have been much higher, but thanks to the timely and professional actions of the Zaporizhzhia state emergency service, 21 victims were already saved. Russia hit the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia with seven rockets, flattening an apartment building on early on Thursday morning. The city’s authorities told Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne at least two have died and at least another five are trapped under the rubble, although later reports revised the death toll down to one. Rescue workers at the scene said they saved one three-year-old girl. Zaporizhzhia’s branch of Suspline reported more explosions in the city at mid-morning Kyiv time. Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, said on Telegram: “Attention. Another enemy missile attack. Stay in shelters”. Russia launched two rockets at the central Ukrainian city of Khmelnytsky, but both reportedly missed their targets. Elsewhere, Russia used what the Ukrainian authorities say are Iranian-supplied kamikaze drones to target the cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Odesa. Ukraine’s military say they managed to shoot down 18 additional drones before they reached Odesa and Mykolaiv. As the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont reported, the Iranian drones are able to remain airborne for several hours and circle over potential targets, the drones are designed to be flown into enemy troops, armour or buildings, exploding on impact – explaining their description as kamikaze drones. The city of Zaporizhzhia is the administrative centre of the Zaporizhzhia region which Russia claims to have annexed. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the exiled leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus, has commented on today’s strikes on Zaporizhzhia, saying: The Russian attack on residential buildings in Zaporizhzhia is another shameful act of terror against the population of Ukraine. Thousands of innocent adults &amp; children have paid with their lives for Putin and Lukashenko’s war. They lose on the battlefield &amp; take revenge on civilians. Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, has alerted people to an another attack on Telegram, posting “Attention. Another enemy missile attack. Stay in shelters”. If you need a reminder, this animated map posted by Ukraine’s minister of defence Oleksii Reznikov yesterday shows the territory that the Ukrainian armed forces have claimed to recapture during their counteroffensive over the last month. The BBC’s Paul Adams reports hearing three more loud explosions in Zaporizhzhia in the last few minutes. Kirill Stremousov, one of the Russian-imposed leaders in the occupied region of Kherson which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex, has been very vocal on Telegram in the last couple of days, attempting to counter any narrative that Ukrainian forces are making any progress in the south. This morning he has, without presenting evidence, again asserted that the defences in Kherson are holding. He said: The situation in the Kherson region is unchanged. The Kherson region is holding back the onslaught of the Ukronazis who are trying to break into Kherson. We repeat once again that despite the panic that is dispersed in the media, in the Kherson region, the ministry of defence and the Russian Guard stand to the death. The advances of the Ukronazis, fascists, Germans, Americans and other mercenaries have been stopped. The Russian Federation has signed into law an annexation of the Kherson region, despite not fully controlling it. Leaders of 44 European countries on Thursday in Prague will send a clear signal of Russia’s isolation and try to create a new order without Moscow, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said this morning. “The meeting is looking for a new order without Russia,” Reuters reports he told reporters in Prague. The Kremlin has published details of the decree that Vladimir Putin signed yesterday to “correct” aspects of the partial mobilisation. Russian state media RIA Novosti reports: According to the decree, the deferment is granted to those who receive education of the appropriate level for the first time in full-time and part-time (evening) forms of education. Students, graduate students and residents enrolled in state-accredited programmes of secondary and higher professional education also have this right. In addition, the basis for the postponement will be training in organisations located on the territories of innovative scientific and technological centres, as well as in spiritual educational organisations. Ukraine’s ministry of internal affairs has confirmed that seven Russian rocket attacks hit the city of Zaporizhzhia overnight. It says that first responders are present, and that “work is ongoing, all relevant services are on site”. Regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, earlier said that one woman was confirmed to have died in the attack while another person died in an ambulance. “At least five people are under the rubble of buildings,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Thursday morning. Images posted by the ministry included pictures of debris on fire, and rescue workers clambering through the rubble of a destroyed high-rise building, which had collapsed on to cars parked in front of it. Ivan Fedorov, Ukraine’s elected mayor of Melitopol, said on Telegram: “Dozens of people are under the rubble. The number of victims increases every hour. This is how the Russian terrorist hits civilians with its ‘high-precision’ weapons. It hits civilians and infrastructure, because it demonstrates to the whole world its worthlessness on the battlefield.” The city of Zaporizhzhia is the administrative centre of the Zaporizhzhia oblast, one of the regions of Ukraine that Russia has claimed to annex, despite not controlling all of the territory there. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, has posted a status update to Telegram to report no casualties overnight in his region. However he says that the region was again attacked by Shahed-136 “kamikaze drones”, and that some residential and farm buildings as well as agricultural lands has been damaged. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian-imposed authorities in the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, occupied Ukrainian territory which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex, have issued casualty figures for the last 24 hours. They claim that six civilians have been wounded and three killed by shelling from Ukrainian armed forces. Additionally they say that 12 houses and five civil infrastructure facilities were damaged. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam in London, you can reach me on martin.belam@theguardian.com Before I hand you over to my colleague Martin Belam here is a rundown of where things stand as of 9am in Ukraine. Two people have been killed after Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia was allegedly hit by Russian missiles in the early hours of Thursday morning. Regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said one woman was confirmed to have died in the attack while another person died in an ambulance. “At least five people are under the rubble of buildings,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Thursday morning. Starukh earlier alleged Russia “fired 7 rockets at high-rise buildings” while rescuers continue to pull people out from under the rubble. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to admit severe losses in Ukraine, conceding the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals and insisting Russia would “stabilise” the situation in four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. “We are working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise,” Putin told Russian teachers during a televised video call on Wednesday.

Christian Salazar Volkmann, said UN experts had documented “a range of violations of the rights to life, liberty and security” and warned the situation would only worsen as Russia pushes forward with the annexation of some Ukrainian regions. European leaders are set to meet in Prague on Thursday in the face of Russia’s war. Leaders from Ukraine, Britain and Turkey will join their EU counterparts in Prague on Thursday for a summit aimed at bringing the continent together in the face of Russia’s aggression. The gathering has been billed by Brussels as a “platform for political coordination” for the disparate 44 nations attending. Attempts to play down retreats in Ukraine are no longer washing inside Russia with the latest military failures spilling on to local television screens. “Why do we advance metre by metre when they advance village by village?” Olga Skabeyeva, the country’s top state-TV host, asked a Russia-appointed official in Luhansk in a recent broadcast. Pro-war military bloggers and journalists are also criticising the Kremlin and painting a bleak picture of deteriorating Russian morale. Russia is lobbying for a secret ballot instead of a public vote when the 193-member UN General Assembly next week considers whether to condemn Moscow’s move to annex four partially occupied regions in Ukraine. The car bombing that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of prominent Russian political figure Alexander Dugin, was allegedly authorised by elements within the Ukrainian government, according to US intelligence sources who spoke with the New York Times and CNN. The United States took no part in the attack, either by providing intelligence or other assistance, the officials said.

Roman Saponkov, a prominent war correspondent, described his despair over the pullback in Kherson on his Telegram channel: Friends, I know you’re waiting for me to comment on the situation. But I really don’t know what to say to you. The retreat … is catastrophic.” Aleksandr Kots, a pro-Kremlin journalist who travels with with the Russian army, added: “We do not have enough people … fatigue has set in … there is no longer any strength left to hold on to the territories won.” Two people have been killed after an alleged Russian missile attack hit Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Thursday morning. Regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said one woman was confirmed to have died in the attack while another person died in an ambulance. “At least 5 people are under the rubble of buildings,” Starukh wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Thursday morning. “Many people were saved. Among them is a three-year-old girl, the child is in foster care. A rescue operation is underway at the scene.” Starukh earlier alleged Russia “fired 7 rockets at high-rise buildings” while rescuers continue to pull people out from under the rubble. Bodies of Russian soldiers, shredded uniforms and burned out military vehicles litter parts of Lyman in Ukraine after it was liberated from Russian occupation. The city in Donetsk became the latest strategically important city Russian occupiers surrendered as the Kremlin faces heavy losses. The gains by Ukraine come after Russia illegally claimed four territories as its own last week. Russia is lobbying for a secret ballot instead of a public vote when the 193-member UN General Assembly next week considers whether to condemn Moscow’s move to annex four partially occupied regions in Ukraine. Ukraine and its allies have denounced the votes in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia as illegal and coercive. A western-drafted UN General Assembly resolution would condemn Russia’s “illegal so-called referenda” and the “attempted illegal annexation” of the areas where voting occurred. Meanwhile, the UN has warned Russia’s claimed annexation of Ukraine territory will only exacerbate human rights violations. Christian Salazar Volkmann, said UN experts had documented “a range of violations of the rights to life, liberty and security” and warned the situation would only worsen as Russia pushes forward with annexing the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The referendums have been dismissed as a “sham” by the west. “With the purported annexation... the Russian Federation has taken steps which deepen rather than resolve the conflict, and exacerbate the human rights violations associated with it,” Salazar Volkmann said. Leaders from Ukraine, Britain and Turkey will join their EU counterparts in Prague on Thursday for a summit aimed at bringing the continent together in the face of Russia’s aggression. The gathering has been billed by Brussels as a “platform for political coordination” for the disparate 44 nations attending. Those set to meet also include the leaders of Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia, Georgia, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Switzerland. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will connect via video link from Kyiv as his prime minister will stand in for him at the talks, according to AFP. British Prime Minister Liz Truss is set to tell fellow leaders: Europe is facing its biggest crisis since the Second World War. And we have faced it together with unity and resolve. We must continue to stand firm - to ensure that Ukraine wins this war, but also to deal with the strategic challenges that it has exposed.” Despite the rhetoric there are expected to be few concrete results from the summit. EU officials expect to agree to hold a follow-up gathering of the community in six months’ time in a country outside the bloc, with Britain and Moldova both offering to host. Unconfirmed reports of shelling in Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia has damaged or destroyed several residential buildings overnight leaving some residents trapped under rubble, according to the region’s governor. “As a result of the enemy attacks, fires broke out in the city,” Oleksandr Starukh wrote on the Telegram messaging app early on Thursday morning. “There are possible casualties. Rescuers are already pulling people out from under the rubble.” Starukh later alleged Russia “fired 7 rockets at high-rise buildings” and said the number of victims is still being clarified. As Russian troops have retreated, they have left behind smashed towns once under occupation and, in places, mass burial sites and evidence of torture chambers. The Guardian’s Isobel Koshiw brings us this dispatch from Kyiv. In the town of Lyman, which was retaken by Ukrainian forces on Sunday, more than 50 graves have been found, some marked with names, others with numbers, the Kyiv-based outlet Hromadske reported on Wednesday. The Russians forced Ukrainians they suspected of collaborating to collect bodies and bury them. One boy, who was detained by the Russians and forced to bury bodies, told Hromadske that some of the bodies were left lying on the street for a long time. More evidence of tortured and extrajudicial killings has been discovered in Kharkiv region. Two civilians corpses aged 30-35 were found in a grave in the village of Novoplatonivka, Kharkiv region, according to Ukrainian authorities. The left hand of one man was handcuffed to the right hand of the second man. Investigators said one of the skulls was fractured and the other had suffered a gun shot wound to the head. Kharkiv prosecutors and police said 250-350 Russian special forces were stationed near the grave. They said their initial suspicion is that the men were killed by Russian special forces. In Pisky-Radkivskyi, another village in Kharkiv region, Ukraine authorities said they found another torture chamber. Serhii Bolvinov, chief investigator for Kharkiv region said: “Neighbours constantly heard screams from here. Investigators found a terrible torture chamber in the village. “Police have been made aware of the torture of burying people alive and the use of a gas mask with a smouldering rag.” Ukraine’s forces are pushing their advance in the east and south, forcing Russian troops to retreat under pressure on both fronts. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s military had made major, rapid advances against Russian forces in the past week, taking back dozens of towns in regions in the south and east that Russia has declared annexed. Military experts say Russia is at its weakest point, partly because of its decision not to mobilise earlier and partly because of massive losses of troops and equipment. In the Kherson region, Ukraine has extended its area of control by six to 12 miles, according to its military’s southern command. Zelenskiy confirmed the recapture of the villages of Novovoskresenske, Novohryhorivka and Petropavlivka, saying the settlements were “liberated from the sham referendum and stabilised” during a Wednesday evening address. Kherson region’s Moscow-appointed governor, Kirill Stremousov, said Russia’s withdrawal was a tactical “regrouping” to “deliver a retaliatory blow”. The extent of Russia’s retreat remains unclear for now. Ukraine’s minister of defence, Oleksii Reznikov, said his soldiers “continue moving forward” in its autumn offensive. “While the ‘Russian parliament’ is intoxicated from the futile attempts at annexation, our soldiers continue moving forward,” he said in a Twitter post on Thursday. “This is the best answer to any and all ‘referenda’, ‘decrees’, ‘treaties’ and pathetic speeches.” The UN nuclear agency chief will shortly arrive in Kyiv to discuss creating a security zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after Putin ordered his government to take it over. “On our way to Kyiv for important meetings,” International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi wrote on Twitter, saying the need for a protection zone around the site was “more urgent than ever”. Putin earlier signed a decree ordering the Russian government to take control of Europe’s largest atomic plant and make it “federal property”. Grossi is also expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss safety at the plant, Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported. The IAEA said it had learned of plans to restart one reactor at the plant, where all six reactors have been shut down for weeks. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to concede the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals in Ukraine, insisting Russia will “stabilise” the situation in the four Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. Putin told Russian teachers during a televised video call on Wednesday: We are working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise.” His comments appear to indirectly acknowledge the challenges Moscow faces to assert its control. When later asked by journalists whether there was a contradiction between Russia’s annexation rhetoric and the reality on the ground, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there was none. There is no contradiction whatsoever. They will be with Russia forever and they will be returned.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

The request from the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, is widely seen as symbolic and appears to be the latest example of nuclear signalling to deter Putin. The White House, however, said it had not received such a request. The car bombing that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of prominent Russian political figure Alexander Dugin, was allegedly authorised by elements within the Ukrainian government, according to US intelligence sources who spoke with the New York Times and CNN. The United States took no part in the attack, either by providing intelligence or other assistance, the officials said. A SpaceX rocket carrying Russian cosmonaut, Anna Kikina, the only female cosmonaut in service, soared into orbit from Florida on Wednesday. The International Space Station crew comprising Kikina, two Americans and a Japanese astronaut flew together in a demonstration of US-Russian teamwork in space despite Ukraine war tensions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/may/03/charlotte-higgins-archers-oliver-adil-pando-ferries-sack-grey-gables-hotel-ruairi","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-03T05:00:13Z","webTitle":"Charlotte Higgins on The Archers: Oliver and Adil pull a P&O Ferries and sack everyone at Grey Gables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/03/charlotte-higgins-archers-oliver-adil-pando-ferries-sack-grey-gables-hotel-ruairi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/03/charlotte-higgins-archers-oliver-adil-pando-ferries-sack-grey-gables-hotel-ruairi","fields":{"headline":"Charlotte Higgins on The Archers: Oliver and Adil pull a P&O Ferries and sack everyone at Grey Gables","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Many questions lingered in the air this month. For example: does Ruth Archer go on about slurry? Or so she herself pettishly enquired. Answer: no more so than I would like to imagine necessary to soften us up for her husband David’s drowning in a pit of effluent, a development for which I have long hankered. Sadly this now seems unlikely, as Brookfield is investing in a cover for its slurry store. Do most listeners mentally, if not actually, tune out during these patently dull “farming bits” the Ministry of Agriculture once levered into proceedings? Back in the day, they were the pedagogical pill for which the rural adultery, mutual loathing, etc, were merely the sweeteners. I admit I find them marvellously soothing. The real story of The Archers, however, may be about the characters’ relentless pursuit of sugary baked goods: faced with Natasha’s gestational diabetes, her parents-in-law, Tony and Pat, have decided to “have an affair” with puddings, setting forth for secret cheesecake in the Orangery at Lower Loxley and clandestine sticky toffee pudding at the Feathers. “The world’s our rum baba,” claimed Tony, inaccurately: as we all know, there’s a mystery forcefield preventing him from leaving Borsetshire at all. When someone asked Kathy Perks whether you can get Radio Borsetshire in Hereford, the answer should have been a resounding no, just like you can’t get Radio Brigadoon in Perth. Yes, Kathy Perks! After years of silence, the manager of Grey Gables is audible again – revealed as the mystery wearer of the Easter bunny costume who, face it, was never going to be Rob Titchener returned in disguise to abduct little Jack, though that would have been quite exciting. She’s reappeared just in time for Oliver and his new business partner, Adil, to pull a P&amp;O and make the entire workforce of Grey Gables redundant without a statutory consultation period. It had to happen: the fabled gables were increasingly, well, grey and, by the sounds of it, peeling. It seems it’s going to be renovated for a year and reopened as a slightly less terrible hotel. I would have thought a different business might provide more plot opportunities. Nuclear power station, à la Springfield? Young offenders’ unit? Asylum seekers’ “reception centre”? That would be nicely topical, what with the real-life plans to establish “Guantánamo-on-Ouse” in a bucolic Yorkshire village.

Kohei Saito on connecting communism with the climate crisis","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When academic Kohei Saito submitted his manuscript on Karl Marx, the ecological crisis and arguments for degrowth economics, he hoped it might introduce at least some people in Japan to a new perspective on the climate crisis. Fast forward three years and the subsequent book, Capital in the Anthropocene, has sold more than half a million copies and Saito, a thoughtful 36-year-old, is now something of a Marxist celebrity. “It was a big surprise,” admits Saito on Zoom from his study in Tokyo, “because who cares about Marx and communism?” Now Saito, who says he has not always been a “degrowth communist”, has written a more academic text, Marx in the Anthropocene, which builds on those arguments to propose degrowth communism as a “new way of living”. At a time when degrowth economics is being hotly debated within and outside the environmental movement, Saito’s aim, he explains, is to “overcome the divide between Marxism and degrowth”, bringing together the red and the green. Many in the environmental movement argue that capitalism and its “infinite accumulation on a finite planet … is the root cause of climate breakdown”, writes Saito. But because Marx’s writings on ecology have often been marginalised, there’s a view that his socialism is pro-technological and anti-ecological – supporting the development of technologies to lay the foundation for a post-capitalist society and ignoring nature’s limits, believing it can be dominated by humans. According to Saito, it is possible and necessary to reconstruct Marx so we can see how he analysed economic and ecological crisis. Saito first studied Marx when he was an undergrad at the University of Tokyo, trying to understand degrading working conditions among temporary workers in Japan. After the earthquake and the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, he realised “how capitalism is not just simply exploiting workers but also seriously degrading the environment”. Influenced by scholars who made the case for Marx as an ecological thinker – including Paul Burkett and John Bellamy Foster – Saito sharpened his analysis studying in the US and began to learn German before his next move. It was in Berlin, where he researched his PhD-cum-award-winning book, that he became involved in editing the new complete works of Marx and Friedrich Engels, Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe, including some of Marx’s long-neglected notebooks. “If you look at his notebooks, one realises he studies two weird fields: one is natural science and the other one is capitalist societies.” While Marx was supposed to be finishing Volume II and III of Capital, he was “actually studying natural science, chemistry, geology”. This shift points to a vital change in Marx’s thinking, argues Saito. “With his growing interest in ecology,” Saito writes, “Marx came to see the plunder of the natural environment as a manifestation of the central contradiction of capitalism.” By synthesising these different approaches, Saito developed a “unique way of reading Marx”, he says, as a “degrowth ecological communist”. Degrowth argues that economic growth – the holy grail for governments in most countries – is simply not sustainable and that to stop climate breakdown, we need to reduce consumption. Saito cites Jason Hickel’s work as one example. He is conscious of the critique that denying many countries in the global south the chance to “develop” in the way the north has could be destructive to people who are already very poor. Woven throughout Marx in the Anthropocene is a mindfulness of this global imbalance. “Like many degrowth people I limit the scope of the argument to the global north, developed countries like the UK, Japan and the US. I am obviously pro-growth for those poor countries in the global south.” What is needed to achieve that is a new idea of “abundance” and “progress”, Saito says. Everyone on the planet should have access to the basic things we need to live – electricity, water, education – but “we need to come up with a vision where mass production, mass consumption and mass waste can be avoided.” Crucial to imagining this alternative world is another strand of thinking in Marx’s notebooks: his interest in pre-capitalist, non-western societies. Contra to the ethnocentrism in some of his earlier work, in the end, Marx emphasised “the importance of learning” from these parts of the world “for the western societies”. Informed by this and his ecological studies, Marx’s idea of communism changed significantly, and was no longer growth-driven. “The pre-capitalist society had a unique way of communal regulations of land,” Saito says, “and they also imposed various rules on their production and consumption which realised a more steady-state of sustainable production.” Still, you may wonder why such a deep engagement with a 19th-century thinker matters today. Saito argues that Marx’s way of understanding the relationship between humans and nature – encapsulated in the theory of “metabolic rift”, a vigorously debated subject in Marxist circles – can determine how we respond to the climate and ecological crisis we now face. The basic premise of this thesis is that human/nature interaction is the “basis of living”, but capitalism organises “human interactions with their ecosystems” in such a way that it creates “a great chasm in these processes and threatens both human and nonhuman beings”, Saito says. Some criticise this concept, arguing that it divides nature and society so as to ignore how the former is completely transformed by capitalism. But Saito doesn’t agree. His use of the term Anthropocene is meant to recognise that the “entire planet is now fully transformed by our economic activities”, but he rejects that this means we don not have to distinguish between nature and society. If we understand the two as the same, Saito argues, we risk believing environmental problems can be overcome through more human intervention. We must be attuned to the differences to grasp what “we cannot change” – such as temperature increases due to CO2 and the natural chain reactions that flow from that – and what we can: most urgently “the fossil fuel industry”, Saito says. This makes him sceptical of technological utopianism. Though he had once been optimistic about the possibility of technological progress, he now sees the limitations. “By hoping there will be new technologies, we simply wait until they will be invented but the result will be they will never be and we will be all dead,” Saito says. This is not just a criticism of much-lauded technological fixes within capitalism, such as carbon capture and storage, but of the idea that we can transfer capitalist technologies to an automated communist utopia – where collectively owned robots do the vast majority of the work and there is no more resource scarcity thanks to green energy and things like asteroid mining. Saito welcomes these attempts for imagining a post-capitalist world but sees them as ultimately misguided. “This kind of abundant future appeals to the satisfaction of people’s immediate desires without challenging the current imperial mode of living in the global north,” he observes. “Such a vision accepts too uncritically existing value-standards and consumerist ideals.” Capitalism doesn’t just flout natural scarcity, caring little for the planet’s limits, Saito argues – it artificially creates a social scarcity, where we are always compelled to want more: the latest phone, car or jacket. But we can reorganise our relationship with nature, Saito insists, to imagine a new kind of abundance: regulating advertising, SUV usage and constant mobile phone model changes while “distributing both wealth and burdens more equally and justly among members of the society”. Some sectors – those that don’t make a profit and so are underdeveloped in capitalism – would be improved, which would mean more money and resources for “education, care work, art, sports and public transportation”. Saito maintains this is not a miserabilist alternative future. Pointing to Kate Soper’s thinking, he says that the constant need to engage in competitive work and consumption is not a mark of the good life and in fact limits opportunities for fulfilling experiences outside the market. Without the need to produce for excessive, unnecessary consumption (that which is “necessary” for economic growth, not the development of the individual), jobs could be fundamentally changed. We could spend far fewer hours working, using our abilities and talents to do what we can and sharing the unpleasant and boring tasks more fairly. Saito, though, does not see this as a romanticised “return-to the countryside”, abandoning all technologies in the process; nor is he a Soviet Marxist. Using André Gorz’s distinction between “open” and “locking technology”, he advocates for the former. While the latter is “about domination over people and nature”, where “technology is for discipline and monopoly” – he gives nuclear power plants as an example – open technologies can be run at a local level by cooperatives. Solar panels, for instance, are a more democratic way of “controlling energy and electricity”, he says. This doesn’t amount to doing away with the state entirely, but he stresses: “My vision is not Soviet-style – I am not arguing for the state ownership of everything or state-planned economy.” That would simply change too little. One question, though, is how possible any of this actually is. Saito is aware of the challenges, but he points to Gen Z, Just Stop Oil, climate protests around the world, and Alberto Garzón, the Spanish minister for consumer affairs, who recently wrote about the limits of growth. This is a big change compared with the past 30 years, when such movements have been marginalised. “I am hoping the 2020s and 2030s will become much more turbulent as the crisis deepens,” he says, and hopes that the amount of radical protest will grow and changes in our values will continue to accelerate. “What I am trying to do,” Saito says at the end of our conversation, “is, inspired by these movements, offer something for them … I tried to show why it is necessary to criticise capitalism and why socialism or communism can be a more solid foundation for their movements too.” Marx in the Anthropocene: Towards the Idea of Degrowth Communism is published by Cambridge University Press on 28 February"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/oct/26/plan-for-new-uk-nuclear-financing-model-moves-upfront-cost-to-energy-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-26T16:38:42Z","webTitle":"Plan for UK nuclear financing model moves upfront cost to energy bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/26/plan-for-new-uk-nuclear-financing-model-moves-upfront-cost-to-energy-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/oct/26/plan-for-new-uk-nuclear-financing-model-moves-upfront-cost-to-energy-bills","fields":{"headline":"Plan for UK nuclear financing model moves upfront cost to energy bills","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The government plans to resuscitate the UK’s nuclear energy ambitions by creating a financing model that could pile part of the upfront cost of the £20bn Sizewell C power plant on to householders’ energy bills before it starts generating electricity. The energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, set out legislation on Tuesday that would share the early construction costs with consumers, with the aim of reducing the UK’s reliance on overseas funding for nuclear projects by making them more attractive to domestic investors. The long-awaited legislation could also pave the way for the government to take a direct stake in the Sizewell C nuclear plant by using tens of millions of pounds of public money during its risky development phase – replacing the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN), which has a 20% share of the project. Kwarteng said the existing financing scheme, which was used to back the Hinkley Point C nuclear scheme in Somerset, had led to “too many overseas nuclear developers walking away from projects, setting Britain back years”. The legal backing for a new financing model is expected to help clear the way for the energy firm EDF to build Sizewell C in Suffolk after years of wrangling over how to fund the huge upfront cost of constructing a nuclear plant. Under the new financing framework, known as a regulated asset base (RAB) model, EDF would start earning money – collected from energy bills – long before the reactor begins generating electricity. The government said each household would not have to pay more than a few pounds a year extra on its bills to support the project during construction, but Sizewell C could save households more than £30bn over the facility’s lifetime. The plant, which is still going through the planning process, could eventually power 6m homes, but has been plagued by opposition from local campaigners, concerns about costs and the involvement of state-owned CGN. CGN is a minority partner in EDF’s Hinkley Point scheme, and is interested in building its own reactor at Bradwell-on-Sea in Essex. However, its involvement in the nuclear industry has faced growing worries over national security. The US has urged the UK to cut the company from its nuclear programme. Kwarteng said: “We urgently need a new approach to attract British funds and other private investors to back new large-scale nuclear power stations.” The government’s nuclear ambitions have foundered in recent years, with companies including the South Korea power utility company Kepco and Japan’s Hitachi and Toshiba abandoning plans to build in the UK. Greg Hands, the minister for energy and clean growth, said the legislation would help the UK to build “the new nuclear power stations we need to ensure a resilient, low-carbon electricity system for future generations. “This finance model will also support the UK’s thriving civil nuclear industry, which currently employs 60,000 in high-skilled jobs, and help create thousands more as we level up opportunities across the whole country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/sep/28/will-labours-energy-plans-work","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-28T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Will Labour’s energy plans work?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/28/will-labours-energy-plans-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/sep/28/will-labours-energy-plans-work","fields":{"headline":"Will Labour’s energy plans work?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Labour’s ambitious plan for zero-carbon power by 2030 raises legitimate questions – which we’ll come to shortly – but the commentary in rightwing newspapers is bizarrely wide of the mark. Perhaps the strangest was a Daily Telegraph editorial that claimed Labour’s plan “would make the country more dependent on imported gas, not less”. As should be obvious, the opposite is true. The UK used 254 terawatt hours (TWh) of gas last year to generate 123TWh of electricity, 40% of the national total. Under Labour’s plan, gas demand for electricity would be 97% lower by 2030. (Why does it take 254TWh of gas to make 123TWh of electricity? Simply because burning fossil fuels is inefficient and half of the energy in the gas is wasted at the power station.) The UK’s low-carbon electricity sources are already saving huge amounts of gas: In 2022 to date, nuclear and renewables have generated 129TWh, more than the 95TWh we got from gas. The Daily Telegraph editorial echoed comments made by the likes of Darren Grimes and Julia Hartley-Brewer, who complained that we “can’t rely on solar or wind to keep our lights on”. Similarly, while interviewing the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg asked if fossil fuels would still be needed as backup in 2030, pointing to low wind output last Friday. Elsewhere, the Daily Mail said Starmer had been “forced to backtrack” by “admit[ting]” fossil fuels might still be used as backup under his 2030 plan. This was not so much an admission as a reiteration: Labour’s own press release had said it would “maintain … a strategic reserve of backup gas power”, as well as a range of other sources. Indeed, Labour’s plan does not rely on wind and solar alone. The hour-by-hour electricity system modelling behind Labour’s plans shows what would fill the gaps when the wind does not blow. In line with the clear consensus that cheap renewables will make up the bulk of electricity supplies in the future, Labour sees wind and solar making up about 70% of the electricity mix in 2030. Almost all of the remaining 30% of the nation’s electricity would come from a mixture of other low-carbon sources including additional new nuclear plants, other renewables and hydrogen. The modelling then leaves a very small share – about 0.7% of annual electricity in 2030 – coming from gas power. A further 0.5% would come from gas plants fitted with carbon capture equipment that prevents their carbon dioxide emissions from reaching the atmosphere. It’s clear that it would be possible to run a reliable UK electricity system on virtually 100% clean power, even during so-called “kalte dunkelflaute” with cold weather and little wind or sun. It’s also worth noting that Labour is not alone in imagining a fully decarbonised UK electricity system will soon be possible. The current government ambition, which is also backed by detailed modelling, is for 95% clean power by 2030 and close to 100% by 2035. Similarly, the National Grid Electricity System Operator has set out a range of “credible ways” to meet the UK’s net zero 2050 target, including one which reaches 98% clean power by 2030. Nevertheless, there are legitimate questions about the pace of Labour’s ambition, which would imply going from the current level of about 55% clean power to 99% in less than a decade. This rate of change would be historically unprecedented, at the same time as electricity demand increases to meet growing demand from electric vehicles and heat pumps. Until the 1960s, fossil fuels supplied more than 95% of the UK’s electricity. The development of nuclear power pushed the low-carbon share of electricity towards 25% by the late 1980s, where it remained into the early part of this century. More recently, the rapid growth of wind, solar and other renewables has seen the UK transform its electricity supply in a decade. Yet despite clean sources growing their share of UK electricity by 2.9 percentage points every year since 2010, fossil fuels still make up 45% of the total. Reaching Labour’s ambition for 99% by 2030 would mean increasing the rate of growth from 2.9 percentage points a year up to 4.9, starting this year. If this sprint only begins after the next election in 2024, the pace would need to be faster, at more than 7 percentage points a year. These are not only mathematical challenges – and it is not only a matter of doubling onshore wind, tripling solar and quadrupling offshore wind, as Starmer has pledged. (Meeting these renewable targets is likely to require planning reform to speed up the process of approvals.) If Labour’s goal is to be met, the UK must also build new nuclear plants, gas plants with carbon capture and storage, hydrogen turbines with clean hydrogen to fuel them, along with huge increases in electricity network capacity, energy storage and “demand-side response”. While the UK need not follow the precise pathway set out in the modelling behind Labour’s proposals, it would need an equivalent set of alternatives to reach close to 100% clean power. And even if Labour’s 2030 target proves too ambitious to meet, the government’s goal of a fully decarbonised electricity system by 2035 is not exactly far behind. Regardless of these question marks, one thing is for sure – whatever the editorial pages of the Daily Telegraph suggests: Whether the UK reaches 100% clean power by 2030 or 2035, the shift towards wind, solar and other low-carbon sources is 100% guaranteed to cut our demand for gas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/27/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-216-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-27T15:19:59Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 216 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/27/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-216-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/27/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-216-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 216 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russia’s “referendums” in Ukraine, which could lead to Moscow annexing 15% of the country’s territory, are due to end on Tuesday. Voting in the eastern provinces of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia began on Friday, Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Tuesday that Russia wants to “save people” in the four Moscow-controlled territories. Russian media have announced early results, claiming that with approaching a quarter of the “votes” counted in each of the four referendums, all the regions have voted by at least 97% to be annexed by Russia. The process has been dismissed as a sham by western nations, and described as a “propaganda show” by Ukrainian authorities, which have pledged not to recognise the results. Putin is scheduled to address both houses of Russian parliament on Friday 30 September, and may use the address to formally announce the accession of the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine into Russia, the British Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Denmark’s military has issued an image of gas bubbling at the surface of the Baltic Sea after “unprecedented” damage to the Nord Stream pipelines, which has seen three offshore lines of the system damaged in one day. Seismologists in Sweden say on Monday they detected what they described as two explosions in the regions of the Baltic sea where the leaks have occurred. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has already called the leaks “an act of sabotage” which he said “related to the next step of escalation of the situation in Ukraine.” The United Nations human rights office has said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had caused a dire human rights situation and led to a wide range of rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and torture, that could amount to war crimes. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said in a report that it was particularly concerned about torture and ill treatment of detainees by Russian forces and affiliated armed groups, but said there had been rights violations by both sides. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called Russia’s mobilisation “a frank attempt to give commanders on the ground a constant stream of “cannon fodder”,” in the Ukrainian president’s nightly address on Monday evening. Ukraine claims some Russian conscripts from the Kremlin’s mass mobilisation are being sent directly to the frontlines without training. Those included newly drafted personnel in Crimea as well as conscripts in the Luhansk region who have received draft summonses in recent days. The Kremlin said it had made no decision on closing Russia’s borders as the first mobilisation since the second world war prompted some to flee. Georgia and Kazakhstan said that tens of thousands of Russians had flooded into their countries from neighbouring Russia as military-aged men avoid military call-up The Russian Orthodox Church head says Russian soldiers who die on the battlefield will have their sins absolved. Patriach Kirill, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and a staunch supporter of the Ukraine invasion, said the “sacrifice washes away all sins”. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish deputy chairman of the security council of Russia, has again threatened the west with the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and said “Imagine that Russia is forced to use the most formidable weapon against the Ukrainian regime, which has committed a large-scale act of aggression, which is dangerous for the very existence of our state. I believe that Nato will not directly intervene in the conflict even in this situation. After all, the security of Washington, London, and Brussels is much more important for the North Atlantic Alliance than the fate of Ukraine, which no one needs, even if it is abundantly supplied with various weapons.” Germany’s economy minister expects to have to extend the lifespans of the country’s last two nuclear power plants to avoid possible outages and grid bottlenecks in Europe’s biggest economy this winter. Refugees arriving from Ukraine have helped drive Germany’s population to its highest level, the Federal Statistical Office said, with more than 84 million people now living in the European Union’s most populous country. Germany’s female population grew by 1.2%, significantly more than its male population, which increased by 0.8%, reflecting the fact that mainly women and children fled the war in Ukraine. Japan’s foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, has commented on the detention of the country’s consul, telling reporters that he was subjected to a “coercive interrogation” during his detention by Russia’s FSB security service and that Japan has demanded an apology. Hayashi told reporters on Tuesday that consul Motoki Tatsunori had not engaged in any illegal activity and described his detention, which lasted several hours, as “totally unacceptable”. The Philippines is in talks with Russia to buy fuel and other commodities, according to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who said the country’s national interests had to take precedence over politics. A Russian man on Monday shot the leader of the local military draft committee in a Siberian town after telling him he would refuse to fight in Ukraine. Video showed the gunman, dressed in camouflage, firing at the official from point-blank range as other potential draftees for the Russian invasion fled the room. The US pledged to provide Ukraine with $457.5m in civilian security aid. The support was aimed at “saving lives” and “bolstering” Ukrainian law enforcement, said the secretary of state, Antony Blinken. The UK announced 92 new sanctions on Monday in response to Russia’s “sham referendums” in Ukraine. The package of penalties target those behind the sham votes as well as oligarchs and board members."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/08/liz-truss-energy-bills-plan-key-points","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-08T11:03:26Z","webTitle":"Liz Truss’s energy bailout: key points at a glance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/08/liz-truss-energy-bills-plan-key-points","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/08/liz-truss-energy-bills-plan-key-points","fields":{"headline":"Liz Truss’s energy bailout: key points at a glance","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Help for consumers Liz Truss has promised to freeze energy bills at an average of £2,500 a year for the next two years from 1 October under the “energy price guarantee”. This will replace the existing Ofgem energy price cap that was due to reach £3,549 from that date. The freeze includes the temporary removal of green levies on household bills, worth about £150. The government said the measure will save the average household about £1,000 a year and is in addition to the £400 of support for all households announced by the former chancellor Rishi Sunak in May. People who are on fixed-term tariffs are likely to receive a matching discount, after negotiations by the government with suppliers. Households who do not pay directly for mains gas and electricity, such as those living in park homes, using heating oil or on heat networks, will not be worse off and said they would receive personal support through a separate fund. Help for businesses Businesses and public sector organisations will have a new-six month scheme offering “equivalent support”. The detail is limited but it is expected to be an intervention to subsidise the wholesale price of gas. After the end of the six months, there will be ongoing support for “vulnerable industries”. Truss’s spokesperson described vulnerable industries as likely to include hospitality such as pubs, but would not go further on what percentage of firms were likely to be classified as such. A review will take place in three months’ time to consider whether the scheme should become more targeted. New oil, gas and fracking licences A licensing round will be launched as early as next week and is expected to lead to more than 100 new licences. The moratorium on UK shale gas production is to be lifted. “This will enable developers to seek planning permission where there is local support, which could get gas flowing in as soon as six months,” the government said. The government has decided to publish the British Geological Survey’s report into fracking, which was commissioned by the then business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, earlier this year. The study suggests “more drilling is required to establish data on shale resources and seismic impacts”, effectively reopening the door to an industry that has been on hold since 2019. The government hopes to “continue progressing” in its mission to generate 24 gigawatts of power from nuclear by 2050. A dedicated body, Great British Nuclear, has been set up to attempt to achieve this aim. Truss also announced a review of the government’s net zero strategy, under the “altered economic landscape”. The review is likely to raise alarm bells from environmental campaigners, but will be led by Chris Skidmore, who chairs the Net Zero Support Group of Conservative MPs and is a key proponent of meeting the targets. Help for suppliers The Treasury will work with the Bank of England to “address the extraordinary liquidity requirements faced by energy firms operating in UK wholesale gas and electricity markets”. The energy markets financing scheme, which is meant as a “last resort”, is designed to “enable stability to both energy and financial markets, and reduce costs for businesses and consumers”. It will open “by the end of October or sooner”. Energy companies have sought to secure their balance sheets amid fears they will have to buy their energy in advance in volatile wholesale markets. Reforms to the structure and regulation of the energy markets are expected to be undertaken after a review of regulations. Funding the support The government will fund the scheme to reduce the unit cost of energy via increased borrowing, likely to exceed £100bn. However, Whitehall sources said estimates for the cost will not come until the chancellor’s fiscal statement later this month. A new windfall tax on energy firms “would discourage the very investment we need to secure home grown energy supplies”, said Truss. The government expects to be able to reduce the cost of the intervention in three ways: negotiating the long-term gas contracts; negotiating with renewable producers to reduce the prices they charge; and accelerating new sources of energy supply. Costs to the exchequer are also hoped to be reduced via a positive impact on gross domestic product, on tax receipts and household incomes. But internally Treasury officials have warned the cost of doing nothing to save customers defaulting, and businesses and energy companies from collapsing would be far greater. The Treasury is declining to outline the costs because of the volatility in the price of gas over the coming year, but sources suggested £150bn was at the upper end of predictions. The Treasury will amend the Debt Management Office’s remit in the coming weeks, to account for the substantial extra borrowing after the mini-budget. Reducing wholesale prices An energy supply taskforce headed by Madelaine McTernan, who led the UK’s Covid vaccine taskforce, has begun negotiations with “domestic and international suppliers” to agree contracts that reduce the price they charge for energy. The taskforce will also negotiate with electricity generators – including wind, solar and nuclear power producers, some of whom have made windfall gains from the rise in wholesale gas prices – to reduce the prices they charge. The talks follow proposals for a scheme where producers on renewable obligation contracts are encouraged to switch to contracts for difference."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/oct/18/fukushima-japans-new-pm-wont-delay-release-of-contaminated-water-into-ocean","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-18T04:32:19Z","webTitle":"Fukushima: Japan’s new PM won’t delay release of contaminated water into ocean","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/18/fukushima-japans-new-pm-wont-delay-release-of-contaminated-water-into-ocean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/oct/18/fukushima-japans-new-pm-wont-delay-release-of-contaminated-water-into-ocean","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima: Japan’s new PM won’t delay release of contaminated water into ocean","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Japan’s new prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has said that there can be no delay to plans to release contaminated water from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the sea, despite opposition from fishers and neighbouring countries. Kishida, who made his first trip to the plant at the weekend since becoming prime minister last month, said every effort would be made to reassure local people that disposing of the water in the Pacific Ocean was safe. The wastewater, which is pumped up from reactor basements and treated to remove all but one radioactive material, has built up at the site since the plant suffered a triple meltdown in March 2011. “I felt strongly that the water issue is a crucial one that should not be pushed back,” Kishida told reporters after being shown around by the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power. More than one million tonnes of water are being stored in 1,000 tanks at the site, and Tepco has warned that space will run out late next year. The government and Tepco said in April that work to release the heavily diluted water would begin in the spring of 2023 and take decades to complete. The move is opposed by nearby fishing communities which say it will undo years of hard work rebuilding their industry’s reputation since the plant was struck by a huge tsunami in March 2011, soon after Japan’s north-east coast was rocked by a magnitude-9 earthquake. The decision ended years of debate over what to do with the water, with other options including evaporation or the construction of more storage tanks at other sites. Neighbouring South Korea, which still bans seafood imports from the region, has repeatedly voiced concern, claiming that discharging the water represented a “grave threat” to the marine environment. The South Korean Olympic committee made separate catering arrangements for the country’s athletes during the Tokyo Olympics amid concern they could be served food from Fukushima, even though produce from the region undergoes rigorous safety checks. Japan’s government says releasing the water is the most realistic option and will enable workers at the site to proceed with decommissioning the plant – a costly operation that is expected to take about 40 years. “We will provide explanations about safety from a scientific viewpoint and transparency in order to address people’s concerns,” Kishida said. Japan has requested help from the International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure the discharge meets global safety standards, including treating the wastewater so its radioactivity levels are below legal limits. Tepco’s Advanced Liquid Processing System reduces radioactive substances in the water to safe levels, but the system is unable to filter out tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. Experts say tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, is only harmful to humans in very large doses, while government and Tepco officials have pointed out that working nuclear plants routinely dilute and release tritium into the ocean. Kishida, who supports the restart of nuclear reactors that were idled after the Fukushima meltdown, offered flowers and prayed at a monument to the disaster in Namie, one of several communities near the plant that were declared no-go zones after the disaster. Some residents have since returned to their homes after evacuation orders were lifted. Kishida has said that nuclear power must be part of Japan’s energy mix if it is to become carbon neutral by 2050. But he has yet to confirm if he will attend the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow early next month, with Japanese media reports suggesting he won’t decide until after lower house elections are held at the end of this month. Boris Johnson encouraged Kishida to attend the summit during a phone call last week, adding that Britain was considering lifting import restrictions on Fukushima produce that were introduced while it was a member of the European Union, according to the Kyodo news agency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/07/eu-sets-out-plans-for-windfall-taxes-and-power-savings-amid-energy-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T15:07:41Z","webTitle":"EU sets out plans for windfall taxes and power savings amid energy crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/07/eu-sets-out-plans-for-windfall-taxes-and-power-savings-amid-energy-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/07/eu-sets-out-plans-for-windfall-taxes-and-power-savings-amid-energy-crisis","fields":{"headline":"EU sets out plans for windfall taxes and power savings amid energy crisis","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The head of the EU executive, has set out plans for windfall taxes, mandatory electricity savings and a cap on the price of Russian gas to limit Kremlin revenues used to finance the “atrocious” war in Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen outlined a five-point plan in response to an energy price crisis, driven by the Russian shutdown of the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline but exacerbated by the climate crisis and lingering effects of the Covid pandemic. Low-carbon energy companies, renewable and nuclear suppliers that have reaped “enormous revenues … they never dreamed of” from generating electricity will face a cap on their revenues, Von der Leyen said, with proceeds earmarked to help domestic consumers and companies pay “astronomical” bills. Under EU energy rules, the price of electricity is determined by the cost of the most expensive fuel, usually gas, rather than cheaper renewables and nuclear power. As a result of all-time-high gas prices, low-carbon electricity generators have been rewarded with a big increase in income. “These revenues do not reflect their production costs,” Von der Leyen said. “So it is now time for the consumers to benefit from the low costs of low-carbon sources.” The commission, she said, proposed “to re-channel these unexpected profits” to allow member states to support vulnerable households and companies. Oil and gas companies that have made “massive profits” would also be subject to a windfall tax, which Von der Leyen called a “solidarity contribution”. While she did not mention specific numbers, a leaked document seen by the Guardian shows the commission wants a €200 (£173) per megawatt hour limit to the price of electricity generated by low-carbon technologies. The paper states this “mimics the market outcomes that could be expected were global supply chains functioning normally and not subject to the weaponisation of energy through gas supply disruptions”. The leaked document also reveals that the EU executive wants a mandatory 5% reduction in electricity use in peak hours. This echoes an earlier plan for gas savings, although EU member states decided those efficiency measures should be voluntary, raising questions about whether they will accept a mandatory target. Finally, Von der Leyen proposed a cap on the price of Russian gas, saying it was necessary to cut revenues that “Putin uses to finance his atrocious war in Ukraine”. The EU has spent nearly €88bn on Russian fossil fuels since the invasion began on 24 February, according to a tracker from the NGO Europe Beyond Coal. The plan to cap Russian gas ran into immediate opposition from the Czech Republic’s industry minister, Jozef Síkela, who is due to chair an EU crisis meeting on Friday. “It’s not a constructive proposal,” he told the Czech senate, adding that it looked like further “sanctions against Russia [rather] than an actual solution to the energy crisis in Europe”. Criticising the plan from a different angle, Poland argues the bloc should cap the price of all non-EU gas as it fears that targeting Russia will trigger retaliation that will deprive Ukraine of lucrative pipeline transit fees. Speaking in Vladivostok, Vladimir Putin dismissed attempts to cap the prices of oil and gas as “completely stupid” and “sheer nonsense”, while claiming that Russia had enough customers in Asia to ride out the damage. “Will they make political decisions contradicting contracts?” he said. “In that case, we won’t supply anything if it goes against our economic interests. We don’t supply anything: no gas, no oil, no coal, no heating oil, nothing.” Asked about his comments, Von der Leyen said Russia had already partially or completely cut off gas to 13 EU member states. “We don’t give anything any more on these announcements by Russia, because we know they’re blackmailing us. The best thing is to fortify ourselves and go towards other suppliers. And have solidarity.” The Kremlin-controlled state energy company Gazprom announced last Friday it would not be restarting gas flows through Nord Stream 1, the biggest pipeline connecting Russia and Europe. While Gazprom blamed “malfunctions” in a turbine along the pipeline, the Kremlin later said it would not resume full gas supplies until Europe lifted sanctions imposed in response to Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. Before the recent shutdown, gas deliveries from Russia to the EU had fallen to 30% of the 2016-21 average. Even before the war, Europe was already facing spiralling gas prices as Chinese demand for fuel surged in the economic rebound after the pandemic. Problems have been compounded by the record-breaking hot dry summer that has pushed up demand for air-conditioning, while reducing hydropower from rivers and reservoirs. Meanwhile half of France’s ageing fleet of nuclear reactors have been forced offline because of corrosion problems in key pipes and safety checks, reversing the country’s traditional role as exporter of electricity to its neighbours. Von der Leyen said the EU was seeing the effects of climate change and drought and described renewables as “our energy insurance for the future”. The long-awaited plans will be discussed by EU energy ministers in emergency talks on Friday. Von der Leyen – who has been accused of a slow response to the energy price surge – is due to discuss the plans with the bloc’s ambassadors on Wednesday, before further diplomatic talks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/04/pressure-mounts-germany-embargo-russian-energy-imports","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-04T14:05:56Z","webTitle":"Pressure mounts on German ministers to embargo Russian energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/pressure-mounts-germany-embargo-russian-energy-imports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/04/pressure-mounts-germany-embargo-russian-energy-imports","fields":{"headline":"Pressure mounts on German ministers to embargo Russian energy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The German government is facing growing pressure at home and abroad to introduce an energy embargo against Russia as reports of atrocities committed on Ukrainian civilians in Bucha increased the urgency of calls for action. Berlin has so far pushed back on appeals for an outright ban on energy imports from Russia, warning that the consequences for Europe’s largest economy and the entire European Union would be devastating. However, discussions are widespread about reducing industry production times to save energy, while ordinary Germans are being urged to turn down thermostats and drive more slowly. Pressure from Germany’s neighbours has been growing, particularly the Baltic states and Poland. Mateusz Morawiecki, the prime minister of Poland, on Monday accused Germany of “standing in the way” of harder sanctions against Russia. “Anyone who reads the notes of EU meetings knows that Germany is the biggest impediment when it comes to more decisive sanctions,” he told journalists in Warsaw. A spokesperson for the German government said it would not be considering an immediate energy embargo but it was determined to speed up its efforts to wean Germany off Russian gas and oil. “After these pictures of the weekend, we will once again see how we can more quickly, and by using further measures, reduce our dependence,” said Oliver Krischer, from the ministry for the economy and climate protection, on Monday morning. Efforts were being made to introduce a “quasi-embargo”, he said, through “non-purchase” and “energy-saving measures” as well as “diversification”, including buying liquefied petroleum gas. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said the atrocities – in which hundreds of civilians are believed to have been murdered north of Kyiv – would not go unanswered, calling them war crimes, and promised on Sunday night that Germany, together with its partners, would be increasing sanctions against Russia in the coming days. The defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, later went further, saying it was time for the EU to jointly discuss the option of a complete ban on Russian gas. “There must be a response,” she said in a television interview. “Such crimes cannot remain unanswered. But in a sign of debate even within the governing coalition, the finance minister, Christian Lindner, rejected a gas embargo. “We are dealing with a criminal war,” Lindner said before talks with his EU colleagues in Brussels. “It is clear we must end as quickly as possible all economic ties to Russia. We must plan tough sanctions, but gas cannot be substituted in the short term. We would inflict more damage on ourselves than on them.” Opinion polls have shown that the majority of Germans – between 55% and 77% – are in favour of stopping imports of gas from Russia, despite the impact it might have on their ability to heat their own homes. The majority said they were also in favour of temporarily increasing the lifespan of coal-fired plants and of making nuclear power plants – the phase-out of which began following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011 – operational again. As a whole, Europe gets about 40% of its gas supplies from Russia, but in Germany the figure is 55%. The EU gets 25% of its oil from Russia. The UK intends to press for a timetable for a total embargo on the import of Russian coal, gas and oil at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers, the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss said on Monday. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who met Truss in Warsaw, urged any country thinking of voting against such an embargo to come first to Bucha. He said he was not making the call for the embargo on the purchase of Russian fossil fuels as a foreign minister but as the demand of “the victims of rape, torture and killings, their relatives and the entire Ukrainian nation.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Monday said he was in favour of a new round of sanctions targeting Russia’s oil and coal sectors, but did not call for a EU ban on gas imports. Macron was named by Morawiecki as he called for European leaders to do more against Russia. “President Macron, how many times have you negotiated with Putin? What have you achieved? ... Would you negotiate with Hitler, with Stalin, with Pol Pot?” he asked. “Chancellor Scholz, Olaf, it is not the voices of German businesses that should be heard aloud in Berlin today. It is the voice of these innocent women and children.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had on Sunday accused the former German chancellor Angela Merkel and the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy of contributing to Russian aggression by making too many concessions towards Putin. “I invite Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy to visit Bucha and to see for their own eyes where the politics of making concessions to Russia in over 14 years has led. You will see tortured Ukrainian men and women with your own eyes,” he said in his nightly video address to Ukrainians. In particular, he levelled criticism at Merkel for not backing Ukraine’s attempts to join Nato in 2008. Merkel’s office responded unusually swiftly to the criticism. In a statement, a spokesperson said: “The retired German chancellor Dr Angela Merkel stands by her decision in conjunction with the Nato summit in Bucharest in 2008.” The spokesperson added that Merkel supported every effort of the German government to stop Russia’s invasion, especially in light of the “atrocities of Bucha and other parts of Ukraine”. Germany’s economics minister, Robert Habeck, who as a leading Green has pushed for years for the abolition of coal-fired plants and the scrapping of nuclear power plants, said Germany was working on reducing its reliance on Russian energy but that it could not happen overnight. “We are working every single day to create the preconditions and to pave the way towards an embargo,” he said when asked if news of the murder of civilians in Bucha would lead to a government rethink. “This is also, in the view of the federal government, as well as in my own opinion, the way forward and one which harms Putin on a daily basis.” • This article was amended on 5 April 2022 to remove a suggestion that the proportion of Germany’s gas supply that comes from Russia is the highest in Europe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/15/we-need-a-practical-handbook-to-build-a-bottom-up-democracy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-15T17:36:37Z","webTitle":"We need a practical handbook to build a bottom-up democracy | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/15/we-need-a-practical-handbook-to-build-a-bottom-up-democracy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/15/we-need-a-practical-handbook-to-build-a-bottom-up-democracy","fields":{"headline":"We need a practical handbook to build a bottom-up democracy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Many of us have been crying out for a sea change in our politics such as the one described by George Monbiot (Feeling the urge to take back control from power-mad governments?

Many of the older generation, who continue to prop up this dishonest and incompetent Tory government, yearn for things to be the way they were in “the good old days”. Perhaps knowing that our ancient ancestors actually were capable of caring about their less well-off neighbours, and seeing to it that people like Boris Johnson got their comeuppance before they had the chance to ruin the country, might make them feel that governance from the bottom up is not new and terrifying but simply another way of doing things that has always been an option.

People cannot be enfranchised politically while just a few thousand extremely wealthy individuals protect and enhance their asserted right to use the planet’s resources for their own benefit, at the expense of everybody else. In particular, we a have a completely inequitable ownership of land – Britain is a stark example, with only a dozen or so owning most of it – and the assumed right to exploit assets such as farming, fishing, minerals and fossil fuels on or under that land, with no participation, ownership or control by the population in general. It’s feudal. Among the necessary reforms is the urgent need to define the true wealth of environmental assets – breathable air, clean water, fertile soil, biodiverse forests and oceans – and to establish legal and economic systems that protect those things from harm. For instance, we should define a crime of environmental theft, which is what pollution amounts to. Today’s political class seek millionaire status by doing the bidding of the billionaires who are stealing the planet’s resources. Getting rid of them and their silly circuses is just the starting point. Bill Dixon The Hague, Netherlands • I am very happy to support George Monbiot’s call for participatory democracy in the form of assemblies. I would be even happier if he would accept the recommendations from an assembly that has actually taken place, the Climate Assembly UK, in September 2020. There, a majority of assembly members agreed that three ways of generating electricity should be part of how the UK gets to net zero: offshore wind, solar and onshore wind. Nuclear power, which Monbiot continues to advocate, saw lower levels of support. Here is an example of his “enclaves of democracy” that it seems he would rather disregard. Linda Rogers Llangoed, Anglesey • No, George, no. As Simon Jenkins explains so eloquently (Why the Labour party is praying for the Tories not to vote for Rishi Sunak, 12 July), the answer to our governmental ills is not more power to the people – which has brought us Trumpism, Johnsonism and populist rule by the angry old white men of the Daily Express and Daily Mail. The answer is to strengthen our institutions so that errant prime ministers cannot prorogue parliament or disobey international law when they feel like it, or have their cheerleaders squeal “enemies of the people!” when the law gets in their way. If ever there was a lesson from the last few disastrous years, it is this. Jonathan Harris Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

With the threat of shortages possible this winter, officials have raised the option of the UK public being requested to reduce their energy usage, after countries in the EU including France and Germany were asked to cut gas demand by 15%. People across Europe have been urged to switch off lights and use appliances less often, after all member states apart from Hungary agreed to a voluntary cut in usage. However, Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, who is likely to be Truss’s next chancellor, is opposed to such a move, believing it is not necessary for the UK and that energy use should be up to individuals. Asked whether people should reduce how much energy they use given the high cost and worries about supply, a spokesperson for Boris Johnson said on Monday: “These decisions, in terms of energy consumption, remain decisions for individuals. “Households, businesses and industry can be confident that they will have the electricity and gas that they need.” The government favours a plan put forward by National Grid to incentivise households with smart meters to save energy by paying them to use appliances at off-peak times. “We support the National Grid in developing all options which could benefit consumers and help to reduce bills by spreading out peak demand,” No 10 said. Concern about energy security has risen since a report was leaked to Bloomberg showing the government had prepared crisis plans modelling a situation where businesses and even consumers could face blackouts this winter. Under the government’s latest “reasonable worst case scenario”, officials believe the UK could experience blackouts for several days in January if cold weather combined with gas shortages to leave the country short of power. At the same time, annual energy bills are forecast by one analyst, Auxilione, to top £6,000 next year, triggering Labour to warn that Britons face “serious hardship on a massive scale” if the government does not intervene. Advising households on how to cut energy usage has previously been attempted in a 1922 Committee report published in April, led by Andrea Leadsom, a former energy secretary. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) committee she chaired proposed that there should be improved guidance on cutting energy usage, better access to existing education and incentive schemes, and clearer messaging on money-saving ideas such as turning off radiators in unused rooms, reducing pressure to hot water taps and reducing radiator settings on gas boilers to between 55C and 65C to optimise energy output. The committee also suggested stronger public messaging on the advantage of smart meters and pressure on energy companies to bring forward smart tariffs. Leadsom said on Monday there was a “really strong case” for these measures. However, politicians can be sensitive about public perceptions of asking people to use less energy. Some energy bosses have been pilloried for giving tips on keeping warm, such as putting on jumpers, doing star jumps, cuddling pets or eating porridge. In the EU, Brussels is urging governments to launch campaigns to encourage people to switch off lights and turn down thermostats and air conditioning. Industrial users may also be given targets to reduce heating and cooling. EU governments are being urged to speed up the switch to renewable energy, but are also asked to consider delaying their exit from nuclear power or coal – an effort to find any alternative to Russian gas. The government insists that power cuts and energy shortages are extremely unlikely. However, Adam Bell, a former policy senior official at BEIS, told the BBC’s PM programme he thought there was about a one-in-10 chance of seeing limited, planned blackouts in certain parts of the country over the winter. He also said: “The right thing to do now is to get used to lowering our demand so we can eliminate that chance as much as we can.” Bell said there were stages that could be gone through, including switching some industry off, then export pipelines and then homes. “But because we might be in that situation, there’s a lot households should be thinking about now, to help minimise the likelihood … like turning down your thermostat by one degree and optimising the flow temperature in your boiler as well as draught-proofing where you can.” A government spokesperson said: “Households, businesses and industry can be confident that the UK’s secure and diverse energy supplies will provide the electricity and gas they need. “Decisions on energy consumption rightly remain a matter for individuals and we recognise households will have different energy usage needs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/09/ukraine-russia-war-live-zelenskiy-counteroffensive-pressure-russian-troops","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-09T18:07:24Z","webTitle":"Ukraine-Russia war: power infrastructure in Enerhodar destroyed by shelling, says UN – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/09/ukraine-russia-war-live-zelenskiy-counteroffensive-pressure-russian-troops","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/09/ukraine-russia-war-live-zelenskiy-counteroffensive-pressure-russian-troops","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine-Russia war: power infrastructure in Enerhodar destroyed by shelling, says UN – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is just past 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: The European Commission on Friday urged EU member states to reassess the terms on which they grant visas to Russian travellers and to root out applicants that pose a security threat. “We should not be naive, Putin’s aim is to destroy the EU and he would like to attack us where we are weakest,” warned EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson. Russia said on Friday it was dispatching reinforcements to the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine where Kyiv’s forces have announced robust gains as part of a broader counter-offensive. State media broadcast footage of columns of Russian tanks, support vehicles and artillery travelling along paved roads and dirt tracks, emblazoned with the letter “Z”, the symbol of Moscow’s invasion. The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said on Friday that it had pushed back against Russian attacks near 10 settlements, the Kyiv Independent reports. It added that Russian forces had launched more than 12 missiles and more than 12 airstrikes on Ukrainian territory in the last 24 hours. Shelling has destroyed power infrastructure at the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar where staff operating the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant live. The shelling posses a growing threat to the plant, the UN nuclear watchdog said on Friday. EU finance ministers on Friday supported a €5bn ($5bn) loan for Ukraine to help maintain the country’s schools, hospitals and other needed operations in the midst of Russia’s invasion. The €5bn loan agreed on Friday, which will be backed by guarantees of EU member states, is part of an overall €9bn package announced in May. The EU executive pledged on Friday to devise unprecedented measures in the coming days to address an energy price shock as a result of Russia’s war on Ukraine, including a controversial gas price cap that could further anger the Kremlin. European energy ministers tasked the European Commission with working through the weekend to draw up legal texts that will include emergency funding for consumers struggling to afford soaring bills. The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Friday conditions at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are increasingly precarious and that a safety zone around it needs to be established immediately to prevent a nuclear accident. IAEA director Rafael Mariano Grossi said that there is minimal chance of re-establishing reliable offsite power lines to the plant and its Ukrainian operator is considering shutting down the only remaining operating reactor. A Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region announced on Friday that civilians are being evacuated from three of the region’s Russian-controlled territories that have come under threat from a Ukrainian counteroffensive. The European Commission on Friday urged EU member states to reassess the terms on which they grant visas to Russian travellers and to root out applicants that pose a security threat. “We should not be naive, Putin’s aim is to destroy the EU and he would like to attack us where we are weakest,” warned EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson, Agence France-Presse reports. Johansson warned that civilians could act as spies, saboteurs or provocateurs and alleged that some Russian travellers had sought to harass and humiliate Ukrainian refugees, who have been granted protected status within the EU. “We can not exclude that people are coming with the aim to provoke, to try to get some social unrest, or to provoke violence or riots or things like that or to try to use propaganda,” she said. On Friday, the EU formally suspended a 2007 visa facilitation pact that had made it easier and cheaper for Russians to travel to Europe, but stopped short of the full travel ban demanded by some member states. Johansson said the new rules would still allow passage to vetted dissidents, journalists and humanitarian cases, but that applications for simple tourist and business visas should be “reassessed.” Just under a million Russians already hold visas for the EU’s Schengen travel area, and the commissioner said member states should also reassess these existing travel documents. Russia said on Friday it was dispatching reinforcements to the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine where Kyiv’s forces have announced robust gains as part of a broader counter-offensive. Agence France-Presse reports: State media broadcast footage of columns of Russian tanks, support vehicles and artillery travelling along paved roads and dirt tracks, emblazoned with the letter “Z”, the symbol of Moscow’s invasion. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said meanwhile that Russia’s push to send reinforcements showed Moscow was paying “huge costs” in its bid to capture and then hold Ukrainian territory. A Moscow-installed official in the region, Vitaliy Ganchev, said in televised remarks that “fierce battles” were under way near Balakliya, a town in the Kharkiv region that Ukraine said it had recaptured on Thursday. “We do not control Balakliya. Attempts are being made to dislodge the Ukrainian forces, but there are fierce battles and our troops are being held back on the approaches,” Ganchev said. “Now Russian reserves have been brought there, our troops are fighting back,” he added. His comments come after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy shared footage late Thursday showing camouflage-clad Ukrainian soldiers holding his country’s blue-and-yellow flag over Balakliya. The town, which had been under Russian control for around six months and had a pre-war population of around 30,000 people, fell easily and early on to Russian forces who invaded in February. Now, Russian officials in the Kharkiv region say they are evacuating civilians towards Russia “until the situation stabilises.” “We have been trying to focus all our efforts on evacuating the local population for three or four days,” Russian-appointed official Maxim Gubin said. The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said on Friday that it had pushed back against Russian attacks near 10 settlements, the Kyiv Independent reports. It added that Russian forces had launched more than 12 missiles and more than 12 airstrikes on Ukrainian territory in the last 24 hours. Shelling has destroyed power infrastructure at the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar where staff operating the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant live, posing a growing threat to the plant, the UN nuclear watchdog said on Friday. Reuters reports: The plant’s offsite power lines, vital lines of defence against potential nuclear meltdown, have already been cut and the shelling at Enerhodar has caused a lasting blackout there. That has prompted Ukraine to say it may have to shut down the last operating reactor supplying power to Zaporizhzhia including the cooling systems for the plant’s nuclear fuel. “This is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious. Enerhodar has gone dark. The power plant has no offsite power. And we have seen that once infrastructure is repaired, it is damaged once again,” International Atomic Energy Agency chief, Rafael Grossi, said in a statement. EU finance ministers on Friday supported a €5bn ($5bn) loan for Ukraine to help maintain the country’s schools, hospitals and other needed operations in the midst of Russia’s invasion. The €5bn loan agreed on Friday, which will be backed by guarantees of EU member states, is part of an overall €9bn package announced in May. The first €1bn was fully sent in early August, while the Czech finance minister, Zbynek Stanjura, said upcoming meetings would decide how the remaining €3bn in the package could be split into loans or grants. “All member states agreed on further support for Ukraine,” Stanjura said. The ministers also discussed short-term financing options and longer-term options to help Ukraine fund its reconstruction in the future. A report released Friday by the World Bank, Ukrainian government and European Commission calculated Russia’s invasion caused more than $97bn in direct damages to Ukraine through to 1 June, while it could cost nearly $350bn to rebuild the country. The European Commission vice-president, Valdis Dombrovski, said costs to help re-build Ukraine would be immense as the war drags into a seventh month. “Clearly Ukraine needs short-term financial assistance to keep the country running on a daily basis and maintain essential services,” he said. “We also need to look beyond immediate needs, as long-term costs for Ukraine’s reconstruction are likely to keep growing as long as war continues.” The EU executive pledged on Friday to devise unprecedented measures in the coming days to address an energy price shock as a result of Russia’s war on Ukraine, including a controversial gas price cap that could further anger the Kremlin. European energy ministers tasked the European Commission with working through the weekend to draw up legal texts that will include emergency funding for consumers struggling to afford soaring bills. The EU will table “unprecedented measures next week for an unprecedented situation”, energy commissioner Kadri Simson said, after meeting the ministers. Simson said compensation for struggling households and businesses would be covered by a levy on non-gas electricity companies, such as nuclear, solar or renewable firms, that are seeing a revenue bonanza on the back of high prices for electric power. She added that fossil fuel companies would also be levied on their mega profits from the inflated energy prices. The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Friday conditions at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are increasingly precarious and that a safety zone around it needs to be established immediately to prevent a nuclear accident. IAEA director Rafael Mariano Grossi said that there is minimal chance of re-establishing reliable offsite power lines to the plant and its Ukrainian operator is considering shutting down the only remaining operating reactor. This would leave the plant fully dependent on emergency diesel generators to provide electricity for vital nuclear safety functions. “This is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious,” Grossi said, the Associated Press reports. “The power plant has no offsite power. And we have seen that once infrastructure is repaired, it is damaged once again,” he said. “This is completely unacceptable. It cannot stand.” Grossi called for an “immediate cessation of all shelling in the entire area” and the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. “This is the only way to ensure that we do not face a nuclear accident,” he said. A Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region announced on Friday that civilians are being evacuated from three of the region’s Russian-controlled territories that have come under threat from a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Vitaly Ganchev said on state television host Vladimir Solovyov’s daily livestream that civilians were being evacuated from the towns of Izium, Kupiansk and Veliky Burluk, Reuters reports. Civilians are being evacuated from Russian-held Izium, and Kupiansk in eastern Ukraine, according to a Russian-appointed local official, Reuters reports. This is a developing story with more details to come … If you’re just joining us, here’s a round-up of all the day’s news from Ukraine so far … Ukraine’s counter-offensive in Kharkiv continues, with Ukrainian forces appearing to be closing in on the city of Kupiansk, a key logistical hub for Russian forces in the region US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said late last night it was likely the city would be taken within 72 hours, and that its recapture would severely hinder Russian lines of communication on the ground. Unverified photos posted to social media appeared to show soldiers holding a Ukrainian flag on the outskirts of the city. Footage reportedly shot in the city of Balakliia, another city in the Kharkiv region, shows residents welcoming soldiers following its recapture by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s military has said the number of Russian soldiers killed since the start of the invasion has reached 51,900. It also said that information provided to it by Ukrainians inside occupied territory has contributed to a recent rise in Russian personnel losses from 150-200 a day to about 600. At least 10 people, three of them children, were injured and a kindergarten was set on fire amid heavy shelling in Kharkiv, city mayor Igor Terekhov has said Nine civilians have also been killed and 23 have been injured by Russian forces in the Donetsk region, according to local officials. A Russian airstrike hit and destroyed a hospital in the north-eastern region of Sumy near the Russian border on Friday, Ukrainian officials said. A total of 127 medical facilities have been destroyed and 826 have been damaged since the start of the invasion, according to the Ukrainian ministry of health. The Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has arrived in Kyiv for talks on energy and military security. A spokesperson said the visit was intended as a “political signal to the Kremlin”. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has said it is “highly unlikely” Belarus is preparing to enter the war in Ukraine, despite ongoing military exercises being conducted by the country’s military A spokesperson for President Putin has said he is “not considering” attending the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. A European Union proposal to cap the price Europe pays for Russian gas did not receive broad support from energy ministers in a meeting on Friday, two diplomats with knowledge of the talks told Reuters. “There was a big debate about capping the price of gas, and the Commission should come up with a proposal that will help reduce the prices of all gas, but at the same time will not jeopardise gas supplies to Europe,” one of the diplomats said. On Wednesday, the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said European Union countries should set a price cap on Russian gas. The finance ministers from the G7 countries have already agreed to impose a price cap on Russian oil exports. Asked about the plans at an economic form last week, President Putin said Russia’s response to price caps would be to “just halt supplies” of gas, oil, diesel oil, and coal. At least 10 people, three of them children, have been injured amid heavy shelling in Kharkiv, the city’s mayor has said. Writing on Telegram, Igor Terekhov said that private homes and a school were among the buildings hit, and that a kindergarten in the centre of the city was on fire. “I ask all Kharkiv residents to be as careful as possible and stay in shelters,” he said. It is highly unlikely that Belarus’s ongoing military exercises near the Ukrainian border are a sign that it is preparing to enter the war in Ukraine, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. On Thursday, the Belarusian military began routine drills close to Brest near the Polish border, around capital Minsk, and in the north-eastern region of Vitebsk. Belarus said the exercises, set to run until Wednesday, were intended to practice “liberating territory temporarily seized by the enemy” and regaining control over border regions. In its latest intelligence update, the UK ministry of defence said: “Although Russia’s use of Belarusian territory was instrumental in Russia’s failed advance on Kyiv early in the invasion, Belarusian forces have limited offensive capabilities and there is a remote chance that they have deployed forces into Ukraine. “It is highly unlikely that these exercises are an indication of preparations for direct Belarusian involvement in the Ukraine war.” Russian personnel losses are increasing because Ukraine is being fed information about the location of Russian forces by Ukrainians who remain in occupied territory, the Ukrainian military has said. Recent figures from the Ukrainian authorities have seen estimates of the number of Russian soldiers being killed each day rise from 150-200 to about 600. The figure for Thursday was 650, bringing the total since the start of the war to 51,900. Oleksii Hromov, the deputy head of the general staff of the armed forces, was asked about the rise during a press briefing on Thursday, Pravda reported. “Conscious Ukrainians, no matter where they are, in occupied Crimea or in the occupied territories of Kherson region, or Zaporizhzhia Oblast, or in Donetsk, Luhansk and other oblasts, conscious citizens effectively help our armed forces,” he said. “It is no secret that thanks to them we have certain information concerning the location of the Russian occupying forces. “Thanks to them we are able to increase these numbers [of Russian losses].” Moldova’s national airline has announced the resumption of flights to Russia. In a statement on its website, Air Moldova said it would begin operating flights to Moscow starting on 1 October. It said the decision was the “result of countless requests from citizens of the Republic of Moldova, who are in the Russian Federation and want to return home”. “The safety and comfort of flights are the company’s priority, thus Air Moldova will continue to make constant efforts to respond to the needs and requests of our passengers,” it said. Air Moldova suspended flights to Russia in February. Moldova, which shares a border with Ukraine, also closed its entire airspace in the immediate wake of the Russian invasion, but partially reopened it the following month. A Russian airstrike hit a hospital in the north-eastern region of Sumy on Friday, Ukrainian officials have said. Posting to Telegram, Dmytro Zhivytsky, head of the regional administration, said the attack occurred after 9am local time and that the building, in the Velyka Pysarivka district, had been destroyed. He added that people had been wounded. “The Russians continue to cynically fire at the civilian infrastructure of Sumy oblast,” he said. “Russian enemy aircraft, without crossing the border of Ukraine, fired at a hospital.” Velyka Pysarivka is a small settlement a few miles from Ukraine’s north-western border with Russia. The Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has arrived in Kyiv for talks on energy and military security, Polish broadcaster Polsat News reports. A spokesperson told the outlet that the visit was intended as a “political signal to the Kremlin” of Poland’s support for Ukraine. They added that the invasion was a breach of all possible international standards and that Poland considered the defence of Ukraine part of the defence of its own security. A photo shared on social media appears to show Ukrainian soldiers on the outskirts of the city of Kupiansk. Ukrainian forces have been advancing on the city, which serves as a key logistical hub for Russian forces in the Kharkiv region. The US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said last night Ukraine would probably recapture the city within 72 hours, and that its loss would severely hinder Russian lines of communication on the ground. A picture posted to Twitter by Illia Ponomarenko, a defence reporter at the Kyiv Independent, showed soldiers holding a Ukrainian flag while stood in front of a large road sign bearing the Russian name for Kupiansk. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify the image. President Putin is “not considering” attending the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, his spokesperson has said. Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti quoted Dmitry Peskov saying the Kremlin would “wait for the announcement of the protocol of the ceremony” before deciding who would represent Russia. Ukraine’s counteroffensive in Kharkiv has proved that it can drive Russia out of its territories, a key adviser in President Zelenskiy’s government has said. Writing on Twitter, Mykhailo Podoliak, adviser to the Head of the Office of President of Ukraine, said: “What does effective Ukrainian counteroffensive tell the world? “1. Ukraine proved the capability of de-occupying its territories. There will be no freezing of the conflict. “2. Ukraine proved that it can effectively use modern western weapons. “3. Russian troops have to get out. It will hurt.” A total of 127 medical facilities have been destroyed and 826 have been damaged since the start of the invasion, according to the Ukrainian ministry of health. The ministry said it was cooperating with global health organisation Project Hope to restore healthcare access across Ukraine. It added that 62 facilities damaged by Russian forces had already been restored. In a statement, deputy health minister Bohdan Borukhovskyi said: “We are now consolidating efforts with our partners to first of all restore hospitals that have received minor damage and can be rebuilt in the shortest possible time. “In parallel with this, we are implementing several more projects in Kyiv Oblast and Sumy Oblast, where medical facilities are being built virtually from scratch.” President Zelenskiy has said efforts continue to keep agricultural exports moving through Ukrainian ports and maintain global food security. Exports of grain and other agricultural goods have been been able to leave Ukraine since a deal agreed between Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, and the UN in July. Speaking in his nightly address on Thursday, Zelenskiy spoken with Kenyan president-elect William Ruto about overcoming food shortages. “We are doing everything for this,” he said. “Just today, four ships with agricultural products for Asian countries left our ports. “At [present], more than 65,000 tons of wheat [are entering] the port of Sudan for unloading. Yesterday, a bulker with wheat departed for Kenya – more than 50,000 tons. Vessels for Lebanon and Libya are now being loaded in Odesa. “In the Pivdennyi Port [a port near Odesa], a ship bound for India is waiting to be loaded. “Literally every working day of the grain export initiative refutes Russian lies about it. Ukraine supplies agricultural products to consumers from different continents. And it is our supply that guarantees food security at the global level.” In a speech on Wednesday, President Putin said the deal should be revised, claiming it was delivering products to the European Union and Turkey rather than to poor countries. Footage reportedly shot in the city of Balakliia near Kharkiv shows residents welcoming soldiers following its recapture by Ukrainian forces. Balakliia lies around 70km (43 miles) south-east of Kharkiv city, in the centre of the territory on which Ukraine has launched a major counter-offensive. One clip posted to twitter by Ukrainian journalist Nataliya Gumenyuk shows men and women emerging from a building to hug soldiers as they arrive. Some of the people can be seen crying. Another shows two women hugging and taking photos with soldiers gathered on a plaza. Nine civilians have been killed and 23 have been injured by Russian forces in the Donetsk region, according to Ukrainian officials. Posting to Telegram, Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration, said: “Russia kills civilians! “On September 8, the Russians killed nine civilians of Donetsk region: five in Bakhmut, two in Zaitsevo, one in New York and one in Fedorivka. Another 23 people were injured.” He added that it was not possible to establish how many people had been killed in Mariupol and Volnovas. “All Russians will be held accountable for their crimes on our land!” he said. US secretary of state Anthony Blinken has left Ukraine after making an unannounced visit on Thursday. The trip, Blinken’s third since the war began on 24 February, included meetings with President Zelenskiy and Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba as well as a visit to a children’s hospital in Kyiv. Photos posted to Twitter showed him speaking with officials before boarding a train. “Stay strong, Kyiv,” a caption read. “I leave with redoubled respect for your ferocity, your courage, and your confidence that Ukraine will prevail.” A further 650 Russian soldiers have been killed in the war in Ukraine, according to the latest update from the Ukrainian ministry of defence. Figures posted to twitter said Russia’s personnel losses since the start of the war had reached 51,900, up from 51,250 since yesterday. It added that, since the start of the invasion, Russia had lost a total of 2122 tanks, 4575 armoured combat vehicles, 239 jets, and 211 helicopters. The tweet also opened with a quote from a second world war radio broadcast delivered to the children of the Commonwealth by Queen Elizabeth II in October 1940, when she was still a princess. “When peace comes, remember it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place,” it read. The G7’s planned price cap on Russian oil exports will fail and drive prices even higher, Russia’s top lawmaker has claimed. Posting on Telegram, Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of Russia’s lower house of parliament, the Duma, said that “what G7 state officials call a price ‘ceiling’ will become a price floor”. “The global market is not limited to seven countries,” he said. “The marginal price announced by the west will become the lower bar.” Last week, the finance ministers from the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan announced plans for a cap intended to “reduce Russian revenues and Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression”. The European Union has also proposed a price cap for Russian gas, and is set to phase in a ban on Russian oil imports over the coming months. Speaking in Vladivostok on Wednesday, President Putin threatened to cut off energy supplies if price caps are imposed on Russia’s oil and gas exports. Ukraine is likely to retake the city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region within 72 hours, US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War has said. The group’s latest assessment said Ukrainian forces had advanced to within 20km of the city, and that retaking it would significantly worsen communication between Russian forces in the region. “Russian rear positions in Kharkiv Oblast are now exposed to further Ukrainian advances, and Ukrainian forces will likely capture Kupiansk within the next 72 hours,” it said. “The loss of Kupiansk and other rear areas on critical ground lines of communication will hinder Russian efforts to support offensive and defence operations, but will not completely sever Russian lines of communication to Izyum.” The space between the Izyum and the city of Kharkiv to its north-west currently forms part of the frontline between Ukrainian and Russian forces. Good morning and welcome to our Ukraine live blog. We’ll be bringing you all the latest updates from the conflict throughout the day. First up, President Zelenskiy has said Ukraine has recaptured more than 1,000 sq km of territory over the last week. It follows a surprise counter-offensive in the north-eastern Kharkiv region and sustained pressure on Russian forces in the south. Speaking in his nightly address on Thursday, Zelenskiy said: “Our heroes have already liberated dozens of settlements. And today this movement continued, there are new results. “In total, more than a thousand square kilometres of our territory have been liberated since 1 September.” He went on to thank everyone serving in the armed forces and the brigades that had retaken territory. Zelenskiy also acknowledged $675m in military aid announced yesterday by the US and the $1bn Ukraine is set to receive from a general package of support for 19 European countries deemed at risk of future Russian aggression. “Each of these steps of our partners has a real impact on the strength of our state and the whole of Europe in defence against Russian terror,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/sep/07/liz-truss-energy-crisis-climate-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T15:14:44Z","webTitle":"Watch out, Liz Truss: this energy crisis may spark a climate revolution we can all get behind | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/07/liz-truss-energy-crisis-climate-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/07/liz-truss-energy-crisis-climate-bills","fields":{"headline":"Watch out, Liz Truss: this energy crisis may spark a climate revolution we can all get behind","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s not looking great for the climate, our change of prime minister: Liz Truss, who has about as much expertise in British geomorphology as she does in cheese, seems to think we can frack our way out of the energy crisis by Christmas, and that nuclear power is a similarly quick answer. Her newly appointed chief economic adviser, Matthew Sinclair, wrote a book entitled Let Them Eat Carbon in 2011, in which he argued that “the temperatures we face today may not be the ideal conditions for humanity to live and flourish”. Let warming go wild, in other words. It might be fun. Sure, it was over a decade ago and don’t let’s cancel him for ever over a tiny little book – all he did was mindlessly risk the end of the species. However, beneath these morbid symptoms the global energy crisis has sparked conversations that are real, perhaps for the first time – certainly, it’s the first time that so many nations have been having them simultaneously. It seems likely that the prime minister’s first move will be to tear up everything she campaigned on and roll over to the opposition’s suggestion that energy bills be frozen at April 2022’s levels. Partly because of her inelegant flip-flopping, partly due to harsh economic realities, it is obvious that this sticking plaster, while necessary, is insufficient. The competing alternative narratives are red (sequester North Sea gas and let wholesalers take their rampant profiteering elsewhere) and green (ramp up renewables until fossil fuel supply is no longer relevant – 45% of UK electricity is already from renewables). Crucially, these narratives don’t compete with each other. You don’t need to gate off the conversation about the pros and cons of retaking gas at source before you can start talking about expanding renewables. It would be reasonable to split the energy market into clean power and fossil power, so that the price of gas was not setting the price of solar and wind, and the incentive to lean heavily on the latter and reduce consumption of the former became universal. Ideas that seemed unthinkably radical a year ago now look much less extreme than the reality we’re facing this winter. We’ve now spent 12 years living this cognitive dissonance, where we have longstanding net-zero ambitions enshrined in law, a climate crisis unfolding with alarming speed, and successive Conservative prime ministers making asinine remarks about “green crap”, then throwing the environmental agenda to the wind whenever they needed to assuage their sociopathically short-termist party members. Any progress we’ve made has been despite our own government, and so much of our collective mental energy has been lost to denial: denying that we’re not moving fast enough, denying that the heatwave was of our own making, denying that we’ve probably already left it too late to save the things we love – whether that’s beaches or biodiversity . We needed Vladimir Putin’s energy war to get serious about how stark our situation is. This is not to predict any sudden conversion to sense from Truss, but rather to point out that the brass-necked irrationality of Tory arguments – that somehow net zero targets were pushing everyone’s bills up, and woke warriors had started it all by cancelling Nigel Lawson – will no longer fly. Having given the opposition a lead in the polls, the Conservatives have also given it an electorate sick of rhetoric and inaction, ready for bold ideas. Even with an energy bill freeze, the cost of living crisis has already moved the dial. The idea that hardship is mainly down to personal inadequacy has become fanciful. The notion that people can scrimp their way to solvency, which is given in justification for so many harmful policy decisions, has been comprehensively overturned. There are the green shoots of a new solidarity across all nine bottom deciles. For goodness sake, this woeful party has radicalised centrist dad Martin Lewis, and they don’t even seem to understand how serious that is, what it means for their prospects. Putin, meanwhile, has overplayed his hand: his threat of disruption to energy supply has historically been enough to keep his neighbours docile, and maintain the scratchy equilibrium between democratic states and his increasingly authoritarian one. Actually disrupting the energy supply, conversely, will force us and the EU towards renewable alternatives, and once that gains momentum, the link between geopolitics and carbon resources will ultimately be severed. Good luck with strongman politics when there’s nothing underpinning them but bot farms tweeting mean things. No one would ever wish to have been brought to a place where there are no alternatives. It would be better if Russia had not invaded Ukraine, if inflation were under control, if energy bills weren’t spiralling into impossibility. It would be better if the UK’s situation weren’t so particularly, idiosyncratically, bad. This is what a country looks like after 12 years of people who don’t believe in government, being in government. It turns out if you focus all your energy and resource on cronyism and getting re-elected, you can make life much harder for millions of people in a relatively short space of time. But, for the want of alternatives, we will emerge from the next election with not only a new government but a radical and uncompromising plan for energy that will transform the way we live. We’ll look back on this as the inflection point that got us to net zero.

Historic England is launching an aerial photography tool that allows users to explore images of England over the past century. The bird’s eye views range from second world war defences and nuclear power stations to the remains of neolithic monuments, Roman farmsteads and medieval villages. More than 400,000 photographs from 1919 to the present day, covering 30% of England, will be available to search and view online for the first time. They include images of the remains of a neolithic long barrow near Broughton, Hampshire, iron age forts such as Pilsdon Pen in Dorset and medieval villages such as Old Sulby in Northamptonshire. There are photos of second world war defensive measures such as anti-aircraft obstructions at Hampton Court Palace and camouflaged runways at RAF Kenley in 1941. Images of Greenwich Park in 1946 show it covered in a patchwork of allotments for food after it aided the war effort. A modern photo from August 2006 shows outlines of the allotments appearing through the grass in hot weather. Bomb damage can be seen in images of central Liverpool and the Albert Dock from 1941, 1946 and 1948. Other photographs of note are of 20th-century industrial sites, such as the construction of Tilbury power station in 1955 and its demolition in 2017, and famous buildings, such as views of St James’ Park football stadium in Newcastle from the 1920s and St Paul’s Cathedral after the war. Last year Historic England launched a digital aerial archaeology tool that allows people to discover archaeological details about local landscapes. Duncan Wilson, Historic England’s chief executive, said: “I am delighted that our new online tool will allow people to access easily our wonderful collection of aerial images and enjoy the historic photography that our team uses every day to unlock the mysteries of England’s past.” Nigel Huddleston, the heritage minister, said the tool offered “a bird’s eye view of our past” and encouraged “everyone to explore the thousands of English sites from the last century”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/oct/29/portmeirion-to-coleg-harlech-an-architectural-odyssey-in-north-west-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-29T14:00:02Z","webTitle":"Portmeirion to Coleg Harlech: an architectural odyssey in north-west Wales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/oct/29/portmeirion-to-coleg-harlech-an-architectural-odyssey-in-north-west-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/oct/29/portmeirion-to-coleg-harlech-an-architectural-odyssey-in-north-west-wales","fields":{"headline":"Portmeirion to Coleg Harlech: an architectural odyssey in north-west Wales","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"It’s hard to think of two building projects less alike than Portmeirion, the whimsical Italianate holiday village that was the career-long labour of love of the architect Clough Williams-Ellis, and the theatre and student housing tower of Coleg Harlech, a rugged work of concrete brutalism. Yet they were completed within a few years of each other, 1975 and 1973, a few miles apart on the coast of north-west Wales. A good way to experience the poles of British 20th-century architecture is to walk from one to the other, and enjoy some ravishing landscapes on the way. This is a land that runs to extremes of large and small, and harsh and sweet. There are mountains, rising towards their highest point at Snowdon, and extra-terrestrial terrains sculpted by slate quarries, but also little cottages and wooded lanes, and the narrow-gauge Ffestiniog railway, whose minus-sized steam engines chug endearingly over dizzying valleys. Portmeirion is at the pretty end of the spectrum. “As a child,” declared its creator Williams-Ellis, “I just lamented that my lot was cast in Victorian non-conformist Wales, instead of some such sparkling setting as decadent 18th-century Venice.” In 1925, he bought a scenic snippet of the coastline, where a steep cleft in the land descends to the broad sands of the Dwyryd Estuary, and set about bringing a bit of the Mediterranean to his home country. For the next 50 years, with a break from 1939 to 1954, he created what stands there now, an artful assembly of turrets, domes and loggias, of scrolls and finials, blue-pink-turquoise-peach-ochre, with images of mermaids, cherubs and eagles and fragments of older buildings salvaged from demolition sites. The prevailing Italian spirit also accommodates touches of Scandinavia and Japan, and an Alpine or Habsburg onion-domed tower. The industrial world is wished away – a single petrol pump (now antiquated but modern in its time) is surmounted by a plumed heraldic bust. The village is avowedly theatrical. An imposing portico turns out to have nothing behind it, like a stage set, and illusionistic paintings of stone and carving mingle with the real things. Living rock, which sometimes bursts through the delicate architecture, is juxtaposed with papery representations of it. Views are framed and managed, like pictures, by archways and openings. Portmeirion seems also to have drunk from the local Alice-in-Wonderland potion of shrinking and enlarging: optical tricks make buildings look bigger than they really are. It is brilliant and seductive, but also a bit weird. It has the Truman Show creepiness that comes from inhabiting someone else’s all-encompassing fantasy, for which reason it made the perfect location for The Prisoner, the cult 1960s TV series about an intelligence agent trapped in a mysterious village. Also contributing to its odd atmosphere are some quite terrible wall paintings, which show the lifeless cavorting of sexless nudes. Coleg Harlech was built as an adult education college to the designs of the north Wales practice of Colwyn Foulkes &amp; Partners. Its housing tower, a plain oblong standing like a sentinel at the foot of a sea-facing slope, has, as Owen Hatherley puts it in Modern Buildings in Britain, “the elemental power of the Welsh landscape”. It is finished in greenish-grey pebbly concrete, scored with exaggerated joints between the panels to give what Hatherley calls its “ascetic intensity”. The regular rhythm of its windows is interrupted by one off-beat move, a bridge that exploits the slope behind to make the main entrance high up the block, with a band of high windows that lights the shared areas to which it leads. The theatre is more intricate and dramatic, with a curved-walled auditorium hovering above glassy foyers, and the vertical shafts of stair towers rising up the outside, a version of the constructivism of the early Soviet Union modified for the land of Owain Glyndŵr. In between the theatre and tower is Wern Fawr, a stony classical structure originally built as a house in the 1900s. They are a punchy and distinctive triptych. In fairness to the reader, I must report that the current state of the Coleg Harlech buildings makes for an austere experience, one perhaps only for serious students of brutalism. The theatre and old house are under renovation, while the tower is currently disused and broken-windowed. If you’re looking for more conventional tourist attractions there’s the magnificent Unesco world heritage site of Harlech Castle, round-towered on a clifftop like one from a story book – as relentless and stark as the college, to be sure, but lent romance by the passage of centuries. And then there’s the walk between the picturesque village and the brutalist college. You’re travelling along a geological border, where the high land gives way to coastal levels that were once submarine, so you get sweeping views of bodies of water and distant mountains, and winding routes through dense woods, hamlets and small fields. A lovely moment is the dragonfly-rich Llyn Tecwyn Isaf, reflecting trees and cloud-shadowed slopes in its glassy surface, that is everything you could want a lake to be. Exactly which route you take is up to you, but it’s better (where possible) to take the lanes and footpaths that loop inland than the less charming A-roads and B-roads to which Google maps will direct you. It should also be noted that this part of Wales, if coming from other parts of Britain, is hard to reach by public transport, so it’s best to enjoy the journey and take your time. It’s possible, for example, to travel to the coastal town of Llandudno, then inland to Blaenau Ffestiniog, and then walk the 10 or so miles from there to Portmeirion. Or use the holidaymakers’ ride of the Ffestiniog railway as an actual transportation facility (if an expensive one) and travel on it part of the way. This route offers more sights of the tough and the sublime. Blaenau Ffestiniog is the location of the area’s most dramatic slate quarries, and you’ll get views, while walking through wooded slopes and over rushing rivers, of the gigantic, decommissioned nuclear power station at Trawsfynydd, designed by the architect of Coventry Cathedral, Basil Spence. Wherever you go, it’s hard to go wrong in this part of the country, where fearless and singular buildings punctuate the majestic landscape."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/23/ukraine-100000-civilians-trapped-in-mariupol-amid-russias-constant-bombing-says-zelenskiy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-23T05:26:00Z","webTitle":"100,000 civilians trapped in Mariupol amid Russia’s ‘constant bombing’, says Zelenskiy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/ukraine-100000-civilians-trapped-in-mariupol-amid-russias-constant-bombing-says-zelenskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/23/ukraine-100000-civilians-trapped-in-mariupol-amid-russias-constant-bombing-says-zelenskiy","fields":{"headline":"100,000 civilians trapped in Mariupol amid Russia’s ‘constant bombing’, says Zelenskiy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Almost 100,000 people remain trapped in the ruined city of Mariupol, facing starvation amid “constant” Russian bombardment, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said, as he appealed for the release of a convoy he said had been captured by Russian forces. In a video address late on Tuesday, he renewed his calls for Russia to allow safe humanitarian corridors, and said civilians faced “inhumane conditions. In a total siege. Without food, water, medication, under constant shelling and under constant bombing.” More than 7,000 people had escaped the city in the past 24 hours, he said. However one humanitarian convoy travelling on an agreed route west of the city had been “captured by the occupiers”. The convoy near Mangush consisted of bus drivers and emergency service personnel. “We are doing everything we can to free out people and unblock the movement of humanitarian aid.” he said. Tens of thousands of residents have already fled the besieged southern port city, bringing harrowing testimony of a “freezing hellscape riddled with dead bodies and destroyed buildings”, according to Human Rights Watch. Satellite images of Mariupol released by Maxar on Tuesday showed a charred landscape, with several buildings ablaze and smoke billowing from the city. The Pentagon has said Russia was now pummelling Mariupol using artillery, long-range missiles and naval ships deployed in the nearby Sea of Azov. “They bombed us for the past 20 days,” said 39-year-old Viktoria Totsen, who fled into Poland. “During the last five days, the planes were flying over us every five seconds and dropped bombs everywhere on residential buildings, kindergartens, art schools, everywhere.” “It is clear that the occupiers are not interested in the city of Mariupol, they want to raze it to the ground, to reduce it to ashes of a dead land,” one local official said. Amid the bloodshed, Zelenskiy held out hope for negotiations, which have yielded little since the invasion began on 24 February. “It’s very difficult, sometimes confrontational,” he said. “But step by step we are moving forward.” For the first time, there are signs that Ukrainian forces are going on the offensive, retaking a town near Kyiv and launching counter attacks in the south of the country, amid claims that Russian forces have just a few days of supplies remaining. In the face of intense Ukrainian resistance, the Pentagon believes Russia’s forces may have been reduced by as much as 10% in the four weeks of fighting since the invasion began. “The Russians may be slightly below a 90% level of assessed available combat power,” a senior defence official told reporters in Washington, adding that some Russian forces were suffering from frostbite. The US president, Joe Biden, is due to travel to Brussels this week for Nato and G7 talks to discuss further action against Russia, including tighter sanctions. Biden discussed Moscow’s “brutal” tactics in a call with European leaders on Monday. Biden will then head to Poland, which has received the bulk of more than 3.5 million Ukrainians fleeing war in their country. Zelenskiy will speak virtually at the Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday. Amid concerns that Vladimir Putin, who Biden believes has “his back against the wall”, is considering the use of chemical and biological weapons, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov spoke to CNN about the circumstances in which Russia would use nuclear weapons. Speaking to Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday, Peskov repeatedly refused to rule out that Russia would consider using nuclear weapons against what Moscow saw as an “existential threat.” US Department of Defence spokesman John Kirby said Moscow’s nuclear remarks were “dangerous” and were “not the way a responsible nuclear power should act”. However, Kirby added that Pentagon officials “haven’t seen anything that would lead us to conclude that we need to change our strategic deterrent posture”. Peskov also insisted that the military operation was going “strictly in accordance with the plans and purposes that were established beforehand.” In other developments: Russian forces “looted and destroyed” a laboratory at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials said. “Russian occupiers illegally seized the newest laboratory,” Ukrainian authorities said in a statement late on Tuesday. The laboratory processes radioactive waste and contains “highly active samples” which are now in the hands of Russian forces, the agency added. The deputy head of Kyiv’s police force accused Russia of using white phosphorous munitions in the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk. Oleksiy Biloshytskiy shared online footage, which could not be independently verified, of material burning fiercely underneath a pile of aggregate. “Another use of phosphorus ammunitions in Kramatorsk,” he said. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, has said it is time for Russia to end its “absurd” and “unwinnable” war in Ukraine, as the EU prepared to set up a “trust fund” aimed at helping Kyiv repel the invasion and rebuild afterwards. “Even if Mariupol falls, Ukraine cannot be conquered city by city, street by street, house by house,” Guterres said. Russia plans to unleash a “great terror” on Kherson by kidnapping residents and taking them across the Russian border, an FSB whistleblower has claimed. The Kremlin was no longer willing to “play nicely” with protesters in the Ukrainian city, a letter said. About 300,000 people in the occupied southern city of Kherson are running out of food and medical supplies, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry said. Russian forces have “kidnapped” 2,389 children from the Russian-controlled areas of Luhansk and Donetsk, the US embassy in Kyiv has said, citing figures by Ukraine’s foreign ministry. The embassy said: “This is not assistance. It is kidnapping.” With Agence France-Presse"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/12/property-donated-by-family-of-john-clarke-embroiled-in-victorian-first-nations-dispute","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T20:00:23Z","webTitle":"Property donated by family of John Clarke embroiled in Victorian First Nations dispute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/12/property-donated-by-family-of-john-clarke-embroiled-in-victorian-first-nations-dispute","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/12/property-donated-by-family-of-john-clarke-embroiled-in-victorian-first-nations-dispute","fields":{"headline":"Property donated by family of John Clarke embroiled in Victorian First Nations dispute","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A property donated by the family of renowned satirist and comedian John Clarke has become embroiled in a long-running dispute between two First Nations groups in Victoria. The land on Phillip Island, about 120km south-east of Melbourne, was donated by Clarke’s widow, Helen McDonald, to conservation group Trust for Nature after his death in 2017. Trust for Nature intends to transfer the eight-hectare property to the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation, however a local traditional owner has demanded that be halted. While the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation is the registered local Aboriginal party, the area involves land on which members of the Boonwurrung people is seeking native title via the federal court. Boonwurrung elder Carolyn Briggs said Trust for Nature had made no effort to consult with her people about the handover. “Once again we have been ignored and decisions made for us by non-Indigenous people,” she told Guardian Australia. Briggs argued the Trust for Nature should postpone the land transfer to allow the legal process to run its course. Gayle Austen, the chair of Trust for Nature, said it was continuing negotiations with the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation regarding the Phillip Island property. “This does not in any way affect the native title claim that the Boon Wurrung Foundation are pursuing, and which doesn’t apply to privately owned property,” she said. “Trust for Nature continues to work with all traditional owner groups across Victoria on a range of projects and Caring for Country initiatives. We have expressed our desire to connect with the Boon Wurrung Foundation and explore opportunities with them into the future.” The agreement includes 12 months access and managed rights followed by a title transfer next year. The chair of the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation board of directors, Kelly Lehmann, said the transfer was an “amazing opportunity” for Bunurong people. “Through this land we can further support our future generations in learning culture and Caring for Country,” she said in a statement. The native title lawyer James Fitzgerald said the dispute highlighted “the challenges faced when you try to unscramble the eggs of colonialism 200 years after the event”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning According to the Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Council, the only known Boon Wurrung (Bunurong) apical ancestors with living descendents are believed to be women who were abducted by sealers in the early 18th century. The council said due to this disruption, the historical record linking current day people with Boon Wurrung – also known as Bunurong – ancestors is in some places incomplete or contradictory. The Boonwurrung Land and Sea Council has long argued that it is not represented by the Bunurong Land Council, which it has previously claimed was largely made up of interstate members. The Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Council – a public body made up of the 11 traditional owners appointed by the state government – has previously rejected the Boonwurrung Land and Sea Council’s application to be listed as a registered Aboriginal party. Registered Aboriginal parties are traditional owner groups that are legally recognised under the state’s Aboriginal Heritage Act and have responsibility for managing and protecting Aboriginal cultural heritage relating to Country. Under the state’s Traditional Owner Settlement Act, traditional owners are also recognised outside the federal native title scheme. Briggs has previously criticised the Aboriginal Heritage Council for recognising the Bunurong Land Council as representatives of the Boonwurrung people. But in 2019 the state’s supreme court upheld the council’s move to grant the Bunurong Land Council the status of a registered Aboriginal party. The Boonwurrung group is pursuing a native title claim covering about 13,000 sq km over large swathes of Melbourne and Gippsland. The Bunurong Land Council did not respond to questions about the dispute when contacted by Guardian Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/12/go-west-if-you-can-desperate-sydney-tenants-priced-out-of-rentals-even-far-from-cbd","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T20:00:23Z","webTitle":"Go west, if you can: desperate Sydney tenants priced out of rentals, even far from CBD","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/12/go-west-if-you-can-desperate-sydney-tenants-priced-out-of-rentals-even-far-from-cbd","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/12/go-west-if-you-can-desperate-sydney-tenants-priced-out-of-rentals-even-far-from-cbd","fields":{"headline":"Go west, if you can: desperate Sydney tenants priced out of rentals, even far from CBD","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"By the time Rebecca Khadka arrived at a midweek inspection for a unit to rent in Homebush, she already felt as if she had compromised too much in her desperation to find a home. It is Khadka’s 11th rental inspection. Her expectations have shrunk from a three-bedroom apartment in Strathfield to a two-bedroom unit anywhere in the surrounding suburbs, and her budget has increased by $100 a week to $700. Her applications keep being rejected. “It’s really tough out there, because I don’t want to go too far, I want to live closer to the city, not further from it,” she said. “We didn’t expect the market to be this competitive, and this expensive.” “It’s frustrating having to move from where you are comfortable … I don’t want that change in environment.” Khadka, who works as a nurse in central Sydney, said she had seen up to 40 people at some inspections, scrambling just like she is to find a home as the rental market approaches crisis levels. A survey conducted by the Real Estate Institute of NSW shows the vacancy rate has dropped to a “historical low” of 1.7%. The number of renters per available property had risen by 28% year-on-year, according to the June 2022 rental report from property analysts PropTrack, and Sydney and Melbourne had the greatest increases. The report also found that the number of new rental listings was 13.8% lower nationwide than the 10-year average. The total volume of rental listings was 18.2% lower year-on-year for June, and 27.7% lower than the 10-year average. The consequences of this rental property shortfall is skyrocketing rent, cut-throat demand and a market that leaves those unable to compete without a home. Maya, who asked to go by her first name only, is a single mother of four-year-old twins. She was given just two weeks’ notice to vacate her rental home in Yagoona. That was extended to four weeks after she begged her landlord, she said. Maya said she rushed to inspect and apply for as many properties as possible, spending all day at inspections and all night on the phone with real estate agents. “The landlords kept calling me, every day, pushing me to leave,” she told Guardian Australia. “They said they wanted the property, and when I told them how hard it had been to find somewhere, they said they didn’t care. “They told me it was my problem, that I could end up on the street with my twins.” She applied for more than 15 properties and was finally accepted one day before her notice to vacate took effect. Her new home is smaller but is also more expensive than her previous rental. “Even if it wasn’t what I wanted, even if it was completely different to my expectations, I’m going to love it no matter what,” she said. “It was just so painful to find.” Matthew Everingham, a director and auctioneer at Richard Matthews Real Estate, said that while rent increases were difficult for tenants, “the cost of ownership has significantly increased”.“To be fair though, we haven’t seen a rental market increase like this in many, many years,” he said. “I think the lack of supply is a real catalyst for the competitive nature of the rental market. If there’s not many available, and you’ve got a large amount of prospective tenants looking, then, of course, you’re going to get that demand.” Everingham said some rental inspections had gone from attracting four or five people, to averaging groups of “40 to 50 people”. He said he had noticed more people moving farther west to secure cheaper rent. “We’re seeing a real push from some – moving into the south-west, looking for more value for money and for larger properties,” he said. “And since cost of living has gone up significantly, if they could save a couple of hundred a week and move 15 minutes down the road, they’re going to take it up.” Prof Nicole Gurran, an urban planner and policy analyst at the University of Sydney, said a reduction in rates of homeownership was a major driver behind increased competition for rental properties. “We’ve got a squeezing out of people who would have previously been moving into homeownership, and are stuck in the rental market, as well as those who don’t have the income support, and don’t have the budgets to afford rent,” Gurran said. “We’ve not provided sufficient subsidies for people to be able to afford decent housing in the private rental sector. So there’s been a chronic shortage of low-cost, rental housing in the right location.” “You now have moderate and low income families competing in the same market as those on solid incomes, and it’s squeezing them.” Gurran said that while increasing the amount of social housing provided by the government would alleviate some supply issues, she said expanding the commonwealth rent assistance program would be “the quickest short-term fix”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2022/aug/13/judith-neilson-institute-dismisses-remaining-members-of-advisory-board-after-earlier-director-walkout","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T20:00:23Z","webTitle":"Judith Neilson Institute dismisses remaining members of advisory board after earlier director walkout","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/13/judith-neilson-institute-dismisses-remaining-members-of-advisory-board-after-earlier-director-walkout","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/aug/13/judith-neilson-institute-dismisses-remaining-members-of-advisory-board-after-earlier-director-walkout","fields":{"headline":"Judith Neilson Institute dismisses remaining members of advisory board after earlier director walkout","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas (JNI) has dismissed the remaining members of its international advisory council ahead of a review of the not-for-profit which has now been stripped of its founding board, expert journalism panel and management. The billionaire philanthropist funded the institute to the tune of $100m in 2018, but blindsided the organisation earlier this year by announcing she wanted to take it in a different direction. The chief executive officer of the Judith Neilson Foundation, Simon Freeman, said it made sense to dissolve the panel while an internal review of the JNI’s direction is undertaken. “A number of the advisory council members have indicated they may be interested in continuing to work with us,” Freeman told Guardian Australia on Friday. In June, Neilson took control after four independent directors – the former New South Wales chief justice James Spigelman, the Australian’s editor-at-large, Paul Kelly, the chief executive of Free TV, Bridget Fair, and Kate Torney, the former chief executive of the State Library – walked out en masse. Staff and media beneficiaries remain perplexed about what the institute’s new mission to promote “social change journalism” means. The executive director, Mark Ryan, formally exited the institute last week saying he was considering legal action. “To date, no coherent rationale has been provided for what was a totally unnecessary disruption to the institute and its hard-working staff,” Ryan said in an email to council members. “I remain unable to provide a full account of the behaviour of the patron and have no intention of responding to the many media requests I’ve received to provide my version of events. “I’m advised by Australia’s preeminent employment law firm Clayton Utz that I have strong grounds to pursue an adverse action claim and I’m reserving my rights in that regard.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Neilson recently arrived back in the country after an extended overseas trip. Her daughter Beau joined the JNI board, along with Neilson’s lawyer, Daniel Appleby, after the resignation of the independent directors. Sources say Neilson wants to become more personally involved in the activities of the institute and for it to focus more on the consumers of journalism rather than the producers, including non-English speaking communities and those in regional areas. Freeman told the advisory council members, who included Australians Tom Switzer, Catherine Liddle, Richard McGregor and Antoinette Lattouf, their services were no longer needed because JNI was taking a “different approach”. In an email seen by Guardian Australia, Freeman added that Neilson “remains committed to the future of JNI”. JNI once described the council, who include Kyle Pope, the editor-in-chief and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review, as “a group of eminent figures in journalism from around the world” appointed to advise the “independent, non-partisan institution”. “As JNI embarks upon its new direction we would hope that you remain friends of the institute and remain open to the possibility of working together in the future,” Freeman said. “Judith and the board acknowledges and appreciates your contribution in establishing the Institute and bringing it to its present position.” JNI has funded several projects for large and small media outlets, including Nine newspapers and Guardian Australia. It has also organised events and education. Until mid-2021, the institute had distributed $2.5m in grants and had a total expenditure of $7.7m, according to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/13/the-first-monkeypox-vaccines-have-arrived-in-australia-what-do-we-know-about-the-jab-and-who-is-eligible","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T20:00:23Z","webTitle":"The first monkeypox vaccines have arrived in Australia.

What do we know about the jab and who is eligible?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The first monkeypox vaccines have arrived in Australia, with the rollout commencing in Victoria this week. The virus was declared last month as a “communicable disease incident of national significance” by Australia’s chief medical officer, Paul Kelly. The Victorian minister for health, Mary-Anne Thomas, announced on Tuesday that the state had received an initial 3,500 doses of the Jynneos vaccine. Thorne Harbour Health, which operates clinics in Abbotsford and St Kilda, began vaccinating people at 11am the next morning, said Colin Batrouney, its director of health promotion, policy and communications. Demand has been high. “People are very, very motivated and mobilised to get vaccinated,” Batrouney said. “All of our vaccine slots were filled prior to us even opening the door on Wednesday.” Dr George Forgan-Smith, a general practitioner at the Collins Street Medical Centre in Melbourne’s CBD who also began administering Jynneos on Wednesday, said he had a waiting list for the vaccine of about 200 people. As of Friday, there had been 34 cases of monkeypox recorded in Victoria. In the first phase of the rollout, the vaccine is primarily available from five clinics in metro Victoria. Several regional locations are also involved in the rollout, but supplies will be limited until September, when more doses are set to arrive. What do we know about Jynneos? Jynneos is a third-generation smallpox vaccine that is also effective against monkeypox, because the two viruses are closely related. It has fewer side-effects than previous smallpox vaccines, and is administered in two doses, at least 28 days apart. The vaccine is administered under the skin near the tricep muscle in the upper arm. Some people may experience a sore arm, redness or itchiness at the injection site, and flu-like symptoms, Forgan-Smith said. “I had my shot on Wednesday with my GP, and I didn’t have much of a reaction other than feeling a bit tired. Most of my patients have been OK.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The only group that might have a slightly bigger response is people who have eczema or [predisposition to] allergies,” Forgan-Smith said, emphasising that it was still safe for people with skin conditions. “It’s safe for all who are HIV positive. It’s safe for people who are immunocompromised, and it’s safe for people with eczema.” Who is eligible for the monkeypox vaccine? Currently, eligibility is limited to high-risk close contacts of monkeypox cases, laboratory workers who analyse monkeypox specimens, and certain men (both cis and trans) who have sex with men. The last category includes those living with HIV, who attend sex on premises venues, or are intending to engage in sexual practices in North America or Europe before 31 October. Sex workers who engage with any of the mentioned groups are also eligible. For those planning to travel to a country experiencing a significant outbreak, vaccination is recommended four to six weeks ahead of departure, Batrouney said. Forgan-Smith emphasised monkeypox was not a sexually transmitted disease. “It’s transmitted through skin to skin contact,” he said. “Sex is a brilliant way to have skin to skin contact … but [the virus can also be transmitted by] giving somebody a hug, or going to an event and rubbing against people.” “In some ways we’re lucky it’s winter in Australia because people are covered more,” Forgan-Smith said. He urged people who have recently returned from overseas to be vigilant. “If you notice that you’re getting a flu-like illness and you’re feeling horrible, if you’re developing a rash that looks a little bit like chickenpox, then it could be monkeypox,” he said. “The patients I’ve seen didn’t have hundreds of sores.” “The numbers are small, so we can potentially contain this outbreak in Australia if we can get enough people vaccinated.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2020/may/14/the-atom-a-love-affair-review-nuclear-power-documentary-vicky-lesley","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-14T11:00:08Z","webTitle":"The Atom: A Love Affair review – changing reactions to nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/14/the-atom-a-love-affair-review-nuclear-power-documentary-vicky-lesley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2020/may/14/the-atom-a-love-affair-review-nuclear-power-documentary-vicky-lesley","fields":{"headline":"The Atom: A Love Affair review – changing reactions to nuclear power","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Vicki Lesley’s sprightly, inconclusive documentary tackles a perennially controversial subject: nuclear power and its contested ethical status. Like almost all documentaries these days, this begins with a clip of some sonorous 1950s propaganda film – shorthand for the hilariously naive, reactionary stance that we’ve supposedly overcome. It is an amusing gimmick, but in danger of being overused here. Nuclear power was idealistically embraced after the war as part of our white-hot technological future (a notable partisan was once Labour politician Tony Benn) but then rejected with the news of terrifying accidents, notably the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in the United States in 1979. (Lesley perhaps should have mentioned the very real importance of James Bridges’ movie The China Syndrome, a nuclear-disaster drama that came out just before Three Mile Island; praised as prophetic and genuinely instrumental in popularising anti-nuclear attitudes.) Ecological campaigners, particularly in West Germany, led the charge in Europe against nuclear energy. The Chernobyl horror in 1986 frightened even the most diehard pro-nuclear interests; and in 2011, just when we were getting complacent, there was the chilling incident at Fukushima in Japan. Yet the climate crisis, the key question of the age, brought a new revisionist case for nuclear power. The climate crisis is the slo-mo disaster that looms as large in our minds as Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima; nuclear does not emit greenhouse gases, and is still capable of wholesale power generation. Should theoretical future increases in nuclear safety be weighed against the climate disaster that is happening right now, under our noses? For the time being, our love affair with nuclear is over, leaving us with a joyless marriage to fossil fuels, and a chaste courtship with renewables. Lesley gives the last word to the passionate and persuasive anti-nuclear campaigner Ralph Nader, though her film does not commit itself in the same way. • The Atom: A Love Affair is available on Curzon Home Cinema from 15 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/13/ukraine-russia-war-putin-crimes-justice","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-13T10:15:55Z","webTitle":"I have run out of words for the horror of Putin’s crimes in Ukraine | Andrey Kurkov","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/13/ukraine-russia-war-putin-crimes-justice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/13/ukraine-russia-war-putin-crimes-justice","fields":{"headline":"I have run out of words for the horror of Putin’s crimes in Ukraine","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Before, my wife and I hardly ever ate bread. At least, if we weren’t in the village where we sometimes spend weekends away from our home in Kyiv. The bread we bought in the village was always tastier than the city stuff. In the Ukrainian countryside, there is a long tradition of having plenty of bread on the table and of eating it with butter and salt or dipping it in milk. Bread dipped in fresh cow’s milk was also given to little kids and they loved it. Since arriving in western Ukraine, where like hundreds of thousands of my fellow countrymen my family has sought relative safety, we find ourselves eating much more bread than before. Our boys have always loved fresh bread. They enjoy making and eating sandwiches. In our village shop, we would buy our favourite Makariv loaf – a soft, white, brick-shaped loaf. It was baked at the well-known Makariv bakery which is 20km from our village. Occasionally, you could find this bread in Kyiv, but only in small corner shops, not supermarkets. I have been thinking about that Makariv bread for several days now, remembering the taste. Only now, as I remember, I sense the taste of blood on my lips, like when I was a child if someone split my lip in a fight. The fact is Makariv bakery was bombed a few days ago by Russian troops. The bakers were at work. I can imagine the fragrant smell that surrounded them the moment before the attack. In an instant, 13 bakery staff were killed and nine were injured. And the bakery is no more – “Makariv bread” is a thing of the past. * * * I have long since run out of words to describe the horror brought by Putin to Ukrainian soil. Ukraine is the land of bread and wheat. Even in Egypt, bread and cakes are baked using Ukrainian flour. It’s the time of year to prepare the fields for sowing, but this work is not being done. The soil of the wheat fields is full of metal – fragments of shells, pieces of blown-up tanks and cars, the remains of downed planes and helicopters. And it’s all covered in blood. The blood of Russian soldiers who do not understand what they are fighting for, and the blood of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians who know that if they do not fight, Ukraine will no longer exist. In its place there will be a cemetery with a caretaker’s hut and some kind of governor general sent from Russia will sit and guard it. Bread was mixed with blood in Chernihiv as well when Russian bombers dropped “dumb” unguided bombs on a square next to a bread shop. People had lined up outside, waiting to buy some fresh, warm bread. Someone was just leaving the store with a bag of it. Many people died in this bombing raid. Amnesty International has documented this crime committed by the Russian army. Every day the list of crimes grows longer as more and more of Putin’s actions are added to it – the shooting of young volunteers who were carrying food to the dog shelter in Hostomel; the murder of postmen who were delivering pensions to elderly residents in Sumy region; the killing of five people in an attack on the Kyiv television tower. The list goes on and on. We certainly don’t yet know about all the crimes that have been committed, but we will definitely find out about them all, and the list will be presented at a new Nuremberg trial. It doesn’t matter where it takes place. The main thing is that we know who will be judged. International lawyers have already begun to collect evidence of crimes. Ukrainians are looking forward to the verdict on the murderers and war criminals. But for now, they must survive under the shelling of the Russian army. They spend their nights in basements, in bomb shelters, in bathrooms – the latest advice circulating on the internet tells us that in case of a bombing raid, the safest places to be are inside your cast-iron bath or in interior corridors where there are no windows. The people of Kyiv have grown suddenly much more attached to their metro, one of the most beautiful and deepest in the world. The metro is no longer a form of transport – it is a haven, like something from an apocalyptic movie. It is covered with signs of permanent presence of non-travelling “passengers” and there is living space everywhere. The station platforms are being turned into cinemas where films are shown for free – children’s films in the morning and films for a wider audience later in the day. Large screens have already been hung or are being hung right now at 14 Kyiv metro stations. There is a constant supply of tea, the internet is already there, but the connection is poor. There are not enough toilets, but people don’t complain about queuing for 40 minutes or more. Everyone waits patiently. They are waiting for the end of the war and the beginning of the trial – a trial that the whole world will have to follow, as the whole world followed at Nuremberg. * * * And, in Russia, what do they think about the future court proceedings? I am afraid they don’t think about it at all. They are now busy buying dollars and euros. Sanctions targeting the banking sector have caused the value of the rouble to fall dramatically, provoking panic. Panic is also observed on the Russian-Finnish border, via which many Russians are now trying to leave their homeland. They are those who are ashamed to stay in Russia, and those who could be drafted into the army, those who do not want to die or do not want to kill or do not want to be cannon fodder for the Kremlin. Some captured Russian soldiers have asked for permission to remain in Ukraine for good. “Jail awaits us if we return!” they say. On the borders of Ukraine with Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland, there are still queues of refugees. It’s said that some Ukrainians are trying to leave the country using fake Russian passports. These are those who don’t want to fight either. I won’t judge them. Let time and history judge everyone. I am glad that at this most difficult of times, most Ukrainians have maintained their humanity and try to help each other. Mobilisation has been announced, but no one is forcibly taken into the army. Those who themselves want to defend their homeland come to the military registration and enlistment offices and get registered. Most often, they are asked to leave a phone number and to wait for a call. There are many who want to fight the invaders, but not all of those who want to fight are really ready to participate in military action. In the last couple of days, I’ve started to dread opening Facebook. More and more often in the news feed, I see posts by young Ukrainian women declaring their love for their recently killed husbands. I know some of these women and have met their husbands. I cannot read these cries of despair thrown into the bottomless well of the internet without tears. But I can’t not read them either. I want to see and hear everything that is happening now in my country. I know that in the occupied Melitopol, in the south of Ukraine, arrests of Crimean Tatar activists and other active citizens have begun. I know that the workers of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have been kept inside the station by the Russian invaders, that their mobile phones were taken away and that they have not been allowed to leave the station for more than a week now. Moscow television propagandists have gone there under the protection of the Russian military to make news stories. I don’t know what they are saying in Russia about this war, about the captured Chernobyl nuclear power plant, about the captured Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is still in operation. Why do they need this non-military atomic installation? Are they planning to blackmail Ukraine and the world? Why are they bombing children’s hospitals and schools? Why destroy residential areas of Chernihiv, Borodianka, Kharkiv, and Mariupol? Why, after all, are they bombing bakeries and bread shops? I don’t have answers to these questions. “You can’t understand Russia with your mind!” wrote the 19th-century Russian poet Fyodor Tyutchev. I agree with him, but I still have a question: how can one understand Russia at all, if the mind does not help?

The energy standoff between Russia and the rest of Europe continues to spiral. At the end of July, Russia further reduced supply to the continent, making it harder – and more expensive – for countries to ensure reserves of gas ahead of the winter. In the UK, the government has offered a trickle of policies that are supposed to lighten the load, including a one-off £400 energy bill discount for households and windfall taxes on energy companies that are reporting exceedingly high profits. But is this enough – and how is the rest of the world coping? In today’s newsletter we outline the measures taken by five other countries to address the global energy crisis. Five big stories NHS | The health minister Maria Caulfield has admitted that 34 hospitals have roofs made of concrete that are so badly maintained they could collapse at any moment. Salman Rushdie | The author’s “road to recovery has begun” but “will be long” after his stabbing in western New York, the novelist’s agent has said. “The injuries are severe,” Andrew Wylie told the Guardian in an email – Rushdie received “life changing” injuries to his neck, stomach, eye, chest and thigh. “But his condition is headed in the right direction.” Water | A Lib Dem councillor has called for Thames Water to be fined after it cut water supplies leading to hundreds of households in Surrey having to go three days without tap water at the height of the heatwave. Labour | Keir Starmer has set out a £29bn proposal that Labour says would avoid people having to pay “a penny more” on their energy bills this winter. It includes an £8bn windfall tax on energy company profits and insulating 19m homes over the next decade. Immigration | Data released by the ONS shows there has been a dramatic drop in EU citizens moving to the UK. Last year 43,000 EU citizens received visas for work, family, study or other purposes, in comparison with 230,000 to 430,000 between 2014-2020. In depth: From nationalising utilities to aircon bans, how other countries are coping With reports that energy bills are going to cost the equivalent of two months’ wages by next year, it seems increasingly important that the British government takes a preemptive, rather than reactive, approach to the crisis. So what’s everyone else doing? *** Germany In 2020, Russia supplied over 50% of Germany’s natural gas, roughly a third of all oil, and almost half of all of its coal imports. So when Russia cut gas supplies to Germany at the end of July, the results were catastrophic. In response, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has been labouring to wean the country off its heavy reliance on Russian exports of oil and gas. He has assured German citizens that they won’t be left without energy this winter or with extortionate bills landing on their doorstep. The first thing Scholz did was to pass emergency legislation to reactivate closed oil and coal power plants. It’s not ideal – the government’s environmentalist economics minister, Robert Habeck, has described the move as “painful but necessary”— but it is an effective way of alleviating some pressure in the short term. Scholz has also indicated that he is considering U-turning on Germany’s policy to phase out nuclear energy, and lengthening the lifetime of the country’s only three remaining nuclear plants. The German government is aware these are temporary responses to stop the bleeding. Looking ahead, a central part of Germany’s long term plan is to achieve energy sovereignty by investing in and scaling up the generation of renewable energy. The government is installing more solar and wind energy farms and has recently released an energy efficiency support package of $180bn to Germany’s climate and transformation fund. *** France There are various factors exacerbating the energy crisis in France, and fewer than half of the country’s nuclear reactors are up and running because of maintenance issues. France has decided the best way to mitigate wider economic damage is to cap retail energy prices. This move has already played a crucial role in insulating France from the energy price shock afflicting the rest of the continent. In comparison with the UK, Germany and even the US, France’s inflation rate, at 6.5%, is considerably lower. Another measure Macron has taken to stabilise the situation is to renationalise EDF, France’s main electricity supplier, at a cost of nearly €10bn. The government has also reduced taxes on electricity and approved a €20bn package of measures to help struggling households cope with rising energy and food prices. *** US It’s not just Europe dealing with this debilitating problem. The US is contending with the worst energy crisis since the 1970s. Last month, gasoline prices reached $5 a gallon for the first time ever, natural gas hit its highest mark in 14 years and electricity grid operators announced controlled outages are likely. In response, Senator Joe Manchin is backing a $369bn climate and energy deal. The legislation would include tax credits for buying environmentally friendly vehicles, incentives to accelerate the rollout of wind and solar farms, and support for nuclear power production. However, for this legislation to have any impact on the current crisis, it would have to be rolled out quickly and efficiently – which in the context of the US’s political gridlock is unlikely. *** Japan Japan is no stranger to an energy crisis. After the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in 2011 that triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, energy saving became a cornerstone national project for the country. So, unlike in many other countries, Japan already has a blueprint for how to deal with this kind of crisis. Instead of large, governmental interventions, the focus seems to be on individuals cutting back. The government has long encouraged businesses and households to lower their use of air conditioners and avoid using other power-hungry appliances. The suspension of nuclear power for the last decade has made problems worse – as the crisis continues, it’s clear Japan is going to have to reevaluate the way it generates energy. *** Pakistan For Pakistan, a country that depends on imported fuel, the global energy crisis has left its economy in a dire place. Power cuts have significantly affected commercial activity, and gas rationing to the textile industry, a vital part of Pakistan’s economy, has resulted in a loss of $1bn in export orders. To deal with this, Pakistan has announced that it is open to long-term contracts of up to 30 years – most likely with Qatar and the UAE. Long-term contracts however are reportedly 75% more expensive than they were a year ago. Experts estimate that if Pakistan signed a deal now, a single cargo could cost roughly $55m-$61m. Pakistan is also looking inward and, like many other countries, turning to its nuclear plants to alleviate some of the pressure. Whether this will be enough is unclear.

Bogs, meanwhile, sound comical. Marshes are pleasanter, although bring malaria to mind, while wetlands emanate wholesomeness but are also wet in the “meh” sense of take it or leave it. Yet, as Tom Blass explains, these words all refer to the same thing: a place where land and water have got into a tussle and can’t decide which has won. The result is not so much an equilibrium, although these states of semi-submersion can hold their nerve for millennia, more a temporary detente where both sides are too exhausted to declare an outcome. It is in search of these in-between places that Blass travels from Cyprus to Lapland, Romania to Virginia, eyes peeled and treading gingerly lest he fall into the murk that lies beneath. Early on, Blass reveals himself to be more ethnologist than naturalist. While he pays respectful attention to the fauna that he encounters as he tacks from the Romney Marshes to Louisiana’s bayous by way of the Danube delta, it is the people he is after. The Lipovans, Cajuns and Seminole are all ethnic groups that have moulded a culture from the sludge squelching between their toes and this is the true subject of Blass’s bracingly original work. Above all, he is scrupulous about avoiding cliches. There are, for instance, very few glorious sunsets in Swamp Songs or encounters with gnarly old locals acting as aquifers for ancient wisdom, small mercies for which the reader should be grateful. This desire to skewer the cliches of his chosen genre starts early on, when Blass makes a trip to Dungeness, which in summer “is overrun by sea kale, psycho-geographers and, dammit, by people like me”. What people like him tend to be after, of course, is Prospect Cottage, the isolated clapperboard dwelling in which the film director Derek Jarman spent his last years cultivating his garden, a Shintoesque, salt-blown wonder in the lee of the looming nuclear power station. Even here, Blass can’t resist undercutting the conventions of his chosen genre, which may, indeed, be psycho-geography. “‘That’s it,’ they say. ‘That’s Derek Jarman’s house.’ And they move on, because really, there isn’t a great deal to see.” Such deadpanning is much in evidence too when Blass heads for the Great Dismal Swamp of Virginia’s coastal plane. The very name of the place is tautologous, since from the 17th century the word “dismal” was a catch-all term for a quagmire. “In other words, all swamps were dismal by dint of being swampy,” he writes. Still, Dismal does seem to live up to the modern usage, offering the visiting Blass nothing but a series of guarded, misfiring interactions with the inhabitants who are doing their favourite thing of fishing for bowfin and bullheads while giving nothing away. The only clue as to what may lie behind this persistent sense of Dismal’s menace is the fact that in the domestic front yards you can see Confederate flags alongside the more usual stars and stripes. The year is 2016, and as Blass drives round the edge of the swamp the US presidential election is only a few weeks away. Everywhere he sees placards that bear the slogans “Lock Her Up” and “Make America Great Again”. Most chilling of all, though, is the exhortation to “Drain the Swamp”. Blass discovers that historically the Dismal was the last redoubt of Black people running away from the plantations, fugitive Native Americans, English and Irish indentured labourers. Seen in this context, to “drain the swamp” is to recast a cluster of oppressed and vulnerable people as bogeymen. Before Britons feel too smug, Blass finds this dynamic alive and well closer to home. Back at the Romney Marshes, near to where he lives, he explores the local romance of smuggling, which has endured over centuries thanks to the watery inlets that allow small boats to drift quietly ashore and unload well away from the customs officer’s gaze. But Blass turns his binoculars sharply round and, before we know it, we are confronting the fact that every month refugees are smuggled across the Channel to land at nearby Dover. They are greeted, if not as swamp monsters exactly, then certainly as creatures from the deep to be swiftly dealt with and dispatched. • Swamp Songs: Journeys Through Marsh, Meadow and Other Wetlands by Tom Blass is published by Bloomsbury (£20).

Peter Dutton has delivered his budget reply speech, focusing on rising power prices and again calling for a discussion around nuclear power. It came hours before the UN warned there was now “no credible pathway” to limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C, the goal set to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis. Two weeks after the Medibank cyber-attack, the question that remains unanswered is: will the company pay a ransom? The hacker claimed to have extracted 200GB of files with data on all of the company’s 3.9 million customers. Richard Buckland, a professor of cybercrime at the University of New South Wales, said the Medibank case was one of the few where a company should pay the ransom, contrary to official advice. The climate crisis has reached a “really bleak moment”, one of the world’s leading climate scientists has said, after a slew of major reports laid bare how close the planet is to catastrophe. The UN’s environment agency has said there is “no credible pathway to 1.5C in place” and the failure to reduce carbon emissions means the only way to limit the worst impacts of the climate crisis is a “rapid transformation of societies”. The grieving mother of 15-year-old Cassius Turvey, killed in an alleged violent attack in Perth, has questioned why police took only a brief statement from the schoolboy before he died in hospital. She said she was frustrated that police, apart from taking a brief statement from Cassius the night he was admitted to hospital, did not take a further statement from him before he died. “We did not hear from any detectives, no police. Nothing. For five full days. That was their opportunity. That was their window,” Turvey said. Australia A chance discovery has ended the trial of Bruce Lehrmann for the alleged rape of Brittany Higgins, with ACT supreme court chief justice Lucy McCallum forced to abort the trial after it was found that a juror was thought to have brought in outside research material into the court. But the chaos of the last minutes of the trial did not stop after McCallum’s decision. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has put cost of living concerns at the centre of his budget in reply speech, accusing Labor of a “missed opportunity” to help Australians in need. Energy ministers should agree to impose a price cap on gas at about a third of current market offers when they meet on Friday to help ease inflation threats, the head of one of Australia’s largest industry groups has said.

It comes as Vladimir Putin has said that he directly ordered his defence minister to make a series of calls to top Nato commanders this week over the potential detonation of a “dirty bomb” in Ukraine. Fears are growing that Jair Bolsonaro could refuse to accept defeat in Brazil’s crunch election this Sunday after his politician son claimed Brazil’s far-right president was the victim of “the greatest electoral fraud ever seen” amid unproven allegations of foul play.

Thanks for following along. Here is a summary of today’s events: Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports. Kyiv has reacted to Russia’s plans in Belarus by calling for an emergency meeting of the United Nations’ Security Council. In a statement, Kyiv’s foreign ministry described Russia’s plans to station nuclear weapons in Belarus as “another provocative step” by Moscow that undermines “the international security system as a whole”. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, said the Kremlin has taken Belarus as a “nuclear hostage”. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak accused Vladimir Putin of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and resorting to “scare” tactics. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has cautioned Belarus against hosting Russian nuclear weapons on its territory. Borrell tweeted: “#Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation &amp; threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” The United States has not seen any indication that Russia has yet moved nuclear weapons to Belarus, national security council spokesman John Kirby said Sunday. “We have not seen any indication that he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around,” Kirby told CBS. Three people were reported injured and three residential buildings were damaged following an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region. Law enforcement has attributed the blast to a Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV drone “packed with explosives”. None of the people hurt in the blast are believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in a televised interview broadcast. Putin stated that the two countries’ military cooperation was transparent, news agencies reported. The UK Ministry of Defence says that since the start of March 2023, Russia is likely to have launched at least 71 Iranian-designed Shahed series one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicle (OWA-UAVS) against targets across Ukraine. It says Russia is likely launching Shaheds from two axes: from Russia’s Krasnodar Krai in the east and from Bryansk Oblast in the north-east. Ukraine will no longer resort to “dangerous” monetary financing to fund the war against Russia, its central bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday. Ukrainian refugees are increasingly being targeted for sexual exploitation with an increase in interest in pornography claiming to feature refugees from the war-torn country, according to research by Thomson Reuters. Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence Hanna Maliar went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. The head of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”. Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid.” The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. Separately, Britain’s defence ministry said the months-long Russian assault on the city had stalled, mainly as a result of heavy troop losses. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. Several buildings were damaged but no one was injured following the detonation of a naval mine that hit some coastline facilities in Odesa, according to the Odesa city council. The Kyiv Independent quoted authorities as saying that no one was injured. Russian oil company Gazprom reduced gas exports to the EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On 24 March, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5m cubic metres. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2m cubic metres. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reported that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported. The United States has not seen any indication that Russia has yet moved nuclear weapons to its neighbor Belarus, national security council spokesman John Kirby said Sunday, according to AFP. “We have not seen any indication that he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around,” Kirby told CBS. Three people were reported injured following the explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region, which law enforcement has attributed to a Ukrainian drone. “A Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV was the cause of an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk, Tula region,” the Tass news agency quoted a law enforcement agency source as saying, according to Reuters. “The drone was packed with explosives.” None of the people hurt in the blast are believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell cautioned Belarus against hosting Russian nuclear weapons on its territory, warning the move may trigger additional sanctions. In a Sunday tweet, Borrell said: “#Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation &amp; threat to European security.” “Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice,” he added. “The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” On Saturday, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced an agreement reached with Belarus will see Moscow stationing tactical nuclear weapons on its smaller neighbors’ territory. Here are some images coming to us over the wires. More details are emerging about the reported explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region, where two people suffered shrapnel wounds. The crater was caused by a drone, the Tass news agency quoted law enforcement as saying, Reuters reports. Three residential buildings were also damaged following the explosion, a regional security agency said. More reaction from Kyiv on plans by Russian president Vladimir Putin to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. In a statement, Kyiv’s foreign ministry described it as “another provocative step” by Moscow that undermines “the international security system as a whole”. The ministry said: Russia once again confirms its chronic inability to be a responsible steward of nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence and prevention of war, not as a tool of threats and intimidation. It demanded a UN security council session and called on the Group of Seven countries and the European Union to warn Belarus of “far-reaching consequences” if it accepts the Russian weapons. The Ukrainian statement added: Ukraine calls on all members of the international community to convey to the criminal (P)utin regime the categorical unacceptability of its next nuclear provocations and to take decisive measures to effectively deter and prevent any possibility of the aggressor state’s use of nuclear weapons. Two people have suffered shrapnel wounds following an explosion on Sunday in the town of Kireyevsk, about 220km (140 miles) south of Moscow, the Tass news agency cited emergency services as saying. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known, but it left a crater in the centre of the town, in the Tula region, Reuters reports. “The explosion sounded at 1519 (1219 GMT). Two victims, born in 2002 and 2006, have shrapnel wounds. Emergency services are on the scene,” Tass quoted a local emergency services representative as saying. “There is a crater. This explosion was in the heart of the city,” the representative added. The representative said the injuries were not life-threatening and that investigators were working at the site. Several nearby buildings were damaged but no one was injured after a naval mine detonated after hitting some some coastline facilities in Odesa, according to Odesa city council. The Kyiv Independent quoted authorities as saying that no one was injured. Ukraine fans have been gathering near Wembley, in north London, ahead of this evening’s UEFA Euro 2024 Group C qualifying match against England: It is just after 4pm in Kyiv. Here is a summary of events so far. Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports. Kyiv has said Russia was holding Minsk as a “nuclear hostage” after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to ally Belarus, Agence France-Presse reports. Ukraine has called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations’ Security Council over Russia’s announcement that it would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Ukrainian refugees are increasingly being targeted for sexual exploitation with an increase in interest in pornography claiming to feature refugees from the war-torn country, according to research by Thomson Reuters.

Ukraine has called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations’ Security Council over Russia’s announcement that it would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. The Ukrainian foreign ministry said: Ukraine expects effective actions to counteract the Kremlin’s nuclear blackmail from the United Kingdom, China, the United States and France... We demand that an extraordinary meeting of the UN Security Council be immediately convened for this purpose. Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports. A Nato spokesperson said on Sunday: Nato is vigilant, and we are closely monitoring the situation. We have not seen any changes in Russia’s nuclear posture that would lead us to adjust our own. Russia’s reference to Nato’s nuclear sharing is totally misleading. Nato allies act with full respect of their international commitments. Russia has consistently broken its arms control commitments, most recently suspending its participation in the New START Treaty. The Associated Press reports on a new recruitment campaign launched across Russia seeking volunteers to enlist troops for the war in Ukraine. Advertisements promise cash bonuses and enticing benefits. Recruiters are making cold calls to eligible men. Enlistment offices are working with universities and social service agencies to lure students and the unemployed. A new campaign is under way this spring across Russia, seeking recruits to replenish its troops for the war in Ukraine. As fighting grinds on in Ukrainian battlegrounds like Bakhmut and both sides prepare for counter-offensives that could cost even more lives, the Kremlin’s war machine badly needs new recruits. A mobilisation in September of 300,000 reservists – billed as a “partial” call-up – sent panic throughout the country, since most men under 65 are formally part of the reserve. Tens of thousands fled Russia rather than report to recruiting stations. The Kremlin denies that another call-up is planned for what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, now more than a year old. But amid widespread uncertainty of whether such a move will eventually happen, the government is enticing men to volunteer, either at makeshift recruiting centres popping up in various regions, or with phone calls from enlistment officials. That way, it can “avoid declaring a formal second mobilisation wave” after the first one proved so unpopular, according to a recent report by the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War. One Muscovite told the Associated Press that his employer, a state-funded organisation, gathered up the military registration cards of all male employees of fighting age and said it would get them deferments. But he said the move still sent a wave of fear through him. “It makes you nervous and scared – no one wants to all of a sudden end up in a war with a rifle in their hands,” said the resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared reprisal. “The special operation is somewhat dragging on, so any surprises from the Russian authorities can be expected.” Former Russian state TV editor Marina Ovsyannikova, who in 2022 interrupted a live news broadcast denouncing the Ukraine war, has said her son called her a “traitor” for her actions, adding that she may never be able to return to Russia. Ukrainian-born Ovsyannikova, who was an editor at Channel One, burst on to the set of the nightly news in March 2022 shouting: “Stop the war. No to war.” She also held a sign saying: “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” It was signed in English: “Russians against the war.” At the time, she was fined 30,000 roubles (£460) for ignoring protest laws. She continued protesting against the war after quitting her job at Channel One. Last August, she was charged with spreading false information about the Russian army for holding up a poster that read “Putin is a murderer, his soldiers are fascists” during a solo protest on the Moskva River embankment opposite the Kremlin. She was subsequently forced to wear an electronic ankle bracelet and placed under house arrest in Moscow, where she was to await trial. She faced up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. However, she escaped her pre-trial house arrest and fled to Europe. She now lives in Paris, France, with her daughter. Shortly after she left Russia, she said her son had told her that her decision to protest had ruined the family’s life. She told BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: My son still called me a traitor, that I betrayed our family. I betrayed our country. I can say that for millions of families [this] is the same situation – war ruins a lot of families. And this is a real catastrophe because Russians have been destroyed by Putin, not only physically by him sending them to war but also on a psychological level. Russia is now deep in depression, there is an apathy everywhere and millions of people just don’t know what the future holds. When asked if she thought it would ever be safe for her to return to Russia, she said: I can’t go back now. But I do see my future with Russia. My son is there, my family is there, my mum, and they don’t want to leave the country. For me, I am not indifferent to the future of this country and I will fight for the future even being outside of Russia. Ovsyannikova said she was “ashamed” of Russia for invading Ukraine and recalling how she had “mixed emotions” before she made the 2022 protest, she explained: A lot of factors came together. Over a long time I realised that the Russian TV became like a gigantic brainwashing machine. Secondly, I have Ukrainian roots – my father is from Ukraine. It was like this huge emotional outburst. But I didn’t really care what would happen to me later.” Ovsyannikova had worked at the channel for nearly 20 years and admitted she had in the past “shut my eyes to it [the propaganda]”, but the war became “a point of no return”. She said: This propaganda is made on a very high level …These people who are working in the main media channels, they don’t really believe it. They have similar views to me, and also, you can say that people who are pro-Putin, who are convinced in him, as no more than 10 or 20%. The arrest warrant handed to President Putin by the international criminal court could herald change, she added: I think this is the first signal that the Russian elite should take notice of, and perhaps some kind of resistance will start within the Russian elite and they might plot against him. At least this is some kind of hope for me. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak has accused Vladimir Putin of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and resorting to “scare” tactics. On Saturday, Putin announced Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in neighbour and ally Belarus “without violating our international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation”, Agence France-Presse reports. But Podolyak said on Twitter: Making a statement about tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, he admits that he is afraid of losing and all he can do is scare with tactics … Second. He once again states his involvement in the crime. Violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty … Ukrainian refugees are increasingly being targeted for sexual exploitation with an increase in interest in pornography claiming to feature refugees from the war-torn country, according to research. Thomson Reuters has conducted the research, which has found that Ukrainian refugees may be victims of both traffickers on the ground and cyber-voyeurs. Researchers identified an increased interest in Ukrainian pornography since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 by analysing global internet search engine traffic. They believe the increased interest online may be encouraging traffickers to act more often and with greater impunity. The organisation has called for urgent action to strengthen protections to help keep Ukrainian women and children who are at risk from sexual exploitation safe. The analysis of internet search trends has found views of pornographic videos claiming to show Ukrainian refugees have exploded in the past six months. A snapshot of 13 pornographic videos claiming to feature Ukrainian refugees shows they were viewed 275,000 times in January. While there was evidence of sexual exploitation and trafficking of some Ukrainians before the war started, the latest data shows a significant increase since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Worldwide search traffic for exploitative terms such as “Ukrainian porn” have been consistently at higher levels since the February 2022 invasion. Thomson Reuters is working with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to raise awareness about this sexual exploitation. They have partnered to launch the “Be Safe” campaign to encourage the global community to provide Ukrainians with safety information and to help them to spot the warning signs of traffickers. Valiant Richey, the OSCE special representative and coordinator for combating trafficking in human beings, said: “This analysis shows just how crucial it is to keep women and children fleeing the war safe. The high demand from men for sexual access to Ukrainian women and girls creates an enormous incentive for traffickers to recruit vulnerable people in order to meet that demand and profit from it. “We already found direct evidence of recruitment attempts on chats used by Ukrainians and an increase in the advertisement of Ukrainians online.” The new data is based on “interest scores”, which relate directly to search traffic and compare a term’s popularity over a specific period. Earlier analysis in 2022 found that global internet searches for sexually exploitative terms specifically relating to Ukrainian refugees surged following the outbreak of the war. In March 2022, research found a 300% global increase in these terms. You can read the full report here. Here are some images coming to us over the wires. Here’s some more on football. Later on Sunday, Ukraine take on England at the UK’s Wembley Stadium in a qualifying match for the men’s Euro 2024 football competition. UK ministers offered 1,000 free tickets to Ukrainians and their sponsors to attend the match at Wembley. Denys Dreyzer, 18, from Kherson, fled Ukraine in May 2022 and came to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. He and his family have since moved out from their hosts' home. Dreyzer, who works as caretaker for the Ukrainian Community Centre and is studying at the University of Bolton, will attend the game with his mother and sister, who he lives with in Bradford. His father is in Kyiv. Discussing the match, he told PA News: I hope it will be amazing, because it’s like new fresh air to our community to watch our guys fighting to get to the Euros. We hope this game our guys will show what we can do. And also it will be good present for our military, because they are every day fighting for our freedom. I hope they will watch this game and this game will will make them happy. The Azadi Stadium in Tehran can hold up to 78,000 at capacity. As Anton Miranchuk of Lokomotiv Moscow kicked off under a giant portrait of the former supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini on Thursday night, let’s generously say it wasn’t quite full. Still, what crowd there was made a pretty decent noise. There were even a few hundred travelling fans, who were rewarded when Miranchuk scored for Russia from the penalty spot. Early in the second half the Porto striker Mehdi Taremi equalised for Iran, and although the later stages disintegrated into a procession of substitutions, the visitors were ultimately a little fortunate to escape with a 1-1 draw. Honours even on the pitch, then, which felt like a diplomatically fitting result. Over the past year, as the west has begun to close ranks, these two pariah states have found themselves locked in a pragmatic but increasingly enthusiastic embrace. Russian money has been pouring into Iranian mining and infrastructure projects, to the point where it is now Iran’s largest source of foreign investment. Iran has invited Russian businesspeople to Tehran to share advice on circumventing western sanctions. The two countries have linked their banking systems and embarked on joint naval drills. And last month the Russian and Iranian sports ministers signed a “memorandum of mutual understanding”, vowing to strengthen their sporting ties. On Sunday evening, Ukraine’s footballers will step out at Wembley Stadium to a vivid fanfare: a sea of flags and bold gestures, an outpouring of affection and solidarity that has greeted them pretty much everywhere they have travelled in the last year. At exactly the same time, in St Petersburg’s Krestovsky Stadium, Russia will play Iraq in their first national team game on home soil since the start of last year’s war. Good luck finding the game on television or tracking down a match report on the Fifa website. But seamlessly, almost imperceptibly, Russia has returned to the international football treadmill, and nobody seems overly perturbed by it. Even Ukraine, who called for Iran to be thrown out of last year’s World Cup for its role in supplying drones to the Russian war effort, has in this instance opted for apathy over outrage. “Those countries who play Russia, an aggressor, support Russian aggression and what Russia is doing to Ukraine,” said Ukraine’s caretaker manager, Ruslan Rotan, last week. “We don’t have to think about those countries, we don’t have to pay attention to them. They are not worthy. The bottom line is, forget Russia.” Read the full report here. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in a televised interview broadcast on Sunday, stating that the two countries’ military cooperation was transparent, news agencies reported. Putin also said western powers were building a new “axis”, bearing some resemblance to Germany and Japan’s second world war alliance. Interfax quoted Putin as saying: We are not creating any military alliance with China. Yes, we have cooperation in the sphere of military-technical interaction. We are not hiding this. Everything is transparent, there is nothing secret. Kyiv on Sunday said Russia was holding Minsk as a “nuclear hostage” after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to ally Belarus, Agence France-Presse reports. “The Kremlin took Belarus as a nuclear hostage,” the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, Oleksiy Danilov, wrote on Twitter, adding that the move was “a step towards the internal destabilisation of the country”. The UK Ministry of Defence says that since the start of March 2023 Russia is likely to have launched at least 71 Iranian-designed Shahed series one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicle (OWA-UAVS) against targets across Ukraine. It says Russia is likely launching Shaheds from two axes: from Russia’s Krasnodar Krai in the east and from Bryansk Oblast in the north-east. Ukraine will no longer resort to “dangerous” monetary financing to fund the war against Russia, its central bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday. The head of the National Bank of Ukraine said that it had “created huge risks for macro-financial stability” when the bank was last year forced to print billions of hryvnia to plug a budget shortfall, adding that an “open conflict” with the government over the issue had been resolved. “It was a quick remedy, but very dangerous,” Pyshnyi told the newspaper. Reactions continue on Vladimir Putin’s announcement Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. “It’s a very significant move,” Nikolai Sokov, a senior fellow at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, told Reuters. “Russia had always been very proud that it had no nuclear weapons outside its territory. So, now, yes, they are changing that and it’s a big change.” Putin did not specify when the weapons would be transferred to Belarus, which has borders with three Nato members – Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. He said Russia would complete the construction of a storage facility there by 1 July. “This is part of Putin’s game to try to intimidate Nato … because there is no military utility from doing this in Belarus as Russia has so many of these weapons and forces inside Russia,” said Hans Kristensen, director of the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons called Putin’s announcement on an extremely dangerous escalation. “In the context of the war in Ukraine, the likelihood of miscalculation or misinterpretation is extremely high. Sharing nuclear weapons makes the situation much worse and risks catastrophic humanitarian consequences,” it said on Twitter. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Christine Kearney to bring you up to speed with the latest developments. The US – the world’s other nuclear superpower – has reacted cautiously to Russia’s deal to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. A senior US administration official says there are no signs Moscow plans to use its nuclear weapons. Putin likened his plans to the US stationing its weapons in Europe and said that Russia would not be transferring control to Belarus. But this could be the first time since the mid-1990s that Russia were to base such weapons outside the country. Hawkish Russian politicians and commentators have long-speculated about nuclear strikes, saying Russia has the right to defend itself with nuclear weapons if it is pushed beyond its limits. “Tactical” nuclear weapons refer to those used for specific gains on a battlefield rather than those with the capacity to wipe out cities. It is unclear how many such weapons Russia has, given it is an area still shrouded in cold war secrecy. Experts say the development is significant, since Russia had until now been proud that unlike the US, it did not deploy nuclear weapons outside its borders. The senior US administration official noted that Russia and Belarus had been speaking about the transfer of nuclear weapons for some time. “We have seen reports of Russia’s announcement and will continue to monitor this situation,” the US defence department’s press office said in a written statement. “We have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture nor any indications Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon. We remain committed to the collective defence of the Nato alliance.” In other key developments shortly after 9am in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv: Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence Hanna Maliar went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. The head of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”. Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid.” The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. Separately, Britain’s defence ministry said the months-long Russian assault on the city had stalled, mainly as a result of heavy troop losses. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. Russian oil company Gazprom reduced gas exports to the EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On 24 March, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5m cubic metres. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2m cubic metres. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reported that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported. More than 5,000 former criminals have been pardoned after finishing their contracts to fight in Russia’s Wagner mercenary group against Ukraine, the founder of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said on Saturday. The Wagner group, originally staffed by battle-hardened veterans of the Russian armed forces, took on a much more prominent role in the Ukraine war after the Russian army suffered a series of humiliating defeats last year, Reuters reported. The United Nations has said it is “deeply concerned” by what it said were summary executions of prisoners of war by both Russian and Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. A report from the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights said its monitors had documented dozens of the executions by both sides, that the actual number was likely higher and that they “may constitute war crimes”. Police in Russia have placed a former speechwriter for Vladimir Putin on a wanted list of suspects, the latest step in a sweeping crackdown on dissent. The Associated Press reports that Abbas Gallyamov wrote speeches for Putin during the Russian leader’s 2008-12 stint as prime minister. Gallyamov later became an outspoken political consultant and analyst who was frequently quoted by Russian and foreign media. He has lived abroad in recent years. Russia’s parliament speaker has proposed banning the activities of the international criminal court (ICC) after the court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accusing him of war crimes. Vyacheslav Volodin, an ally of Putin’s, said on Saturday that Russian legislation should be amended to prohibit any activity of the ICC in Russia and to punish any who gave “assistance and support” to the court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2021/nov/28/britain-and-israel-to-sign-trade-and-defence-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-28T23:56:11Z","webTitle":"Britain and Israel to sign trade and defence deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/28/britain-and-israel-to-sign-trade-and-defence-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2021/nov/28/britain-and-israel-to-sign-trade-and-defence-deal","fields":{"headline":"Britain and Israel to sign trade and defence deal","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Britain and Israel will sign a 10-year trade and defence pact in London on Monday, promising cooperation on issues such as cybersecurity and a joint commitment to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The agreement was announced by Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, and her Israeli counterpart Yair Lapid, despite evidence that spyware made by Israeli company NSO Group had probably been used to spy on two British lawyers advising the ex-wife of the ruler of Dubai, Princess Haya. In a joint article in the Daily Telegraph, Truss and Lapid said the agreement amounted to “a new strategic plan for the next decade spanning cyber, tech, trade and defence,” while the two countries would “work night and day to prevent the Iranian regime from ever becoming a nuclear power”. The ministers added that the two countries would “work closer” to defend themselves in cyberspace, while Israel would become a tier one cyber partner for the UK and have greater access to the British market. “Our partnership will keep us at the forefront of the technological revolution,” Truss and Lapid added. Just over a week ago, Priti Patel, the home secretary, announced that the UK would proscribe the political wing of Palestinian political group Hamas, bringing the UK in line with the US and the EU. “Hamas is fundamentally and rabidly antisemitic,” Patel said in a speech she gave in Washington DC. But it comes after a British court ruled that NSO’s Pegasus spyware had been used against divorce lawyer Lady Shackleton, and an associate, at a time when they were advising Princess Haya in a child protection battle being played out in the UK. British complaints at the time were relatively muted, although sources close to the company said it had altered its software to prevent +44 UK numbers from being spied on again. NSO technology has since been put on a US blacklist, citing use of the company’s software by regimes around the world for “transnational repression”. Meanwhile, talks with Iran on salvaging the 2015 nuclear deal restart on Monday in Vienna after a five-month break, although there is little hope of a breakthrough that would allow the US to rejoin the agreement given Tehran’s negotiating demands. Nevertheless, in the joint statement by the foreign ministers, Britain seeks to reassure Israel that it will remain vigilant on the issue. “We will also work night and day to prevent the Iranian regime from ever becoming a nuclear power. The clock is ticking, which heightens the need for close cooperation with our partners and friends to thwart Tehran’s ambitions,” Truss and Lapid said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/10/brexit-legacy-is-just-the-start-of-incoming-pms-problems-as-cost-of-living-crisis-spirals","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-10T07:00:29Z","webTitle":"Brexit legacy is just the start of incoming PM’s problems as cost of living crisis spirals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/10/brexit-legacy-is-just-the-start-of-incoming-pms-problems-as-cost-of-living-crisis-spirals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/10/brexit-legacy-is-just-the-start-of-incoming-pms-problems-as-cost-of-living-crisis-spirals","fields":{"headline":"Brexit legacy is just the start of incoming PM’s problems as cost of living crisis spirals","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has left the Conservative party in policy la-la land. “Cakeism” has run riot – vast, incoherent ambitions detached from political, economic and business realities. Thus the aim is to be “Global Britain” but an ultra-hard Brexit ensures shrinking exports, falling inward investment, dwindling financial muscle and inevitably global retreat. Britain is to be a high-wage, high-innovation economy but there is only one hi-tech company in the FTSE 100, and no strategy to add any more. We are to be a science superpower but there is little chance when we are excluded from the biggest transnational scientific organisation on earth – the EU Horizon programme. There are targets to level up Britain’s glaring geographical inequalities but with scant resources – with what little there is directed at Tory constituencies. As the cost of living crisis intensifies, the government consistently offers too little, too late. A mid-ranking European power must collaborate with others to have leverage over any significant policy area: instead, rancour, rows and delusions of a capacity to go it alone dominate. There are commitments to fiscal responsibility while simultaneously advocating more spending and lower taxes. It is an intellectual black hole. The incoming PM’s problems start with the legacy of Johnson’s Brexit – the unchallenged, sacred verity of Conservative politics. But this allegedly “oven-ready” deal paid no attention to the realities of the 21st-century economy, now dominated by products and services that compete on their knowledge content, resilience and compliance with the highest regulatory standards. To exclude ourselves from the EU single market, which sets the standards for the whole of the EU, is thus a ball and chain around Britain’s growth potential – and by menacing our exports worsens the deficit in our current balance of payments so that a sterling crisis is an ever-present risk. Importantly, the attempt to shoehorn Northern Ireland back into the UK market and suspend its relationship with the EU by unilaterally rewriting the NI protocol had led to no new contracts being awarded in the EU Horizon programme, and to existing ones being cancelled. It is a self-defeating debacle. Beyond that, Johnson was an opportunistic policy jackdaw – backing whatever seemed attractive to whatever audience but with no sense of how it was to be delivered or financed, or how it fitted with a larger vision. Levelling up was his commitment to the former Labour “red wall” seats in the Midlands and north which turned Tory in the 2019 general election. They deserved better, he rightly insisted, from life expectancy and public transport to career prospects: but how? The levelling up white paper set 12 interlinked economic, social and political priorities – but their achievement demands a mobilisation of resources, strengthened institutions and serious devolution. Johnson, obsessed with favouring only Brexit Tories and their constituencies, could deliver none of it. Above all, no serious creative thought had been given to how the UK could find the billions necessary, over many years, to fund levelling up. In the event, the HS2 link from Birmingham to Leeds was cancelled. The entire strategy needs urgent attention if it is not to collapse. Yet in principle it should be a national priority. So should developing lifelong learning, placing big bets on innovative projects, renewing our infrastructure, confronting digital monopolies, securing energy resilience consistent with lowering carbon emissions, and offering a national social care system for our elderly. To none of these challenges did Johnson give sustained attention. Is the health and social care levy even going to survive, let alone deliver what was promised? Energy policy in the wake of the crisis in prices after the Ukraine war is a particular jumble; grandiloquent impossible ambitions to build eight new nuclear power stations in the decade ahead sit alongside drawing back from commitments to renewables. Any chance of meeting net zero commitments by 2050 (and capping energy bills) means insulating a million homes a year: the figure runs at a derisory 30-40,000, with no commitment to improvement. Looming in the background – and undermining all of it – is the commitment to a smaller state and lower taxes. Rarely has any government or any party faced in so many contradictory directions at once, with so little chance of achieving any of its goals. Exit Johnson – leaving behind a mess for others to clear up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/26/how-does-the-eu-plan-to-cut-gas-usage-by-15-this-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-26T17:33:07Z","webTitle":"How does the EU plan to cut gas usage by 15% this winter?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/26/how-does-the-eu-plan-to-cut-gas-usage-by-15-this-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/26/how-does-the-eu-plan-to-cut-gas-usage-by-15-this-winter","fields":{"headline":"How does the EU plan to cut gas usage by 15% this winter?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The EU has agreed to cut its gas consumption by 15% in an attempt to stave off a winter crisis triggered by a sharp reduction or total shutdown of Russian gas supplies to the bloc. What has been agreed? From next month until the end of March 2023, all EU member states will strive for a voluntary 15% reduction in gas consumption. In the event of a major supply shock – a complete shutdown of Russian gas – the EU may declare an emergency and make the target mandatory with immediate effect. Three island nations that are not connected to the EU gas network – Cyprus, Ireland and Malta – would be exempt from the compulsory energy savings. But almost any member state, especially those with little connection to the gas network, or those facing an electricity supply shock, would be entitled to apply for an opt-out. How would it work? EU governments can choose how to ration gas, as long as they protect supplies to households. Industrial users will feel the pinch first; factories could be given targets to reduce heating and cooling. Some could be spared, such as manufacturers of critical goods, or plants that are difficult to restart after switching off energy. While consumers are protected, they are expected to do their bit. EU authorities are urging governments to launch campaigns to encourage people to switch off lights and turn down thermostats and air conditioning. EU governments are being urged to speed up the switch to renewable energy, but are also asked to consider delaying their exit from nuclear power or coal – an effort to find any alternative to Russian gas. Member states are required to report to EU authorities in Brussels on their energy savings plan every two months, a form of peer pressure intended to chivvy them into action. Why is the EU doing this now? As the EU was in the final throes of negotiating the plan, Gazprom announced that a drastic cut in supplies via the crucial Nord Stream 1 pipeline would take effect on Wednesday. The timing was a coincidence, but underlines why the EU is pushing to reduce Russian gas use. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the EU has decided to phase out Russian fossil fuels, which are major sources of funding for the Kremlin’s war effort. For many EU member states, ending the use of Russian gas will be painful. Before the invasion, Russia supplied 40% of the EU’s gas and 55% of Germany’s, although Europe’s biggest economy has since reduced its dependence. How is the bloc divided on the subject? EU member states have very different energy mixes: a few countries were nearly 100% dependent on Russian gas, while others used none. Countries that took little or no Russian energy objected to making sacrifices for those that benefited from years of cheap fuel from their eastern neighbour. Spain and Portugal, which have little connection to the EU gas network, argued that the blanket 15% target was unfair. In the end, all countries in the bloc supported the plan with the exception of Hungary, where the government is a longtime Kremlin ally that supports EU sanctions reluctantly. France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands supported the original plan, fearing the economic ripples of a recession from the German economy. How much energy will be saved? If the EU reduces gas use by 15%, it would avoid using 45bn cubic metres of the fuel, according to European Commission estimates. The various opt-outs depress that total, but officials say that even if countries took full advantage of the exemptions, the plan would still see the EU through an averagely cold winter. The 15% target, however, was designed to see the EU through a bitterly cold winter. Expect the long-range weather reports to be as keenly studied as the EU’s economic forecast. What happens next? The 2022-23 winter is expected to be difficult, especially if temperatures plunge. But some fear the following winter could be even worse. EU gas storage levels are at 66%, but by the end of next spring they could be seriously depleted with fewer options to replace stocks. EU officials suggest the gap could be filled by pipeline gas from Norway and Azerbaijan, more tanker-delivered liquified natural gas from as far afield as the US, and efforts to reduce demand. The original gas-savings plan was meant to last for two years, but EU governments reduced the scope to one year. The plan for winter 2023-24 still has to be written."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/04/ukraine-pm-thanks-germany-solidarity-calls-more-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-04T15:14:31Z","webTitle":"Ukraine PM thanks Germany for solidarity and calls for more weapons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/04/ukraine-pm-thanks-germany-solidarity-calls-more-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/04/ukraine-pm-thanks-germany-solidarity-calls-more-weapons","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine PM thanks Germany for solidarity and calls for more weapons","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ukraine’s prime minister has thanked Germany for its solidarity in the face of the Russian invasion while calling for more weapons, in a sign of easing tensions between Berlin and Kyiv. Denys Shmyhal, who was welcomed by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, with military honours in Berlin on Sunday, is the most senior Ukrainian official to visit the German capital in months, since Kyiv accused the EU’s biggest economy of doing too little. Starting his Berlin trip, Shmyhal met the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who was blocked from visiting Kyiv in April because of his past advocacy of strong German-Russian ties. Steinmeier, a former German foreign minister, who conceded in April that his approach to Moscow had been mistaken, offered to travel to Ukraine’s capital in the early weeks of the war to show solidarity but was told his visit was “not desired in Kyiv”. In a tweet after the meeting with Steinmeier, Shmyhal said they had discussed the military situation, strengthening sanctions and the need to provide weapons for Ukraine. “Thanked for solidarity with Ukrainians and support,” the tweet said. Germany will “continue to stand reliably by Ukraine’s side”, Steinmeier told Shmyhal, according to the German president’s spokesperson. “Germany has made huge progress in its support of Ukraine with weapons,” Shmyhal told German media before his trip, according to Agence France-Presse. But the prime minister added that Kyiv needed more from Berlin, including “modern combat tanks” such as the Leopard 2. Writing on Telegram, Shmyhal urged allies to provide Ukraine with more heavy weapons. “The MARS II multiple rocket launchers and the Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled artillery units, which Germany has provided, have performed well on the battlefield,” he said, adding that he expected Germany to become one of the leaders in supporting Ukraine’s air defence. The rapprochement between Kyiv and Berlin came as Scholz declared that Germany “will get through this winter”, as his government announced on Sunday a €65bn (£56bn) package to help households and companies cope with soaring energy prices. Scholz told local media that Germany would use income from windfall taxes to reduce end-consumer prices for gas, coal and oil. Europe faces an energy crisis after Russia shut down gas flows from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline into Germany. Gazprom said on Friday that the pipeline – the largest gas pipeline to Europe with capacity to deliver 55bn cubic metres a year – would be shut indefinitely because of a leak and would not restart until repairs were completed. Siemens Energy, which supplies and maintains equipment to Nord Stream 1, said the leak could be sealed and there was no reason to shut down the entire pipeline. In his nightly video address on Saturday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Moscow of weaponising its energy supplies against European countries it cannot yet attack with missiles. “Russia wants to destroy the normal life of every European – in all countries of our continent,” Zelenskiy said. “It is trying to attack with poverty and political chaos where it cannot yet attack with missiles.” The answer to this “decisive energy attack” was unity of European states and sanctions to limit Russia’s oil and gas revenues, he said. With the war in its 193rd day, Ukrainian officials said an eight-year-old child died and three other children were injured by Russian overnight shelling in the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv. Russian forces hit multiple residential targets in the region, according to Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv. Posting on his Telegram account, he said Russian shelling had damaged homes, three hospitals, two education facilities, a hotel and a museum in the area. Zelenskiy urged the EU to deliver a promised €9bn emergency financial aid package “asap”, he reported on Sunday in a tweet about a phone call he had with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. So far the EU has released only €1bn of the total because of wrangling over the balance between grants and loans. The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, said last week he was confident the EU would soon meet its promise, although Ukraine needs an estimated €5bn a month to keep going. Ukraine’s prime minister said he expected €5bn in macrofinancial assistance from the EU this week, which will “help ensure the stability of our economy, support of the army and the passing of the heating season”. Concerns remained high over Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is relying on a reserve line to supply electricity to the grid. In a statement on Saturday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the plant had again lost the connection to its last remaining main external power line, but continued to supply electricity to the grid via a reserve line. The plant was occupied by Russian forces in March but remains connected to Ukraine’s electricity grid and run by Ukrainian staff. After mounting concern about nuclear disaster, the IAEA inspectors arrived at the plant last Thursday with the aim of establishing a permanent presence. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on Saturday that his country could play a facilitator role regarding the plant, Erdoğan’s office said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/mar/06/observer-view-ukraine-western-support","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-06T06:00:45Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on Ukraine and western support | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/06/observer-view-ukraine-western-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/06/observer-view-ukraine-western-support","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on Ukraine and western support","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"The world has watched in horror as Vladimir Putin has deployed the same tactics of indiscriminate slaughter of civilians in Ukraine as he did in Syria and Chechnya. The power of despots derives from their willingness to inflict unthinkable evil to bend the will of those they seek to dominate and Putin is no different. Ukrainians are locked into a mortal fight for their freedom and their liberty; the extraordinary bravery of its ordinary citizens should humble us all. Yesterday’s bellicose rhetoric from the Russian leader, including his threat to dismantle Ukraine’s statehood, offers no suggestion of compromise. His war crimes are intensifying. Over the past week, we have seen civilians targeted with mass shellings. Densely populated cities have been under constant bombardment for days, as people hide in basements with dwindling supplies of food and water. Hospitals and kindergartens have been destroyed by the bombs. Whole families trying to flee the carnage have been shot in cold blood by Russian soldiers. In Volnovakha, shells hit civilian buildings every five minutes from a line of contact 20km away; barely a building in the town has been left unscathed. Bodies have been left in the streets; the peril facing those carrying out rescue missions is so great that they have to prioritise the living. Just as he did in Syria, Putin has ordered that key cities such as Mariupol should be besieged. Just as he did in Syria, he appeared to make concessions for humanitarian corridors to be established from Mariupol and Volnovakha, to allow for the evacuation of civilians, only to rip up the terms of that ceasefire as soon as it had been agreed. Putin’s aim appears to be to break the morale of the Ukrainian people and to brutally terrorise them into surrender. There will be a time to go over the failings of the west that brought us to this dreadful point, where there seems to be no way for other democracies to avert a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine; all they can do is to try to lessen the toll. For now, the most important question is what we can do to support Ukrainians and their democratically elected leader, President Zelenskiy, in their fight and what we can do to limit the scale of the human catastrophe. There are actions the west can take that should not even be the subject of debate, yet on which the British government seems to be dragging its feet. Despite minor relaxations, the UK’s policy with respect to Ukrainian refugees remains far more restrictive than that of the EU. There are stories of families fleeing war who remain separated because of British bureaucracy and mean-spiritedness. This should be a source of national shame. Economic sanctions on Russian oligarchs may have limited direct effect on Putin on the short term. But there is no justification for not clamping down swiftly and hard: these are people who have profited directly from Putin’s regime. Yesterday, the Italian government seized yachts and villas worth at least €140m from four Russians on the EU sanctions list. The UK government’s sluggishness is likely to prove costly in terms of allowing individuals to escape the sanctions they must face. These are the easier questions to answer about what actions the west must take. Far harder is what Nato should do to support Ukrainian forces and minimise civilian casualties in Ukraine itself. Here, the UK has led the way on providing accurate intelligence and military supplies, but there is the ever-present question of what more there is to do. Nato cannot declare war on Russia, which is what a no-fly zone would amount to. This would be a reckless escalation of conflict with a nuclear power. But there are lessons the west must learn from Syria about effective military and humanitarian support in the face of Russian brutality. There must be more support for evacuating civilians, especially vulnerable adults and children, from cities not yet under siege. Cities should be flooded with humanitarian supplies and basic infrastructure, such as satellites and generators. Russian guarantees for humanitarian corridors cannot be relied upon. It is vital that war crimes are documented, not just in the interests of justice when the conflict is over, but to assist in negotiations for humanitarian access. Ukraine has reported that some of the anti-aircraft defence missiles it has received from Germany do not work, and has asked for more, a call that must be heeded. The bravery of the Ukrainian resistance will be remembered by generations to come: the people from all walks of life volunteering to defend their country; the unarmed protesters marching against their occupiers in Kherson, the only city the Russians have so far captured. Citizens of liberal democracies owe the people of Ukraine a debt of gratitude; they are at the frontline of the fight for freedom and democracy in the face of authoritarianism, for rights that most of us are complacent about. Russia’s strike on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station should serve as a reminder that they are more fragile than we would like to think. It is too early to know the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict for the global order. China, guilty of genocide within its own borders, will be watching closely how Nato countries respond to the Russian threat. The people of Ukraine fight for their nation’s existence. What the US, Europe and the UK choose to do to support them could shape the course of history."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-302-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-22T16:06:36Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 302 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-302-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-302-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 302 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has travelled to the US in his first foreign visit since Russia’s war on Ukraine to secure support for his war effort well into next year. Joe Biden told Zelenskiy that “it’s an honour to be by your side” and promised he “will never stand alone” as the US president pledged continued financial, military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine. The two leaders held a joint news conference before heading to Capitol Hill to address a joint session of the US Senate and House of Representatives. In an address to Congress, Zelenskiy said Ukraine “will never surrender” as he reiterated how his country and the US “are allies in this battle”. “Next year will be a turning point, the point when Ukrainian courage and American resolve will guarantee Ukrainian freedom, the freedom of people who stand for their values,” Zelenskiy said. “The Russian tyranny has lost control over us,” he added. “Against all odds and doom and gloom, Ukraine didn’t fall. Ukraine is alive and kicking.” Zelenskiy also sought to persuade Republican lawmakers to continue to fund his country’s defence against Russia. “Your money is not charity. It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way,” he said. The Kremlin said US supplies of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, announced during the visit of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to Washington on Wednesday, would not contribute to settling the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv, and would not prevent Russia from achieving its goals. In a call with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said there had been no signs of readiness for peace talks during Zelenskiy’s visit, and this was evidence the US was fighting a proxy war with Russia “to the last Ukrainian”. Zelenskiy met with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday while returning to Ukraine from the US. Ukraine’s president posted a photo of the meeting on his Telegram and said the pair “summed up the year, which brought historic challenges due to a full-scale war”. The two spoke “for a long time, almost two hours”, according to an aide for President Duda. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has visited army units fighting in Ukraine, state media cited the ministry as saying. Shoigu visited Russian units deployed to the “area of the special military operation”, the state-owned news agency Ria reported, using Moscow’s term for the conflict in Ukraine. It did not specify where the visit took place. Russia’s chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said the frontline in Ukraine was stable. In an end-of-year message delivered to foreign military attaches and published by the defence ministry, Gerasimov said Moscow had concentrated its forces on “completing the liberation” of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. A fire broke out on Russia’s only aircraft carrier on Thursday, Russian state media reported. The Admiral Kuznetsov, a flagship of the Russian navy, suffered a “minor” fire while docked at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in the Arctic port of Murmansk, located in the far north-west of Russia, according to reports by the Russian state-owned Tass and Ria Novosti news agencies. A former Russian deputy prime minister and a pro-Moscow official were injured when Ukrainian forces shelled the eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, Russian news agencies said. Donetsk, controlled by pro-Moscow troops, is in the industrial Donbas region, the centre of recent bitter fighting between Russia and Ukraine. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said that recent military manoeuvres were not aimed at Ukraine and dismissed “conspiracy theories” about deployments of Belarusian armed forces at the border. Speaking at a conference of military leaders marking the end of snap military inspections held this month, Lukashenko also said he could not rule out “aggression” against Belarus on the part of unspecified “neighbours”. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, met officials from Russia’s military and state atomic energy company, Rosatom, to discuss setting up a safe zone around Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s chief, said more negotiations were needed after “another round of necessary discussions”. Rosatom described the talks on measures needed to safeguard the Zaporizhzhia facility and the surrounding region as “substantive, useful and frank”. The Ukrainian ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said the number of children who had been “forcibly deported” to Russia could be in the hundreds of thousands. Authorities had established the identity of more than 13,000 children deported to Russia, Lubinets said, adding that investigators had uncovered a cell inside a “torture chamber” in the recently liberated Kherson where children were allegedly detained and mistreated. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for Europe to reduce its reliance on the US and develop its own defence capabilities while taking a more assertive role within Nato. Speaking to reporters on his return to Paris from a summit in Amman, Jordan, Macron stressed that he doesn’t see his push to develop European defence as an alternative to Nato. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will hold a summit with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy early next year, according to an EU spokesperson. The summit will take place on 3 February but its location has not yet been determined. The White House has pledged a new $1.58bn aid package to Ukraine and will send advanced Patriot missile batteries to the war-torn country, saying the assistance will be vital to stop Russia’s “barbaric” rocket attacks on critical infrastructure. Zelenskiy told a White House news conference that the weapons were “the only way that we can deprive the terrorist state of its main instrument of terror – the possibility to hit our cities, our energy”. In a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned that continued western arms supplies to Ukraine would lead to a “deepening” of the conflict. The US has already supplied $22bn in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February. The Biden administration also unveiled new curbs on technology exports to Russia’s Wagner military group. The group, a private military contractor with close ties to the Kremlin, will now be labelled a military end-user and face tough new curbs on access to technology made anywhere in the world with US equipment. The US under-secretary of commerce for industry and security, Alan Estevez, said the group was “actively committing atrocities and human rights abuses across Ukraine”. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has pledged to give his army anything it asks for, promising no financial limits on what the government would provide in terms of equipment and hardware. Speaking in Moscow after meeting with Russia’s top military officials, Putin said there were no “funding restrictions” for the military. “The country, the government will give everything that the army asks for. Everything.” Putin also gave his backing to a plan by his defence minister to boost the size of the armed forces by more than 30% to 1.5 million combat personnel. Putin also acknowledged that the call-up of 300,000 reservists he ordered in September had not gone smoothly, the latest in a series of recent comments in which he has admitted the challenges his army is facing. “The partial mobilisation that was carried out revealed certain problems, as everyone well knows, which should be promptly addressed,” he said. The call-up drew strong criticism as new recruits were deemed to be physically unfit or too old and lacking basic equipment. The UN will allocate an additional $20m from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund to support more than 300 civil society organisations and volunteer groups. “These groups have always been the backbone of the humanitarian response in Ukraine and even more since the war started in late February,” said Denise Brown, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine. In an overwhelming vote of 93-2, the US Senate confirmed the appointment of Lynne M Tracy as the new US ambassador to Russia on Wednesday. Tracy, a career diplomat of the US foreign service, “will be tasked with standing up to [Vladimir] Putin”, the Associated Press quoted the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, as saying."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/may/24/rishi-sunak-windfall-tax-electricity-generators-oil-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T13:53:47Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak reportedly considering windfall tax on electricity generators","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/rishi-sunak-windfall-tax-electricity-generators-oil-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/24/rishi-sunak-windfall-tax-electricity-generators-oil-gas","fields":{"headline":"Rishi Sunak reportedly considering windfall tax on electricity generators","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Rishi Sunak is reportedly considering imposing a wider windfall tax on electricity generators, as well as on oil and gas producers, that could bring in billions of pounds to help households struggling with soaring food and energy costs. The chancellor has instructed Treasury officials to work on plans for a potential tax on more than £10bn of excess profits made by electricity generators, including renewable energy operators such as windfarms, according to sources cited by the Financial Times. That would go far beyond Labour’s plan for a one-off levy applied only to North Sea oil and gas producers, which would raise an estimated £2bn. Profits on these firms are taxed at 30% corporation tax plus a 10% surcharge, but Labour has proposed raising the combined rate from 40% to 50%. Oil and gas producers have benefited from rocketing global energy prices amid Russia’s war in Ukraine. Higher gas prices have pushed up wholesale prices across the electricity market, including for some producers of renewable and nuclear power. Shares in the biggest electricity generators fell sharply on Tuesday. Drax, which owns a large power station near Selby in North Yorkshire, tumbled 14%, while British Gas owner Centrica fell 8% and SSE 7%. Government estimates suggest electricity producers could have made more than £10bn in excess profits as a result of higher gas prices, the FT reported. The chancellor appears to have shifted his position after initially opposing a windfall tax. He said earlier this month that he was “pragmatic”, saying “no options are off the table” if oil and gas companies did not raise investment in the UK economy. However, Royal London Asset Management, a big UK fund manager, raised concerns about a windfall tax on electricity generators, including renewable energy developers. Mike Fox, the head of sustainable investments, said: “The social consequences of higher energy prices cannot and should not be ignored. However, levying additional taxes on businesses directly investing in renewable generation feels contradictory to the UK’s desire for greater energy independence and a greener power system that can help to deliver a net zero economy. “The government has other tools which it could use to both raise funds to help tackle the cost of living crisis and encourage greater investment in the UK’s green economy, such as encouraging the crown estate to unlock more seabed for offshore wind.” The Investec analyst Martin Young was also sceptical about the idea. He said: “A windfall tax on generation could possibly jeopardise much-needed investment, and could see higher returns demanded [by electricity generators].” He noted there were huge investment needs in electricity generation such as offshore wind, nuclear and hydrogen storage. “Longer term, neither would be good for the consumer or the net zero pathway. Cost of energy crisis? Yes. Insufficient action so far by government? Yes. A windfall tax on generators the right answer? No. Be careful what you wish for. The spectre of intervention, however, could weigh on the generators.” The Bernstein analyst Deepa Venkateswaran was sceptical about the £10bn excess profit figure. She said: “We believe that the Treasury has grossly overstated the potential take from a windfall tax on renewable generators and shaken investor confidence in the sector, as can be seen from the share price reaction today, which we believe is an overreaction.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/21/further-russia-sanctions-eu-ukraine-poland-russia-eu-baltic-states-poland","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-21T16:27:16Z","webTitle":"After eight rounds, is there space for further EU sanctions on Russia?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/21/further-russia-sanctions-eu-ukraine-poland-russia-eu-baltic-states-poland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/21/further-russia-sanctions-eu-ukraine-poland-russia-eu-baltic-states-poland","fields":{"headline":"After eight rounds, is there space for further EU sanctions on Russia?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Since Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, Russia has been subjected to the heaviest sanctions of any country in the world. A fossil fuel superpower, Russia is no longer able to export coal to the European Union and will soon lose 90% of its oil sales to the bloc. In the other direction, the EU has banned the export of hundreds of goods to Russia, from hi-tech military kit and semiconductors that could aid Russia’s military, to makeup, handbags and clothes that may turn a handsome profit for Russian entrepreneurs. EU asset freezes and travel bans have been imposed on 1,239 individuals and 116 companies. The list includes Putin, his most powerful acolytes and cheerleaders in state-controlled media, oligarchs and generals, as well as some of Russia’s largest banks and arms manufacturers. But after eight rounds of EU sanctions, the appetite for further measures is diminishing. “Member states are working on additional possible measures, but we need to see the scope, because we have adopted so much so far that the space is rather limited,” a senior EU official said. “That’s a matter of fact.” Ukraine’s most vocal supporters in the EU think the bloc could go further. “Our sanctions are working, but our sanctions unfortunately did not bring so far the result we expected,” Lithuania’s president, Gitanas Nausėda, told reporters as he arrived at an EU summit on Thursday. “I think we have very big potential to improve our sanctions and to tighten them.” The Baltic states and Poland have a long shopping list: a ban on liquified petroleum gas, which is used for heating and fuel, as well as ending cooperation with Russia on nuclear power. They also want to close loopholes in earlier sanctions by banning civilian drones, smartphones and speeding up an end to trade in certain metals. It seems no stone is left unturned: the group wants to ban the sale of specialist wine fridges, a luxury missed off earlier lists. Denmark, Sweden and Finland are broadly supportive of the ideas, but a host of western European states, Germany, France and Belgium, are seen as cautious of new sanctions. Berlin argues there is little left to impose sanctions on, although German officials say they are not opposed to further measures. One diplomat suggested some proposed sanctions risked hurting Europe more than Russia: “If we harm our own economies, and the extreme right and the extreme left, the pro-Putin forces, get into power, then Putin wins.” Even some sanction hawks say the easy things have been done, while suggesting further steps would be symbolic, rather than a major strike against the Russian economy. The EU is also increasingly focused on countries helping Russia’s war effort. This week the bloc imposed sanctions on three senior Iranian commanders and the company that develops the so-called “kamikaze drones” that have been used by Russia to attack Ukraine. For many insiders this was only the beginning. “It’s an important step in order to send a political message to Iran, but also to other malign actors that would be thinking of aiding Russia’s war effort,” a second EU diplomat said, adding that further sanctions were needed to “cripple Iran’s production capacity”. The EU is also preparing tougher sanctions against Belarus, in case Alexander Lukashenko formally enters the war against Ukraine. Speaking on Friday, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU was very concerned about “circumventions via third countries” and could now place sanctions on individuals who help Moscow evade the restrictions. “And this is a very strong deterrent,” she added. One sore point for sanction hawks is Russian diamonds, which have been repeatedly exempt, meaning the gems can continue to be bought by Antwerp dealers. Before the invasion, Belgium was the top destination for Russian diamond imports, buying €1.8bn (£1.6bn) of them. Some European diplomats are scathing about what they see as Belgian lobbying to protect a special interest, when every member state has been asked to make sacrifices. Belgium’s government says the trade is winding down and insists it has never blocked a ban on Russian diamonds. The dispute briefly burst into the open last month, when a draft sanctions list included Russia’s state-owned diamond company, Alrosa, which was included because EU officials said it was supporting the Russian navy. Yet after backroom dealing, the company dropped off the list. Much noisier opposition to sanctions comes from Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, who has criticised “Brussels sanctions”, as “primitive” and claimed they are “destroying the economies of Europe and Hungary”. Diplomats point out that the Hungarian prime minister has agreed to every round of sanctions against Russia, which included exemptions for Hungary. Orbán sounds less confrontational in Brussels than he is talking to his voters in Hungary, say diplomatic sources. Nonetheless, even sanction hawks say he has to be taken into account and stress they will only support sanctions that preserve EU unity. The desire to maintain unity may help explain why rising imports of Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) have gone under the radar. As Russia’s pipeline gas exports to the EU have plunged, several member states have quietly been increasing their imports of Russian LNG. Before the war, Russia was the world’s fourth-largest supplier of LNG and this year 78% of Russian LNG was bought by countries that had sanctioned Russia, according to Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. France, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands have all increased their LNG imports in 2022, while Italy and Portugal have occasionally imported the gas, according to Columbia. Maria Pastukhova at the E3G thinktank in Berlin said Russia remained a “very minor actor” on LNG compared with pipeline gas. She suggested the reason this trade had escaped attention was because Russia’s largest LNG producer was a private company, Novatek, which paid relatively little taxes in Russia, so could not be seen as fuelling the Kremlin’s war effort. But that is changing: from 2023, tax on LNG projects will increase to 32%, whereas previously Novatek has paid 13% taxes, according to Russian media. As the EU wrangles over how to cope with an energy shock that has sent consumer bills soaring, even staunchest supporters of sanctions are not proposing to ban Russian LNG. “It would be very difficult to find a compromise on this,” another EU diplomat said. • This article was amended on 24 October 2022. Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy found that France, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands all increased their imports of Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) in 2022, not increased their LNG exports as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/04/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-223-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-04T14:05:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 223 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/04/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-223-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/04/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-223-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 223 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The upper house of Russia’s parliament has voted to approve the incorporation of four occupied Ukrainian regions into Russia, as Moscow sets about formally annexing territory it seized from Kyiv since staging its latest invasion of Ukraine in February. In a session on Tuesday, the Federation Council unanimously ratified legislation to annex the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, following a similar vote in the state Duma, Russia’s lower house, yesterday. No lawmakers in the lower house voted against the bill either. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has signed a decree formally declaring the prospect of any Ukrainian talks with Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin “impossible”. The decree formalised comments made by Zelenskiy on Friday after the Russian president proclaimed the four occupied regions of Ukraine were to become part of Russia. Russia, however, no longer has full control of any of the four provinces it claims to annex, after Ukrainian troops reportedly advanced dozens of kilometres in Kherson province. The Russian military has acknowledged that Kyiv’s forces had broken through in the Kherson region. It said the Ukrainian army and its “superior tank units” had managed to “penetrate the depths of our defence” around the villages of Zoltaya Balka and Alexsandrovka. On Monday, Putin’s spokesperson said the Kremlin would consult with residents of the areas it has “annexed” to determine where the borders should be, suggesting Russia does not know where its new self-declared international borders are. Putin has vowed to protect Russia’s newly claimed territories using “all means at its disposal”, indicating a potential nuclear strike. The lack of a clear red line may undermine his attempts at using nuclear deterrence to halt Ukraine’s successful counteroffensive and western support for Kyiv. Ukraine has “fully cleared” Russian forces from the key eastern city of Lyman, Zelenskiy confirmed on Monday, a day after Moscow admitted its troops had pulled out after they were encircled. Russia’s retreat from Lyman has sparked vociferous criticism of the handling of the war on Russian state television. Vladimir Solovyov, host of a primetime talkshow on state TV channel Russia 1 and one of the Kremlin’s biggest cheerleaders, said on air on Sunday. “We need to pull it together, make unpopular, but necessary decisions and act.” Lyman’s recapture by Ukrainian troops is Russia’s largest battlefield loss since Ukraine’s lightning counteroffensive in the north-eastern Kharkiv region in September. Russias’s ministry of defence spokesperson, Igor Konashenkov, said Russian troops had occupied what he called a “pre-prepared defensive line”. His comments are an admission that Ukraine’s southern counter-offensive is dramatically gaining pace, two months after it began. Russia is at risk of losing control of the strategic towns critical to retaining the city of Kherson and eventually Crimea, western officials said, but they warned the fighting along the Dnipro River “will not be an easy rush into constrained territory”. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has claimed that in the last 24 hours two people were injured on the territory it occupies, and 13 houses and 12 civil infrastructure were damaged by fire from the Ukrainian armed forces. More than 200,000 people have been called up for military service since Russia announced a “partial mobilisation” two weeks ago, according to the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. A Russian court has fined the streaming service Twitch 4m roubles (£60,000/$68,000) for failing to remove an interview with a Ukrainian political figure. The court said the interview violated Russian laws on the spreading of fake information. North Korea has become the only UN member state apart from Russia to recognise the “results” of the Moscow-backed “referendums” in the occupied areas of Ukraine. Diplomatic relations between Russia and Japan continue to deteriorate. Japanese foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi has ordered a Russian consul in Sapporo to leave Japan by 10 October. European Union finance ministers agreed Tuesday to integrate the EU’s support payments to Ukraine into its 2023 budget to make payments more structured and predictable, European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said. The British government has said it has imposed a travel ban and an asset freeze on Sergei Yeliseyev as part of its broader sanctions against Russia. Ukraine needs to revamp its labour laws and redouble efforts to privatise thousands of companies to repair its economy, its president’s economic adviser has said. Alexander Rodnyansky, an adviser to the president, said the war-torn country needed to speed up efforts to reform industries as it looked to rebuild after Russia’s invasion. Elon Musk has prompted an online row with Zelenskiy after he asked Twitter users to weigh in on his ideas to end Russia’s war. In a tweet, Musk suggested UN-supervised elections in four occupied regions that Moscow has falsely annexed after what it called referendums. Zelenskiy responded with his own poll. “Which @elonmusk do you like more?,” he wrote, offering two responses: one who supports Ukraine, or supports Russia. The Kremlin has praised the Tesla boss, with Kremlin spokesperson Peskov saying “It is very positive that somebody like Elon Musk is looking for a peaceful way out of this situation.” The US will deliver four more of the advanced rocket systems to Ukraine. The High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, known as HIMARS, will be part of a new $625m aid package to be announced on Tuesday, according to US officials. The head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine has been released, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi. Ihor Murashov was detained on Friday by a Russian patrol as he travelled from the Zaporizhzhia plant to the town of Enerhodar, according to the state-owned company in charge of the plant. Russia has put Marina Ovsyannikova, the former state TV editor who interrupted a news broadcast to protest against the Ukraine war, on a wanted list after she reportedly escaped house arrest. The Ukrainian-born Ovsyannikova, 44, gained international attention in March after bursting into a studio of Channel One, her then employer, to denounce the Ukraine war during a live news bulletin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/jul/21/dining-across-the-divide-miles-jasper","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-21T11:30:30Z","webTitle":"Dining across the divide: ‘He supports a new Heathrow runway – we should invest in trains’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/21/dining-across-the-divide-miles-jasper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/21/dining-across-the-divide-miles-jasper","fields":{"headline":"Dining across the divide: ‘He supports a new Heathrow runway – we should invest in trains’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Jasper, 26, London Occupation Architect Voting record Jasper, who was born and brought up in south Wales, describes himself as left-of-centre and has always voted Labour.

And I agreed with him that all the levelling up is focusing on northern England, not Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales. I’m in favour of any measure that will keep the union together. Jasper We both thought austerity was a tragedy. For many people I know, it’s one of the reasons they could never vote Conservative. For afters Miles I’m in favour of putting troops on the ground in Ukraine. It’s not just about Ukraine, it’s about Europe and about Russia’s worldview. It was basically a proxy attack on us, and we should have demonstrated to Putin that we knew that. Jasper I wouldn’t go and fight there. And I don’t think world war three is the best idea. There’s a risk of turning up and then pulling out like in Afghanistan, where it is flooded with weapons from the west and no one takes responsibility. It would be saturating Europe with arms. Takeaways Miles It’s useful to listen to people who can challenge your views and make you think a bit harder. Face-to-face is definitely more intense – you have to be challenging but gentle as well. Jasper My main takeaway was shock about his idea of sending the army into Ukraine. That overshadowed most things for me as I was walking home.

Earthly Order: How Natural Laws Define Human Life is an ambitious effort to bridge the gap between politics and science, drawing on his experience as a National Geographic field explorer who has worked in more than 150 countries. Ali has three passports, having been born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, moved to Pakistan aged nine and lived in Australia for several years. In a phone interview from Delaware, he happily ruffles feathers by defending nuclear power, suggesting that democracies can learn lessons from autocracies and attacking the last sacred space on television: the nature documentary. “Some of these nature biodiversity documentaries can, in fact, create a problem because they lead to niche thinking,” he says. “They are good for some things like biodiversity conservation but they are not making the connections often that you need to do.” Indeed, the 48-year-old revels in complexity and loathes dumbing down – even if it means frustrating literary agents. “When I was writing the book, agents would ask me, ‘What’s your one argument?’ I’d say, ‘You know, I’m writing a book about earth systems, I can’t have one argument. I have to approach the issues with nuance.’ This is the problem we have, unfortunately, in terms of communication of environmental issues.” To illustrate the point, Ali cites predictions that Dubai in the United Arab Emirates will soon be so hot that it will be uninhabitable. “That is such a ludicrous statement from the point of view of looking at how humans have interacted with the environment,” he contends. “Most cities in the western world are uninhabitable in winter without infrastructure, including New York City or London – if you didn’t have heating you wouldn’t be able to survive or you could have a very short existence with hypothermia. “We have developed adaptive mechanisms so to say that Dubai would be uninhabitable in summer without air conditioning makes no sense from the point of view of earth systems. But it makes a good headline because people immediately start panicking and they’re like, ‘Oh my goodness, it’s becoming so bad.’” Humanity will have to adapt, he argues, for example through different types of architecture and more subterranean dwellings. He believes this is the pragmatic way forward in responding to some climate crisis thresholds that are now irreversible – while still aggressively reducing dependence on fossil fuels and refusing to surrender to the worst-case scenario. “If we frame the conversation as, look, this is going to be a future which is not ideal, we wish we had not gone that pathway, we wish we had reduced emissions, but now we need to figure out what’s the best way to adapt to this new future, that would be much more constructive and realistic to work through with some of the people who have been climate deniers. “But it wouldn’t mean complacency. You still need a lot of action around it. That’s where I feel as though we’ve been remiss in attacking this issue.” Ali is among the voices who contend that nuclear power, long anathema to many on the left, deserves a second look. It currently provides about a fifth of electricity in the US, accounting for about half the country’s carbon-free energy, and some companies – including one started by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates – are developing smaller, cheaper reactors that could supplement the grid. But the US has no long-term plan for managing or disposing of radioactive waste that can persist in the environment for thousands of years. Nuclear disasters at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island, Chernobyl in Ukraine and Fukushima in Japan have cast a long shadow. Although countries such as France are sticking with the technology or planning to build more plants, others, including Germany, are phasing out their reactors. Ali argues: “There has been a completely emotional kneejerk response to Fukushima, especially in Germany, which they are realising now was a mistake. If you look at the actual science in terms of the natural order of how energy is extracted from materials, nuclear energy is the most energy-dense resource. “If you look at the data in terms of the the morbidity and mortality of Fukushima, you had not a single person die of radiation exposure; they died of the tsunami. The International Atomic Energy Agency published a report last year which showed that there were no cancer clusters around there either. And yet you had an entire energy policy recrafted. That is why Germany is in this dependency situation.” Indeed, Ali does not believe that western democracies have all the right answers. He suggests that for decades their leaders have been talking about climate in a fashion that is too narrow, failing to join dots in the public imagination. He is donating all royalties from the book to environmental literacy programmes in developing countries. “There was a strategic mistake made in terms of framing it just as climate change. I always like, with my students, to talk about global environmental change. We’re talking about many aspects of the global system which are changing. When people think of climate change, immediately it is just resonating as, ‘Oh, are we getting more heat or cold?’ “That’s not really what’s going on. We’re talking about water scarcity. We’re talking about the ways in which energy is going to be delivered. If we had framed the conversation around global environmental change, it would have been easier to be able to figure out all of these interconnections.” Ali, who has a PhD in environmental planning, continues: “We assume that democratic systems are going to be able to deliver efficient outcomes but the reality is democratic systems are often very short-term-oriented because they are driven by election cycles. “We have the same problem with reference to even business decision making, especially publicly traded companies which are driven by quarterly earnings reports. When you’re talking about long-range impacts, there is definitely a disconnect between both aspects. “We threw the baby out with the bathwater when we started to lobby against planning. ‘Planning’ had these connotations that it was going back to somehow centrally planned economies but you need a certain bureaucracy to continue the planning programmes and we needed to have planning independent of the political apparatus. That’s been another reason why, unfortunately, we have ended up in this current impasse with climate change.” Do autocracies, which Joe Biden warns are locked in a global struggle with democracies, do it better? Ali, whose book draws a contrast between China and India, says: “China is going to have problems in terms of their dependence on coal but there is definitely a much more technically oriented approach to decision making in China. Even if you take out the part about the central planning, the Confucian approach has been much more around let’s bring technocracy to the mix.” Public transport in a classic example, he believes, with China deciding to switch from planes to trains as the dominant mode between major cities and getting it done within a decade. “Here in the US we’re stuck with Amtrak, which they have still not been able to change because there isn’t this sense of let’s work through all of the technical details and make it happen based on those decisions. “That’s also linked to the fact we have a very litigious culture that makes it very challenging to be able to develop new projects. Unfortunately, in current democracies the actual process of getting feedback and stakeholder engagement and litigation becomes an end in itself. There is just no point at which you draw the line and say, OK, now we have to move forward.” This, he continues, is one of the reasons that the outsider businessman Donald Trump was an attractive proposition to millions of frustrated voters in the 2016 presidential election. “People saw that at least there was this willingness to make a decision. Much as I lament many aspects of his policies – building the wall – there was a decision. “In environmental discourse, we often talk about the precautionary principle, that you have to be careful about things, but if you go to the extreme, it becomes paralysis because you can’t make any kind of forward movement. That’s the main problem we have had.” But no, Ali is not calling for dictatorship in America, as he insists: “Democracies can correct that. I don’t see this as being something that only autocracies can do. We just need democracies to be made more efficient and form processes where decisions are based on technical knowledge and, after a certain point, that technical knowledge should trump – for want of a better word – negotiations.” By Ali’s lights, environmental awareness is no longer enough; environmental literacy is critical to the survival of the planet. Or as he puts it: “Depth in understanding of complexity is essential for functional order on Earth.” Earthly Order: How Natural Laws Define Human Life is out on 15 July"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/17/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-16T18:00:01Z","webTitle":"What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week?

Catch up with the must-read news and analysis","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis and opinion. Putin preparing for major new offensive in new year Senior Ukrainian officials say Vladimir Putin is preparing for a major new offensive in the new year, Isobel Koshiw and Peter Beaumont reported, despite a series of humiliating battlefield setbacks for Russia in recent months. In an interview with the Guardian, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said that while Ukraine was now able to successfully defend itself against Russia’s missile attacks targeting key infrastructure, including the energy grid, evidence was emerging that the Kremlin was preparing a broad new offensive. Reznikov’s comments echoed similar remarks made to the Economist this week – including from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the head of the armed forces, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, and the chief of ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskii. The briefings appeared to be part of a broad, coordinated effort to warn against complacency among western allies and highlight the continuing threat Russia poses to Ukraine. Deadlocked enemy forces slog it out in ‘Bakhmut meat grinder’ Ukraine’s current defining battle is taking place in the eastern Donetsk city of Bakhmut. Once home to 72,000, the civilian population has dwindled to 12,000 over the past six months, surviving in basements and supplied by mobile grocery trucks that enter the city when they can. A widespread assessment that Russian forces have until mid-December before the onset of full winter conditions forces a slowing of their efforts has supplied one motive for the sense of urgency, Peter Beaumont writes from the region. A recent assessment for the Institute for the Study of War determined that even if Russia succeeded in a controlled Ukrainian withdrawal from the city, Bakhmut itself offered them little operational benefit. “The costs associated with six months of brutal, grinding and attrition-based combat around Bakhmut far outweigh any operational advantage that the Russians can obtain from taking Bakhmut.” Safety of Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant hangs in balance The Russian shell that struck in the night had taken away the wall of a top-floor apartment, and in its place was just freezing air blowing off the Dnieper River – and a view of Europe’s biggest nuclear power station on the other bank. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant’s silhouette – with its two fat cooling towers and the row of six squat blocks – has become globally familiar since it was dubbed the most dangerous place on Earth: six nuclear reactors on the frontline of a catastrophic war. On a fairly typical night last week, the Russians on the left bank of the river fired 40 shells and rockets into Nikopol, a town on the Ukrainian-held right bank, falling on its rows of krushchevky, five-storey blocks of flats built for factory workers in the 1960s and named after the Soviet leader of the time. After 10 months of war, the blocks are half empty, so there are fewer people to kill. The only reported casualty on this particular night was a 65-year-old man who was taken to hospital, and whose flat now afforded such a comprehensive view of the power plant. By the next morning, the repairs had already begun. Julian Borger had this report. Was the Viktor Bout exchange deal a win for Moscow? The Russian arms dealer is back in Moscow after the prisoner swap for US women’s basketball star Brittney Griner. Kremlin officials say it’s a “capitulation by America” – but others believe Bout is a declining asset. Was the Viktor Bout exchange deal really a win for Moscow? Andrew Roth asked this week. Both Russia and Bout had long denied suspicions that he was an asset for the Russian spy services, and in his first remarks after arriving, Bout seemed to nod and wink at the belief that he held some secret value for the Kremlin. “I don’t think I’m somehow important for Russian politics,” he said, before adding a line now common in Russian war films and military circles: “We don’t abandon our own, right?” Russians connected to the Kremlin have treated the swap as greatly advantageous but analysts gave a more careful evaluation, noting that Bout has already served more than a decade in prison and most of his contacts and knowledge will have withered with time. Putin won’t hold end-of-year press conference Vladimir Putin will not hold a year-end press conference for the first time in at least a decade, Andrew Roth reports, in what Kremlin-watchers view as a break with protocol due to his war in Ukraine. The marathon press conferences are traditionally an occasion for the Russian president to burnish his image, a campy spectacle that allows Putin to play the populist on national television each December. On Monday, the Kremlin announced it would not be holding the press conference this year. There would also be no new year reception at the Kremlin, officials said, possibly a decision influenced by the reluctance to celebrate because Russia’s war in Ukraine has not gone to plan. Putin mentioned a potential settlement to end his war in Ukraine on Friday while still claiming that his “special military operation” was going to plan. “The settlement process as a whole, yes, it will probably be difficult and will take some time. But one way or another, all participants in this process will have to agree with the realities that are taking shape on the ground,” the Russian president said during remarks at a press conference in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. His remarks came just days after he appeared to be girding Russians for a protracted war in Ukraine, saying that his military operation could be a “long-term process”. Crimea is Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s greatest bargaining chip This week, Patrick Wintour took a look at the differing views on how Ukraine might approach the question of Crimea. In a little noticed intervention, the former British prime minister Boris Johnson – seen as a bosom ally of Volodymyr Zelenskiy – made the startling statement that if Russian troops were returned to lands they held inside Ukraine before the 24 February invasion, that would represent a basis for reopening talks between Ukraine and Russia. The statement implies Ukraine would have to accept that the removal of Russian troops from Crimea would not be a precondition for the start of talks. In proposing this, in a piece last week in the Wall Street Journal, Johnson was making an admission made in private by many diplomats that a militarily enforced return of the Crimean peninsula – which was annexed by Russia in 2014 in a move rejected by the UN – to full Ukrainian control is fraught with risk. Historically and ethnically, Crimea is different from the rest of Ukraine, the argument goes. There are also 30,000 Russian forces dug in with little available Ukrainian amphibious access. Crimea’s retention in some form is so precious to Vladimir Putin that if he felt it were slipping from his grasp, some fear he may act on his threat to deploy tactical nuclear weapons – the escalation that terrifies, and holds back, Washington and Europe. Moldovans weigh political future as Ukraine war hits economy Electricity blackouts, stray missiles and 35% inflation: collateral damage from Russia’s war on Ukraine has plunged neighbouring Moldova into a crisis that goes beyond higher energy bills. “I see elderly people crying in front of the shop window. It’s not that they can’t afford salami, they can’t even afford the basics like milk,” Carolina Untilă, who works in a corner shop in the suburbs of the capital, Chișinău, told the Guardian’s Paula Erizanu. Moldova’s dependence on energy imports is driving record inflation. Prices of some products have doubled; in her shop, grocery sales have halved, Untilă says. To alleviate the burden of winter, as the former Soviet republic weans itself off almost total energy reliance on Russia, the government has had to turn to its western partners for emergency financial support. Russia’s state gas company, Gazprom, slashed supplies to Moldova in October, while reliance on Ukrainian electricity interconnectors has made the country an indirect casualty of the violence, as Kyiv stopped exporting electricity to Moldova in October after Russian airstrikes on its critical infrastructure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/01/kwasi-kwartengs-stand-for-green-energy-isnt-everything-but-it-helps","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-01T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"Is the UK government finally seeing sense on renewables?

","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On Monday, as war in Ukraine caused turbulence in the European energy market, and just before the publication of the “bleakest warning yet” from scientists on the climate crisis, the UK’s secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, Kwasi Kwarteng, took to Twitter to set out his case for a clean energy future for the UK. It was a major intervention from the business secretary, at a vital juncture. Kwarteng is joining many of the biggest voices and leading experts in the UK energy industry in arguing for clean energy and rejecting fossil fuels. But this new emphasis from the government will need to be backed up by further policy and action if it is to mean real change. So what should we make of Kwarteng’s statements? The invasion of Ukraine has led to a huge upheaval of the energy markets, as the International Energy Agency chief Fatih Birol predicted. Gas prices in Europe were already soaring, owing, in part, to Vladimir Putin’s tightening of gas supply to the EU – a move that now seems a clear precursor to his invasion aims. Germany has announced a suite of new energy policies alongside its historic foreign policy reversals, and the country’s Green party – in the ruling coalition – is even reconsidering its implacable opposition to nuclear power. EU nations are ramping up their low-carbon energy efforts, and businesses have been affected too: earlier this week BP gave up its stake in Rosneft, and on Monday Shell did the same with Gazprom. In the UK, the war has added impetus to the claims of many Conservative politicians and rightwing commentators, fuelled by soaring gas prices, that the UK must put off the goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions in favour of fostering domestic fossil fuel supplies. Kwarteng’s statements, in response to these issues, acknowledge that North Sea oil and gas are totemic for many opponents of the UK’s net zero plans – the UK’s own fossil fuel resources are seen as a bulwark against energy insecurity and economic threats. However, this overlooks the fact that much of the UK’s production of North Sea oil and gas is sold overseas to the highest bidder – in fact, the amount exported doubled late last year. The UK has no gas supply issues, but what Kwarteng carefully leaves out is that the UK certainly does have a gas storage issue. The Conservative government decided in 2017 to allow the closure of major gas storage facilities, meaning that the UK now has puny storage capacity compared with EU countries such as Germany and the Netherlands. Being unable to store large quantities of gas makes the UK more dependent on imports and vulnerable to price shocks, like the current one. Kwarteng is absolutely right – but why then is he planning a big expansion of exploration in the North Sea? The Committee on Climate Change found last week that granting new licences to explore for oil and gas in the North Sea would do nothing to alleviate high prices, as those new fields would take decades to come into production. But although the CCC clearly “favoured” a moratorium on new licences, the government’s response made clear it was minded to press ahead with them anyway. Again, Kwarteng is right – those calling for a return to fracking as the answer to the UK’s energy problems are deluded. Fracking failed because the industrialisation of densely populated countryside for meagre returns was always a doubtful business in the UK. But it’s notable that Kwarteng, one of the authors of Britannia Unchained, chooses an entirely different argument to slap down the frackers – the fact that any gas produced would not reduce the market price. The UK led the dash for gas, and away from coal, in the 1990s, which is the main reason why UK greenhouse gas emissions have fallen further and faster than many comparable developed countries over that time. But gas cannot be the long-term answer if we are to tackle the climate crisis. However, as the energy commentator Michael Liebreich also pointed out on Twitter on Monday, moving away from gas needs to be planned and carefully executed – otherwise, consumers will face price shocks. The UK could have ramped up renewable energy much sooner, but chose to rely on North Sea fossil fuels for much longer than necessary. Why does nuclear come first? Building new nuclear power stations will take even longer than new North Sea oil and gas fields, or new fracking wells. The only new nuclear power station currently being built in the UK, at Hinkley Point C in Somerset by French energy giant EDF, has taken the best part of two decades to move from planning to construction and is still years away from producing electricity. Financial backing for new nuclear is also in serious doubt, as critics say it is likely to be the most expensive form of generation. Again, Kwarteng is absolutely right: renewables are cheaper than gas. Onshore wind is one of the cheapest forms of renewable energy. Why then has the UK made onshore windfarms almost impossible to build in England? Solar prices have also plummeted. So why has the government failed to mandate solar panels on new housing, and reduced the incentives available for households to install them? The case for energy efficiency is abundantly clear. The UK has the leakiest housing stock in Europe, so insulation will cut energy bills, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make people healthier. But since the scrapping of the ill-administered green homes grant last April, households across England have been left without any assistance scheme. In fact, apart from the short-lived green homes grant scheme, there has been no nationwide insulation programme for the last seven years, and meanwhile more than 1m new homes have been built to high-carbon standards, and will have to be retrofitted. Ed Matthew, of the thinktank E3G, says: “The business secretary is right to flag that energy efficiency investment is the best way to bring down energy bills. There is potential to cut UK home energy use in half with energy efficiency. “But the £6bn the government has committed is only half of the investment needed to get on track to net zero and reach the target to end fuel poverty by 2030. The Ukraine crisis is a reminder of the price we pay due to our addiction to gas. “For energy security, for net zero, for energy bills, the solution is the same – we need a bold new infrastructure programme to insulate every UK home within a decade and massively accelerate the switch to electrified heat. There is no greater patriotic mission.” Jan Rosenow, director at the Regulatory Assistance Project, applauds Kwarteng’s intentions but says that the UK is coming at this from a slow start. “The government rightly identifies an expansion of renewables and home energy efficiency upgrades as important levers to move away from imported fossil gas,” he says. “Whilst on renewable energy the UK has achieved a lot and recent announcements of annual auctions are welcome, on energy efficiency the UK is trailing far behind its European neighbours. A well-funded, long-term energy efficiency programme is still nonexistent and this needs to change.” Nothing that Kwarteng says in this thread represents a departure in government policy. What’s important is that he has chosen to say it, at this time and in this way. He is not alone: Alok Sharma, the cabinet minister who presided over the Cop26 climate summit last year, has repeatedly called for more climate action. Other Conservatives are also joining the fray: Samuel Hall of the Conservative Environment Network told Darren Grimes on GB News on Monday that renewables would work better than fracking in bringing bills down. These interventions have come amid renewed concern over the UK’s energy future, sparked by the war in Ukraine. They also come as a belated riposte to attempts by the right wing of the Tory party to turn net zero into a culture war. For months now, almost as soon as the last delegate departed from Cop26 in Glasgow last November, the UK’s right-leaning press has been full of attacks on the government’s climate policy by the opponents of net zero. The wounding of Boris Johnson in the partygate scandals gave rightwing Conservatives and commentators the opening they needed, as the “green agenda” has long been closely identified with the prime minister. Soaring energy prices fanned the flames. For Kwarteng now to take such a public stand in favour of green energy, slapping down fracking enthusiasts and deflating claims for North Sea gas, marks a significant ramping up of green rhetoric. Perhaps the fightback starts here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/05/charity-linked-to-uk-anti-onshore-wind-campaigns-active-again-renewable-energy-foundation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-05T13:39:56Z","webTitle":"Charity linked to UK anti-onshore wind campaigns active again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/05/charity-linked-to-uk-anti-onshore-wind-campaigns-active-again-renewable-energy-foundation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/apr/05/charity-linked-to-uk-anti-onshore-wind-campaigns-active-again-renewable-energy-foundation","fields":{"headline":"Charity linked to UK anti-onshore wind campaigns active again","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"While the name of the Renewable Energy Foundation (REF) suggests it is a charity dedicated to promoting low-carbon electricity, it appears to spend most of its time campaigning against onshore wind. When it was founded in 2004, with the TV personality Noel Edmonds as its chair, the organisation was clear it wanted to fight against the “grotesque political push” for onshore renewable energy in the UK. It styles itself on its website as “a registered charity promoting sustainable development for the benefit of the public by means of energy conservation and the use of renewable energy”. However, many in the energy sector believe the charity to be full of anti-wind lobbyists. As onshore wind expanded at the beginning of the century, many people felt affronted by what they saw as “eyesores”. It was something many grassroots Conservative party members were angry about, and articles in the Daily Mail and Telegraph frequently complained about a “plague” of windfarms. Some conservationists prefer other forms of renewable energy to onshore wind, which is feared to deplete biodiversity in some areas. The REF was on hand to help with the campaign against onshore renewables, providing research and quotes to the rightwing press. But at the time, others, including the Guardian, questioned the motives of this group. In 2008, the REF had what it described as a “dialogue” with the Charity Commission over whether it was violating its charitable status by being too political in its campaigning. The Charity Commission said it assessed the complaint relating to the REF’s campaigning activities and determined there was no evidence that it was not charitable, but also provided guidance about how to achieve its objectives as an organisation. The REF has strong links to a group accused of climate science scepticism, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, started by the former chancellor Nigel Lawson, who has denied global heating is a problem. Prof Michael Kelly, a trustee of the REF also has a position on the board of the GWPF. John Constable, an adviser to the GWPF, has been quoted as an REF spokesperson and was previously its director of policy and research. Constable answered the Guardian’s questions for this article on behalf of the REF. Since the first onshore wind farm was built in Cornwall in 1991, local groups have formed to fight against the construction of turbines in their area. By 2004, when the REF formed, there were many of these groups. Articles based on the REF’s findings appeared in rightwing papers, helping to sway public opinion against renewable energy. MPs also used briefings from the REF to lobby the government. This seemed to bear fruit. Although in 2011, what was then the Department of Energy and Climate Change said there was a need for onshore wind and that it was a cheap and effective source of renewable energy, the then prime minister David Cameron began to listen to his backbenchers about their distaste for it. In 2015, he said he wanted to rid the countryside of the “unsightly” structures. He did just that. Onshore wind was officially blocked from bidding for financial support available to other forms of renewable energy in 2016, leading to a 94% decline in the number of new projects. It has become very difficult to secure planning permission for renewables, with figures from RenewableUK showing that there are approximately 7,000MW worth of onshore schemes waiting for planning permission. While the REF has been relatively quiet in recent years, growing pressure on the government to support wind energy to help solve the energy crisis seems to have led to it becoming more active again. In recent weeks, the charity has provided anti-onshore wind research to the Telegraph and Daily Mail. Colin Davie, a trustee of the REF, has appeared on Radio 4’s Today programme to oppose onshore wind. Opposition to wind energy has been building in parliament, too. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, last week emphasised that he supported offshore wind, and made no mention of onshore. He is understood to believe that the renewable energy source is unpopular among Conservative MPs. Government sources have briefed that he would prefer to press on with a nuclear energy scheme, aiming for a quarter of the UK’s energy to be supplied by nuclear by 2050. This seems to be out of tune with the public’s thinking. Recent polling for Politico found that 72% of people would support new windfarms in their local area, 52% more permits for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea, and just 38% nuclear power stations in their area. Constable, on behalf of the REF, said: “Our data is often used in planning debates, but we neither make planning applications nor create local opposition groups, so cannot be said to ‘start’ such discussions.” Some Conservative MPs have supported expanding onshore wind. The Thirsk and Malton MP, Kevin Hollinrake, said that now was “the right time” to develop onshore energy “where there is local support”. He continued: “I welcome the government’s decision to hold a new auction for onshore wind and solar. Public opinion has shifted decisively in favour of renewable energy in recent years, with CEN [Conservative Environment Network] polling showing that 74% of Conservative voters back onshore wind.” Environmental campaigners have also been pushing for onshore wind expansion. A Greenpeace UK spokesperson said: “It’s a no-brainer that we should build more onshore wind. It’s the country’s cheapest energy source, one of the quickest to get up and running, and is supported by 80% of the public. Boris Johnson himself has had to rethink his former opposition to wind power and is now considering speeding up the deployment of onshore turbines. With huge public concern about our dependence on fossil fuel imports and skyrocketing bills, any politician actively campaigning against the UK’s cheapest source of homegrown energy has some serious explaining to do to their constituents.” But onshore wind expansion will be unpopular with many Conservatives, including those in the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, which says it accepts the fundamental facts of the climate emergency and the need to reduce emissions, but has been campaigning for more oil exploration, nuclear power and fracking as well as arguing against green subsidies and expansion of renewables. Constable added that the REF had “no blanket policy” on renewables – but that the charity did not see them as a large part of the net zero strategy. He added: “Each proposal must be judged on its own merits, and providing that local environmental concerns offer no obstacle, niche applications may be suitable, as they may be for all renewables.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/26/first-edition-putin-russia-wagner-civil-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-26T05:34:05Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: How Russia pulled back from the brink of civil war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/26/first-edition-putin-russia-wagner-civil-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/26/first-edition-putin-russia-wagner-civil-war","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: How Russia pulled back from the brink of civil war","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning. Months of simmering tension between the Russian military and the Wagner group, a Russian mercenary organisation, came to the boil over the weekend after the group’s leader, hitherto Vladimir Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin, claimed to have seized control of all military sites in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don. Since the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine, the Wagner group has fought alongside the Russian military, with thousands of Wagner troops estimated to have been deployed. Their tactics are brutal and violent. The group, which describes itself as a “private military company”, has been around since 2014 and has intervened in conflicts across Africa and the Middle East. But on Friday, Prigozhin broke ranks accusing the Russian military leadership of starving his troops of ammunition in an expletive-laden video. He accused Russian military leaders of targeting his forces and killing his fighters in a rocket attack, and accused the Kremlin of lying to the public about its justifications for invading Ukraine. The hours that followed were filled with chaos. As Wagner forces marched on Moscow, Putin vowed vengeance on Russian state TV. Prigozhin called his rebellion a “march for freedom” and the world watched closely as a nuclear power teetered on the edge of civil war, before pulling back from the brink. Today’s newsletter is a roundup of the weekend’s astonishing events. That’s right after the headlines. Five big stories NHS | Britons die sooner from cancer and heart disease than people in many other rich countries, partly because of the NHS’s lack of beds, staff and scanners, a study has found. The UK “underperforms significantly”, in part because the NHS has been weakened by years of underinvestment, according to the King’s Fund health thinktank. Strikes | The government is prepared to overrule and block the pay rises that public sector review bodies recommend, a senior minister has confirmed, as unions threaten to strike over the issue. Tax | More than 180,000 people on low incomes were fined for not filing a tax return on time last year, even though they received so little that they had no tax to pay in the first place. Many of these people, already in severe financial difficulties, misunderstood the initial fine and were then subjected to further fines and interest. Greece | The New Democracy Party has won a comfortable victory in Greece’s second election in five weeks. The centre-right party won 40.5% of the vote, giving them an outright majority and their leader, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, a second four-year term in office. UK news | The musicians Fatboy Slim, Billy Bragg, and Olugbenga Adelekan of Metronomy – in a letter to home secretary Suella Braverman – have called for the government to allow the resumption of tests of confiscated pills at music festivals. A cross-party group of MPs have condemned the Home Office’s decision to block onsite drug testing as “shortsighted and dangerous”. In depth: Why ‘Putin’s chef’ turned on Moscow Yevgeny Prigozhin’s fleeting attempt at revolution may not have succeeded but it does suggest that Putin may not have as strong a grip on power as he would like the world to believe. The US has said that the events show that there are real cracks in Russia’s government – and it’s hard to disagree when a key arm of Moscow’s military power seems to have gone rogue. It is unlikely that this is the last we will hear of the feud between the “maverick warlord” and the Russian president, Andrew Roth writes in his analysis. But before we look ahead, let’s parse what exactly went on in the past 72 hours. *** What happened? The escalation in the conflict between Russia’s military and paramilitary forces marks the most significant challenge to Vladimir Putin’s hold on power since he became president in 1999. Prigozhin’s open revolt against Russia’s military leadership began on Saturday morning when Wagner soldiers crossed from occupied eastern Ukraine into Rostov-on-Don, a big city in the country’s south. It is there that the Wagner group’s leader (pictured above) claimed that his fighters were in control of the city’s military sites. It was particularly difficult to be sure of what was happening because of Prigozhin’s history of making outlandish and often inaccurate claims, writes Jonathan Yerushalmy. Rostov is a tactically significant city for Russia as it houses the command centre for the Russian joint group of forces in Ukraine – any confusion or disorder there could impact important aspects of the war effort. The mercenary group’s leader said that they would blockade Rostov until he could speak to Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and the chief of the Russian General Staff, Valery Gerasimov – his rivals in Russia’s military leadership. And that wasn’t all. Prigozhin’s armoured convoy set out for Moscow, seemingly without opposition from the Russian state apparatus. Authorities in the capital implemented anti-terror measures. Civilians were told to stay in their houses, work was cancelled, events were called off until July. But then reports suddenly came in that a deal was being brokered by the Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko. As quickly as the mutiny began, it had seemingly ended, as Prigozhin agreed to turn his troops around to avoid the shedding of Russian blood. Under the agreement, Prigozhin was exiled from Russia but he and his fighters would not face charges of treason. While Putin staved off this crisis, it has exposed his waning grip on power, writes Luke Harding, in his snap analysis of the political situation in Russia. The abrupt de-escalation averted the chance of a civil war breaking out in the country. *** Who is Yevgeny Prigozhin and who are the Wagner group Before becoming one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies, Yevgeny Prigozhin spent most of his 20s in prison for a series of violent robberies in 1980. He was released just as the Soviet Union was collapsing and in the following years built a catering empire that started off as a hotdog stand in a flea market. Prigozhin became known as “Putin’s chef” because of his numerous links to the Kremlin, and was renowned for his thuggish behaviour, ruthlessness and violence – a heady mix that created the profile of a man able to found what is now known as the Wagner Mercenary Group. For more information on Prigozhin’s life, read Shaun Walker and Pjotr Sauer’s article on his rise to the top of Russia’s war machine. The paramilitary group, who were designated a transnational criminal organisation by the US in January, has been accused of war crimes, including torture, sexual violence and mass-murder, and are known to have taken part in conflicts in Syria, Libya, Central African Republic and Mali. The group operate with impunity and are unafraid to sustain heavy losses on their own side. *** How did the world respond? The reaction shifted from confusion, to fear, to bewilderment. The official response from most foreign governments has simply been to reiterate that they are closely watching how things shake out. An adviser to the Ukrainian defence minister has been less neutral, describing the revolt as “the most ridiculous attempt at mutiny” ever. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the events showed Russia’s “full-scale weakness,” adding that the longer Russia keeps its troops and mercenaries in Ukraine, “the more chaos, pain and problems it will have for itself later”. Rishi Sunak called an emergency Cobra meeting and urged “all parties to be responsible and to protect civilians”. (Miranda Bryant’s piece lays out the rest of the responses from across Europe and North America.) *** How will this impact Ukraine? It is difficult to be sure what this short-lived rebellion means for the war in Ukraine. On Saturday, Prigozhin insisted that his so-called freedom march would not impede Russia’s war effort at all. News of the mutiny filled Ukrainians with hope that this could be the death knell of Russia’s invasion of their country. But as the hours wore on and the chance of civil war decreased, the dream of an end to war began to look increasingly unlikely. The rebellion will still likely benefit Ukraine even if it’s just in the short term: as Emma Graham-Harrison notes in her analysis: “Focus, weapons and troops were shifted away from the frontlines, as Kyiv [intensified] its counter-offensive.” While the situation in Russia looks like it has now quietened down, with Prigozhin headed to Belarus and the Wagner group back in their assumed positions, things are rarely as they seem in Russia. It may take months for the true fallout of this failed coup to become apparent – in the meantime our reporters on the ground in the region will be on hand to provide all the latest news and analysis.

South Korea said Monday’s tit-for-tat launch off its east coast was a demonstration of Seoul’s “capability and readiness to carry out precision strikes” against the source of North Korea’s missile launches or the command and support centres, the Yonhap news agency cited the South Korean military as saying. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has vowed to take a tougher line against the North and agreed with Joe Biden at a summit in Seoul last month to upgrade joint military drills and their combined deterrence posture, including the deployment of more powerful US weapons. On Monday, Yoon said the North’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes had reached a level where they “threatened regional and world peace”, and promised a “firm and stern response” to any future provocations. The militaries of South Korea and the US fired eight missiles over a period of about 10 minutes starting at 4.45am, Yonhap said. US Forces Korea said in a statement that the exercise had involved one US army missile and seven South Korean army missiles. It said the countries’ alliance “remains committed to peace and prosperity on the Korean peninsula and throughout the Indo-Pacific. The US commitment to the defence of [South Korea] remains ironclad.” North Korea fired eight short-range ballistic missiles towards the sea off its east coast on Sunday, a day after the US aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan concluded a three-day naval exercise with South Korea in the Philippine Sea, apparently their first joint drill involving a carrier since November 2017. The South’s military said it had detected the North firing the missiles over a 35-minute period from at least four different locations, in what appeared to be a single-day record for the regime’s ballistic launches. North Korea, which is several weeks into battling its first known outbreak of Covid-19, has criticised previous joint drills as proof of Washington’s continued “hostile policies” toward Pyongyang, despite its talk of resuming nuclear diplomacy. Pyongyang has not commented on its recent missile tests and appears to be focusing on its Covid-19 response for the domestic audience, but it is continuing to modernise its military, according to Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. While the regime has not yet demonstrated miniaturised nuclear warheads, missiles with multiple warheads, or warhead reentry capability, even launches of short-range missile launches can provide valuable lessons, he said. “Firing many projectiles at once from various locations suggests Pyongyang is practicing to overwhelm South Korea’s missile defences,” Easley said, adding that the US and South Korea had “quickly responded to the Kim regime’s recent missile firings with counter-launches that demonstrate combined readiness for precision strikes against the origin of an attack”. North Korea has conducted a flurry of missile launches this year, from hypersonic weapons to intercontinental ballistic missiles [ICBM], for the first time in nearly five years. Washington and Seoul officials also recently warned that North Korea appeared ready to resume nuclear weapons tests for the first time since 2017, as Kim attempts to push his country’s status as a genuine nuclear power to win economic and security concessions from the US. Last month, North Korea fired three missiles, including one thought to be its largest ICBM, after Biden ended his three-day trip to South Korea, where he and Yoon agreed to new measures to deter the regime. The combined forces of South Korea and the US also fired missiles in response to those tests, which the two allies said violated UN security council resolutions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/13/nationals-leader-says-party-must-rebuild-trust-with-women-but-rejects-quotas","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T06:07:31Z","webTitle":"Nationals leader says party must rebuild trust with women but rejects quotas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/13/nationals-leader-says-party-must-rebuild-trust-with-women-but-rejects-quotas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/13/nationals-leader-says-party-must-rebuild-trust-with-women-but-rejects-quotas","fields":{"headline":"Nationals leader says party must rebuild trust with women but rejects quotas","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The leader of the Nationals, David Littleproud, has said his party will make rebuilding trust with women a top priority, but rejected quotas for his party. “I don’t believe in quotas,” he said. “I believe in creating the environment for women to come forward. “We’ll be looking to identify female candidates in new seats and those seats that we will have retiring members in and we’ll start that process as part of this journey in being open and honest, but we want to be genuine about this.” Littleproud outlined his vision for the Nationals to the party faithful gathered in Canberra for a federal council meeting on Saturday. In the first address of the meeting, the Nationals federal president, Kay Hull, spoke of the importance of women in politics and the contribution they made to key regional industries, including agriculture. “We need to be resetting, ensuring we are embracing particularly the women of our nation,” she said. “And so they are part of our heartland … we stand as one of the few parties that have such a proud track record. “I think there are many areas that we need to embrace and further reset.” Analysis of the Coalition’s election defeat showed women deserted the Liberal party in droves, as a number of women – the teal independents – won city seats from the Liberal party. The independents campaigned strongly on climate change action and integrity. Hull said the Nationals was the most diverse of any political party, and spruiked the lived experience of its members. “They’ve had to make decisions and pay for mistakes out of their own pocket, not out of the taxpayers’ purse,” she said. “They make decisions on good economic basis on what they would do if this was their own business and their own livelihood.” Littleproud said he would take policies representing regional and rural communities to the Albanese government’s national jobs summit next month. “It’s disappointing that regional Australia wasn’t even thought of,” he said. “We were an afterthought, and it’s important regional Australia has a voice there. “We want to prosecute our case with some pragmatic solutions. “The fact that regional Australia wasn’t even invited just goes to show that this stunt was all aimed at just sending the symbolic messages to the electorate.” The federal government will hold its jobs and skills summit in Canberra over the first two days in September. Labor invited the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, to attend, or send a Coalition member in his place, but the Liberal party turned down the offer. At the Nationals meeting on Saturday Littleproud said pensioners and veterans should be able to work more without their payments being affected, as a reward for their service to the nation. “This is a payback to them,” he said. The party will also fight for a visa to fast-track permanent residency for workers in rural and regional communities. “We believe that it needs now to go forward and to incentivise those migrants that come to regional Australia,” Littleproud said. “We need to give them the incentive of becoming residents and citizens of this great country. “This is an opportunity to grow regional Australia to make sure the next generation are out there and taking us to our full potential.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Littleproud said the program of paying university debt of healthcare workers in the regions should be extended to other graduates in areas experiencing skills shortages. Littleproud was elected leader in May, following Labor’s election victory, emerging the winner of a three-way contest with ousted leader Barnaby Joyce and former minister Darren Chester. He has called for the party to “evolve” with the changes in the electorate, but to continue to stand up for rural and regional Australians."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/13/watershed-moment-horror-and-hope-from-inquiry-into-queensland-police","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T20:00:23Z","webTitle":"‘Watershed moment’: horror and hope from inquiry into Queensland police","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/13/watershed-moment-horror-and-hope-from-inquiry-into-queensland-police","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/13/watershed-moment-horror-and-hope-from-inquiry-into-queensland-police","fields":{"headline":"‘Watershed moment’: horror and hope from inquiry into Queensland police","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Of all the shocking allegations heard during five weeks of public hearings by a commission of inquiry, one conversation between two Queensland police officers stood out for Betty Taylor. The alarming allegation was that police did not investigate the suspicious death of a victim as she and her partner were “a pair of scumbags” who lived in a “shit area in a shit house”. The comment, allegedly made by a senior officer to his colleague in 2019, shocked Taylor, who has spent three decades working in the domestic violence sector. As chief executive of the Red Rose Foundation, Taylor says it warrants an independent investigation. “I don’t think that can just stand and not be taken further. We can’t have women being killed and we’re not doing thorough investigations,” Taylor says. “If they start to look at other suspicious deaths, [there are] probably going to be more.” The independent commission of inquiry into the Queensland police service’s responses to domestic violence incidents was recommended by the state’s women’s safety and justice taskforce after submissions from victims outlining alleged police failures. The taskforce said “cultural problems within the QPS persist and appear to be widespread”, despite the “best efforts” of senior leadership and officers trained specifically in domestic violence. For Thelma Schwartz, the principal legal officer of the Queensland Indigenous Family Violence Legal Service, the allegation that a proper investigation wasn’t conducted into a death is feared to be the tip of the iceberg. Schwartz says she’s heard similar claims about a lack of willingness by police to investigate acts of violence. “The commonwealth has just established an inquiry into murdered and missing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women,” she said. “Why have these women just disappeared and there’s been no response?” A QPS spokesperson says the ethical standards command “has commenced internal inquiries into specific allegations raised as part of the inquiry which it had not previously been made aware of”. “A number of matters raised which have been the subject of previous ESC investigations have also been reviewed,” they say. “Officers are rightly expected to meet a high level of service and standard of conduct.” ‘Too ugly to be raped’ The inquiry, which has held five weeks of public hearings, heard from dozens of witnesses including current and former police officers, service providers and advocates. One police officer broke down in tears at the hearings as he described hearing officers referring to domestic violence as “foreplay”, describing rape as “surprise sex” and saying victims were “too ugly to be raped”. Indigenous women are some of the worst affected by police inaction, the inquiry heard, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders regularly misidentified as perpetrators of domestic violence and not considered the “ideal victim”. An internal report by an intelligence officer also found domestic violence deaths were likely in the Torres Strait Islands, with allegations of police inaction even after officers had observed victims’ “bloodied lips, swollen faces” and “black eyes”. The Queensland police union was contacted for comment. Ian Leavers, the president of the union, said in a written submission there was “no widespread culture problem” in how police respond to domestic violence incidents. His submission said that while there are still “unsatisfactory behaviour and attitudes within the service”, this involves a “very small minority of serving police officers”. Leavers said he believed failures are more likely caused by “workload pressures or inadequate training”. Schwartz says the hearings highlight systemic police failures in responding to victims, “irrespective of race, gender or sexuality”. “It does not shock me one single bit what has finally come out of Pandora’s box at all,” she says. “I hope that the general public have seen how widespread this rot is.” Nicole Moulding, the director of the Safe Relationships and Communities Research Group at the University of South Australia, says it’s hard to quantify when an issue becomes widespread. But the evidence brought by experts, as well as submissions to taskforce, shows this is a common problem. “These negative misogynistic attitudes about domestic violence victims also exist in the wider community but it’s totally reasonable to expect more of the police,” Moulding says. Moulding says most victims never report domestic violence to police, so it’s likely police failures may also be going unreported. For officers it’s also daunting to take a stand, Moulding says, as whistleblowers may confront professional blow-back. “There are a lot of officers that are well educated and have a sound understanding of domestic violence but there are also a lot of barriers to police speaking out,” Moulding says. “Police culture historically has been one about supporting your buddies.” The hope for lasting change After decades of “denial” and “deflection” by police, Prof Kerry Carrington, an expert on the policing of domestic violence, says the inquiry has been a “watershed moment” for the state. But she believes the hearings could have “gone further” by compelling several influential police figures to give evidence in person, including the QPS commissioner, Katarina Carroll; the president of the Queensland police union, Ian Leavers; and the police minister, Mark Ryan. “I would have liked to have seen the inquiry ask those in charge what are they gonna do. They’ve heard the evidence. Do they take it on board?” Carrington said. The commission’s final report will be handed down by 4 October. Guardian Australia understands a further hearing is being considered on 18 August, with plans under way to determine the witnesses and location. A QPS spokesperson says all the inquiry’s recommendations will be “thoroughly considered” and police remain “committed to refining and enhancing” responses to domestic violence. Advocates are in firm agreement that any recommendations to come out of the inquiry need to more than a tokenistic or “Band-Aid” approach. As an advocate for specialist domestic violence police stations, Carrington hopes the commission will suggest their introduction following recommendations from coronial inquests into Doreen Langham and Hannah Clarke and her children. Moulding believes police training must be accompanied by “structural changes” such as police hiring more women in positions of power. Taylor hopes for “strong, sustainable” change. “You had to have the inquiry to shine the light,” Taylor says. “Now it’s out there and we need to get on with the reforms.” In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

Here’s where we stand: Britain will send a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine to help push back Russia’s invasion, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has confirmed. Outlining details to the UK’s parliament, Wallace described the military support as “the most significant package of combat power to date to accelerate Ukrainian success”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, thanked Wallace, Rishi Sunak and the people of Britain for the “powerful contribution to our common victory over tyrany”, adding that tanks, APCs and artillery are “exactly what Ukraine needs to restore its territorial integrity”. The Kremlin said the tanks Britain plans to send to Ukraine “will burn”, warning the west that supplying a new round of more advanced weapons to Ukraine would not change the course of the war. The announcement makes the UK the first western power to supply the Ukrainians with main battle tanks, which would be used to help train Ukrainian troops, and will heap further pressure on Germany to approve a wider delivery of the vehicles this week. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, urged Germany to permit the supply of Leopard tanks to Ukraine, adding that the move could unlock support from other nations. Germany should take “decisive actions” and send “all sorts of weapons” to Ukraine to help its troops defend themselves against Russia’s invasion, Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. Morawiecki, speaking in parliament, implicitly criticised the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for his reluctance to supply Kyiv with heavier weaponry. Ukraine expects to receive the first €3bn of an €18bn macro-financial assistance package from the EU this week, its prime minister Denys Shmyhal said. Matti Maasikas, the EU’s top representative to Ukraine, said the package “brings much needed predictability and relief to Ukraine’s state budget”. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and her Dutch counterpart, Wopke Hoekstra, condemned the deportation by Russians of thousands of Ukrainian children. Russia “must account for the whereabouts of these children”, Baerbock said at a joint news conference with Hoekstra, who said this “deliberate Russian policy” is “tearing families apart and traumatising children”. Russia carried out two mass rocket strikes on Ukraine on Saturday, devastating an apartment block in the south-central city of Dnipro, where at least 40 people have died and scores were injured. Dozens are still missing, city official Gennadiy Korban wrote on Telegram on Monday. 75 people were wounded in the strike, including 14 children, he said. The victims from the attack included a 15-year-old girl, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest nightly address. Russia and Belarus began joint air force drills this morning, triggering fears in Kyiv and the west that Moscow could use its ally to launch a new ground offensive in Ukraine. According to a statement published to the Telegram account of the Belarus ministry of defence, units from Russia’s aerospace forces arrived at the airfields of Belarus late on Sunday night. Shortly after 8am local time the ministry said the planned combat training tasks had begun. Russia launched an attack on Ukraine’s south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia overnight, wounding civilians and destroying residential infrastructure, according to regional officials. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the office of the president of Ukraine, said “The occupiers launched a rocket attack on the regional centre. The rocket hit next to a five-story building. Five people, including two children aged nine and 15, were injured by glass fragments. The children were hospitalised.” Ukraine’s forces have “almost certainly” maintained positions in Soledar, north of Bakhmut, according to the UK’s ministry of defence’s latest intelligence update. Over the weekend, intense fighting continued in both the Kremina and Bakhmut sectors of the Donbas front, the ministry added. President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke by phone on Monday where they discussed the conflict in Ukraine, according to readouts of the call from both sides. The pair discussed the question of a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, the Kremlin said, as well as the export of Ukrainian grain from Black Sea ports and ways to unblock fertiliser and food exports from Russia. The UN’s nuclear watchdog is expanding its presence in Ukraine to “help prevent a nuclear accident” during the ongoing conflict, the agency’s head, Rafael Grossi, has said. Grossi is in Ukraine this week to establish the “continuous presence” of nuclear safety and security experts at all the country’s nuclear power facilities, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in its latest update on Ukraine on Friday. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Ukraine could expect more deliveries of heavy weapons from western countries soon. Western allies will consider sending battle tanks to Kyiv ahead of a meeting in Ramstein in Germany on Friday, where governments are expected to announce their latest pledges of military support. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, has announced her resignation following a series of blunders and a growing impression that she has struggled to deal with the challenges of overseeing the country’s military since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Lambrecht’s resignation comes at a crucial moment with Germany expected to deliver battle tanks to Ukraine, in a huge decision for the country as it changes the longstanding direction of its defence policy. A Russian man who reportedly fought for the private mercenary Wagner group has crossed into Norway and requested political asylum, according to Norwegian authorities. Andrey Medvedev, who reportedly served as a high-ranking Wagner group member, has sought shelter in Norway, authorities confirmed to the Associated Press. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has thanked Britain and its prime minister and defence secretary after the announcement that UK will supply 14 Challenger 2 tanks as part of a new military support package for Kyiv. Tanks, APCs and artillery are “exactly what Ukraine needs to restore its territorial integrity”, Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter. The UK will send a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine to help push back Russia’s invasion, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has confirmed. Speaking in the House of Commons, Wallace announced what he described as “the most significant package of combat to date to accelerate Ukrainian success”. The announcement makes the UK the first western power to supply the Ukrainians with main battle tanks, which would be used to help train Ukrainian troops, and will heap further pressure on Germany to approve a wider delivery of the vehicles this week. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has called for the establishment of a special international tribunal to prosecute Russian leaders over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Baerbock and her Dutch counterpart, Wopke Hoekstra, also condemned the deportation by Russians of thousands of Ukrainian children, calling it a deliberate policy of cruel and inhumane abductions that is tearing families apart. A tribunal must be created to “investigate the Russian leadership and put them on trial”, the German minister said in a speech at the Academy of International Law in The Hague, where the international criminal court is based. It could be supplemented with international elements, “at a location outside Ukraine, with financial support from partners and with international prosecutors and judges, so that impartiality and legitimacy are guaranteed”, she continued. Ukraine and the EU have publicly backed the idea of a special tribunal. Russia has denied accusations of war crimes, including the deliberate targeting of Ukrainian civilians. During a news conference later today, Baerbock addressed Ukrainian reports of children being deported to Russia and given up for adoption there. Russia “must account for the whereabouts of these children”, she said. Baerbock added: Their parents, families, caregivers must no longer be in uncertainty and fear. These children have their homes with their families in Ukraine. These children did not leave their homes voluntarily. These children have been abducted. At least 1,000 children were seized from schools and orphanages in the Kherson region during Russia’s eight-month occupation of the area, according to local authorities. Their whereabouts are still unknown. Her Dutch counterpart, also speaking at the press conference, said: This deliberate Russian policy is tearing families apart and traumatising children. It is cruel and it is inhumane. And let me be clear that children abducted by Russia must be returned to their own country as soon as possible. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has urged Germany to permit the supply of Leopard tanks to Ukraine, adding that the move could unlock support from other nations. Berlin is under pressure to approve an increase in international military support for Kyiv by allowing the export of German-made Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine. Germany has resisted the move so far, saying western tanks should only be supplied to Ukraine if there is agreement among Kyiv’s main allies, particularly the US. Speaking in parliament today, Wallace said: It has been reported that obviously Poland is very keen to donate some Leopards, as is Finland. All of this currently relies on the German government’s decisions - not only whether the Germans will supply their own Leopards, but whether or not they’ll give permissions to others. I would urge my German colleagues to do that. Finland’s defence minister, Mikko Savola, said today that Finland’s stance on giving Leopard tanks to Ukraine depends on Germany’s lead, after President Sauli Niinisto said Finland could donate a small number of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine if a wider group of European nations also decided to do so. Savola told Reuters: It depends very much on Germany’s lead how we act with these Leopard tanks. These require a German export permit and in addition to that, the German defence industry has a very strong role in this, in how substitutive equipment can be obtained. On Thursday, Germany’s vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, said Berlin should not stand in the way of countries that want to send Leopards to Ukraine. That would give the green light to countries such as Poland, which has said it wants to take such a step as part of a coalition. Ukraine expects to receive the first €3bn of an €18bn macro-financial assistance package from the EU this week, its prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said. Matti Maasikas, the EU’s top representative to Ukraine, said the package “brings much needed predictability and relief to Ukraine’s state budget”. Britain’s shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said the government’s first package of UK military assistance for 2023 “has Labour’s fullest support”. Ukraine needs more combined military firepower “to break the battlefield deadlock”, Healey said, adding that 2023 would be a “decisive year” in the war in Ukraine. He added: That’s why this first package of UK military assistance for 2023 with tanks, artillery, infantry vehicles, ammunition and missiles has Labour’s fullest support. Challenger 2 is a world-class tank and it can help Ukraine retake lost ground and limit the cost in Ukrainian lives. The death of dozens of Russian soldiers in a new year missile strike on a building in occupied eastern Ukraine has not dented Moscow’s resolve almost a year after it first launched its invasion, according to a report. The strike in Makiivka killed 89 people, Russia’s defence ministry has so far conceded. It is the biggest loss of life from a single attack that Moscow has acknowledged since it began its invasion in February. Yet the strike provoked little more than murmurs of discontent in the region of Samara in southwestern Russia, where many of the dead were from, the Wall Street Journal reports. Few people in the region are openly resisting Russia’s war in Ukraine, which the paper writes “highlights an advantage for the Kremlin as it digs in for a long war”. It says: Mr Putin faces little domestic pressure over its costs, even as the body count rises. His decision to mobilise 300,000 men appears to have shored up Russian lines, which were wobbling late last year after a series of defeats, and allowed them to advance for the first time since July, claiming the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine. Russian state-run polling on the war suggests public support for what Moscow calls its special military operation dropped after President Vladimir Putin ordered a partial mobilisation of troops to fight in Ukraine, before soaring again in November once the mobilisation was declared order. The polling suggests Russians will tolerate another round of mobilisation, according to a former Kremlin official. The UK’s defence ministry has confirmed the announcement by its minister, Ben Wallace, that Britain will send a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine. The Ministry of Defence shared a video of the battle tank “doing what it does best”. The UK’s decision to send Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine is a “calibrated response to Russia’s growing aggression and indiscriminate bombing”, Wallace continues. He says none of the international support for Ukraine is “an attack on Russia, or Nato-orchestrated aggression, let alone a proxy war”. From the outset, President Putin believed his forces would be welcomed with open arms, that Ukrainians wouldn’t fight and that western support would crumble. He has been proved wrong on all counts. Today’s package will help accelerate the conclusion of Putin’s occupation and all its brutality and ensure that in 2023 and beyond, if necessary, Ukraine retains its momentum supported by the international community that is determined more than ever, that Putin’s illegal and unprovoked invasion will fail. Wallace welcomed the decision by the French government to send AMX 10-RC light combat tanks to Ukraine as well as the US’s new weapons package that will include about 50 Bradley fighting vehicles. These contributions are “important in and of themselves” but they represent part of an international effort that “collectively conveys a force multiplier effect”, he said. Wallace says: In December, I told the house that I was developing options to respond to Russia’s continued aggression in a calibrated and determined manner. Today, I can announce the most significant package of combat power to date to accelerate Ukrainian success. This includes a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks with armoured recovery and repair vehicles. We will donate AS-90 guns to Ukraine. This comprises a battery of eight guns of high readiness and two further batteries at varying stages of readiness. Today’s package is an “important increase to Ukrainian capabilities”, he continues. It means they can go from existing to expelling Russian forces from Ukrainian soil. President Putin cannot win, but he’s equally certain he can continue inflicting this wanton violence and human suffering until his forces are ejected from their defensive positions and expelled from the country. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, says it is “notable” that Russia is using forced labour of convicts to manufacture weaponry. Moscow’s appointment of Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff, as its overall commander for the war in Ukraine, in the latest of several major shake-ups of Moscow’s military leadership is a “visible tip of an iceberg of factionalism within the Russian command”, Wallace tells MPs. He says there is no loss of momentum from the international community in its support of Ukraine in 2023, he said. Wallace adds: Quite the opposite. President Putin believed the west would get tired, bored and fragment. Ukraine is continuing to fight. Far from fragmenting, the west is accelerating its efforts. Britain will send a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine to help push back Russia’s invasion, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has confirmed. Speaking in the House of Commons, Wallace said Russia had “singularly failed to break the will of the Ukrainian people” and had “managed to lose significant numbers of generals and commanding officers”. He said: We now would expect a trend back towards a Russian offensive, no matter how much loss of life accompanies it. Ukraine’s allies must “accelerate our collective efforts to dramatically, economically and militarily to keep the pressure” on Vladimir Putin, Wallace said. Announcing what he described as “the most significant package of combat to date to accelerate Ukrainian success”, Wallace said the UK would send a squadron of Challenge 2 tanks with armoured recovery and repair vehicles. The announcement makes the UK the first western power to supply the Ukrainians with main battle tanks, which would be used to help train Ukrainian troops, and will heap further pressure on Germany to approve a wider delivery of the vehicles this week. In a call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Saturday, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, confirmed for the first time that it was Britain’s intention to provide a small number of Challenger 2 tanks to Kyiv. After the phone call, a spokesperson for the prime minister said the offer of Challenger 2 tanks and additional artillery systems was a sign of the UK’s “ambition to intensify our support to Ukraine”. In response, the Kremlin said today that the Challenger 2s “will burn” on the battlefield, and claimed the supplies were an attempt to draw out the conflict. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russia has carried out two mass rocket strikes on Ukraine on Saturday, devastating an apartment block in the south-central city of Dnipro, where at least 40 people have died and scores were injured. Dozens are still missing, city official Gennadiy Korban wrote on Telegram on Monday. 75 people were wounded in the strike, including 14 children, he said. The victims from the attack included a 15-year-old girl, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest nightly address.

Over the weekend, intense fighting continued in both the Kremina and Bakhmut sectors of the Donbas front, the ministry added. President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke by phone on Monday where they discussed the conflict in Ukraine, according to readouts of the call from both sides. The pair discussed the question of a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, the Kremlin said, as well as the export of Ukrainian grain from Black Sea ports and ways to unblock fertiliser and food exports from Russia. The UN’s nuclear watchdog is expanding its presence in Ukraine to “help prevent a nuclear accident” during the ongoing conflict, the agency’s head, Rafael Grossi, has said.

Western allies will consider sending battle tanks to Kyiv ahead of a meeting in Ramstein in Germany on Friday, where governments are expected to announce their latest pledges of military support. The Kremlin said the tanks Britain plans to send to Ukraine “will burn”, warning the west that supplying a new round of more advanced weapons to Ukraine would not change the course of the war. Germany should take “decisive actions” and send “all sorts of weapons” to Ukraine to help its troops defend themselves against Russia’s invasion, Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. Morawiecki, speaking in parliament, implicitly criticised the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for his reluctance to supply Kyiv with heavier weaponry. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, has announced her resignation following a series of blunders and a growing impression that she has struggled to deal with the challenges of overseeing the country’s military since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Lambrecht’s resignation comes at a crucial moment with Germany expected to deliver battle tanks to Ukraine, in a huge decision for the country as it changes the longstanding direction of its defence policy. A Russian man who reportedly fought for the private mercenary Wagner group has crossed into Norway and requested political asylum, according to Norwegian authorities. Andrey Medvedev, who reportedly served as a high-ranking Wagner group member, has sought shelter in Norway, authorities confirmed to the Associated Press. Tanks arguably decided the first world war, after four years of deadlock, and were indispensable throughout the second. Yet after the initial Russian invasion, one of the surprising features of the war in Ukraine is that it has not been a war of dramatic manoeuvre, but rather only modestly changing fronts. However, with the Russians trying to fortify their positions, ahead perhaps of a renewed attack, Kyiv is under pressure to find a breakthrough this spring. With Nato unwilling to help Ukraine with combat air power, the answer, for now, lies in the heavily armoured tank – which finally, the west is prepared to provide. Britain will send a squadron of 14 Challenger 2 tanks and Poland wants to send another 14 German-made Leopard 2s, if Berlin (as is increasingly looking likely) grants permission. It is a start, but well short of a pre-Christmas Ukrainian demand for 300 tanks and at least 600 fighting vehicles (of which about 90 have been pledged). Only tanks have the “protection, mobility and firepower to maintain momentum even once they make contact with enemy forces in strength”, said Nick Reynolds, a land warfare expert at the Rusi thinktank. The question, however, is what number will give Kyiv chance to mount its own offensive. Read the full analysis by Dan Sabbagh here: President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone today where they discussed the conflict in Ukraine, according to both readouts of the call from both sides. The pair discussed the question of a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, the Kremlin said, after talks between Moscow and Kyiv’s human rights commissioners in Turkey last week. Putin “drew attention to the destructive line of the Kyiv regime, which relies on the intensification of hostilities with the support of western sponsors, increasing the volume of transferred weapons and military equipment”, the Kremlin’s readout of the call continued. It said the two leaders also discussed the export of Ukrainian grain from Black Sea ports and ways to unblock fertiliser and food exports from Russia. They also discussed the creation of a gas hub in Turkey, as well as the normalisation of Turkish-Syrian relations, it said. Erdoğan’s office said the Turkish president renewed his offer to help mediate an end to the conflict in Ukraine during the call. A statement read: During the call, President Erdoğan reiterated that Turkey is ready to undertake the task of facilitating and mediating for the establishment of a lasting peace between Russia and Ukraine. The Russian-imposed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, has posted to Telegram to say that in total the air defences of the Crimean city repulsed 10 drones from Ukraine this morning. He told residents: The air defence and the Black Sea Fleet shot down ten out of ten [Ukrainian drones] over the sea. No objects either in the city or in the water area were damaged. Everything is calm in the city. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia claimed to annex Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne has posted to its Telegram news channel to report that its correspondents say explosions have been heard in Kherson. More details soon … A Russian man who reportedly fought for the private mercenary Wagner group has crossed into Norway and requested political asylum, according to Norwegian authorities. Andrey Medvedev, who reportedly served as a high-ranking Wagner group member, has sought shelter in Norway, authorities confirmed to the Associated Press. Police in Arctic Norway said last week that a person had illegally entered from Russia by crossing the border. The man, identified only as a foreigner, was detained by border guards after he reportedly visited a private house in the border area and asked for help. The case was handed to Norwegian immigration police and the man was transferred to Oslo, where he was placed in a centre for violators of migration laws. Police in Norway have declined to comment on the case. The independent Russian news website Meduza writes that Medvedev reportedly served as the commander of the unit that included Yevgeny Nuzhin, a Wagner mercenary who was apparently executed by the group with a sledgehammer in a video that surfaced online in November. The UK’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, writes that he has been hit with sanctions by the Russian government. Cleverly writes on Twitter: I’ve been sanctioned by the Russian government. Good. If this is the price for supporting Ukrainian freedom, then I’m happy to be sanctioned #SlavaUkraini The Shakhtar Donetsk president, Rinat Akhmetov, has donated £20.5m of Mykhaylo Mudryk’s Chelsea transfer fee to the Ukrainian war effort. Chelsea beat Arsenal to the signing of Mudryk on Sunday and paraded him at Stamford Bridge, where they beat Crystal Palace 1-0 in the Premier League. Mudryk, who has agreed an eight-and-a-half-year contract, had a Ukraine flag draped over his shoulders. Chelsea have paid an initial €70m (£62m) for the winger with €30m (£26.5m) to follow in add-ons. The money is a boost to Shakhtar, who have been displaced from their home in Donetsk, but Akhmetov – Ukraine’s richest businessman, according to Forbes – has made clear that without his country’s soldiers there would be no football. As such, he has made the financial gesture, launching the Heart of Azovstal project. Azovstal is Akhmetov’s steel plant in Mariupol, where Ukrainian fighters defied weeks of Russian bombardment before the city fell. Azovstal has become a symbol of bravery, endurance and the indomitable spirit of the Ukrainian people. “I want to thank the entire civilised world for helping Ukraine,” Akhmetov said. We can only talk about Ukrainian football because of the Ukrainian army, the Ukrainian people and the tremendous support we have had during this incredibly difficult time. And the only way we can defeat the evil that has come to our homes is by working together. Read the full story here: The UN’s nuclear watchdog is expanding its presence in Ukraine to “help prevent a nuclear accident” during the ongoing conflict, the agency’s head, Rafael Grossi, has said. Grossi is in Ukraine this week to establish the “continuous presence” of nuclear safety and security experts at all the country’s nuclear power facilities, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in its latest update on Ukraine on Friday. He is expected to travel to south Ukraine and Rivne nuclear power plants (NPPs) as well as to the Chornobyl site to launch the missions consisting of two IAEA experts at each of the facilities. The IAEA already has a permanent presence of up to four experts at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and a two-member team will also be stationed at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear plant in the coming days. In a statement, Grossi said: Soon the IAEA will be permanently present at all of Ukraine’s nuclear power facilities, including Chornobyl. This is an important step in our work to help Ukraine during these immensely difficult and challenging times. Our nuclear safety and security experts will monitor the situation at the plants, assess their equipment and other needs, provide technical support and advice, and report their findings to IAEA headquarters. The Kremlin has denied that Russian missile strikes hit residential buildings in Ukraine, after local officials in Dnipro said at least 40 people were killed in Saturday’s attack on a residential block in the Ukrainian south-central city. During a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: The Russian armed forces do not strike residential buildings or social infrastructure facilities. Attacks are made on military targets, either obvious or disguised. Ukraine’s air force has said the residential block was struck by a Russian Kh-22 missile, which is known to be inaccurate and that Kyiv says it has no way of shooting down. Here are some of the latest images we have received showing the aftermath of Russia’s missile attack on a residential block in Dnipro. Germany should take “decisive actions” and send “all sorts of weapons” to Ukraine to help its troops defend themselves against Russia’s invasion, Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. Morawiecki, speaking in parliament, implicitly criticised the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for his reluctance to supply Kyiv with heavier weaponry. He said: I call for decisive actions by the German government. For all sorts of weapons to be delivered. The battle for freedom and our future is raging as we speak ... Tanks must not be left in storehouses, but placed in their hands. A Swedish prosecutor has said there will be no formal investigation into a demonstration last week in Stockholm in which a puppet of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, was hung from its feet, according to a report. Images of the hanged effigy near the Swedish capital’s city hall were published by a pro-Kurdish group, the Rojava Committee of Sweden, who compared the Turkish leader to Italy’s fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini, who was hung upside down after his execution in the final days of the second world war. Sweden’s prime minister condemned the demonstration and said it was a sabotage of Sweden’s bid to join Nato. Turkey summoned Sweden’s ambassador, Staffan Herrstrom, on Thursday and demanded that those responsible for the demonstration be prosecuted. But a Swedish prosecutor, Lucas Eriksson, told the Aftonbladet newspaper: I received the case as defamation, but did not think it could amount to defamation. Therefore, I decided not to initiate a preliminary investigation. In a historic decision in May, Sweden and Finland announced they wished to join the Nato military alliance, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While 28 out of 30 Nato members have ratified their bids, Hungary and Turkey have not, with the latter likely to prove the biggest hurdle. Ankara has so far refused to ratify the applications unless the two countries do more to clamp down on Kurdish groups it regards as terrorists. The number of people killed in Saturday’s Russian missile attack on a residential block in Ukraine’s south-central city of Dnipro has risen to 40, according to a local official. Dozens are still missing, Gennadiy Korban wrote on Telegram. 75 people were wounded in the strike, including 14 children, he said. The victims from the attack included a 15-year-old girl, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest nightly address. Rescue efforts are still under way. Russia and Belarus have begun joint air force drills this morning, triggering fears in Kyiv and the west that Moscow could use its ally to launch a new ground offensive in Ukraine. According to a statement published to the Telegram account of the Belarus ministry of defence, units from Russia’s aerospace forces arrived at the airfields of Belarus late on Sunday night. Shortly after 8am local time the ministry said the planned combat training tasks had begun. Viacheslav Chaus, the Chernihiv governor, has warned residents that there is likely to be an increase in air raid warnings as a result of the exercises. Belarus has described the drills as purely defensive. The country was used as a base for Russian troops to launch their failed assault on Kyiv in February 2022, Russia launched an attack on Ukraine’s south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia overnight, wounding civilians and destroying residential infrastructure, according to regional officials. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the office of president of Ukraine, said “The occupiers launched a rocket attack on the regional centre. The rocket hit next to a five-story building. Five people, including two children aged nine and 15, were injured by glass fragments. The children were hospitalised.” Air defences in Sevastopol in Crimea have been active against Ukrainian drones, according to the Russian-imposed regional governor in the area which Russia annexed in 2014. As of Sunday, Ukraine’s forces have “almost certainly” maintained positions in Soledar, north of Bakhmut, according to the UK ministry of defence. Over the weekend, intense fighting continued in both the Kremina and Bakhmut sectors of the Donbas front, the ministry added. The number of people killed in a Russian missile attack on a residential block in Dnipro has risen to 37, the state broadcaster Suspilne reported Ukrainian officials had confirmed to it. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Sunday latest address that the victims included a 15-year-old girl. At least 73 people were wounded and 39 people had been rescued as of Sunday afternoon. The city government in Dnipro said 43 people were still reported missing. “The chances of saving people now are minimal,” Dnipro’s mayor, Borys Filatov, told Reuters. I think the number of dead will be in the dozens.” Claiming responsibility for the missile strikes across Ukraine, Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that it achieved its goal. A ministry statement posted on Telegram said: “All designated targets have been hit. The goal of the attack has been achieved.” However, it did not mention the attack on the Dnipro residential building. President Vladimir Putin has told Russian state television that what he calls the “special military operation” in Ukraine has gained positive momentum. “The dynamic is positive,” he told Rossiya 1 state television. “Everything is developing within the framework of the plan of the ministry of defence and the general staff.” German defence minister Christine Lambrecht on Monday announced ger resignation. Her decision to step down comes as Germany is under pressure to approve an increase in international military support for Kyiv, and Germany’s defence capabilities have been called into question after several Puma infantry tanks were put out of service during a recent military drill. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you for the next few hours to continue our live coverage. The Kremlin said on Monday that the tanks Britain plans to send to Ukraine “will burn”, warning the west that supplying a new round of more advanced weapons to Ukraine would not change the course of the war. “They are using [Ukraine] as a tool to achieve their anti-Russian goals,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said when asked about the British tanks, Reuters reports. “These tanks are burning and will burn just like the rest,” Peskov said. Britain said on Saturday it would send 14 of its Challenger 2 main battle tanks as well as other advanced artillery support to Ukraine in the coming weeks. Peskov said the new supplies from countries like Britain and Poland would not change the situation on the ground. The Kremlin spokesperson also, according to Russian-owned news agency RIA, denied that there was any conflict between Russia’s ministry of defence and the Wagner mercenary group. RIA posted to Telegram a report which said: The “conflict” between the ministry of defence and Wagner exists only in the information space, Peskov said. He noted that everyone is doing a common thing – fighting for the motherland. Ukrainian state broadcaster Suspilne has reported on Telegram that the death toll from the weekend’s Dnipro missile attack has risen to 37. It reports that local authorities have confirmed the higher number to it. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, has today resigned, she said in a statement on Monday, the culmination of growing scepticism about her ability to bring the German army into shape against the backdrop of the Ukraine war. Reuters reports Lambrecht, a member of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic party (SPD), said in the statement: “Today I asked the chancellor to dismiss me from the office of federal minister of defence.” Her decision to step down comes as Germany is under pressure to approve an increase in international military support for Kyiv, and Germany’s defence capabilities have been called into question after several Puma infantry tanks were put out of service during a recent military drill. Viacheslav Chaus, the Chernihiv governor, has warned residents that there is likely to be an increase in air raid warnings as a result of the joint air exercises being carried out by Russia and Belarus. In a message posted to Telegram, Chaus said: 125 explosions on the outskirts of six border settlements of Chernihiv region over the past week. The enemy uses mortars, grenade launchers, BM-21 Grad rocket artillery. Important! From 16 January to 1 February, a joint flight and tactical exercise will be held with the aviation units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation. The number of air alarms on the territory of Chernihiv oblast and the country in general may increase significantly. Don’t ignore any threat message. Chernihiv has borders with both Belarus to Russia to the north. Russian news agency Interfax is reporting that air defences in Sevastopol have been active against Ukrainian drones, according to the Russian-imposed regional governor. Interfax reports. “An attack by drones again. Air defence systems shot down a UAV over the sea in the direction of Belbek ,” [Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev] wrote in his telegram channel. Interfax adds the governor also reported one downed drone over the bay. Sevastopol is the largest city in the Crimean peninsula, an area of Ukraine which Russia claimed to annex in 2014. Belbek is an airfield north-west of the city which has previously been a target for Ukraine. In Germany, Die Welt reports that at a demonstration in Berlin on Sunday, the flag of the chiefly unrecognised self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic was seen, a report which is being picked up by Russian state media Tass. Martin Heller writes for Die Welt: The content of a video of the demonstration march in Berlin on Sunday, with which thousands commemorated Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, is now causing a stir. In the video of the demonstration, left-wing demonstrators - white skin, accent-free German and mostly male - chant anti-Western slogans: “Mali, Donbass, Gaza City: finally flatten the West!”. A banner from a “communist organization” carried in front of the group reads: “The main enemy is at home”. At the same event, international observers noticed a flag from the “Donetsk People’s Republic” illegally proclaimed by Russia. This also causes discussions on the internet. Suspilne, the Ukrainian state broadcaster, is reporting that three people were killed in the Kherson region yesterday. In a message posted to Telegram, it stated: On 15 January, the Russian army shelled the territory of the Kherson region 90 times with artillery, anti-aircraft guns, mortars and tanks. Three people died, 14 were injured, said the head of the region Yaroslav Yanushevych. The claims have not been independently verified. Kherson is one of the regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the office of president of Ukraine, has given more details of an attack of Zaporizhzhia in a Telegram post. He writes: The occupiers launched a rocket attack on the regional centre. The rocket hit next to a five-story building. Five people, including 2 children aged 9 and 15, were injured by glass fragments. The children were hospitalised. In the building itself, the windows were broken, the supporting structures were not damaged. He added that in a separate attack: The rocket hit the territory of a business. A fire broke out on the spot. There is no information about the victims. Rescuers are working on the spot. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian state-owned news agency is reporting claims from the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) that in the last week two people died and four were injured by Ukrainian fire into the territory which the LPR occupies and which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Tass also reported the claim that 52 houses and three civil infrastructure facilities were destroyed and damaged, including one educational institution, in the attacks. Tass said that the claims, which have not been independently verified, were reported by a representative of the so-called “Joint centre for control and coordination of issues related to war crimes of Ukraine”. Prior to Russia’s claim to have annexed the Luhansk region, the LPR, which was formed in 2014, was recognised as a legitimate authority by only three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. Reuters reports that a Ukrainian vessel carrying peas was grounded in Istanbul’s Bosphorus strait on Monday, and traffic in the strait was suspended. No damage was reported. The joint coordination centre in Istanbul, which runs the UN-brokered Black Sea grain deal operations, said at the weekend the ship was travelling from Pivdennyi – a commercial seaport in the Ukrainian city of Yuzhne, near Odesa – to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Mersin. Several tugs were among vessels sent to provide assistance to the ship, the coastguard authority said. This is Martin Belam taking over the blog in London. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russia launched an attack on Ukraine’s south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia overnight, wounding civilians and destroying residential infrastructure, according to regional officials. Oleksandr Starukh, the Zaporizhzhia regional state administration head, said Russia launched a rocket attack on the regional centre in a Telegram post at about 1am local time. The enemy launched a rocket attack on the regional centre and suburbs. There is destruction of civil, residential and industrial infrastructure. Information was received about several lightly wounded. All relevant services are on site.” The secretary of the Zaporizhzhia city council, Anatoly Kurtev, confirmed three people were taken to hospital. Russians fired at our city again. As a result of the night attack, people were injured. There are damaged houses. Three people were transported to hospitals. Among them are two children aged nine and 15.” As of Sunday, Ukraine’s forces have “almost certainly” maintained positions in Soledar, north of Bakhmut, according to the UK ministry of defence. Over the weekend, intense fighting continued in both the Kremina and Bakhmut sectors of the Donbas front, the ministry added. “Overall, the UAF continue to gradually advance their front line east on the edge of Kremina town,” the report read. “Over the last six weeks, both Russia and Ukraine have achieved hard-fought but limited gains in different sectors. “In these circumstances, a key operational challenge for both sides is to generate formations of uncommitted, capable troops which can exploit the tactical successes to create operational breakthroughs.” The US military has launched an expanded, more sophisticated training programme of Ukrainian forces that is focused on large-scale combat and designed to bolster Ukraine’s ability to take back territory from Russian forces, the Pentagon’s top general said on Sunday. Gen Mark A. Milley, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said the training had begun on Sunday at the Grafenwoehr training area in Germany and will continue for five or six weeks, according to a Washington Post report. About 500 soldiers will reportedly go through the initial version of training, focused on what the military calls combined-arms warfare, in which tanks, artillery, combat vehicles and other weapons are “layered to maximise the violence they inflict”, according to the Post. We want the Ukrainians to have a capability to successfully defend their country,” Milley said. “Ukraine is doing nothing more than defending itself, and they are trying to liberate Russian-occupied Ukraine.” “It’ll take a bit of time,” Milley added. “Five, six, seven, eight weeks, who knows. We’ll see what happens here. But in terms of the criticality of it, the need is now.” Nato’s secretary general said Ukraine could expect more deliveries of heavy weapons from western countries soon. The recent pledges for heavy warfare equipment are important – and I expect more in the near future,” Jens Stoltenberg told Germany’s Handelsblatt daily on Sunday. Western allies will consider sending battle tanks to Kyiv ahead of a meeting in Ramstein in Germany on Friday, where governments are expected to announce their latest pledges of military support. Zelenskiy has pleaded for more western weaponry, saying that Russian “terror” could be stopped only on the battlefield. Earlier this month, France, Germany and the US respectively promised French AMX-10 RC light tanks, 40 German Marder infantry vehicles, and 50 Bradley fighting vehicles. However, pressure is growing on the allies to go further and agree to delivery of battle tanks. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, pledged on Saturday to provide 14 Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine, making it the first western country to supply the heavy tanks Kyiv has been calling for. Russia’s embassy in Britain warned that “bringing tanks to the conflict zone … will only serve to intensify combat operations, generating more casualties, including among the civilian population”. As Russian and Belarusian forces conduct joint air force drills today in a show of cooperation, it appears to be business as usual for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader earlier told Rossiya 1 state television that what he calls the “special military operation” in Ukraine has gained positive momentum and is going according to plan. The dynamic is positive. Everything is developing within the framework of the plan of the ministry of defence and the general staff.” Putin said he hoped soldiers would deliver more wins after Russia claimed control of the eastern Ukrainian saltmining town of Soledar – a claim disputed by Kyiv. Belarus’s ministry of defence has just issued this statement regarding its joint air force drills with Russia this morning. Today, a joint tactical flight exercise of the aviation units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation, which are part of the aviation component of the regional grouping of troops (forces), has started.” The ministry added that the main goal of the exercise is “to increase operational compatibility in the joint performance of combat training tasks”. Russia and Belarus have begun joint air force drills this morning, triggering fears in Kyiv and the west that Moscow could use its ally to launch a new ground offensive in Ukraine. According to a statement published to the Telegram account of the Belarus ministry of defence, units from Russia’s aerospace forces arrived at the airfields of Belarus late on Sunday night. Shortly after 8am local time the ministry said the planned combat training tasks had begun. A subdivision of the 120th Separate Guards Mechanised Brigade, as part of the coordination of the Belarusian and Russian parts of the regional grouping of forces, began to carry out a number of combat training tasks. After the march to the 227th combined-arms training ground, the military personnel will begin to conduct control classes in combat training subjects.” Minsk earlier said the drills are defensive. However, the ongoing buildup of Russian troops in Belarus, combined with a flurry of military activity in the country, is an echo to what was happening there just before Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine, when Moscow used the country as a springboard to launch the attack. Together with Moscow, Minsk has also been bolstering the drills with weaponry and military equipment. Unofficial Telegram military monitoring channels have been reporting a series of fighters, helicopters and military transport planes coming to Belarus since the start of the year – eight fighters and four cargo planes on Sunday alone. The Belarusian defence ministry said only that “units” of Russia’s air forces have been arriving in Belarus. During the tactical flight exercise, all airfields and training grounds of the Air Force and Air Defence Forces of the Armed Forces of Belarus will be involved,” the ministry said in a statement as cited by Reuters. The situation on Belarus’s southern border – the border with Ukraine – was “not very calm”, and Ukraine has been “provoking” Belarus, said Pavel Muraveyko, first deputy state secretary of the Belarusian security council, according to a post on the Belarusian defence ministry’s Telegram app on Sunday. We’re maintaining restraint and patience, keeping our gunpowder dry,” Muraveyko said. “We have the necessary set of forces and means that will respond to any manifestations of aggression or a terrorist threat on our territory.” Ukraine has continuously warned of possible attacks from Belarus and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week that the country must be ready at its border with Belarus. The Kremlin has denied that it has been pressuring the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, to take a more active role in the conflict in Ukraine. Minsk has said it will not enter the war. A series of haunting images show the aftermath of Sunday’s missile attack on a residential block in Dnipro. The number of people killed in a Russian missile attack on a residential block in Dnipro has risen to 35, according to Ukrainian officials. Dnipro’s regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, confirmed 35 people were killed in the attack in an update shared to Telegram about 8.30am on Monday. The search and rescue operation in Dnipro has been going on for almost 40 hours. At night, rescuers pulled out several more dead from under the rubble of a high-rise building destroyed by a Russian missile. At that time, the enemy attack claimed the lives of 35 residents of the building. Among them are two children. 39 people were saved, 75 were injured. Among the injured are 14 children. The fate of another 35 residents of the building is unknown. The search for people under the rubble continues. Dnipro’s mayor, Borys Filatov, told Reuters: The chances of saving people now are minimal. I think the number of dead will be in the dozens.” Claiming responsibility for the missile strikes across Ukraine, Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that it achieved its goal. A ministry statement posted on Telegram said: “All designated targets have been hit. The goal of the attack has been achieved.” However, it did not mention the attack on the Dnipro residential building. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned the Russian people’s “cowardly silence” over the attack, noting that Ukraine had received messages of sympathy from around the world over “this terror.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. Rescuers continue to comb the rubble of a nine-story apartment building that was destroyed by a Russian strike in Dnipro on Sunday, as the death toll from the attack climbs to 35. Russia and Belarus will begin joint air force drills on Monday, which have triggered fears in Kyiv and the west that Moscow could use its ally to launch a new ground offensive in Ukraine. Minsk says the drills are “purely defensive in nature” though Ukraine has warned of possible attacks from its neighbour to the north. If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: The number of people killed in a Russian missile attack on a residential block in Dnipro has risen to 35, according to Ukrainian officials. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest address that “the list of the dead includes 30 people, including one child – a girl, she was 15 years old”. At least 73 people were wounded and 39 people had been rescued as of Sunday afternoon. The city government in Dnipro said 43 people were still reported missing. “The chances of saving people now are minimal,” Dnipro’s mayor, Borys Filatov, told Reuters. I think the number of dead will be in the dozens.” Claiming responsibility for the missile strikes across Ukraine, Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that it achieved its goal. A ministry statement posted on Telegram said: “All designated targets have been hit.

Battle tanks from German industrial reserves wanted by Ukraine will not be ready to be delivered until 2024. The warning from arms manufacturer Rheinmetall will dampen Kyiv’s hopes that the UK’s promise to deliver Challenger 2 tanks would encourage other European nations to swiftly follow suit. “Even if the decision to send our Leopard tanks to Kyiv came tomorrow, the delivery would take until the start of next year,” Rheinmetall’s chief executive, Armin Papperger, told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. The UK prime minister has confirmed the country will provide 14 of its Challenger 2 main battle tanks and other advanced artillery support to Ukraine in the coming weeks. Downing Street said Rishi Sunak made the pledge during a call on Saturday morning with Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a sign of the UK’s “ambition to intensify our support to Ukraine”. Russia’s embassy in Britain said the move would only “intensify” the conflict. The UK foreign secretary has said “now is the time to accelerate and go further and faster” in giving Ukraine the support it needs. In a column for British tabloid the Sun on Sunday, James Cleverly writes that the Russian army is on the defensive and morale among its troops is pitiful, blaming the “shambolic state of Russian military logistics”. Nato’s secretary general said Ukraine could expect more deliveries of heavy weapons from western countries soon. “The recent pledges for heavy warfare equipment are important – and I expect more in the near future,” Jens Stoltenberg told Germany’s Handelsblatt daily on Sunday. Western allies will consider sending battle tanks to Kyiv ahead of a meeting in Ramstein in Germany next Friday where governments are expected to announce their latest pledges of military support. Belarus’s security council said on Sunday that joint air force drills with Russia, due to start on Monday, were purely defensive in nature and would focus on reconnaissance missions and how to thwart a potential attack. “The exercise is purely defensive in nature,” said Pavel Muraveyko, first deputy state secretary of the Belarusian security council, according to a post on the Belarusian defence ministry’s Telegram app on Sunday. “It will be a set of measures to prepare our and Russian aviation to carry out the relevant combat missions.” For any updates or feedback you wish to share, please feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/10/ftse-100-firms-hand-billions-in-dividend-payouts-to-qatar-investors","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-10T07:00:47Z","webTitle":"FTSE 100 firms hand billions in dividend payouts to Qatar investors ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/10/ftse-100-firms-hand-billions-in-dividend-payouts-to-qatar-investors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/10/ftse-100-firms-hand-billions-in-dividend-payouts-to-qatar-investors","fields":{"headline":"FTSE 100 firms hand billions in dividend payouts to Qatar investors ","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Some of the UK’s largest listed companies including water and energy giants have handed almost £500m to Qatari state-owned investors this year, raising concerns that blue-chip company profits are supporting the controversial World Cup host. The dividend payouts are the result of the Gulf nation’s investments in a raft of FTSE 100 firms, including Barclays, Shell and utility firm Severn Trent, which have reported strong profits amid a cost of living crisis and the worst UK drought in centuries. The figures, compiled by the Guardian, cover funds distributed to Qatari state-owned shareholders in the 10 months leading up to the controversial tournament in November. However, the Qatari state’s income from UK-listed firms is likely to have been in the billions of pounds since it won the rights to host the Fifa World Cup in 2010. The figures will raise concerns over how everyday spending by British consumers, through bank transactions, grocery shopping and air travel, may be inadvertently supporting the Qatari host, which has criminalised homosexuality and been accused of exploiting migrant workers to build World Cup infrastructure. Although the shareholdings of listed companies are publicly available, there is little awareness about the types of investors that hold shares in UK firms. Amnesty International UK’s director of economic affairs, Peter Frankental, said British firms needed to be more upfront about the destination of dividend payouts. “Qatar’s considerable wealth and its extensive portfolio of overseas investments have been accompanied by the systematic exploitation of its vast migrant labour force, many of whom have toiled for years for abusive employers with the connivance of the Qatari authorities,” Frankental said. “UK companies need to be transparent about any human rights abuses that may have occurred in their investor chain, including those originating in Qatar’s notorious construction sites.” Qatar’s $450bn (£389bn) sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), has taken a huge interest in UK-listed investment in recent decades, spending billions to acquire stakes in a raft of British blue-chip firms such as the London Stock Exchange Group and Royal Dutch Shell. UK stocks make up nearly a fifth of the QIA’s equity portfolio at 17%, and are worth a combined $8.8bn. That makes the UK the third-largest destination for the authority’s equity investments, behind Germany which makes up 29% of the portfolio at a value of $15bn, and Qatar where shares make up nearly 19% of the portfolio at $9.6bn. Those UK stakes have meant that the investment authority – and therefore the Qatari state – have benefited from British companies’ profits, which have subsequently been handed to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Guardian analysis of publicly available data shows Qatari vehicles, including QIA, have pocketed around £475m in dividends since January alone, helping support Qatari finances at a time when the state is estimated to have spent about $200bn preparing to host the World Cup. That includes Shell, which handed nearly $17m worth of dividends to Qatar in a year when it reported record profits on the back of surging energy prices linked to the shortages caused by the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the QIA earned £13m through its 4.6% holding in Coventry-based water company Severn Trent, which has come under fire for bumper executive payouts – including £3.9m for its boss Liv Garfield – even though the country suffered under the worst drought conditions in centuries. The QIA also earned £11m from the London Stock Exchange Group, in which the QIA still holds a 7% stake, and further £33m from its shareholding in supermarket chain Sainsbury’s. That is on top of £64m from a 6.3% stake in banking giant Barclays. Its holding in the UK bank is a hangover from its controversial involvement in the bank’s emergency fundraising at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. The funding arrangement helped Barclays avoid a public bailout that would have placed it under government control, but later led the Serious Fraud Office to accuse three former Barclays bankers of funnelling secret fees to Qatar in exchange for the emergency funding. A jury found those executives not guilty in early 2020. The bank itself is now appealing against a regulatory fine over the deal. One of the biggest sources of UK dividend revenue came from UK-listed mining giant Glencore, which paid Qatar Holding – a subsidiary of the QIA – a total of $387m (£347m) since January. The dividends are the result of an 8% stake in the company. While Glencore is headquartered in Switzerland, rather than the UK, most UK pensions will have a stake in the FTSE 100-listed firm, which trades metals used in key technologies such as electric batteries. Glencore became one of the largest commodity companies in the world thanks to a £50bn merger with mining company Xstrata, sealed thanks to late-night talks involving Tony Blair and Qatari billionaire politician Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani. Other dividend payouts came from stakes in Dettol disinfectant and Nurofen maker Reckitt Benckiser, which paid £382,000 to QIA, and private equity group and GKN-owner Melrose Industries, at £14,000. The state-owned Qatar Airways also holds a 25.23% stake in British Airways owner IAG, though the group – which is still recovering from the Covid pandemic – has not yet paid a dividend this year. The QIA, Glencore, Barclays, Severn Trent, and the London Stock Exchange declined to comment. Melrose Industries did not respond to requests for comment. Sainsbury’s said in a statement that it did not choose its shareholders, and that the majority were UK pension funds and private investors including Sainsbury’s staff. Reckitt Benckiser said the company recently strengthened policies meant to prevent modern slavery and had a zero-tolerance policy on human rights abuses. “We have a track record of working throughout our supply chain to strengthen human rights and labour standards, excluding suppliers where our standards are not achieved, and working with suppliers, peers and civil society to enable change at scale.” Shell did not directly comment on the dividend payouts but shared a statement regarding its approach to separate investments in Qatar. “A commitment to worker welfare and respect for people is fundamental to how companies in the Shell group operate globally, including in Qatar.” Those dividends from listed firms are on top of valuable stakes in private British companies including Harrods, Heathrow, The Shard and Starling Bank. In December engine maker Rolls-Royce announced the QIA was spending £85m to take a 10% stake in a UK government-backed project to develop small nuclear power plants, known as Rolls-Royce SMR. QInvest, another investment vehicle of the Qatari royal family, also maintains a 43% stake in stockbroker and investment bank Panmure Gordon, which posted its first profit in three years in 2021. Meanwhile, Farnborough-headquartered arms company BAE Systems announced in March that it had signed an agreement to develop warship support for the Qatar Emiri’s Naval Force. And amid the UK’s energy crisis, Qatar’s participation in the South Hook LNG terminal has come into focus. State-owned Qatar Energy has a 67.5% share in the Pembrokeshire-based terminal. Qatar is one of the UK’s largest sources of liquefied natural gas (LNG), a role that led Boris Johnson to discuss increased supply from the Gulf state in late 2021, as global gas prices soared."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/feb/06/de-ageing-on-screen-ai-artificial-intelligence-film","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-06T15:19:07Z","webTitle":"‘We’re going through a big revolution’: how AI is de-ageing stars on screen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/06/de-ageing-on-screen-ai-artificial-intelligence-film","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/feb/06/de-ageing-on-screen-ai-artificial-intelligence-film","fields":{"headline":"‘We’re going through a big revolution’: how AI is de-ageing stars on screen","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Craggy, grey-haired and 80 years old, Harrison Ford might seem a bit old to don his brown Fedora-style hat or crack his whip as Indiana Jones. But a trailer for his upcoming film Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny offers a flashback to Indy in his swashbuckling glory days. “That is my actual face at that age,” the actor explained on CBS’s The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. “They have this artificial intelligence (AI) programme. It can go through every foot of film that Lucasfilm owns because I did a bunch of movies for them and they have all this footage including film that wasn’t printed: stock. They could mine it from where the light is coming from, the expression. But that’s my actual face. Then I put little dots on my face and I say the words and they make it. It’s fantastic.” Having discovered the secret of eternal youth, Ford joked: “That’s what I see when I look in the mirror now.” He is not the only actor to get a digital facelift with an assist from AI. Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and other cast members will play younger versions of themselves in Here, directed by Robert Zemeckis, thanks to a tool that the AI company Metaphysic says can create “high-resolution photorealistic faceswaps and de-ageing effects on top of actors’ performances live and in real time without the need for further compositing or VFX work”. Metaphysic’s website proclaims: “We are world leaders in creating AI generated content that looks real” and suggests: “Use AI to create your own hyperreal avatar”. The company has just struck a deal with the Creative Artists Agency “to develop generative AI tools and services for talent”, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Just as the buzzy AI chatbot ChatGPT threatens to upend journalism, speechwriting and school essays, so AI could turn digital de-ageing from something that requires many months of highly skilled artists to something that many people can do in their bedrooms. And as the technology becomes ever more sophisticated, there are fears that deepfake technology could fall into the wrong hands and be weaponised. Olcun Tan, a German-born visual effects supervisor based in Los Angeles, reflects: “We’re going through a big revolution. This is like the invention of nuclear power. This is a big deal. It’s underestimated and overlooked. Currently, it feels like, ‘Oh, it’s a toy, it’s awesome, look what it can do,’ but this is just the start of a big change in our economic structure because it will do a lot more than normal humans can do.” De-ageing has met mixed results so far. Examples include Brad Pitt in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Jeff Bridges in Tron: Legacy, Robert Downey Jr in Captain America: Civil War, Michael Douglas in Ant Man, Kurt Russell in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, Will Smith in Gemini Man and Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill in various instalments of Star Wars. One of the more impressive was Samuel L Jackson who, in 2019’s Captain Marvel, shed about 25 years and featured in the entire story rather than just a cameo. “The artists meticulously compared Jackson to how he looked in his mid-90s-era movies to see precisely how skin would hang off his face or how light would hit his cheeks,” according to the Wrap website. Why bother? Better to have a de-aged Harrison Ford, some argue, than to have a different actor playing one of his indelible roles, as happened when he took on the young Han Solo in Solo: A Star Wars Story. Many fans found it a jarring experience. Drexel Heard, a political activist who has worked in Hollywood, says: “We’re getting to the point where viewers want to see that same person where it’s not going to take them out of the moment. Because our brains automatically go, ‘Well, that’s not the same person. Who’s that actor? Will that actor be better than the actor that we are watching right now?’ Nobody wants to have to go through that as an audience member.” Not everyone sees it that way, however. Tan, who uses an AI-assisted tool called Shapeshifter, says: “It’s time for the old farts to make space. It’s annoying. There’s no reason for somebody to be in his 80s and still look like in his 30s. There’s no point. What it does is create a culture of recycling. “It’s like Mickey Mouse going on forever. You have a Mickey Mouse and it doesn’t need any water, it doesn’t need any food, it doesn’t need a contract. They can monetise it any way they want. It doesn’t need to sleep. It works 24 hours if they want in 10 copies or 30 copies simultaneously. What’s happening right now is these actors are becoming more that. They become like a brand.” Tan adds: “In Harrison Ford’s case, the guy did of course Indiana Jones but there could be easily a new Indiana Jones introduced, a next generation. Why even recycle all that stuff constantly? Because it’s a sure thing for money making, obviously, but the question arises, what does it do to our society if you have always the same idols being recreated on the screen? It’s like we got stuck somehow in the past and we don’t want to look into the future.” Martin Scorsese’s 2019 movie The Irishman knocked four decades off Al Pacino, then 79, and Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, both 76, but fell into the “uncanny valley” trap of being distracting, eerie and not quite lifelike enough. If the test of visual effects is that you shouldn’t notice them, The Irishman failed. And for all the digital wizardry, the actors’ bodies betrayed the ravages of time. Joe Pavlo, an Emmy award-winning visual effects artist based in London, says: “Marty should have come to me. I would have told him you can’t do that with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci – they’re just too damn famous and everybody knows them. If you’re going to do it, do it with unknown actors and age them and get a young guy and age them. “Bless his heart but Robert De Niro moves like a guy in his 70s. An old person doesn’t move like a young person. They don’t walk the same. Their mannerisms are not the same. There’s all kinds of problems but people will figure this out and it’s just going to be another tool for film-making. A tool for film-making can be used by someone very artistically and with great vision or it can be used hamfistedly as a novelty and a gimmick. Building on Industrial Light and Magic’s de-ageing work in The Irishman, a fan rapidly created a deepfake version that was released on YouTube and widely praised as an improvement. Pavlo, who uses AI tools to save time on boring and mundane tasks, adds: “The technology is just getting better and better. You can see stuff falling apart a little bit and not being perfect but, every time I dive into it again, I find that it’s improved exponentially since the last time I looked at it.” Asked if he is worried about a Pandora’s Box of deepfakes being opened, Pavlo notes that AI software is also used to detect deepfakes with high accuracy. “AI technology is the disease and the cure.” Tan, however, has misgivings. He says: “AI is in a sense cool and fun in the beginning but then you realise it’s actually dangerous. It can imitate people and make them do things on screen and then you can have a whole societal belief that those people are disgraced for whatever they did on screen and in reality it wasn’t even them. It’s just a ploy to wind people up. “You see it in warfare, which I think Russia tried with Ukraine. There was this use that had the Ukrainian president saying they were giving up and soldiers should put their weapons down. That was done with AI. A simple tool which doesn’t look dangerous suddenly can be very dangerous because now you are affecting reality with it.” It has the makings of an ethical quagmire and government regulators are struggling to catch up. One source in the visual effects industry, who did not wished to be named, writes in an email: “In the hands of well-meaning people, I don’t think it crosses an ethical line since we’ve been doing this manually with makeup or CG for decades already and it can be a really effective part of storytelling. “However, the issue is when it becomes so accessible that it’s used by less scrupulous people and when society hasn’t caught up in terms of understanding how to deal with it. Where the skill required was a deterrent, now anyone can make people say or do what they want.” The source adds: “You can see this already with the inception of deepfakes for celebrity pornography. The ability for the average person to realise if something is fake is always years behind the state of the art in technology, and it’s ripe for dissemination of misinformation. The last few years have shown how much fake news (often foreign state-sponsored efforts) affects society, even just as text. “How will we cope when we can’t trust what we see or hear? How will we be able to trust that a celebrity didn’t say something heinous years ago versus it just being a poorly shot cellphone video? Or conversely, how would we hold people accountable when they can just pretend it’s all fake?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2022/sep/05/what-policies-will-liz-truss-pursue-as-britain-new-prime-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-05T11:43:34Z","webTitle":"What policies will Liz Truss pursue as Britain’s new prime minister?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/05/what-policies-will-liz-truss-pursue-as-britain-new-prime-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/sep/05/what-policies-will-liz-truss-pursue-as-britain-new-prime-minister","fields":{"headline":"What policies will Liz Truss pursue as Britain’s new prime minister?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The policy focus of a Truss prime ministership will, inevitably, be largely a work in progress, given she is taking office amid a hugely turbulent economic period. But during a long leadership campaign the new PM has set out a series of proposals and plans for government: Taxation and cost of living Truss’s clear economic priority is to cut taxes, a move she insists will reboot a stalled economy and help people with soaring energy bills. She has promised to reverse the recent increase in national insurance and to cancel a scheduled rise in corporation tax, at a combined cost of about £30bn a year. Truss’s team has also mooted the idea of slashing VAT by 5% or cutting income tax to help household budgets. While Truss has said her plans would be paid for by fiscal headroom and delaying the repayment of Covid-related debts, critics have argued she will need to borrow considerable sums, at potentially expensive rates, at some cost to the economy. One option could be to expand a windfall tax on energy firms, but Truss has said she dislikes this. There is also considerable scepticism about a tax cut-based response to the energy costs crisis, which would disproportionately benefit high earners and do nothing for those reliant on pensions or benefits. Truss has not ruled out more direct help over energy bills, but has refused to say explicity what this might be, and talked about her distaste for “handouts”. It is a position that is about to be tested against economic reality. Climate and green energy While Truss has stressed her commitment to the UK’s existing net zero target, and her team insists she will focus on renewable energy, some on the greener side of the Conservative party are becoming worried about her priorities. One of Truss’s few direct policies on the cost of living would be to suspend green levies on energy bills, which are used to invest in renewable schemes. She opposes onshore wind, and described seeing solar farms on farmland as “one of the most depressing sights” of modern Britain. In contrast, she supports fracking for shale gas and reportedly wants to see a push for new drilling in the North Sea, and has backed a major expansion of nuclear power. She has not talked about efforts to reduce energy consumption, such as subsidising insulation for homes. Health and social care Truss has received relatively little scrutiny over her plans for the NHS and care, especially given the crisis in the health service, and the widespread expectation things will get much worse into the winter. While she remains committed to existing plans to support the NHS, there is the issue that Truss has promised to reverse the national insurance rise aimed at providing cash firstly to help clear the Covid-exacerbated backlog of NHS procedures, and in the longer term to pay for better social care. Much of the problems with delayed ambulances are because hospital beds are filled with people unable to access social care. Truss will need a coherent plan, and soon. Levelling up This is another area on which Truss said relatively little during the leadership campaign but could increase in significance as she faces the country, and her own MPs, as prime minister. Levelling up was Boris Johnson’s self-stated defining purpose, and while Truss has said she remains committed to this agenda, it is unclear whether she would back this with significant spending. Truss has said she will level up “in a Conservative way”, seen as a focus more on deregulation and tax cuts. One of the reasons Johnson was popular with many “red wall” Tory MPs was that they could point to specific, Whitehall-financed infrastructure projects, whether a new local bypass or a revamped high street. If Truss was to take this away, it could create disquiet. Immigration and home affairs During the campaign, Truss has promised to double down on the policy of deporting asylum seekers and other immigrants to Rwanda, and to seek other countries who will take them. It remains to be seen how feasible this is, or if it would have any impact on the numbers of people crossing the Channel by unofficial means, even if some did depart. Truss is likely to link any failure to remove people to the continued jurisdiction of the European court of human rights. While removing the UK entirely from its oversight would be complex and tricky, she is likely to push ahead with plans for a so-called UK bill of rights, with fewer protections for asylum seekers and others. Culture wars Truss is more of a keen amateur culture warrior than a die-hard aficionado, keeping the Tory faithful happy at hustings events with passing swipes at “woke” culture and trans rights. However, if as tipped she appoints Suella Braverman as home secretary and Kemi Badenoch to education, the temperature could rise considerably. Culture war issues tend to be more focused on seeking debate and political dividing lines than actual policies, but particularly in education it could lead to changes in approach, for example on trans rights and free speech. Foreign policy and Brexit Wider foreign policy is likely to be more of the same, given Truss led on this under Johnson, so expect more vehement support for Ukraine, plus occasional gaffes such as her recent refusal to say whether the French president, Emmanuel Macron, a neighbour and close ally, is a “friend or foe”. Truss has made much of her toughness over the Northern Ireland protocol, and her camp has hinted she could trigger article 16, the emergency procedure clause in the post-Brexit deal with the EU, within days of entering No 10. But with so many other crises to face, and the leadership contest over, Truss might decide a potential trade war is not what she needs as well."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/03/greens-give-crucial-support-to-labors-climate-bill-for-43-emissions-reduction-by-2030","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T10:49:45Z","webTitle":" Labor’s climate bill set to pass with support from Greens and Bridget Archer ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/03/greens-give-crucial-support-to-labors-climate-bill-for-43-emissions-reduction-by-2030","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/03/greens-give-crucial-support-to-labors-climate-bill-for-43-emissions-reduction-by-2030","fields":{"headline":" Labor’s climate bill set to pass with support from Greens and Bridget Archer ","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The House of Representatives is moving towards passage of Labor’s bill enshrining emissions reductions targets for 2030 and 2050 after the Greens signalled they would support the legislation and Liberal MP Bridget Archer confirmed she would cross the floor. After weeks of negotiations, the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, confirmed on Wednesday his party would back the Albanese government’s legislation in both chambers, and king-making Senate independent, David Pocock, confirmed his priority was “getting a target locked in and legislated”. The legislation will pass the lower house on Thursday morning before moving to the Senate during the next parliamentary sitting fortnight in September. Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday the measure – an opening salvo in ending Australia’s decade long climate wars – was “as important a piece of legislation as will come before this parliament”. Despite losing a swathe of heartland metropolitan seats to climate-focussed independents at the election on 21 May, the Coalition has resolved to oppose the bill. But Archer confirmed on Wednesday night she would support Labor’s primary legislation, but not the consequential amendments bill. Archer told the chamber climate change was an issue that “transcends age, gender, political beliefs and socioeconomic circumstances” and she had been approached from all types of constituents – including a Baptist minister, business leaders and pensioners of the left and right – “all of who believe this is not an issue of left or right”. At the National Press Club on Wednesday Bandt said the Greens would support Labor’s legislation. He said the bill now ensured the 43% emissions reduction target was a floor and not a ceiling, and ambition could be ratcheted up over time. He said Labor had bolstered its initial proposal by ensuring government agencies would have to consider climate targets before funding new projects, and had clarified the role the Climate Change Authority would play in providing expert advice. But while supporting the legislation, he foreshadowed further discussions with Labor about the safeguards mechanism, and about inserting a climate trigger in environmental regulations, which would make it hard for new fossil fuel developments to secure approval. “The fight begins now to get Labor to stop opening coal and gas mines,” the Greens leader said. Bandt vowed to “comb the entire budget for any public money … going to coal and gas corporations and amend the budget to remove them”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Albanese told reporters in Canberra that Labor had agreed to amendments that were “consistent with the policy we took to the election”, but had not committed to the Greens to consider a climate trigger in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act. He ruled out using the safeguards mechanism to block new fossil fuel projects. Albanese welcomed the Greens’ decision that “they are prepared to vote for the legislation” even though some of their amendments were not accepted. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said it was “a good day for Australia”. “A good day therefore [for] the economy, a good day for the future,” he said. “The climate wars may not be over, but they are suddenly in retreat, under this government.” In question time, Albanese said Labor was “another step closer to delivering our mandate”, deflecting Coalition attacks about power prices by accusing them of “opposition to the cheapest form of energy, renewables” and support for “the most expensive solutions – nuclear power”. Earlier, Bandt claimed that Labor’s position on new coal and gas projects was “untenable ultimately”, citing ambition for greater action from Australia’s “closest security allies” including the US and Pacific nations. “This is round one,” he said. “There is three years of this parliament and there are a number of points coming up where we will push to stop opening coal and gas.” Bandt cited the review of the EPBC Act, which he said “needs a climate trigger”. “An environment law that allows projects to go ahead, even if it makes climate change worse and destroys the environment is an environment law with a massive hole in the middle of it.” The crossbench believed it has secured government agreement for a range of other amendments including: an objects clause in the legislation, a statutory review in five years of the act’s effectiveness, and clearer reporting obligations for the minister and Climate Change Authority. Bowen said the government had “good conversations across the parliament with people of goodwill” and accepted changes that “improve the bill” and implement Labor’s mandate. Others had “completely ruled themselves out of any discussions with the government”, he said. On Tuesday the Coalition resolved to oppose the bill, reasoning that Labor had already increased Australia’s emission reduction obligations under the Paris agreement, and the opposition parties could determine a new target closer to the next election. Independent MPs including Sophie Scamps, Kylea Tink, Kate Chaney and Allegra Spender have voiced support for the bill – but it will be the Jacqui Lambie Network and David Pocock’s votes in the Senate which Labor will need to pass it. The independent MP for Fowler, Dai Le, has indicated she would abstain in the climate bill vote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jun/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-ukraine-makes-advances-in-south-and-east-top-general-says-putin-greets-crowds-in-rare-walkabout","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-29T17:46:00Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Wagner mercenaries will no longer fight in Ukraine; Putin greets crowds in rare walkabout – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-ukraine-makes-advances-in-south-and-east-top-general-says-putin-greets-crowds-in-rare-walkabout","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-ukraine-makes-advances-in-south-and-east-top-general-says-putin-greets-crowds-in-rare-walkabout","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Wagner mercenaries will no longer fight in Ukraine; Putin greets crowds in rare walkabout – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The blog is now closing. Below is a roundup of today’s stories: Wagner mercenaries will no longer fight in Ukraine after their chief refused to sign contracts with the Kremlin. Yevgeny Prigozhin refused to sign any contracts with the Kremlin, according to the head of the Duma defence committee, Andrei Kartapolov. Reports have emerged that Gen Sergei Surovikin has been detained in Russia. The Financial Times and Associated Press have reported this. Three people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times that Surovikin was being detained while sources citing US and Ukrainian intelligence reports spoke told the AP. Surovikin’s daughter told the website Baza that “nothing happened to [Surovikin], no one arrested him and now everyone is at their jobs”. The general, who previously led the invasion force in Ukraine, has not been seen in public since Saturday. The New York Times, citing anonymous US intelligence sources, reported that Surovikin had prior knowledge of the uprising led by the Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, with whom he had well publicised links. Surovikin is the head of the Russian aerospace forces and was formerly Moscow’s supreme commander in Ukraine. Russia has ruled out Switzerland as location for peace talks, saying it had “lost its status as a neutral state” after supporting EU sanctions. Russia’s ambassador to Switzerland said Moscow could not accept any Swiss-hosted peace summit on Ukraine after it joined EU sanctions against his country, adding that Switzerland had lost its reputation for neutrality. Ukrainian forces are advancing “slowly but surely” on the frontlines in the east and south-east of the country as well as around the longstanding flashpoint of Bakhmut, senior military officials have said. Ukrainian commander-in-chief Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi told the chair of the US joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, that his forces had “succeeded in seizing the strategic initiative”. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar, speaking on national television, said forces had made advances in sectors in the south designated by two occupied towns – Berdiansk and Mariupol. “Every day, there is an advance,” Maliar said. “Yes, the advances are slow, but they are sure.” Mike Pence met Volodymyr Zelenskiy during surprise Ukraine trip. Pence is the first Republican presidential candidate to meet Zelenskiy during the campaign. He told NBC News: “Coming here just as a private citizen – being able to really see first-hand the heroism of the Ukrainian soldiers holding the line in those woods, see the heroism of the people here in Irpin that held back the Russian army, to see families whose homes were literally shelled in the midst of an unconscionable and unprovoked Russian invasion – just steels my resolve to do my part, to continue to call for strong American support for our Ukrainian friends and allies.” The death toll in a Russian rocket attack on a packed pizza restaurant in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk has risen to 12, including four children. Ukraine’s state emergency service said at least 56 people were injured, some critically, when two Iskander missiles were fired into the restaurant in the city centre on Tuesday evening. The regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said rescue attempts had ended. The UK’s ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, described the strike as “heartbreaking”. Russia’s defence ministry claimed it killed two Ukrainian generals and up to 50 officers in a missile attack when referring to this attack. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence agency has arrested a local man whom it accused of helping the Russians carry out the attack on Kramatorsk. The SBU said it had arrested an employee of a gas transportation company who helped coordinate the strike and allegedly sent video footage of the cafe to the Russian military. It provided no evidence for the claims. Putin said on Wednesday that he “didn’t doubt” that he had the support of Russians during the mutiny. In a meeting with the head of the southern Russian province of Dagestan, parts of which were aired on state television, he said: “I did not doubt the reaction in Dagestan and in all of the country.” Putin made a rare public walkabout in Derbent on Wednesday, including shaking hands with people, which was shown on Russian state television. The distribution of humanitarian aid in Nevske in the Ukraine-controlled portion of Luhansk has been paused after Russian shelling. The Russian-imposed acting governor of occupied Kherson region has denied claims that Ukrainian troops had succeeded in establishing any kind of bridgehead over the Dnipro at the location of the Antonivskyi Bridge. He has also claimed that Russian forces repelled multiple landing attempts in the area. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he had rejected calls from Washington and Kyiv to arm Ukraine due to “concerns that I don’t think any of the western allies of Ukraine have”. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, he said Israel needed “freedom of action” in Syria, where Israel often bombs Iranian targets near Russian forces. He said he also had fears that Israeli weaponry could be captured in Ukraine and turned over to Iran, specifically the Iron Dome air defence system, which was developed with the US. Poland expects the EU to help it fund measures to strengthen its eastern border, a deputy minister said on Thursday, after Warsaw announced a tightening of security due to concerns over the presence of Wagner group troops in Belarus. The Hungarian parliament’s house committee has rejected a proposal to schedule a vote on the ratification of Sweden’s Nato membership for next week. The EU should not “lower the bar” on membership for Ukraine in terms of corruption and democracy, Denmark’s foreign minister has warned in an interview with the Financial Times, saying that to do so would risk “importing instability”. Lars Løkke Rasmussen told the newspaper that Denmark supported EU membership for Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and the western Balkans, but that “geopolitical circumstances” did not justify skating over governance reforms. Russia said it was opening criminal cases against what it claimed to be 160 mercenaries from 33 different countries who were operating on behalf of Ukrainian forces in the country. An aide of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has told Reuters that Ukraine wants to receive an invitation to begin the process of joining Nato at the military alliance’s summit next month, and that Zelenskiy will not attend if leaders do not show “courage”. Chief diplomatic adviser Ihor Zhovkva said that Kyiv wanted the Nato summit – due to be held in Vilnius, Lithuania, on 11-12 July – to deliver a response to the application for Nato membership that Ukraine filed on 30 September last year. “This application is now on the tables of the leaders of Nato allies. The Vilnius summit would be a very good start to respond to this application. And by respond, we mean invitation for membership, which is only the first stage,” he said. Kyiv has said it understands Ukraine cannot join Nato until the war with Russia is over. “What we are asking for is to start the procedure,” he said. “If there is no result at the Vilnius summit, [Zelenskiy] doesn’t have reason and time to go,” said Zhovkva. “The president will not travel … to the summit if the leaders will tend to or will show a deficit of courage, while Ukraine – with all its courage, will and strength and high morale – is fighting against Russian aggression,” he said. “When Finland and Sweden submitted an application for membership last year, immediately in June last year the allies responded to the application … inviting them to membership with Nato,” he added. The head of Russia’s Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, told papal envoy Cardinal Matteo Zuppi on Thursday that their churches should work together to avert “negative political developments and serve the cause of peace and justice”. Kirill is a strong supporter of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s decision to send troops into Ukraine. Zuppi is in Moscow to help find “a solution to the tragic current situation”. Merchandise carrying the insignia of Wagner mercenary group has soared in price since the group’s aborted mutiny, Reuters reports. E-commerce leader Wildberries’ weekly price breakdowns showed how costs have risen. A patch depicting the skull that can be sewn on to clothes fetched 525 roubles (£4.70) in the period 25-29 June, up sharply from 294 (£2.70) roubles during 18-25 June. Prices for a black T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of a Wagner fighter holding a violin jumped this week to 1,650 (£15) roubles from 1,236 (£11.20) roubles. The UK’s defence minister, Ben Wallace, said on Thursday that Nato should look at skipping the requirement for Ukraine’s membership action plan (Map) as part of its pathway to joining the alliance. Any move to ditch or circumvent Ukraine’s Map requirement, designed to help candidates meet certain political, economic and military criteria, could speed up its accession. “I think we should absolutely look at skipping the membership action plan,” Wallace said at a joint press conference alongside his Canadian counterpart in London. “But of course, we have to put some realism in this space that there are 31 members of Nato now and, you know, we have to all move together.” Wallace said he could not guarantee agreement on that step before next month’s Nato summit in Lithuania, but said it could be possible to remove other barriers to Ukraine’s membership. Last month, Politico reported that Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, privately suggested that allies agree Ukraine could join Nato after the war, without following a Map. The US president, Joe Biden, has also expressed he is open to waiving the Map for Ukraine. Ben Wallace was at one point seen as a contender to become the next head of Nato but it is now expected that incumbent Stoltenberg’s term will be extended. On Monday Wallace ruled out a plan to become secretary general. He told the Royal United Services Institute land warfare conference: “I’m not going to do it this year or next year or the year after, so it’s for others to take that job.” The Wall Street Journal reports that the US is close to approving a long-range missile system for Ukraine that could strike Russian targets from far behind the frontlines, according to a senior Ukrainian defence official. The Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) has a range of about 190 miles (306km). The US president, Joe Biden, has not signed off on the transfer, partly over concerns among US officials that Ukraine could use it to strike Russian territory and escalate the conflict. A senior Ukrainian defence official told the newspaper that Kyiv had received positive signs in recent weeks that the US had come around on the missile system. Ukrainian officials have argued that the long-range missiles are needed, in part, to strike into Crimea, the peninsula occupied by Russia, which is being used as a base to launch Iranian-made drones, according to public statements by the US and its European allies. The US asked Ukrainian officials not to conduct covert attacks inside Russia as the Wagner group rebellion was under way and advised them not to do anything that would influence the outcome of events or take advantage of the chaos, American officials have told the New York Times. US officials did not want to give the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, an excuse to claim that the Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin’s rebellion was orchestrated by the US or Ukraine. They also said they believed that any high-profile operation by Ukrainian forces inside Russia was unlikely to have any major effect on Prigozhin’s goals, but would allow Putin to level accusations against the west, according to American assessments. US officials added that as far as they knew, Ukrainian intelligence units took heed of the advice. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, condemned Sweden on Thursday over the burning of a Qur’an in Stockholm as tensions between the two countries grow. In order to join Nato, Sweden needs the backing of Turkey which has been blocking its bid. “We will teach the arrogant western people that it is not freedom of expression to insult the sacred values of Muslims,” Erdoğan told party members on the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. Erdoğan said Turkey would show the strongest possible reaction to what he called the vile protest. Swedish police had granted permission for the anti-Qur’an protest to take place. But police charged the man who carried out the burning with agitation against an ethnic or national group. The Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, condemned the protest and said it was unacceptable to allow anti-Islam protests in the name of freedom of expression. This month a new anti-terrorism law targeted at Kurdish and anti-Turkish government groups, which include the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) and the Gülen movement, came into force in Sweden to appease demands from the Turkish government. In response, protests advocating for Kurdish rights were held. The former US vice-president Mike Pence met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a surprise trip to Ukraine, NBC news reports. “I believe America’s the leader of the free world,” Pence told NBC News. “But coming here just as a private citizen – being able to really see first-hand the heroism of the Ukrainian soldiers holding the line in those woods, see the heroism of the people here in Irpin that held back the Russian army, to see families whose homes were literally shelled in the midst of an unconscionable and unprovoked Russian invasion – just steels my resolve to do my part, to continue to call for strong American support for our Ukrainian friends and allies.” Pence is the first Republican presidential candidate to meet Zelenskiy during the campaign. Unlike the Republican frontrunners Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, both of whom have expressed tepid support for Ukraine and US intervention, Pence has been unambiguous in his strong support for Ukraine and said “there can be no room in the leadership of the Republican party for apologists for Putin”. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday found that large majorities of Americans – 67% and 73% – are more likely to support a candidate in next year’s US presidential election who will continue military aid to Ukraine and one who backs the Nato alliance. Here is a picture of pro-Ukrainian protesters outside the European Council in Brussels on Thursday as EU leaders met to discuss “future security commitments” to Ukraine. The protest was held to call on the EU to outline the way for Ukraine and Georgia to become member states, to further sanction Russia, and to recognise the Wagner group as a terrorist organisation. Russia’s ambassador to Switzerland said Moscow could not accept any Swiss-hosted peace summit on Ukraine after it joined EU sanctions against his country, adding that Switzerland had lost its reputation for neutrality. Switzerland, which has consistently blocked the re-export of Swiss-manufactured weapons by other countries for use in Ukraine, was described of having “lost its status as a neutral state” by Sergei Garmonin in an interview with Le Temps newspaper published on Thursday. Reuters reports that in his speech to parliament on 15 June, Volodymyr Zelenskiy invited Switzerland to host a global peace summit on Ukraine. Ukraine’s president said he had previously discussed the initiative with the Swiss president, Alain Berset. Two people were killed and two wounded in a Russian shelling of a refuge for civilians known as an invincibility point in the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine on Thursday, the regional governor said. “Two local people were killed and two more are in hospital in moderate condition,” Reuters reports governor Oleksandr Prokudin wrote on the Telegram messaging app. BBC Journalist Francis Scarr has shared a fawning clip from Russian TV that portrays president Vladimir Putin as a “rock star” days after an attempted mutiny. Presenter Olga Skabeyeva says that “even rock stars have nothing on him” after the welcome he was given by crowds in Derbent last night. “Where else does the national leader get greeted like this? Where is anyone greeted like this at all. “Ovations, cheering, and then for a very long time they didn’t let him go” she said. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed it killed two Ukrainian generals and up to 50 officers in a missile attack on the city of Kramatorsk on Tuesday, the RIA state news agency reported. On Wednesday, the Kremlin and defence ministry claimed the strike was aimed at military targets. Ukraine said the attack, which hit a crowded restaurant, targeted civilians. Officials said 12 people died as a result, including three children. “Nothing [has] happened” to Gen Sergei Surovikin said his daughter on Thursday after reports of his arrest. Surovikin had not been seen in public since Saturday. The Financial Times, citing three sources, reported that the missing general had been detained. Speaking to the website Baza, Surovikin’s daughter Veronika said “nothing happened to [Surovikin], no one arrested him, and now everyone is at their jobs”. She also said that the general “never appeared every day in the media and did not make statements”. Surovikin’s wife refused to comment on the rumours about his arrest. The New York Times, citing anonymous US intelligence sources, reported that Surovikin had prior knowledge of the uprising led by the Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, with whom he had well publicised links. Surovikin is the head of the Russian aerospace forces and was formerly Moscow’s supreme commander in Ukraine. The head of the British army is expected to step down next year after a shorter than expected time in the role. Gen Sir Patrick Sanders became chief of the general staff last June. Army chiefs typically serve about three years in office unless they are promoted to become chief of the defence staff, the most senior military commander. Sanders has been outspoken about the need to rebuild the UK’s war-fighting capability after Russia’s war in Ukraine. In January, he said donating tanks and other military equipment to Ukraine “will leave us temporarily weaker as an Army”. In a letter posted on the Ministry of Defence’s private internet server Defence Connect, Sanders said: “Giving away these capabilities will leave us temporarily weaker as an Army, there is no denying it. “There is no doubt our choice will impact on our ability to mobilise the Army against the acute and enduring threat Russia presents and meet our Nato obligations. “Our tank crews and gunners will feel the impact the most. But the decision also brings the opportunity to accelerate the modernisation and transformation of the Army ahead of Russia. Ukraine needs our tanks and guns now. I know they will put them to good use.” The Sun reports that Gen Sharon Nesmith has been invited to apply for the role by Ben Wallace, the UK’s defence secretary. Reuters reports that the Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer has said EU countries with a neutral stance object to giving Ukraine outright security assurances. “For us as neutral states it is clear we can’t give security guarantees like that. Austria, Ireland, Malta and Cyprus have made it clear they have objections,” Nehammer said on Thursday before a meeting with other EU government leaders in Brussels. “The role of the neutral states needs to be explicitly taken into account. We will certainly discuss this and we will find formulations that will be acceptable for us as well.” This follows on from comments Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Denmark’s foreign minister, made in an interview with the Financial Times on Thursday where he said the EU should not “lower the bar” on membership for Ukraine in terms of corruption and democracy, saying to do so would risk “importing instability”. Rasmussen added that Denmark supported EU membership for Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and the western Balkans but that “geopolitical circumstances” did not justify skating over governance reforms. Wagner fighters will no longer fight in Ukraine after the mercenary group’s chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, refused to sign any contracts with the Kremlin, according to the head of the Duma defence committee, Andrei Kartapolov. Kartapolov said that a few days before the attempted rebellion, Russia’s ministry of defence announced that “all [groups] that perform combat missions must sign a contract” with the ministry, Tass news agency reported. According to Kartapolov, Prigozhin did not sign the contracts and was informed that “Wagner would not take part in a special military operation.” “That is, funding, material resources will not be allocated,” the deputy added. The Kremlin said on Thursday there was a constant threat of “provocations” from the Ukrainian side regarding the nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that inspectors had recently been at the site to check on the safety of the plant, which is controlled by Russian forces but is near the frontline of fighting in southern Ukraine. The UN atomic energy agency has frequently appealed to both sides to avoid shelling in the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia. Patrick Reevell, a reporter from ABC News, tweeted on Thursday morning that he was in Zaporizhzhia with Ukrainian emergency workers doing drills and practising how to respond if Russia blew up the city’s nuclear power plant. The governor of Kherson, Oleksander Prokudin, said on Telegram: “The purpose of the event is to coordinate the actions of all services in case of a real threat of an emergency situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.” Gen Sergei Surovikin has been detained in Russia, the Financial Times reports. Surovikin had not been seen in public since Saturday. The New York Times, citing anonymous US intelligence sources, reported that Surovikin had prior knowledge of the uprising led by the Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, with whom he had well publicised links. Surovikin is the head of the Russian aerospace forces and was formerly Moscow’s supreme commander in Ukraine. Three people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times that Surovikin was being detained. It is not clear whether Surovikin has been charged as a plotter in the uprising led by Prigozhin on Saturday, or simply detained for interrogation. Both the Kremlin and Russia’s defence ministry have refused to clarify the fate of Surovikin. The Kremlin has refused to clarify the fate of Gen Sergei Surovikin, who has not been seen in public since Saturday. The New York Times, citing anonymous US intelligence sources, reported that Surovikin had prior knowledge of the Wagner uprising. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov referred questions about Surovikin to the defence ministry, which has so far not made any statement about him. Asked by reporters if the Kremlin could clarify the situation with Surovikin, Peskov said: “No, unfortunately not.” “So I recommend that you contact the defence ministry; this is its prerogative.” When a reporter asked if Russian president Vladimir Putin still continued to trust Surovikin, Peskov said: “He is the supreme commander-in-chief and he works with the defence minister and with the chief of the general staff.” Questions about “structural units within the ministry,” Peskov said, should be addressed to the defence ministry. Asked about Prigozhin’s whereabouts, after a plane linked to the mercenary flew to Moscow from St Petersburg, Peskov said he did not have information about Prigozhin’s location at the current time. Australia handed over some military assistance to Ukraine before it was formally approved or without the necessary export permits, an audit has found. A report published on Thursday also said some grants were made to Nato and the UK defence ministry despite uncertainty around the legislative basis for providing that assistance. The Australian National Audit Office examined the Department of Defence’s role in providing military assistance to Ukraine, and revealed that the deliveries had been made on 40 flights to date. The ANAO found the planning, implementation and delivery of the assistance was “largely effective” although it also pointed to “some shortcomings” in the rapid rollout. “Defence delivered military assistance quickly and in line with Australian government expectations,” the report tabled in parliament said. “However, not all legislative and administrative requirements were met in the context of this rapid implementation activity.” Defence, the report said, was “not able to demonstrate” that all Australian government policy approvals were secured for 13.5% of the military assistance dispatched in 2022, valued at $36.4m. A further 58 items with a value of $38.4m were transferred from Australia to Ukraine without being included in an exchange of letters between the two governments, the report said. The report also questioned the legal basis for certain Australian grants made shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. This included $4.2m to a Nato trust fund announced on 28 February 2022 and $18m to the UK Ministry of Defence announced on 1 March 2022, both while the Coalition was in power. Read the full story here The Kremlin said on Thursday that its own data suggested continued strong support among Russians for what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine and for Russian president Vladimir Putin, Reuters reports. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was responding at a regular news briefing to a question about a survey suggesting there was an equal number of people who supported negotiations to end the 16-month military operation in Ukraine and those who favoured continuing the conflict. “The data we have show something quite different - dominant support for the special military operation and for the president,” said Peskov. “The main thing for Russians is achieving the goals before us which were formulated by the president,” Peskov said. Ukrainian forces are advancing “slowly but surely” on the frontlines in the east and south-east of the country as well as around the longstanding flashpoint of Bakhmut, senior military officials have said. Ukrainian commander-in-chief Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi told the chair of the US joint chiefs of staff Mark Milley that his forces had “succeeded in seizing the strategic initiative.” The Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar, speaking on national television, said forces had made advances in sectors in the south designated by two occupied towns – Berdiansk and Mariupol. “Every day, there is an advance,” Maliar said. “Yes, the advances are slow, but they are sure.” The death toll in a Russian rocket attack on a packed pizza restaurant in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk has risen to 12, including four children. Ukraine’s state emergency service said at least 56 people were injured, some critically, when two Iskander missiles slammed into the restaurant in the city centre on Tuesday evening. Regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said rescue attempts had ended. The UK’s ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, described the strike as “heartbreaking”. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence agency has arrested a local man it accused of helping the Russians carry out the attack on Kramatorsk. The SBU said it had arrested an employee of a gas transportation company who helped coordinate the strike and allegedly sent video footage of the cafe to the Russian military. It provided no evidence for the claims. Putin said Wednesday that he “didn’t doubt” that he had the support of Russians during the mutiny. In a meeting with the head of the southern Russian province of Dagestan, parts of which were aired on state television, he said: “I did not doubt the reaction in Dagestan and in all of the country.” Putin made a rare public walkabout in Derbent on Wednesday, including shaking hands with people, which was shown on Russian state television. A Russian general who previously led the invasion force in Ukraine has not been seen in public since Saturday. The New York Times, citing anonymous US intelligence sources, reported that Gen Sergei Surovikin had prior knowledge of the uprising led by the Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, with whom he had well publicised links. Surovikin is the head of the Russian aerospace forces and was formerly Moscow’s supreme commander in Ukraine. The distribution of humanitarian aid in Nevske in the Ukraine-controlled portion of Luhansk has been paused after Russian shelling. The Russian-imposed acting governor of occupied Kherson region has denied claims that Ukrainian troops had succeeded in establishing any kind of bridghead over the Dnipro at the location of the Antonivskyi bridge. He has also claimed that Russian forces have repelled multiple landing attempts in the area. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he had rejected calls from Washington and Kyiv to arm Ukraine due to “concerns that I don’t think any of the western allies of Ukraine have”. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, he said Israel needed “freedom of action” in Syria, where Israel often bombs Iranian targets near Russian forces. He said he also had fears that Israeli weaponry could be captured in Ukraine and turned over to Iran, specifically the Iron Dome air defence system, which was developed with the US. Poland expects the EU to help it fund measures to strengthen its eastern border, a deputy minister said on Thursday, after Warsaw announced a tightening of security due to concerns over the presence of Wagner group troops in Belarus. The Hungarian parliament’s house committee has rejected a proposal to schedule a vote on the ratification of Sweden’s Nato membership for next week The EU should not “lower the bar” on membership for Ukraine in terms of corruption and democracy, Denmark’s foreign minister has warned in an interview with the Financial Times, saying to do so would risk “importing instability”. Lars Løkke Rasmussen told the newspaper Denmark supported EU membership for Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and the western Balkans but that “geopolitical circumstances” did not justify skating over governance reforms. Russia said it is opening criminal cases against what it claims are 160 mercenaries from 33 different countries who are operating on behalf of Ukrainian forces in the country. Papal envoy Cardinal Matteo Zuppi and Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, will meet in Moscow on Thursday. The Russian-imposed acting governor of occupied Kherson region has denied claims that Ukrainian troops had succeeded in establishing any kind of bridghead over the Dnipro at the location of the Antonivskyi bridge. He has also claimed that Russian forces have repelled multiple landing attempts in the area. State-owned media Tass quotes Vladimir Saldo saying: The enemy has not created any bridgeheads there, and has no offensive potential. Over the past two days, the artillerymen of the Dnipro group of troops sank six boats, on which more than 30 Ukrainian soldiers tried to cross over for subsequent landing at the pillars of the bridge on the left bank. Last night, they destroyed a loaded boat, on which the militants tried to evacuate from under bridge to the right bank. The claims have not been independently verified. There had been some reports in Ukrainian media that Ukrainian forces had established a position on the Russian-controlled left-bank of the Dnipro. The Hungarian parliament’s house committee has rejected a proposal to schedule a vote on the ratification of Sweden’s Nato membership for next week, Reuters reports a lawmaker of the opposition party the Democratic coalition said on Thursday. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that yesterday in Donetsk region 11 settlements were fired upon, killing one person. Citing the Donetsk police force, it reported that in Zalisne “two apartment buildings and a private house, and a bank building were damaged by shelling, electricity was cut off.” The claims have not been independently verified. The Economist foreign correspondent Oliver Carroll posts that unverified news is beginning to filter out about some restructuring of the Russian military command structure. Reuters earlier reported that two of the most prominent figures in the campaign against Ukraine have not been seen since the Wagner mutiny. The armed forces chief of staff Gen Valery Gerasimov has not appeared in public or on state TV since the the weekend. Gerasimov, 67, is the commander of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Absent from view, too, is Gen Sergei Surovikin, who is deputy commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, and who has been named by US media citing security sources as having foreknowledge of Yevgeney Prigozhin’s planned rebellion. It is Surovikin’s deputy who is named as being fired by some Russian sources. In a post to social media Volodymyr Zelenskiy has described Ukraine’s path to victory as “difficult” but that they would achieve it. The Ukrainian president wrote: We have to realise that the path to our victory is difficult. And now, no one can say when we will complete it. But when the goal is clear and fair, it does not matter how thorny the path to this goal is. Ukraine will walk this path to victory! And this is no longer a dream – it is a reality. Poland expects the European Union to help it fund measures to strengthen its eastern border, a deputy minister said on Thursday, after Warsaw announced a tightening of security due to concerns over the presence of the Wagner group in Belarus. Reuters reports that asked on Thursday whether Brussels should help Warsaw pay for such measures, deputy foreign minister Paweł Jabłoński said “Poland expects it”. “European solidarity means supporting countries threatened with destabilization,” he told public radio. “These safeguards need to be increased.” On Wednesday Poland’s deputy prime minister, Jarosław Kaczyński, said the country believed that there could be around 8,000 Wagner troops already in Belarus. State-owned Russian news service Tass is reporting that the Russian Federation is opening criminal cases against what it claims are 160 mercenaries from 33 different countries who are operating on behalf of Ukrainian forces in the country. It quotes a report by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, which states: As a result of interaction with the ministry of defence of the Russian Federation and other operational services, evidence of the participation of mercenaries from Georgia, the US, Latvia, Sweden and other states has been collected. Currently, 160 foreigners from 33 countries are being prosecuted. This is the video clip which shows Vladimir Putin on a rare public walkabout in Russia, which was broadcast on state television. It has been widely seen as a visible attempt to reinforce the popular image of Russia’s president in the aftermath of the weekend’s armed mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group. Here are some recent images to be sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. The UK’s ambassador to Ukraine has described the strike on Kramatorsk which took 12 lives as “heartbreaking”. In a tweet, Melinda Simmons said: The Russian attack on Kramatorsk is heartbreaking. Ukrainian children among those killed in a missile attack on a pizza restaurant. So obviously not a military installation but a popular venue for residents and visitors. The rap sheet against Russia continues to grow. Papal envoy Cardinal Matteo Zuppi and Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, will meet in Moscow on Thursday, Reuters reports, citing the RIA news agency. The sound of explosions has been heard in Kherson, according to Suspilne. This is not uncommon, as Ukrainian and Russian forces have positions on opposite sides of the Dnipro. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that the distribution of humanitarian aid in Nevske in the Ukraine-controlled portion of Luhansk has been paused after Russian shelling. It cites the regional governor Artem Lysohor, who said there were no casualties or injuries, but that due to the deterioration of the security situation, the humanitarian aid would be distributed later. Rescue operations at the site of the strike on the restaurant in Kramatorsk have been completed, the regional governor of Donetsk has said on Telegram. Pavlo Kyrylenko confirmed that the final death toll in the attack was 12, and urged residents of Donetsk to consider evacuating. He posted: The rescue operations at the site of the missile strike in Kramatorsk have been completed. A total of 12 people, including three children, died as a result of the attack. 60 people were injured, including an eight-month-old baby. Rescuers managed to pull out 11 victims from under the rubble. 20 people applied for psychological help. I am asking everyone: do not neglect safety measures! Evacuate to safer regions of Ukraine! Donetsk is one of the region of Ukraine that the Russian Federation claimed to annex last year. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he had rejected calls from Washington and Kyiv to arm Ukraine due to “concerns that I don’t think any of the western allies of Ukraine have”. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, he said Israel needed “freedom of action” in Syria, where Israel often bombs Iranian targets near Russian forces. He said he also had fears that Israeli weaponry could be captured in Ukraine and turned over to Iran, specifically the Iron Dome air defence system, which was developed with the US. “If that system were to fall into the hands of Iran, then millions of Israelis would be left defenseless and imperiled,” he said. Iran has developed a closed relationship with Moscow in recent months. A bit more from the ISW report, which suggests that the Kremlin will attempt to balance its desire to mitigate the “widespread disdain” for the MoD establishment that fuelled Wagner’s rebellion, while also trying to disempower those who sympathised with the mutiny. Wagner’s goal of removing Gen Valery Gerasimov and the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, suggested that the Kremlin may view their unpopularity as “a direct threat to Putin’s ability to retain support among key constituencies and the military”, the US thinktank wrote. ISW previously assessed that the Kremlin is likely attempting to signal that Shoigu will maintain his position, but the Kremlin has yet to promote Gerasimov in a similar way in the days following the rebellion. The Kremlin may attempt to placate disdain for the MoD establishment by reducing Gerasimov’s role in operations in Ukraine, although he is highly likely to maintain, at least nominally, the position of overall theater commander and his long-term role as Chief of the General Staff. ISW has previously assessed that Gerasimov’s removal from either position would be too damaging to Putin’s and the MoD’s reputation .. Putin is likely further incentivized not to publicly replace Gerasimov out of fears of legitimizing rebellion as a successful means of blackmail. The EU should not “lower the bar” on membership for Ukraine in terms of corruption and democracy, Denmark’s foreign minister has warned in an interview with the Financial Times, saying to do so would risk “importing instability”. Lars Løkke Rasmussen told the newspaper Denmark supported EU membership for Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and the western Balkans but that “geopolitical circumstances” did not justify skating over governance reforms. If you don’t complete the reform process before you enter, then there could be a risk of slowing down afterwards. And we do not export stability, we risk importing instability. And that’s why it is so important to stress the need of fulfilling the [EU membership] criteria.” If there were to be special treatment for Ukraine, it should be in the form of extra help for Kyiv meet EU standards, he said. We want to invest and we want to assist and we want to be as positive and help some as possible, but we can’t lower the bar. Russian sources are speculating that the Wagner rebellion is already having widespread impacts on the Russian military command structure, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest analysis of the conflict in Ukraine. One prominent milblogger claimed here had been “large-scale purges” among the command cadre of the Russian armed forces and that the Russian MoD is currently undergoing a “crash test” for loyalty, the US thinktank wrote. The milblogger notably claimed that Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) commander and rumored deputy theater commander Colonel General Mikhail Teplinsky assumed responsibilities as overall theater commander in Ukraine from Chief of the General Staff and current overall theater commander Army General Valery Gerasimov on an unspecified date, but likely after the rebellion … Another Russian source claimed that an “atmosphere of suspicion has enveloped the General Staff” and that affiliates of Gerasimov are accused of indecision and failure while the affiliates of deputy commander of the joint grouping of forces in Ukraine Army General Sergei Surovikin are accused of complicity in the rebellion. The ISW said the sources had largely been accurate in their previous reporting on Russian command changes but emphasised that it could not confirm any of the reports Russian president Vladimir Putin greeted supporters in a rare up-close public appearance on Wednesday, after arriving in the remote southern region of Dagestan on the Caspian Sea, 2,000km from Moscow. The appearance appeared to be an attempt to repair the damage done to his image wreaked by the weekend’s mutiny, as he tries to portray himself as retaining popular support with the whole of the Russian people behind him. He flew to the city of Derbent in the mostly Muslim region to mark the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha and visit an ancient citadel and historic mosque where he took a tour and stopped to kiss fans, pose for selfies and shake hands with cheering crowds. It was an unusual move for a secretive president whom one senior security official once described as “pathologically afraid for his life”, requiring his staff to undergo a two-week quarantine during the pandemic. The length of the tables Putin used to greet foreign leaders last year was widely seen as both a power play and a way to socially distance himself for fear of infection. The death toll in a Russian missile strike on a restaurant in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk has risen to 12, after another body was pulled from the rubble early on Thursday, Ukrainian emergency services have said. Three children were among the dead, it said in a tweet, and 60 people were injured, including one child. Earlier reports had said four children were among the dead. “Emergency and rescue operations have been completed,” the emergency services added. Ukrainian forces are advancing “slowly but surely” on the front lines in the east and southeast of the country as well as around the longstanding flashpoint of Bakhmut, senior military officials have said, according to Reuters. The news wire reported: Ukrainian commander-in-chief General Valerii Zaluzhnyi told chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff Mark Milley that the that his forces had “succeeded in seizing the strategic initiative.” “Ukraine‘s defence forces are proceeding with their offensive action and we have made advances. The enemy is offering strong resistance, while sustaining considerable losses,” Zaluzhnyi wrote on Telegram. He told Milley about weapons needed by Ukrainian forces as well as demining equipment – Ukrainian officials have cited large tracts of mined territory as an impediment to any advance. Reuters also reported that deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar, speaking on national television, had noted advances in sectors in the south designated by two occupied towns – Berdiansk and Mariupol. “Every day, there is an advance,” Maliar said. “Yes, the advances are slow, but they are sure.” She cited the recapture this week of the village of Rivnopol in the southeast, saying “mopping up operations were complete” and that the army was now well dug in. Ukrainian military analyst Oleksander Musiyenko said Ukrainian gains on the fringes of Bakhmut were probably a prelude for plans to recapture other areas, including the long-contested towns of Aviivka and Maryinka. “It makes no sense to enter Bakhmut itself now. The risk is too great,” he told Ukrainian NV Radio “But in the east, Ukraine has gradually taken over the initiative. Ukraine has improved its tactical positions without sending in significant reserves.” Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. Ukrainian forces are making progress in the south and southeast of the country, military officials have said. “Ukraine’s defence forces are proceeding with their offensive action and we have made advances,” the country’s commander-in-chief General Valerii Zaluzhnyi wrote on Telegram. “The enemy is offering strong resistance, while sustaining considerable losses.” Deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Ukraine had made advances in sectors in the south designated by two occupied towns – Berdiansk and Mariupol. “Every day, there is an advance,” Maliar said on national televsion. “Yes, the advances are slow, but they are sure.” In Russia meanwhile, president Vladimir Putin went on a rare public walkabout in Dagestan, shaking hands and posing for selfies in an apparent attempt to counter the damage to his image wreaked by the weekend’s Wagner rebellion. It was an unusual move for a secretive president whom one senior security official once described as “pathologically afraid for his life”, requiring his staff to undergo a two-week quarantine during the pandemic. In other developments: A Russian general who previously led the invasion force in Ukraine has not been seen in public since Saturday. The New York Times, citing anonymous US intelligence sources, reported that General Sergei Surovikin had prior knowledge of the uprising led by the Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, with whom he had well publicised links. Surovikin is the head of the Russian aerospace forces and was formerly Moscow’s supreme commander in Ukraine.

The SBU said it had arrested an employee of a gas transportation company who helped coordinate the strike and allegedly sent video footage of the cafe to the Russian military. It provided no evidence for the claims. Putin has said that he “didn’t doubt” that he had the support of Russians during the mutiny. In a meeting with the head of the southern Russian province of Dagestan, parts of which were aired on state television, he said: “I did not doubt the reaction in Dagestan and in all of the country.” US president Joe Biden said Putin “was clearly losing the war” but that it was too early to tell whether he had been weakened by the Wagner rebellion. “He’s losing the war at home, and he has become a bit of a pariah around the world,” he added. German chancellor Olaf Scholz said the failed mutiny had weakened Putin but the implications for his invasion of Ukraine remained unclear. “I do believe he is weakened as this shows that the autocratic power structures have cracks in them and he is not as firmly in the saddle as he always asserts,” Scholz said in an interview with broadcaster ARD. Ukraine’s defence minister says he expects a guarantee that his country will be invited to join Nato at the conclusion of the war with Russia, describing membership as non-negotiable. Before a meeting of Nato leaders in Vilnius next month, Oleksii Reznikov said Kyiv recognised that accession to the military alliance was not possible while the conflict continued, but insisted hard pledges for the future would need to be made. The presidents of Lithuania and Poland, Gitanas Nausėda and Andrzej Duda, visited Kyiv, with Nausėda confirming that his country will supply Ukraine with two Nasams launchers within three months. The visit comes ahead of an EU leaders summit which begins on Thursday. Duda warned the presence of Wagner troops in Belarus could pose a potential threat to the region. “It is difficult for us to exclude today that the presence of the Wagner group in Belarus could pose a potential threat to Poland, which shares a border with Belarus, a threat to Lithuania … as well as potentially to Latvia,” Duda said. UK officials are coordinating with the EU over plans to seize the interest on billions of frozen Russian assets and send the proceeds to Ukraine, the UK’s Europe minister, Leo Docherty, has said. The transfer of the interest on frozen Russian assets is seen as one of the most legally viable routes to use Russian assets to help the recovery of Ukraine. Kyiv has appointed Herman Smetanin as the new head of state-owned weapons producer Ukroboronprom. “The newly appointed general director faces three main tasks: to increase the production of ammunition and military equipment, build an effective anti-corruption infrastructure in the company, and transform Ukroboronprom,” said Oleksander Kamyshyn, the minister for Ukraine’s strategic industries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/10/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-229-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-10T14:09:59Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 229 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/10/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-229-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/10/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-229-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 229 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At least 11 people have died and 64 have been wounded in a wave of Russian missile strikes across Ukraine, according to Ukrainian police. Authorities in Kyiv said eight people had died and 24 were injured in a Russian missile strike on the capital’s Shevchenkivskyi district this morning. Lviv, Kherson, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv were also among the areas targeted. Barely hours after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, denounced the bridge attack on Saturday as an “act of terrorism” that he blamed on Ukraine’s secret services, missiles slammed into the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, during morning rush hour, striking targets including a popular tourist bridge and a major road junction. According to Ukraine’s military, by mid-morning on Monday, 75 missiles had been launched, of which it claimed over 40 had been intercepted. In an update in the midst of the attack, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russia had fired dozens of missiles as well as Iranian-made kamikaze drones, adding that Russia’s main targets appeared to be energy infrastructure and civilians. He said his country was “dealing with terrorists”. Speaking outside the presidential office near where some of the missiles hit, Zelenskiy accused Russia of “deliberately choosing such a time, such goals, in order to cause as much harm as possible”, he said. Putin has threatened a “harsh response” if attacks continue against Russia. In televised remarks after the wave of attacks, Putin once again blamed Ukraine for the Kerch bridge attack, describing it as a “terrorist attack aimed at the destruction of civil critical important infrastructure of Russia”. Russia had launched long-range missile attacks against Ukraine’s energy, military and communications infrastructure today in retaliation for the bridge attack, he said. “It is simply impossible to leave crimes of this kind unanswered,” he said. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said 11 infrastructure facilities in eight regions and in the capital, Kyiv, had been damaged in the Russian strikes. The building housing the German consulate in Kyiv was hit by a Russian missile strike, according to a German foreign ministry spokesperson. Although the consulate was housed in the building, it has not been operational since February. Romania’s foreign minister, Bogdan Aurescu, said a Russian missile strike on Kyiv landed 850 metres from the Romanian embassy. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, made an immediate appeal to the west for the supply of increased air defence systems. Zelenskiy said he had agreed with German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, an urgent meeting of G7 leaders in response. Kuleba has cut short a tour of African nations to return to Kyiv. The G7 will hold a call on Tuesday. In an urgent round of diplomatic calls, Scholz, French president Emmanuel Macron, and the UK’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, all reiterated their support for Ukraine. Alexander De Croo said the bombardment of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv and of civilian targets in other Ukrainian cities on Monday was “a reprehensible act by Russia”. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, condemned the “horrific and indiscriminate” missile attacks on civilian targets. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said he was “deeply shocked” by the Russian air strikes. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said she was “shocked and appalled by the vicious attack on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. Russia once again has shown to the world what it stands for – it is terror and brutality.” Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, unequivocally labelled Monday’s actions by Russia as war crimes. President Zelenskiy said Ukraine “counts on Britain’s leadership” after a phone call with the UK prime minister, Liz Truss, on Monday. Zelenskiy’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he also spoke with his UK counterpart, James Cleverly, who assured him of Britain’s unwavering support of Ukraine. Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, is among authorities in the areas struck to appeal to residents to try to limit electric consumption to preserve supplies. The International Committee of the Red Cross has paused its operations in Ukraine for security reasons, according to a spokesperson. The BBC’s Hugo Bachega ducked for cover during a live broadcast which was interrupted as rockets rained down on Kyiv. Belarus leader, Alexander Lukashenko, said Belarus and Russia would deploy a joint military task force on the country’s western borders in response to what he called an aggravation of tension. Moldova’s foreign minister, Nicu Popescu, summoned Russia’s ambassador to explain why missiles launched from the Black Sea into Ukraine crossed Moldova’s airspace. Poland’s border guard said that the electricity has failed on Ukraine’s side of border crossings at Medyka and Korczowa, but that they are still working normally. The crossings border Ukraine’s Lviv region, where there are reported power outages after Russian strikes on critical infrastructure earlier this morning. A power line that was cut by shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been restored, according to the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). “Engineers restored external power to Zaporizhzhya NPP today, a day after the facility lost the connection to this last remaining operating power line due to shelling — enabling ZNPP to start switching off its emergency diesel generators,” the IAEA said. NEW The president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, will visit Moscow on Tuesday to meet Vladimir Putin, UAE state media reported. Mohammed “will discuss with President Putin the friendly relations between the UAE and Russia along with a number of regional and international issues and developments of common interest”, the UAE’s state-owned news agency WAM said. Vladimir Putin may meet Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, at a summit in Kazakhstan this week, the Kremlin said. Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters it was “possible” the pair could discuss a Turkish proposal to host talks between Russia and the west on Ukraine. Denmark’s Baltic Sea island of Bornholm, located near the presumed sabotage attack on Nord Stream’s gas pipelines, on Monday suffered an unexplained power outage, electricity operator Energinet said. Latvia’s prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš, has called on EU leaders to stop all tourist visas for Russians, reigniting the debate about further tightening sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The Council of Europe awarded detained Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza the Vaclav Havel human rights prize on Monday for what it called his bravery in standing up to Russia’s leaders. Russian divers are to examine the extent of the damage caused by the blast on the road-and-rail bridge. Crimea’s Russian governor, Sergei Aksyonov, told reporters that residents would manage despite the damage to the bridge. “Of course, emotions have been triggered and there is a healthy desire to seek revenge,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/17/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-175-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T11:12:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 175 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/17/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-175-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/17/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-175-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 175 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russian military leaders are likely to be “increasingly concerned” about security in Crimea after reported explosions, a British intelligence update said. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said both Russian and Ukrainian authorities admitted that an ammunition dump exploded on Tuesday near Dzhankoi in the north of the region and that a nearby railway and sub-station were also damaged. The update said Russian media also reported smoke rising near the Gvardeyskoye airbase. And while the “the cause of these incidents and the extent of the damage is not yet clear”, Russian commanders are likely to be “increasingly concerned” with security in the region that Russia annexed in 2014. In the Donetsk region at the forefront of the Russian offensive, two civilians were killed and seven others were wounded by recent Russian shelling of several towns and villages. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, confirmed the latest casualties on Telegram. The area has been the subject of heavy shelling by the Russian military in recent weeks as they try to make tactical advances in the Donbas region. A recreation centre has been destroyed and three people injured after Russian shelling in Odesa, a top official has said. Sergey Bratchuk, a representative of the Odesa military administration, said a fire broke out and nearby buildings were damaged after the attack. In a post on the Telegram messaging app he said the damage was caused by two enemy rockets. A rescue operation is continuing, he added. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, has warned residents in the western city to prepare for a tough winter. In a video posted to his social media accounts, he said: “It’s likely that we’re in for a difficult winter. It’s logical – there can’t be anything simple in a country that fights for its independence. But we have to be prepared for everything.” He added that the city’s authorities had worked on an action plan for any emergencies “that may arise as a result of an enemy attack”. There could be more attacks in the “next two or three months” similar to the strikes in Crimea, a key adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine was engaged in a counteroffensive aimed at creating “chaos within Russian forces” by striking at the invaders’ supply lines deep into occupied territories. Ukraine has hinted it was behind a series of mysterious and devastating strikes in occupied Crimea that destroyed a key railway junction used for supplying Russian troops and a military airbase. Several explosions on Tuesday appeared to have destroyed a Russian ammunition depot and an electricity substation about 125 miles (200km) from the frontline with Ukrainian forces. Russia blamed saboteurs for orchestrating the series of explosions. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet to review the grain export deal in Lviv on Thursday. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said. Ukraine’s nuclear operator reported what it called an “unprecedented” cyber-attack on its website, but said its operations had not been disrupted. “On 16 August 2022, the most powerful cyber-attack since the start of the Russian invasion occurred against Energoatom’s website,” the operator said, adding it “was attacked from Russian territory”. North Korea and the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk will develop “equally beneficial bilateral cooperation”, Denis Pushilin, the head of the separatist administration, said in a letter to Kim Jong-un, North Korean state media reported on Wednesday. The first ship to depart Ukraine under a grain export deal docked in Syria on Tuesday, according to a shipping source and satellite data. Another ship carrying the first cargo of food aid bound for Africa also left Ukraine’s ports. Russia’s defence ministry has warned Britain against a planned spy plane flight over Russian territory, saying its air force has been given orders to prevent an intrusion. The ministry said the UK sent a notice informing about a planned flight of an RC-135 reconnaissance plane along a route that partly passes over Russian territory. “We regard this action as a deliberate provocation,” the ministry said. Estonian authorities removed a Soviet-era tank from its pedestal in the eastern city of Narva, the most significant removal yet out of an estimated 200 to 400 such monuments that the government has pledged to take down by the end of the year. “No one wants to see our militant and hostile neighbour foment tensions in our home,” the prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said on Tuesday. Estonia will also this week close its border to more than 50,000 Russians with previously issued visas. Finland says it will cut the number of visas it issues to Russians to 10% of current volumes from 1 September after Russian tourists began using the country as a gateway to European holiday destinations. Finland will also join the Baltic states in jointly proposing the discontinuation of an EU visa facilitation agreement with Russia that makes it easier and cheaper for Russians to travel to and within the EU, the foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/05/putin-appears-to-admit-severe-russian-losses-in-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-05T18:09:02Z","webTitle":"Putin appears to admit severe Russian losses in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/05/putin-appears-to-admit-severe-russian-losses-in-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/05/putin-appears-to-admit-severe-russian-losses-in-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Putin appears to admit severe Russian losses in Ukraine","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to concede the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals in Ukraine, insisting Russia would “stabilise” the situation in four Ukrainian regions it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. Russia has suffered significant losses in two of the four regions since Friday, when Putin signed treaties to incorporate them into Russia by force, with Russian officials saying their forces were “regrouping”. “We are working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise,” Putin told Russian teachers during a televised video call. With Ukraine pushing its advance in the east and south, Russian troops have been retreating under pressure on both fronts, confronted by fast moving and agile Ukrainian forces supplied with advanced western-supplied artillery systems. As Russian troops have retreated, they have left behind smashed towns once under occupation and, in places, mass burial sites and evidence of torture chambers. In the town of Lyman, which was retaken by Ukrainian forces on Sunday, more than 50 graves have been found, some marked with names, others with numbers, the Kyiv-based outlet Hromadske reported on Wednesday. Putin’s comments comes amid increasingly gloomy commentary from Russian war correspondents and military bloggers over the severity of the situation that has seen a large-scale withdrawal from the Kharkiv region, the loss of the strategic town of Lyman on Friday and Ukrainian advances in the Kherson region. The scale of the recent defeats was underlined by a report by the BBC’s Russian service that said an elite Russian military intelligence unit may have lost up to three-quarters of its reconnaissance manpower in Ukraine. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s southern command said it had extended its area of control by six to 12 miles in the Kherson region and the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, confirmed the recapture of a series of villages. The territory recaptured is to the south of the city of Kryvyi Rih in the direction of Nova Kakhovka as well as west along the north bank of the Dnipro river towards Kherson. “The Ukrainian army is making quite fast and powerful progress in the south of our country,” said Zelenskiy in his nightly address on Tuesday. “Dozens of settlements have already been exempted from the Russian pseudo-referendum this week alone … and this is far from a complete list.” He named eight villages in the Kherson region. Some Russian propagandists and officials blamed the losses on Nato. “We are regrouping [our forces] along the front, which means that we can gather strength and strike back,” Kirill Stremousov, the Moscow-appointed deputy head of Kherson region, told the RIA Novosti news agency. Stremousov said it was “impossible” for them to enter Kherson city. A Russian war reporter for state TV, Roman Saponkov, wrote to his Telegram followers that Russia was losing in Kherson. “Friends, I know you’re waiting for me to comment on the situation. But I really don’t know what to say to you. The retreat from the north on the right bank is a disaster.” The losses came as Putin ordered on Wednesday his government to take control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, but was met with the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company saying he was taking charge and urging workers not to sign any documents with Russia. Military experts say Russia is at its weakest point, partly because of its decision not to mobilise earlier and partly because of massive losses of troops and equipment. About 15,000 of Russia’s best-trained troops are struggling to fight off Ukrainians on the western bank of occupied Kherson, despite movements of Russian troops from the eastern front to the south, which has thinned Russian forces elsewhere. According to Jack Watling, a senior analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, Russian troops around Kherson have retreated to their second line of defence to shorten their frontline. “There’s no evidence of surrender or collapse [of Russian forces] … like we saw in Kharkiv region,” said Watling, noting the political importance for Russia of holding on to Kherson city, the only regional centre it has managed to acquire since February. But if Ukraine’s forces manage to break through Russia’s second line of defence, they will be able to cut the Russian supply lines with a wider range of cheaper artillery and trap them on the western bank of Kherson, he added. “At the moment, the bridges are being hit by Himars [rockets], which are scarce and very expensive … [if they advance further] they can afford to open up against more incidental targets,” said Watling of the bridges supplying Russian forces on Kherson’s west bank. Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at St Andrews University, added that Ukraine’s recent progress had been a product of a process, not a turning point. “For months now, Russia has been getting weaker, it has been bleeding its army on the field, it’s been losing a huge amount of equipment. On the other hand, the Ukrainians have been getting stronger; they have better-trained forces and better military equipment.” He added: “This hasn’t happened overnight, this has been the way the war has been trending but now we can say it reached the tipping point in September.” In the short term there is nothing Russia can do because they waited too long to mobilise, O’Brien said. Russia, meanwhile, has continued to attack behind Ukraine’s frontlines, a mixture of military and civilian targets. On Wednesday morning, it launched a significant drone attack on Bila Tserkva in Kyiv region and fired rockets into Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro region. But O’Brien doubted Russia had enough quality missiles to alter the situation behind the frontlines to affect the battlefield. “It’s more of a question of, can they just hold on and hope that they can get a trained and re-equipped force back in the spring, but even then there’s a question about whether they can do that,” said O’Brien. He said Russia would need to produce more equipment and properly train troops but its system of mobilisation appeared “chaotic”. Konrad Muzyka, an independent military analyst, said he had initially thought the war may last for years, but after the Kharkiv region, it could be much less. “It does not look good for [Russia] … They are not able to defend properly, let alone conduct any offensives,” said Muzyka. “This Russian leadership thinks with [new] reservists they will be able to stop Ukrainian advances, but I’m not sure. The truth is, we don’t know how big an impact it will [have] on the frontline.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/sep/01/liz-truss-oil-gas-energy-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T11:00:18Z","webTitle":"Liz Truss puts hard-right ideology above lives – and is backing oil and gas to prove it | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/01/liz-truss-oil-gas-energy-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/01/liz-truss-oil-gas-energy-climate-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Liz Truss puts hard-right ideology above lives – and is backing oil and gas to prove it","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"How best to describe wilfully vandalising the planet and threatening human life to satisfy ideological bloodlust? Liz Truss – already a plausible contender for the “worst prime minister ever” gong before she even assumes office – apparently intends to issue up to 130 drilling licences for oil and gas firms. If the purpose of this is to confront the looming social catastrophe of energy bills, to describe it as an exercise in futility would be generous: it takes the best part of three decades to pump fossil fuels out of the ground and put them onstream. As Russia switches off Europe’s flow of gas via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline – it implausibly cites maintenance work as the reason – the need for drastic, swift action could not be more obvious, yet our soon-to-be prime minister has nothing meaningful to offer. There are other paths. New renewable energy capacity secured by the government will cost only £48 per megawatt hour – compared with the current cost of running gas-fired power stations, which has surged to around £450 per MWh. (And, depending on the impact of action from the EU, it could rise further.) Renewables, therefore, are around nine times cheaper and far quicker to plug into our energy system. What possible reason is there not to make wind and solar the central pillars of an effective strategy to build energy independence and help stop millions being plunged into destitution? What explains this suicidal strategy? It is undoubtedly that the ideological predilections of the Tory right are prioritised above the Earth’s survival, energy independence and people’s livelihoods. Renewables are indelibly culturally associated with dangerous lefty nonsense, while gas and oil somehow represent macho British tradition. That the case for renewables is based both on pragmatic economics and incontrovertible scientific facts is irrelevant. It is hard not to conclude, too, that an addiction to waging eternal culture war is at play. Much of the behaviour of the modern right is driven by a desire to offend their opponents; like announcing they have passed wind, they want you to be aware of and disgusted by their actions. If you want to see such ideological spite in all its glory, consider the fact that onshore wind is a mere £50 per MWh, but has essentially been banned by the government. Why? Not because it’s unpopular – polling suggests that three-quarters back it, including a large majority of Tory voters. And not because another much less popular option they’ve also swung behind – expanding nuclear power stations – is cheaper. Nuclear plants are far more expensive and – toxic nuclear waste aside – still take so long to build that they would do little to address the current emergency. It gets worse: Truss has committed to change planning laws to hinder the development of solar power, trashing an energy source that costs just £55 per MWh. “Our fields shouldn’t be full of solar panels” she crows, while our streets will be filled with hungry kids and cold pensioners. This may explain, too, why David Cameron – who began his leadership by changing the Tory logo into a tree – demanded cutting the “green crap”. It was a commitment the Tories followed up on: while more than 2 million households were insulated in 2012, that plummeted to around quarter of a million a year later, and less than 100,000 in 2020. The consequence? An analysis by Carbon Brief showed that the insulation gap, along with cuts to wind and solar, will cost households an extra £150 a year – and that’s before we mention the loss of skilled jobs that mass insulation programmes support. Avoiding this looming, avoidable humanitarian catastrophe is crucial. So too is saving the planet. This week, scientists concluded that the Greenland ice cap melting will inevitably mean major rises in sea levels, threatening to overwhelm coastal areas and all those who live in them. A decisive shift to renewable energy offers hope of at least mitigating this calamity, while expanding UK drilling means pouring North Sea oil on to the inferno. The taxpayer is expected to carry a financial burden of subsidies to fossil fuel companies wthat will cost them twice over: it will cost them now in the pocket, and it will cost them a sustainable future. Britain’s direction is clear: Truss’s Britain will be governed by policies lifted from cliched Daily Mail headlines. All the bêtes noires of saloon-bar reactionaries from the past 20 years will be slaughtered, and the resulting anguish from those effete metropolitan lefties obsessed with mere trivialities such as avoiding mass impoverishment and the destruction of the planet will give the Tory faithful their kicks. While Labour’s refusal to confront the issue of utility ownership closes off the possibility of a long-term solution – and fuels the transfer of wealth from taxpayer to shareholder – at least their windfall tax to scoop away the ludicrous profits of energy giants to suppress bills offers some relief. As things stand, Truss only serves up a tray of niche hard-right poison pills that do nothing to address the three intersecting crises – living standards, energy independence and climate. And, yes, Truss may crave the disgust of those lefty do-gooders, but come winter, many of the Tories own true believers will be shivering in their homes, too.

The comparison to the former Iraqi minister who gained cult status for his outrageous lies came during a fractious prime minister’s questions, with Starmer saying Johnson was complacent about people’s “blindingly obvious” economic problems. The Labour leader said a mooted plan to let motorists get MOTs lasting two years instead of one made the ill-fated 1990s “cones hotline” look “visionary and inspirational”. He said Johnson was “only just waking up to the cost of living crisis” and had acted like an ostrich. Johnson accused Starmer of “droning on” and dismissed his call for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help bring down people’s energy bills, saying: “This guy is doomed to be a permanent spectator.” In their final public pitches before next week’s local elections, the two leaders traded blows during a session that was focused mainly on the economy. Johnson was tackled over an anonymous Tory MP’s briefing to the Mail on Sunday accusing Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, of crossing and uncrossing her legs in the House of Commons chamber to distract the prime minister. Starmer said the UK was on course to have the slowest growth and highest inflation in the G7, and he said Johnson was failing to properly manage the economy. In a series of targeted questions designed to pin responsibility for the cost of living crisis on the government, Starmer said ministers were making life worse for working people with last month’s “tax-hiking budget” and by failing to help those whose fuel bills have spiralled. “They’re the party of excess profits, we’re the party of working people,” Starmer said. He accused ministers of letting prices “get out of control”, denying it was happening and failing to do anything about it. “A vote for Labour next week is a vote for a very different set of choices,” Starmer said. He said his party would ask oil and gas companies to pay their fare share, insulate homes to get bills down and close tax avoidance schemes by scrapping non-dom status. But Johnson repeatedly branded Starmer “Captain Hindsight”, saying the cost of living crisis was affecting people around the world and insisting: “This government is tackling it.” He said the recently published energy security strategy would “undo the mistakes of the previous Labour government” by pushing for a new nuclear power station to be built every year instead of every decade. Johnson dismissed the windfall tax on offshore energy companies, saying it would “clobber the very businesses that we need to invest in energy to bring the prices down for people across this country.” The prime minister said a record number of jobs were being created and the Conservatives’ plans were better than Labour’s “by a mile”. He added: “Never forget, Labour-run Britain in 2010 – bankrupt because of what the Labour government did. They said they had no money left.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/05/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-223-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-05T13:56:12Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 224 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/05/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-223-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/05/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-223-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 224 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed the four laws ratifying the Russian Federation’s claimed annexation of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Russian forces do not fully control any of the four areas, and it remains unclear where Russia is attempting to set its new external border. Ukraine has made major and rapid advances this week, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying in an address on Tuesday night that “dozens” of towns have been recaptured. Ukrainian forces captured the town of Dudchany on the west bank of the Dnipro River in their major advance in Kherson region, and in the east, Ukrainian forces were advancing after capturing Lyman, the main Russian bastion in the north of Donetsk province. Russia is at risk of losing control of the strategic towns critical to retaining the city of Kherson and eventually Crimea, western officials have judged, but they warned the fighting along the Dnipro river “will not be an easy rush into constrained territory”. Zelenskiy on Tuesday signed a decree formally declaring the prospect of any Ukrainian talks with Vladimir Putin “impossible”. The decree formalised comments made by Zelenskiy on Friday after the Russian president proclaimed the four occupied regions of Ukraine were to become part of Russia. Pro-Russian leaders in the occupied regions have claimed that the situation is stabilising this morning. Denis Pushilin, installed as governor in Donetsk by Russia has said “the situation on the front line in the Lyman direction is stabilising, the defence line is being strengthened”, while Kirill Stremousov, part of the occupiation administration imposed on Kherson, has been quoted saying that Russian forces were “conducting a regrouping in order to gather their strength and deliver a retaliatory blow” in the region, and that “the advance of the armed forces of Ukraine in the Kherson direction has stopped.” The UK ministry of defence has said in its daily operational briefing that “Ukraine continues to make progress in offensive operations along both the north-eastern and southern fronts. In the north-east, in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine has now consolidated a substantial area of territory east of the Oskil River.” Putin said in televised comments that he signed a decree making “corrections” to the partial mobilisation drive he announced 21 September. The Russian preisdent said the decree would defer conscription for additional categories of students, including those enrolled at accredited private universities and certain postgraduate students. The EU has agreed to set a price cap on Russian oil and ban trade in numerous technical and consumer goods, as part of further sanctions designed to counter Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. The latest round of sanctions, the eighth since February, were signed off by EU ambassadors on Wednesday, a week since the measures were proposed, a time scale regarded as lightning speed in Brussels. Russia’s foreign ministry has said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) will operate under the supervision of Russian agencies after the annexation declaration. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since the earliest days of the war. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-enterprise that owns the plant, has said it may restart it to ensure safety. Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, said that overnight “the enemy fired rockets at the regional centre and the outskirts of the city. Infrastructure facilities were destroyed.” Zelenskiy has posted a series of images of damaged buildings across social media from recently liberated Lyman, with the message “Our Lyman after the occupier. All basics of life have been destroyed here. They are doing so everywhere in the territories they seize. This can be stopped in one way only: liberate Ukraine, life, humanity, law and truth as soon as possible.” Russian TV journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, famous for staging an on-air protest against Russia’s war in Ukraine, confirmed she had escaped house arrest over further charges of spreading fake news, saying she had no case to answer. Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, says Washington’s decision to send more military aid to Ukraine poses a threat to Moscow’s interests and increases the risk of a military clash between Russia and the west. Russia’s foreign ministry said that it had expelled a Lithuanian diplomat. The British Prime Minister Liz Truss has said that Ukraine “will win” and that no peace deal should give away Ukrainian territory. She said “The Ukrainian people aren’t just fighting for their security but for all of our security. This is a fight for freedom and democracy around the world. We should not give in to those who want a deal which trades away Ukrainian land. They are proposing to pay in Ukrainian lives for the illusion of peace. We will stand with our Ukrainian friends, however long it takes. Ukraine can win. Ukraine must win. And Ukraine will win.” France’s junior minister for European affairs Laurence Boone has clarified the situation in which Russians fleeing the partial mobilisation for the war in Ukraine can obtain visas to stay in France, saying “We have limited conditions under which visas can be given. We will make sure dissident journalists, people who fight the regime, artists and students can still come here, and we will issue visas on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the security risks.” The UN has outlined the “unspeakable suffering and devastation” inflicted on Ukrainians. Christian Salazar Volkmann, presenting a report on rights in Ukraine to the UN human rights council in Geneva, said “disturbing accounts” were emerging of violations in detention, of both civilians and prisoners of war, while enforced disappearances and arbitrary detention had become “widespread” in territory controlled by Russia and its proxies. There were two documented cases of Ukrainian servicemen having been tortured to death, he said. About 2,000 videos, photographs and audio files of alleged war crimes have been submitted to the UN mandated international commission of inquiry (UN COI) on Ukraine. The footage was captured through an app designed to create verifiable evidence. Two women in Russia-annexed Crimea, including Miss Crimea, have been found guilty of discrediting the Russian army by singing a patriotic Ukrainian song. European Union finance ministers agreed Tuesday to integrate the EU’s support payments to Ukraine into its 2023 budget to make payments more structured and predictable. Russia’s retreat from Lyman has sparked vociferous criticism of the handling of the war on Russian state television. Vladimir Solovyov, host of a primetime talkshow on state TV channel Russia 1 and one of the Kremlin’s biggest cheerleaders, said on air on Sunday: “We need to pull it together, make unpopular, but necessary decisions and act.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/sep/21/albania-dalmatian-pelican-colony-narta-faces-threat-vlora-airport-aoe","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-21T06:30:21Z","webTitle":"Albania’s pelican colony was bouncing back.

Now it faces the threat of a new airport ","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Half a dozen Dalmatian pelicans fly off as we approach the Narta lagoon, a marshland near Vlora in south-west Albania. It is a majestic sight – six elegantly soaring birds, with necks tilted back and wingspans almost matching that of an albatross. “They’re juveniles,” says Taulant Bino, head of the Albanian Ornithological Society (AOS). “They might start their own family in the next years.” Although Dalmatian pelicans (Pelecanus crispus) do not breed here, the lagoon serves as an important feeding site for the birds and many more species, including flamingos, gull-billed terns and Kentish plovers. Migratory birds use the lagoon as a stopover during their long journey between Africa and central and northern Europe. They are key Mediterranean wetlands, the type of habitat that covered much of the whole Albanian coast until Enver Hoxha’s dictatorial regime drained large swaths of it in the 1950s and 60s, in an attempt to eradicate malaria and develop the lowlands for agriculture. The Dalmatian pelican’s range spans much of Eurasia – from the Mediterranean in the west to the Taiwan Strait in the east – but it has experienced a decline in the 20th century. A combination of land development, drainage of marshlands, human disturbance and poaching means the bird is considered “near threatened” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This year, avian flu has killed an estimated 2,000 adult birds in Greece and Romania. In Albania, the Dalmatian pelican’s survival counts as one of the country’s biggest conservation successes. Once inhabiting its entire coastal strip, the bird came close to disappearing from the area in the 1990s. When Hoxha’s totalitarian regime ended in 1991, a state of anarchy ensued. “In those days, everyone had guns, which means everyone was a potential hunter,” says Aleksandër Trajçe, head of Protection and Preservation of Natural Environment in Albania (PPNEA). “Even just a few trigger-happy individuals with crazy ideas could cause a lot of damage.” By 2000, when Bino began working to save the birds, only 19 nests remained in Divjaka-Karavasta national park – the country’s only breeding colony, 25 miles north of Narta – down from 81 pairs in 1984. According to Trajçe, legal protection proved crucial in reversing the downward trend. “Initially, only the pine forest of Divjaka was a protected area,” he says. “In 1996, the lagoon got protected status. And in 2007, the entire area, from the Shkumbin River in the north to the Seman River in the south, was declared a national park.” Vjosa-Narta became a protected landscape in 2004. A hunting moratorium in 2014, although poorly implemented, added another layer of protection; international conservation efforts also helped. Now, from January to June each year, when pelicans breed and raise their chicks, wardens guard the nests day and night, preventing tourists, poachers and fishers from disturbing the birds. “At night, local fishermen use flashlights to catch fish, which make the pelicans sometimes abandon their nest,” says Bino. “And when we realised eggs got lost in floods, we created heightened breeding beds from sticks, branches and vegetation. The colony started bouncing back.” In 2020, 85 pelican pairs nested in Albania, the highest number since records began. Now, however, the pelicans are facing a fresh onslaught – this time from bulldozers. The Albanian government has approved the construction of an international airport at Vlora in an effort to boost the country’s tourism industry. The planned airport’s location, within the protected landscape surrounding Narta lagoon, could have devastating consequences for the birds, says Trajçe. “It will reduce the birds’ ability to move around and to feed, and, as a consequence, their potential to increase in number or expand their habitat.” The airport project will also put pressure on migration routes between Africa and northern Europe. “Albania has lagoons scattered along its coast,” says Trajçe. “Migratory birds use those to rest and feed. Building an airport right in the middle would interrupt bird movements that have been happening for thousands of years.” A consortium of three companies won the bid to build the airport – YDA Group (a Turkish conglomerate with ties to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s party), Mabetex and 2A Group. According to the consortium’s environmental impact study, the negative effects of the airport on surrounding wildlife can be easily mitigated – for example, by not working on construction during the breeding season and by rerouting flights during spring and autumn migration. But more than 40 conservation organisations, including PPNEA and AOS, have questioned this. “Different species breed at different times, which would mean for construction to be stopped for a few months,” says Trajçe. “And what about the impact during the operational phase? Are they going to stop flights during the breeding season as well? What about the migration season? It all seems highly unrealistic.” The conservation organisations say there was a lack of public consultation and a superficial assessment of alternative sites. “It might seem more expensive to build the airport elsewhere,” says Dorian Matlija, a lawyer advising the organisations, “but only if you don’t consider the damage to the environment.” In December 2020, authorities reviewed the network of protected areas in Albania and removed, among others, the site of the planned airport. The conservationists claim that, by redrawing the borders of protected parks, the government is infringing national laws. In its 2020 Albania report, the European Commission said the proposed airport “conflicts with other national laws and with international biodiversity protection conventions that Albania has ratified”. Four of the conservation organisations – PPNEA, AOS, EcoAlbania and the German-based EuroNatur – now plan to go to court over the project. “If removing land from protection goes without legal consequences, it means that the government can do that for every protected area,” says Trajçe. “What’s to stop them from building resorts in protected areas? Or a nuclear power plant? That would be the end of nature conservation.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-253-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-03T14:06:46Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 253 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-253-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-253-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 253 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The UN nuclear watchdog said on Thursday it found no sign of undeclared nuclear activity at three sites in Ukraine that it inspected at Kyiv’s request, in response to Russian allegations that work was being done on a “dirty bomb”. “Our technical and scientific evaluation of the results we have so far did not show any sign of undeclared nuclear activities and materials at these three locations,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said, adding that environmental samples taken would be analysed. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, reacted strongly to the results of the nuclear inspection, saying Russia had confirmed its status as “the world’s top liar”. He said “The IAEA has checked three Ukrainian facilities in focus of Russian disinfo and found no evidence of any ‘dirty bombs’. I thank Rafael Mariano Grossi for IAEA’s excellent and prompt cooperation which helped counter Russian falsehoods. Russia has confirmed its status of the world’s top liar.” The Russian delegation resumed work at the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) that runs the Black Sea grain deal operations in Istanbul and joined vessel inspections on Thursday, the UN secretariat at the centre said. It said the queue for inspections has been significantly reduced, with currently over 120 ships waiting to move, mainly those planning an inbound voyage. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had said Wednesday that Moscow would rejoin the grain export deal brokered by the UN and Turkey with Ukraine, but that it reserved the right to withdraw if necessary. “We demanded assurances and guarantees from the Ukrainian side that nothing like this would happen again, that the humanitarian corridors would not be used militarily,” Putin said during a video meeting with his coordination council on Wednesday. Russia on Thursday urged the United Nations, which sponsored the deal, to help fulfil the parts of the deal intended to ease Russia’s food and fertiliser exports. “We still do not see any results regarding a second aspect: the removal of obstacles to the export of Russian fertilisers and grain,” the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told a news conference in Amman, Jordan. Russian agricultural exports do not fall explicitly under sanctions imposed since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February, but Moscow says they are badly hindered by the restrictions imposed on its financial, logistics and insurance sectors. A Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson said that, contrary to Russian claims, Ukraine has made no new commitments that go beyond the terms originally signed in July. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, welcomed Moscow’s humiliating U-turn and hailed “a significant diplomatic result for our country and the whole world”. “Implementation of the grain export initiative continues,” he said in his Wednesday evening address. “The Kremlin is demanding security guarantees from Ukraine. This shows both the failure of the Russian aggression and how strong we are when we remain united”. The Russian flag has been removed from the Kherson regional administration, a building located on the west bank of the city where Ukrainian forces made significant advances a few weeks ago. Russian forces moved their regional headquarters across the Dnipro river to the left bank of Kherson city, according to Ukraine’s Centre of National Resistance. One of the Russian-imposed leaders of the occupying authorities in Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, posted to Telegram encouraging further civilian “evacuations” from the city – a move that has been described by Kyiv as forced deportations. Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s Southern Command, is urging caution, saying that Russia’s unusual manoeuvres in Kherson might be a trap to lure in Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s grid operator Ukrenergo has confirmed that Russian missile attacks hit energy infrastructure in the Ukrainian regions of Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk late on Wednesday, further complicating the work of the energy system. Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of Dnipropetrovsk region described “a tense night of massive attacks” but said on Thursday morning there were no known casualties. Russian attacks in the Donetsk oblast and Kharkiv oblast have killed at least five civilians in the past day, officials said. The armed forces of Ukraine are estimating that about 730 Russian soldiers were killed yesterday alone, bringing the total to 68,900 personnel lost so far in the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged the remaining high-voltage lines, leaving it with just diesel generators, according to the Ukrainian nuclear firm Energoatom. Olena Zelenska, the wife of Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said she hoped that Elon Musk’s tweet about a peace deal to end the war with Russia was a “chance mistake”. “He supported Ukraine from the very first day and that’s why Ukrainians really admired him,” Zelenska told the Guardian in an interview at the Web Summit in Lisbon. “So it was extremely sensitive for us to read the tweet. Let’s be honest, even the smartest person can’t say the smartest things 24 hours a day. There are mistakes. And we hope it was a chance mistake.” A small anti-British protest in Moscow greeted British ambassador Deborah Bronnert after she was summoned by Russia’s foreign ministry. Russia said in a statement that Bronnert was told “confrontational actions by the British pose the threat of an escalation and can lead to unpredictable and dangerous consequences”. The Russian foreign ministry objected to British agreements to train Ukrainian naval personnel, and accuse Britain of being involved in assisting an attack on the Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol last weekend. Hungary’s parliament will decide on when to schedule a debate on the ratification of Finland’s and Sweden’s applications to join Nato, its foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, told a press conference this morning. Switzerland has committed to providing $106m for Ukraine’s energy infrastructure recovery. Russia said Wednesday it was fully committed to preventing nuclear war, and that avoiding a clash among countries that have nuclear weapons was its highest priority. The Russian foreign ministry said it feared the five declared nuclear powers were teetering “on the brink of a direct armed conflict” and that the west must stop “encouraging provocations with weapons of mass destruction, which can lead to catastrophic consequences”. The White House has accused North Korea of covertly shipping a “significant number” of artillery shells to Russia in support of its invasion of Ukraine amid mounting evidence of shortages for key weapons systems. US National security council spokesperson John Kirby said the US believed North Korea “is covertly supplying” the ammunition to Russia and “trying to make it appear as though they are being sent to countries in the Middle East or north Africa”. Putin called for weapons used by Russia’s military to be modernised during a meeting of his coordination council on Wednesday. “Weapons must constantly, continuously improve and remain effective. To achieve this, I repeat, it is important to ensure that there is active competition between manufacturers and developers,” he said. The UN security council has overwhelmingly rejected Russia’s attempt to establish a commission to investigate its unfounded claims that Ukraine and the United States are carrying out “military biological” activities that violate the convention prohibiting the use of biological weapons. Details have been published of the damage caused to the Nord Stream gas pipeline by explosions at the end of September. Nord Stream AG said that about 250 metres (820ft) of the pipeline in the Baltic Sea was “destroyed”. Two Russian oligarchs and business partners of Roman Abramovich have been added to the UK government’s sanctions list. Alexander Abramov and Alexander Frolov, whom the UK government said were “known to be business associates” of the former Chelsea FC owner, were on Wednesday among four new Russian steel and petrochemical tycoons added to the sanctions list."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/06/russia-ukraine-war-un-to-publish-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-report-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-06T18:00:26Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukraine capturing villages near Kherson, says US; IAEA calls for security zone at Zaporizhzhia – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/06/russia-ukraine-war-un-to-publish-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-report-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/06/russia-ukraine-war-un-to-publish-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-report-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukraine capturing villages near Kherson, says US; IAEA calls for security zone at Zaporizhzhia – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. I’ll be back tomorrow. Here’s a quick recap of where we stand: The Ukrainian military repelled several Russian offensives in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk, the army’s general staff has said. In a situational update on Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian military also claimed the destruction of Russian targets in the Donetsk region. An adviser to the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff said he expected Kyiv to announce “great news” about its counteroffensive in the eastern Kharkiv region on Tuesday evening. The US defence department is seeing Ukrainian offensive forces in the Kherson region “continue to make some forward movement,” including retaking villages, according to a Pentagon official. The US has also seen “some offensive Russian activity … near Bakhmut”, Pentagon press secretary Air Force Brig Gen Pat Ryder said. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk oblast, has said Ukrainian troops have “gained a foothold” in the eastern region. In an update posted on Telegram, Haidai said Ukrainian forces have “advanced a little” in the Luhansk region and have repulsed Russian attacks. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. Ukraine’s forces are conducting counteroffensive actions in the east and south-east of the country, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. Writing on Telegram, Oleksiy Arestovych said Kyiv’s troops had “liberated several settlements on the western bank of the Dnieper” and that Russian forces on the right bank of the Dnieper would be in an “extremely difficult” position within a month. The Russian defence ministry is in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea to support its invasion of Ukraine, according to a newly downgraded US intelligence finding. A US official said the fact Russia was turning to North Korea demonstrated that “the Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions”. A powerful explosion in the occupied city of Enerhodar, which houses the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, has cut off water and electricity supplies, according to the local mayor. Russia’s defence ministry claimed earlier on Tuesday that Ukraine had fired 20 artillery shells on the town of Enerhodar and the area around the facility over a 24-hour period. The UN’s nuclear watchdog has called for the creation of a security zone around the Zaporizhzhia plant on the frontline of Russia’s war in Ukraine. In a long-awaited report that detailed extensive damage there, the IAEA said it was “gravely concerned” about the “unprecedented” situation at the plant and urged interim measures to prevent a nuclear disaster. Russia’s biggest natural gas pipeline to Europe will not resume pumping until Siemens Energy repairs faulty equipment, Gazprom has said. Siemens Energy said an engine oil leak at the last remaining turbine in operation at the Portovaya compressor station did not warrant keeping the pipeline closed. Russia’s foreign ministry has said the US is responsible for Europe’s gas supply crisis by pushing European leaders towards the “suicidal” step of cutting economic and energy cooperation with Moscow. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the “dominance of Washington prevailed” and that political forces playing the role of “sheep-provocateurs” were brought to power in EU countries. The Kremlin said Russia will not resume in full its gas supplies to Europe until the west lifts its sanctions against Moscow, as gas prices surged and the pound and euro slumped. Speaking to journalists on Monday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, blamed sanctions for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. “It is these sanctions imposed by the western states that have brought the situation to what we see now.” The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has blamed Europe’s energy crisis on sanctions it imposed on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine – a line taken by the Kremlin itself. European nations were “harvesting what they sowed” by imposing economic restrictions on Russia, Erdoğan added. The Kremlin has said “with much certainty” that Russia-UK relations will not improve under the leadership of Liz Truss. “Judging by statements made by Madame Truss when she was still foreign minister … one can say with much certainty that no changes for the better are expected,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has criticised Britain’s next prime minister, Liz Truss, for not being able to compromise. The UK will not strengthen its position in the international arena under her leadership, Lavrov said, while also mocking her for saying she did not know if the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was a friend or an enemy. A Russian-appointed official in the occupied city of Berdiansk in southern Ukraine has been seriously injured in a car blast, according to Moscow-installed authorities. Artem Bardin, who was appointed commandant of the Berdiansk’s occupying administration, was taken to hospital in “serious condition”, the pro-Russian mayor’s office said on Telegram, while blaming Ukraine. Ukraine’s major western allies have yet to sign up to establish a tribunal to try Vladimir Putin and his inner circle for the crime of aggression, according to Ukraine’s top officials. Andriy Smyrnov, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, said western allies are “putting their foot in the closing door on relations with Russia so that it doesn’t close completely”. The US president, Joe Biden, has decided not to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terror, the White House said. The designation of Russia as a state sponsor of terror – a label Ukraine has pushed for – could delay food exports and jeopardise deals to move goods through the Black Sea, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said. Jailed Russian opposition politician and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny’s chief of staff has said worsening prison conditions were threatening his health. In a post on his Twitter and Instagram accounts, Navalny wrote last week via his lawyers that he had been sent to a punishment cell for a third time in August in revenge for his political activity. A Russian court has sentenced the journalist Ivan Safronov to 22 years in prison on trumped-up treason charges. The sentencing of Safronov, a former defence reporter for the Kommersant and Vedomosti dailies, shocked friends and supporters who gathered in court on Monday to protest against his imprisonment. Editors at the Russian newspaper Kommersant published a front-page editorial in support of Safronov on Tuesday. Also on Monday, a court in Moscow stripped the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta of its print media licence, effectively banning the newspaper from operating inside Russia. Editor-in-chief, Dmitry Muratov, said the ruling was “a political hit job, without the slightest legal basis”. He said the paper would appeal. The same Russian court then revoked the licence of Novaya Gazeta’s sister magazine, “No” (“But”), on Tuesday. Novaya Gazeta is one of the country’s most important independent publications. Since it was established by Muratov and colleagues in 1993, it has investigated corruption inside and outside Russia, as well as the wars in Chechnya. Russia is burning excess gas because it has no capacity to store it after cutting deliveries to Europe, the EU’s energy commissioner Kadri Simson said. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Indonesia, Simson said: Our satellites are registering the leak of natural gas or them flaring the natural gas and this is very polluting. They don’t have alternative pipeline connections to other regions in the world, and their own underground gas storage is full. The US president, Joe Biden, has decided not to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terror, the White House said. Biden had said previously that Russia should not be designated a state sponsor of terrorism, a label Ukraine has pushed for. The designation of Russia as state sponsor of terror could delay food exports and jeopardise deals to move goods through the Black Sea, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said. The Ukrainian military repelled several Russian offensives in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk, the army’s general staff has said. In a situational update, the general staff said: Units of the Defence Forces of Ukraine hold their positions and prevent the enemy from advancing deeper into the territory of Ukraine. It added: Our military successfully repelled enemy attacks in the areas of Dolyna, Soledar, Novobakhmutivka, Kodema, Zaitseve, Avdiivka, Mariinka, and Lyubomirivka settlements of Donetsk region. The Ukrainian military also claimed the destruction of Russian targets in the Donetsk region. The US defence department is seeing Ukrainian offensive forces in the Kherson region “continue to make some forward movement,” including retaking villages, according to a Pentagon official. At a briefing with reporters, Pentagon press secretary Air Force Brig Gen Pat Ryder said: What we’ve seen in the Kherson region first is some continued offensive operations by the Ukrainians. They continue to make some forward movement. We are aware that they have retaken some villages. The US has also seen “some offensive Russian activity … near Bakhmut”, he added. A powerful explosion in the occupied city of Enerhodar, which houses the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, has cut off water and electricity supplies, according to the local mayor. Writing on Telegram, Dmytro Orlov said: Today at 12:20 residents of Enerhodar reported about a powerful explosion in the city. After that, the electricity and water supply disappeared simultaneously in Enerhodar. Earlier today, Russia’s defence ministry claimed Ukraine had fired 20 artillery shells on the town of Enerhodar and the area around the facility over a 24-hour period. In its daily military briefing, the Kremlin said three shells landed on the territory of the nuclear power station. It has not been possible to independently verify either side’s claims. A Russian-appointed official in the occupied city of Berdiansk in southern Ukraine has been seriously injured in a car blast, according to Moscow-installed authorities. Artem Bardin, who was appointed commandant of the Berdiansk’s occupying administration, was taken to hospital in “serious condition”, the mayor’s office said on Telegram. Bardin’s car exploded in “the very centre of Berdiansk” near the building of the civil-military administration, it said. The mayor’s office said: Today, September 6, in the very centre of Berdiansk, near the building of the Military Civil Administration, the car of the city commandant Artem Bardin was blown up. As a result of the explosion, the city commandant was hospitalised in severe condition. Doctors are providing him with necessary medical care. Although it was not immediately clear what caused the explosion, pro-Russian authorities have blamed Ukraine. The pro-Russian mayor’s office said: The terrorists of the Kyiv regime continue to try to intimidate residents of the liberated territories. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attack. Here’s more on the report by the International Atomic Energy Agency after the UN nuclear watchdog sent a team to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant last week. The IAEA called for the establishment of a “safety and security protection zone” around the nuclear power plant, calling the current situation “untenable”. The report states: There is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means. This can be achieved by the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. The UN agency urged that shelling on site and its vicinity “should be stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant and associated facilities”. In addition to establishing a security zone around the plant, the IAEA recommended that the conditions Ukrainian staff operating the plant are working in should be improved. The report says: Ukrainian staff operating the plant under Russian military occupation are under constant high stress and pressure, especially with the limited staff available. This is not sustainable and could lead to increased human error with implications for nuclear safety. An adviser to the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff has said he expects Kyiv to announce “great news” about its counteroffensive in the eastern Kharkiv region on Tuesday evening. Serhiy Leshchenko wrote on Twitter: Tonight there is going to be a great news from President Zelenskyy on counteroffensive operation in Kharkiv region. He did not give any further details. It’s just past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk oblast, has said Ukrainian troops have “gained a foothold” in the eastern region. In an update posted on Telegram, Haidai said Ukrainian forces have “advanced a little” in the Luhansk region and have repulsed Russian attacks.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has warned there is an “urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident” at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine. In its report, the UN nuclear watchdog said it was “gravely concerned” about the situation at the facility and that ongoing shelling near the plant “represented a constant threat to nuclear safety and security”. The backup power line at the Zaporizhzhia power plant was disconnected to extinguish a fire, officials said on Monday. However, the IAEA said the line itself was not damaged and that the backup line “will be reconnected once the fire has been extinguished”. Russia’s biggest natural gas pipeline to Europe will not resume pumping until Siemens Energy repairs faulty equipment, Gazprom has said. Siemens Energy said an engine oil leak at the last remaining turbine in operation at the Portovaya compressor station did not warrant keeping the pipeline closed.

Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you today with all the latest news from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The team of UN nuclear experts “closely” witnessed shelling in the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant during their visit to the facility, the IAEA report says. They also first-hand observations of damage to the road surface, walls and windows of various buildings, as well as at the overpass connecting the reactor units at the plant. The report continues: The shelling could have impacted safety related structures, systems and components, and could have caused safety significant impacts, loss of lives and personnel injuries. IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, stated that “while past events had not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, they represented a constant threat to nuclear safety and security because critical safety functions could be impacted”, it says. The International Atomic Energy Agency has published its report about the nuclear safety and security situation at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine. The UN nuclear watchdog warns that there is “urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident” at the nuclear plant, adding that it was “gravely concerned” concerned about the situation at the facility. The situation in Ukraine is “unprecedented”, the report writes. It is the first time a military conflict has occurred amid the facilities of a large, established nuclear power programme. A nuclear accident can have serious impacts within the country and beyond its borders. The IAEA added: Pending the end of the conflict and re-establishment of stable conditions there is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means. This can be achieved by the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. Ukraine has urged Hasidic Jewish pilgrims travelling to the war-torn country to skip their annual pilgrimage to the city of Uman this year because of the Russian invasion. Every year, tens of thousands of pilgrims come to Uman from all around the world to visit the tomb of Rabbi Nachman for Rosh Hashana – the Jewish new year, celebrated this year between 25 and 27 September, Agence France-Presse reports. Rabbi Nachman from Breslov (1772-1810) was the founder of an ultra-orthodox movement that settled in Uman in the early 1800s. In a Facebook post, the Ukrainian embassy in Israel said: “When the echoes of the Russian enemy explosions on Ukraine don’t stop, we must take care of ourselves. “Please, avoid coming to Uman on Rosh Hashanah and pray that peace will return to Ukraine and the blessed pilgrimage will be renewed.” Plans have been made for “additional restrictions” in the city already under curfew. More than 10,000 pilgrims from around the world are expected according to regional governor Igor Taburets, who was cited by Interfax-Ukraine. Plans have been made for “additional restrictions” in the city already under curfew, including a ban on street vending and public gatherings because of the “high risk of a terrorist attack”, Taburets said. He added: We know how sly our enemy is. Any public gathering is potentially vulnerable.” Three Royal Navy warships have been shadowing a Russian Navy taskforce in waters close to the UK, PA Media reports. Type 23 frigates HMS Westminster, HMS Lancaster and HMS Richmond tracked Slava-class cruiser, Marshal Ustinov, the sister ship of the ill-fated Moskva which sunk in the Black Sea in April. They have also been keeping a watch on Udaloy-class destroyer, Vice-Admiral Kulakov and tanker Vyazma as the three ships headed home from the eastern Mediterranean after supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine since February. At the same time, patrol ship HMS Mersey has also shadowed Russian military research vessel Akademik Ioffe on its journey south through the Dover shipping lanes into the Channel. A Royal Navy spokesman said: The frigates and their helicopters used an array of cutting-edge sensors and modern naval technology to keep close watch in the Celtic Sea and through the English Channel.” HMS Westminster’s commanding officer (CO) Commander Ed Moss-Ward said: Maritime security in the sea areas around the UK is crucial to our prosperity and resilience. The Royal Navy routinely responds to escort warships in UK territorial waters and the adjacent sea areas to ensure compliance with maritime law, to deter malign activity and to protect our national interests. Escorting the Russian task group has demonstrated that the Royal Navy is committed to maintaining maritime security and to co-operating with our Nato allies.” HMS Lancaster shadowed the Russian ships from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Celtic Sea as part of Nato’s fast response task force in the Atlantic. HMS Westminster deployed from Portsmouth to intercept the Russian ships in the Celtic Sea where the Marshal Ustinov was refuelled by the tanker Vyazma while HMS Richmond kept watch in the Channel. Commander Tom Johnson, CO of HMS Lancaster, said: Working together allows Nato allies to respond to security challenges at pace and collectively deter potential aggressors. Exchange of personnel further deepens Nato cohesion and interoperability so that the alliance can swiftly and efficiently react to any threat. Lancaster’s team work exceptionally hard to ensure we are always ready to respond to any threat at a moment’s notice.” My colleague Isobel Koshiw writes: A chimpanzee that escaped Kharkiv city zoo on Monday was persuaded to return by a zoo employee who wheeled it back on a bicycle. Staff at the zoo in Ukraine’s second-biggest city were struggling to persuade Chichi, who had wandered around streets and a nearby park, to return to the zoo with them. But when it started to rain she ran to a keeper, who put a yellow jacket on her. The pair embraced before Chichi was put on the seat of a bike. Footage of the incident brought a rare moment of joy to a frontline city under daily bombardment by Russian forces. The zoo’s director, Oleksiy Hryhoriev, confirmed to Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne that the animal was safely back in the zoo. Earlier in the war, Chichi had been evacuated from the Feldman Ecopark, an outdoor zoo on frontlines in the Kharkiv region. Read the full story here. Editors at the Russian newspaper Kommersant have published a front-page editorial in support of the journalist Ivan Safronov, who was yesterday sentenced to 22 years in prison on treason charges. The open letter to Safronov, a former military correspondent for Kommersant, pays tribute to how he became “the best in his field” and states that colleagues at the newspaper were “lucky to work with you”. The letter writes that the authors “haven’t heard any public evidence of your guilt”, adding: You didn’t give up – and don’t give up now. […] We love you, we believe in you. We are waiting for you. Safronov’s sentencing on Monday shocked friends and supporters who gathered in the Russian court to protest against his imprisonment. He was tried on secret evidence, but case files revealed by Proekt showed that much of the case against him came from public data in his articles and alleged ties to foreigners that were not backed up by evidence. The actors Ben Stiller and Sean Penn have been banned from entering Russia following their outspoken support of Ukraine during the invasion. Russia’s minister of foreign affairs released a list on Monday of 25 new names that will be excluded from the country in response to “the ever-expanding personal sanctions by the … Biden administration against Russian citizens”. Stiller and Penn are both included, along with political figures such as senators Mark Kelly, Rick Scott and Kyrsten Sinema. Stiller, an ambassador for UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, visited Ukraine in June, and posted a video on Instagram in solidarity with refugees of the conflict, saying: “Nobody chooses to flee their homes. Seeking safety is a right and it needs to be upheld for every person.” Stiller also met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, telling him: “You’re my hero.” Penn has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine and Zelenskiy, having been in the country making a documentary as the Russian invasion got under way in February. Penn later made a series of TV appearances in April to call for US solidarity with Ukraine and asked for US fighter jets to be supplied to the country. He also said he had considered joining the fight against Russia. They join a longer list of more than 1,000 names of US citizens who have been sanctioned by Russia; these mostly comprise political and military figures (including President Biden and Hillary Clinton, but not Donald Trump), but also a handful of Hollywood names, including executives Jeffrey Katzenberg and Peter Cramer, film director Rob Reiner, and actor Morgan Freeman. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk oblast, has said Ukrainian troops have “gained a foothold” in the eastern region. In an update posted on Telegram, Haidai said Ukrainian forces have “advanced a little” in the Luhansk region and have repulsed Russian attacks. Haidai wrote: Luhansk Region continues to defend itself. Enemy attacks have been repulsed, there are certain positive results: our defenders have advanced a little and gained a foothold. We are waiting for the de-occupation. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. More from Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who accused the west of not honouring its promise to help Russian food exports reach global markets, according to Russian state media. Russian state-owned news agency Ria Novosti cited Lavrov as claiming that western countries had not relaxed sanctions that would allow it easier access to ship its agricultural products abroad. Russia had seen the commitment as a key part of an UN-brokered grain deal that helped end a blockade on Ukrainian grain exports from its southern ports. Russia’s foreign ministry has said the US is responsible for Europe’s gas supply crisis by pushing European leaders towards the “suicidal” step of cutting economic and energy cooperation with Moscow. Asked what needed to happen for the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline to begin pumping again, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Reuters: Listen, you are asking me questions that even children know the answer to: those who started this need to finish this. She said the US had long sought to break the energy ties between Russia and major European powers such as Germany. Political forces playing the role of “sheep-provocateurs” were brought to power in EU countries, she added. The “dominance of Washington prevailed”, Zakharova said. She added: It is absolute suicide but it seems they will have to go through this. A court in Moscow has revoked the licence of Novaya Gazeta’s sister magazine, a day after the newspaper was stripped of its print media licence and effectively banned from operating inside Russia. On Monday, the Basmanny district court revoked Novaya Gazeta of its licence after Russia’s media regulator, Roskomnadzor, accused the publication of failing to provide documents related to a change of ownership in 2006. Speaking outside court yesterday, the newspaper’s editor-in-chief and Nobel laureate Dmitry Muratov said the ruling was “a political hit job, without the slightest legal basis”. He said the paper would appeal. The same court today revoked the licence of “No” (“But”), because of its failure to appear from 2009, when it was registered, until 2022. Novaya Gazeta lawyer Yaroslav Kozheurov said: Why did Roskomnadzor go to court only after the magazine was printed? It is absolutely clear that the appeal to the court is not due to the fact that the magazine was not published, but due to the fact that the magazine started appearing. Novaya Gazeta is one of the country’s most important independent publications. Since it was established by Muratov and colleagues in 1993, it has investigated corruption inside and outside Russia, as well as the wars in Chechnya. In March, Novaya Gazeta said it would cease operations until the end of the war in Ukraine after it received several warnings from the state censor for allegedly violating the country’s “foreign agent” law. Ukraine’s major western allies have yet to sign up to establish a tribunal to try Vladimir Putin and his inner circle for the crime of aggression, wanting to leave space for future relations with Russia, according to Ukraine’s top officials. “It’s big politics. On the one hand, countries publicly condemn the aggression but on the other, they are putting their foot in the closing door on relations with Russia so that it doesn’t close completely,” said Andriy Smyrnov, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, who is leading the country’s effort to establish the international tribunal. Smyrnov said: They are attempting to keep some space for diplomatic manoeuvres. We know that agreements with Russia are not worth the paper they are written on. His claims come as the US president, Joe Biden, said on Monday that Russia should not be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, something Ukrainian officials and some US politicians had pushed for. Russia had previously said such a designation would mean Washington had crossed the point of no return. Ukrainian officials say that since April, they have been trying to convince their western allies to establish an ad hoc tribunal that would hold Russia’s senior leadership responsible for the crime of aggression for invading Ukraine. Aggression is viewed as the supreme crime under international law because without the transgression of borders during an invasion, subsequent war crimes would not have been committed.

Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has criticised Britain’s next prime minister, Liz Truss, for not being able to compromise and said the UK will not strengthen its position in the international arena under her leadership. Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, Lavrov said the incoming prime minister tried to “defend Britain’s interests without taking into account the positions of others in any way and without any attempt to compromise”, he said. Lavrov added: I do not think that this will help Britain to maintain or strengthen its position in the international arena, which has clearly been shaken after it left the European Union. He also mocked the incoming prime minister for saying she did not know if the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was a friend or an enemy. He said: For Liz Truss ... it should be more of a priority to deal with her closest neighbours, including finally deciding whether President Macron is her friend or enemy. This question is still hanging in the air. Lavrov said the UK had tried to “compensate” for Brexit by taking “drastic steps on the world stage” and was acting “aggressively over the situation in Ukraine”. Hello everyone. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, taking over the blog from Jane Clinton to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far: Russia’s biggest natural gas pipeline to Europe will not resume pumping until Siemens Energy repairs faulty equipment, Gazprom has said. Siemens Energy said an engine oil leak at the last remaining turbine in operation at the Portovaya compressor station did not warrant keeping the pipeline closed. The Kremlin said Russia will not resume in full its gas supplies to Europe until the west lifts its sanctions against Moscow, as gas prices surged and the pound and euro slumped. Speaking to journalists on Monday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, blamed sanctions for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. “It is these sanctions imposed by the western states that have brought the situation to what we see now.” The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has blamed Europe’s energy crisis on sanctions it imposed on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine – a line taken by the Kremlin itself. European nations were “harvesting what they sowed” by imposing economic restrictions on Russia, Erdoğan added. The backup power line at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine has been disconnected to extinguish a fire, officials said on Monday. However, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the line itself was not damaged and that the backup line “will be reconnected once the fire has been extinguished”. An expert mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is set to release their findings from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a detailed report later on Tuesday. Four of the six UN mission members at the plant have left the site and the remaining two IAEA experts will stay on a permanent basis, the UN nuclear watchdog said. The Kremlin has said “with much certainty” that Russia-UK relations will not improve under the leadership of Liz Truss. “Judging by statements made by Madame Truss when she was still foreign minister … one can say with much certainty that no changes for the better are expected,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Ukraine’s forces are conducting counteroffensive actions in the east and south-east of the country, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. Writing on Telegram, Oleksiy Arestovych said Kyiv’s troops had “liberated several settlements on the western bank of the Dnieper” and that Russian forces on the right bank of the Dnieper would be in an “extremely difficult” position within a month. The Russian defence ministry is in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea to support its invasion of Ukraine, according to a newly downgraded US intelligence finding. A US official said the fact Russia was turning to North Korea demonstrated that “the Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions”. Vladimir Putin attended large-scale military exercises on Tuesday involving China and several other Russia-friendly countries. Participating countries in the military drills included several of Russia’s neighbours, as well as Syria, India and key ally China. Jailed Russian opposition politician and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny’s chief of staff has said worsening prison conditions were threatening his health. In a post on his Twitter and Instagram accounts, Navalny wrote last week via his lawyers that he had been sent to a punishment cell for a third time in August in revenge for his political activity. Ukraine’s southern offensive has prompted Kherson occupiers to “pause” a planned referendum on whether to become part of Russia. Russian state news agency Tass reported that the head of Kherson’s Russian-appointed authorities, Kirill Stremousov, said plans for a referendum on joining Russia had been “paused” because of the security situation. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has said European Union politicians are being “suicidal” over Russian energy supplies, Reuters reports. Russian president Vladimir Putin was shown smiling and joking with his defence minister as he inspected a military exercise in Russia’s far east. The “Vostok” (East) exercises also involve troops from China and India, although it was not clear if units from those countries were taking part in the exercise observed by Putin. The Zvezda military news service showed a clip of Putin seated next to defence minister Sergei Shoigu, both were wearing military combat jackets and were seen exchanging a joke as they listened to a phone call between Shoigu’s deputy and the head of the general staff, Reuters reports. The defence ministry says the four-yearly war games that began on 1 September involve only 50,000 troops, a fraction of the 300,000 they said took part in 2018. Western military analysts say they believe both figures are exaggerated. The defence ministry released a video of the naval part of the exercise, showing Russia’s Pacific Fleet practising launching Kalibr cruise missiles which it said had successfully struck a target more than 300km (185 miles) away. On Monday, Russian and Chinese combat ships practised repelling an enemy air attack using air defence artillery systems. India has sent an army contingent to the drills which it says is taking part in “joint field training exercises, combat discussions and firepower exercises”. Russia is the biggest supplier of military hardware to India. Moscow says the war games also involve military contingents and observers from Algeria, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Syria and six former Soviet republics. The Swiss government has agreed to offer financial help to the publicly owned electricity group Axpo, Agence France-Presse reports. It is the latest European energy company to require state aid after Russia’s war in Ukraine sent gas prices soaring. Axpo, which requested temporary government help last week, will have access to credit line of 4bn Swiss francs ($4.1bn) to ensure liquidity amid the energy crisis. The Federal Energy Office said: The government responded favourably to avoid putting Switzerland’s energy supply in jeopardy.” It added that Axpo was an electricity firm of “systemic importance” for the country. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has blamed Europe’s energy crisis on sanctions it imposed on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine – a line taken by the Kremlin itself. He said European nations were “harvesting what they sowed” by imposing economic restrictions on Russia, Agence France-Presse reports. Erdoğan added: Europe’s attitude towards Mr Putin, its sanctions, brought Mr Putin – willingly or not – to the point of saying: ‘If you do this, I will do that.’ He is using all his means and weapons. Natural gas, unfortunately, is one of them.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Monday blamed Russia’s halting of gas deliveries to Germany via the Nord Stream pipeline on “sanctions that were imposed against our country”. Jailed Russian opposition politician and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny’s chief of staff said worsening prison conditions were threatening his health. In a post on his Twitter and Instagram accounts, Navalny wrote last week via his lawyers that he had been sent to a punishment cell for a third time in August in revenge for his political activity. The prison service did not respond to a request for comment. Navalny’s cell is reported to be two by three metres wide with a table, chair and bed which is folded from 6am to 10pm. His chief of staff, Leonid Volkov, told Reuters: Suddenly, three weeks ago, they started to dramatically worsen his conditions, which actually poses an enormous threat to his health, because no normal person could spend a long time in that ‘special’ cell. And for Alexei, who had just survived the poisoning, it is especially dangerous.” Volkov, who keeps in touch with the opposition leader through lawyers, said that Navalny is still “mentally and physically very fit”. He added: The fact that Putin is losing (the war), and is getting less and less predictable, makes the situation more dangerous.” Navalny is serving eleven-and-a-half years in prison for parole violations, fraud and contempt of court charges, which he denies. His Anti-Corruption Foundation is preparing to turn the upcoming local elections in Moscow into an anti-war vote. Russia’s biggest natural gas pipeline to Europe will not resume pumping until Siemens Energy repairs faulty equipment, Gazprom’s deputy chief executive Vitaly Markelov has told Reuters. Gazprom said on Friday that the Nord Stream 1 pipeline would remain shut as a turbine at a compressor station had an engine oil leak, sending wholesale gas prices soaring. When asked when Nord Stream 1 would start pumping gas again, Markelov said: “You should ask Siemens. They have to repair equipment first.” Siemens Energy said an engine oil leak at the last remaining turbine in operation at the Portovaya compressor station did not warrant keeping the pipeline closed. In a written statement, Siemens Energy said: We cannot comprehend this new representation based on the information provided to us over the weekend. Therefore, until further notice, our assessment is that the finding communicated to us does not represent a technical reason for stopping operation. Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site.” Finnish state-owned energy company Fortum said it has signed a bridge financing arrangement with Finnish government investment company Solidium for €2.35bn ($2.34bn/£2.02bn) to cover collateral needs in the Nordic power commodity market. It comes after the Finnish government on Sunday unveiled plans to offer up to €10bn in guarantees to the power industry after Russia’s Gazprom shut the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, worsening Europe’s energy shortage. Fortum chief executive Markus Rauramo said in a statement: The ongoing energy crisis in Europe is caused by Russia’s decision to use energy as a weapon and it is now also severely affecting Fortum and other Nordic power producers.” The Finnish government said: The arrangement is aimed at strengthening Fortum’s liquidity reserves and thereby securing Finnish energy supply.” The first instalment of the one-year loan would be €350m and it needs to be withdrawn by 30 September for the arrangement to remain effective, Fortum said. The effective annual interest cost for the bridge financing, including arrangement and commitment fees, would be 14.2%, it added. Russia’s economy is expected to contract by 2.9% this year before returning to growth in 2023-24, according to its economy minister Maxim Reshetnikov, as quoted by the Tass news agency. In its base case scenario, Russia’s economy ministry said it expected a 0.9% GDP contraction in 2023, up from predictions of a 2.7% decline made just last month, Reuters reports. Reshetnikov said the economy would return to periods of growth on a quarterly basis from as early as the end of this year. The economy ministry also forecast 2.6% growth in 2024, down from 3.7% it had predicted in August. Reshetnikov said the economy was on course to post GDP growth in excess of 3% a year after 2024. This new forecast is a significant improvement from the predictions made just last month when the economy ministry forecast a 4.2% contraction for 2022 and a 2.7% fall in GDP in 2023. Reshetnikov said expectations had improved as the Russian economy continued to weather the fallout from western sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine better than expected. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the newswires from Kharkiv. Russian energy giant Gazprom said it will ship 42.4m cubic metres of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Tuesday, a figure unchanged from Monday, Reuters reports. Further reaction from the Kremlin on its expectations of relations with Britain under the soon-to-be new prime minister, Liz Truss. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by the state TASS agency: Judging by statements made by Madame Truss when she was still foreign minister... one can say with much certainty that no changes for the better are expected.” In his farewell speech from Downing Street in London this morning, outgoing prime minister Boris Johnson referenced the early delivery of weapons to Ukraine. PA Media reports that Johnson added that the “early supplies of weapons to the heroic Ukrainian armed forces” may “very well have helped change the course of the biggest European war of 80 years”. He praised his government for getting “this economy moving again from July last year despite all the opposition”. Johnson continued: We have and will continue to have that economic strength to give people the cash they need to get through this energy crisis that has been caused by Putin’s vicious war. … And if Putin thinks that he can succeed by blackmailing or bullying the British people, then he is utterly deluded.” UK’s defence secretary Ben Wallace will be going to Germany this week to discuss longer-term funding for Ukraine, the Ministry of Defence says. President Vladimir Putin attended large-scale military exercises on Tuesday involving China and several other Russia-friendly countries, Kremlin, spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told local news agencies. Agence France-Presse reports: Putin was meeting with defence minister Sergei Shoigu and military chief of staff Valery Gerasimov at the Sergeevski military range and could observe the final phase of the military exercises later, Peskov was quoted as saying. The military drills, called Vostok-2022, started on 1 September and are due to take place until 7 September across several training grounds in Russia’s far east and in the waters off its eastern coast. According to Moscow, more than 50,000 soldiers and more than 5,000 units of military equipment, including 140 aircraft and 60 ships, will be involved in the drills. Participating countries include several of Russia’s neighbours, as well as Syria, India and key ally China. Similar drills were last held in 2018. The latest from the UK’s Ministry of Defence: Ukraine’s offensive operations in the Kherson region continued over the weekend. On 05 September 2022, the Odesa Journal reported 27 sorties by Russian uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) on the west bank of the Dnipro, compared to an average of 50 a day throughout August. On 21 August 2022, Ukrainian forces reported shooting down three Russian Orlan-10 tactical UAVs in a single day. In recent years, Russian doctrine has given an increasingly prominent role for UAVs, particularly to spot targets for its artillery to strike. UAVs can be vulnerable to both kinetic effects – where they are directly shot down – and to electronic jamming. In the face of combat losses, it is likely that Russia is struggling to maintain stocks of UAVs, exacerbated by component shortages resulting from international sanctions. The limited availability of reconnaissance UAVs is likely degrading commanders’ tactical situational awareness and increasingly hampering Russian operations.” A senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has claimed Ukraine’s forces are conducting counteroffensive actions in the east and south-east of the country. Counteroffensive actions by the Armed Forces of Ukraine are taking place not only in the south of Ukraine, but also in the east and southeast,” Oleksiy Arestovych said on his Telegram channel late on Monday evening. Since the beginning of the operation to liberate the south of Ukraine, our military has liberated several settlements on the western bank of the Dnieper. These are subtle movements on the map. But the beginning of counteroffensive actions on different sectors of the front on our part speaks of a change in the situation as a whole.” Arestovych claimed Russian forces on the right bank of the Dnieper are in “operational encirclement”, and predicted that within a month their position will be “extremely difficult”. Gazprom has introduced some confusion around the reasons for the closure of the Nord Stream 1 natural gas pipeline. Yesterday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, told journalists that sanctions “introduced against our country by western countries including Germany and the UK” were to blame for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. “Other reasons that would cause problems with the pumping don’t exist,” Peskov was cited by the Interfax news agency as saying. But Reuters reported on Tuesday that Gazprom’s deputy chief executive officer, Vitaly Markelov, went back to the original reason for the closure – maintenance problems – when he said it would not open until Siemens Energy repaired faulty equipment. “You should ask Siemens. They have to repair equipment first,” Markelov said on the sidelines of Eastern Economic Forum in Russian Pacific port of Vladivostok, when asked about when the pipeline could start pumping gas again. The Russian defence ministry is in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea to support its invasion of Ukraine, according to a newly downgraded US intelligence finding. A US official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said on Monday that the fact Russia was turning to North Korea demonstrated that “the Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions”. US intelligence officials believe that the Russians could look to purchase additional North Korean military equipment in the future. The intelligence finding was first reported by the New York Times. The finding comes after the Biden administration recently confirmed that the Russian military in August took delivery of Iranian-manufactured drones for use on the battlefield in Ukraine. US president Joe Biden has said Russia should not be designated a state sponsor of terrorism, a label Ukraine has pushed for amid Russia’s ongoing invasion while Moscow has warned it would rupture US-Russian ties. Asked if Russia should be designated a state sponsor of terrorism, Biden told reporters at the White House on Monday: “No.” Some US lawmakers have also pressed for the designation. An expert mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is set to release their findings from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a detailed report later on Tuesday. Four of the six UN mission members at the plant have left the site and the remaining two IAEA experts will stay on a permanent basis, the UN nuclear watchdog said. A statement released on Monday read: Director General Grossi will on Tuesday issue a report about the nuclear safety, security and safeguards situation in Ukraine – including the findings from the mission to the ZNPP – and later the same day brief the United Nations Security Council about the mission to the plant.” Zaporizhzhia city administrative head, Oleksandr Starukh, said via his Telegram channel on Monday: Today, the IAEA mission left the Zaporizhzhya NPP, so we are currently waiting not only for a report on the current situation, but for clear decisions. The nuclear power plant and the area around it must be demilitarised as soon as possible.” Ukraine’s president President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reiterated that the conclusions of the mission should be presented on Tuesday, adding: “I hope they will be objective.” The backup power line at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine has been disconnected to extinguish a fire, officials said on Monday. Due to a fire caused by shelling, the [backup] line was disconnected, that is the last line linking the ZNPP/ZTPP hub to the power system of Ukraine,” Ukrainian operator Energoatom said. As a result, the plant’s sixth and last functioning reactor was disconnected from the grid. However the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the line itself was not damaged. “The ZNPP continues to receive the electricity it needs for safety from its sole operating reactor,” it said. The back-up line “will be re-connected once the fire has been extinguished”, the UN nuclear watchdog added. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. An expert mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is set to release their findings from the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a detailed report later today. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden has said Russia should not be designated a state sponsor of terrorism, a label Ukraine has pushed for amid Russia’s ongoing invasion while Moscow has warned it would rupture US-Russian ties. It is 7.30am in Kyiv. Here is where things stand: Ukraine’s southern offensive has prompted Kherson separatists to “pause” a planned referendum on whether to become part of Russia. Russian state news agency Tass reported that the head of Kherson’s Russian-appointed authorities, Kirill Stremousov, said plans for a referendum on joining Russia had been “paused” because of the security situation. Ukraine has repelled Russian offensives in the east as well as hindering Russian positions near Kramatorsk, a key town in eastern Donetsk region, its armed forces claimed. In a situational update, it also claimed that Ukrainian troops had successes in disrupting Russian crossings near Kherson and in using long-range artillery in Kharkiv. In a rare acknowledgment of the Ukrainian counter-offensive, Russia said it pushed back assaults in Kherson. The backup power line at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine has been disconnected to extinguish a fire, officials said on Monday. “Due to a fire caused by shelling, the [backup] line was disconnected, that is the last line linking the ZNPP/ZTPP hub to the power system of Ukraine.” As a result, the plant’s sixth and last functioning reactor was disconnected from the grid, Ukrainian operator Energoatom said. However the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the line itself was not damaged. “The ZNPP continues to receive the electricity it needs for safety from its sole operating reactor,” it said. The back-up line “will be re-connected once the fire has been extinguished”, the UN nuclear watchdog added. Four of the six UN mission members at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left the site, Energoatom, Ukraine’s state enterprise operating all four nuclear power stations in the country, has said. The remaining two IAEA experts will stay on a permanent basis, it said. The agency is drawing up a report to be released this week. Liz Truss’s imminent arrival as British prime minister has been greeted with scorn from the Kremlin and praise in Ukraine. “I wouldn’t like to say that things can change for the worse, because it’s hard to imagine anything worse,” Vladimir Putin’s chief spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said when asked if Moscow expected any shift in relations with Britain. “But unfortunately, this cannot be ruled out.” Ukrainian politicians offered an exuberant welcome. “In Liz, we Truss” tweeted Ukrainian deputy Rustem Umerov. “Mrs Truss is a solid supporter of Ukraine. Hope for a fruitful ongoing partnership between the UK and Ukraine.” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he was “looking forward to the start of cooperation” with Truss. Ukraine has sought political backing in Brussels for the creation of a special tribunal to prosecute Russian military and political leaders for their role in the war. Several Ukrainian leaders attending a conference on war crimes accountability in the European capital on Monday argued for a court dedicated to prosecuting high-level Russian perpetrators, in addition to the International Criminal Court. Russia will not resume in full its gas supplies to Europe until the west lifts its sanctions against Moscow, the Kremlin said, as gas prices surged on Monday and the pound and euro slumped. Speaking to journalists on Monday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, blamed sanctions for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. “It is these sanctions imposed by the western states that have brought the situation to what we see now.” A Russian court has sentenced journalist Ivan Safronov to 22 years in prison on trumped-up treason charges, a record sentence that has shocked those who gathered to protest against his imprisonment. Safronov, a former defence reporter for the Kommersant and Vedomosti dailies, was tried on secret evidence. A court in Moscow also stripped the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta of its print media licence, effectively banning the newspaper from operating inside Russia. Editor-in-chief, Dmitry Muratov, said the ruling was “a political hit job, without the slightest legal basis”. He said the paper would appeal. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, approved a new foreign policy doctrine based around the concept of a “Russian World”, a notion that conservative ideologues have used to justify intervention abroad in support of Russian-speakers. The 31-page “humanitarian policy”, published on Monday, says Russia should “protect, safeguard and advance the traditions and ideals of the Russian World”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2021/oct/27/rishi-sunaks-budget-is-gambling-with-the-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-27T15:06:00Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak’s budget is gambling with the climate crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/27/rishi-sunaks-budget-is-gambling-with-the-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2021/oct/27/rishi-sunaks-budget-is-gambling-with-the-climate-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Rishi Sunak’s budget is gambling with the climate crisis","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In failing to make any serious new government investment in the UK’s green future, Rishi Sunak has chosen to gamble that the market will deliver instead. That is a very high-stakes bet in the face of a climate emergency. Four days before the UK hosts the crucial Cop26 climate summit, the virtual absence of the climate crisis from Sunak’s budget speech was startling. The most eye-catching announcement was the halving of taxes on domestic flights, which are already far cheaper and more polluting than trains. Sunak appeared to splash the cash for public transport in the UK’s city regions. But only £1.5bn turned out to be new money. The Green Alliance estimates £7.6bn a year is needed. Meanwhile, he announced £21bn for roads and a freezing of the duty on fossil fuels used by cars for the 12th year in a row. It could have been different. “This government chooses to invest” in a high-wage, hi-tech “economy fit for a new age of optimism”, said Sunak in his budget speech. He just wasn’t talking about the low-carbon economy. The UK government set out its net zero strategy last week. “Clearly, it’s a very market-led strategy,” said Chris Stark, head of the Climate Change Committee (CCC), the government’s official advisers. “We shall see how that fares.” Cutting emissions from homes is vital, but Sunak will part-subsidise just 30,000 heat pumps a year for three years. Will that get us to the government’s 600,000 a year in just six years’ time? Not many would take that wager, with the Green Alliance estimating funding needs to be three times higher. The government’s previous flutters on energy efficiency have been also-rans. The recent green homes grant was botched, according to the Public Accounts Committee. The earlier green deal also failed, despite clear prior warnings. “We think there is a significant risk in leaving it to the market, as that has never worked anywhere in the world and is unlikely to happen in the UK,” said Stark’s predecessor way back in 2011. One big punt Sunak is taking with taxpayers’ money is on a new nuclear power station, to be seeded with “up to £1.7bn of new direct government funding”. Energy bill payers will also pay upfront for the power plant, described as “writing a blank cheque that the consumer is on the hook for” by the BBC’s business editor. But nuclear power stations have an appalling record of delays and ballooning costs. In 2017, two nuclear power plants in South Carolina, funded by energy bill payers in a similar way, were abandoned, half-built, with billions of dollars down the drain. The cut in domestic air passenger duty follows the net zero strategy having nothing to say on curbing the growth of flying or reducing the amount of meat and dairy people eat. Ignoring these areas is another gamble, making hitting climate targets “more difficult and riskier”, the CCC said. “The recent net zero strategy was seen as a big step forward, but if the chancellor really wants to get the UK on track to net zero, an extra £21bn a year in public investment is needed,” said Sam Alvis, of the Green Alliance. The government has provided about half that but says it will leverage new private investments of up to £90bn by 2030. The Labour party has pledged £280bn of green capital investment by 2030, equivalent to half the defence budget, and by far the party’s biggest spending pledge. There is always an argument to be had about the relative roles of the state and private sector in investment. Sunak railed against “reckless unfunded pledges” on Wednesday and said “governments should have limits”. But Alvis said: “The fiscally responsible approach is to invest now rather than facing huge risks to the economy and environment later.” Four days from the most important global climate summit in history, Sunak mentioned Cop26 just once in passing. On Tuesday, economist Prof Nicholas Stern said: “The move to net zero [emissions] can be the growth story of the 21st century.” Missing this economic opportunity by playing roulette with climate action is shooting ourselves in the foot. But risking the catastrophic impacts of global heating means Sunak is playing Russian roulette – we may be shooting ourselves in the head."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/16/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-205-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-16T10:15:09Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 205 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/16/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-205-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/16/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-205-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 205 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Prosecutors, police officers and journalists are heading to Izium after authorities there said they had found a mass grave containing more than 440 bodies. Some of the people had been killed by shelling and airstrikes, authorities said. Serhiy Bolvinov, the chief police investigator for Kharkiv province, said forensic investigations would be carried out on every body in the grave, which was reportedly located in woods near the city. While authorities said some had been killed by shelling and airstrikes, investigators have prepared themselves for the worst, after the discoveries of slain civilians bearing signs of torture in Bucha and other previously occupied territories. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy likened the discovery to what happened in Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, saying in his Thursday night video address: “Russia is leaving death behind it everywhere and must be held responsible. The necessary procedures have already begun there. More information – clear, verifiable information – should be available tomorrow.” Andriy Yermak, the presidential chief of staff in Ukraine, accused Russia of being “a murderer country, a state sponsor of terrorism.” Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, urged people “don’t look away” from the images emerging from liberated Ukrainian cities like Izium. She said “This is the face of Russian occupation: towns and cities turned into mass graves. Ukraine has used our military aid with skill and determination. Ukraine can win if we keep supporting them.” Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out targeted strikes in the cities of Kherson and Luhansk against local officials who have been collaborating with Moscow. At least five Himars missiles crashed into the central administration building in Kherson. Video from the scene showed smoke pouring out of the complex and debris, and the local Russian-imposed authorities said that at least one person was killed. Ukraine’s military declined to comment on the explosions. Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Kyiv’s operation command south, said Kyiv was keen to avoid “informational chaos”. “Happiness loves silence,” she remarked. On the other side of the country, in the eastern city of Luhansk, a pro-Russia prosecutor and his deputy died when their office was blown up. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear. The Kremlin news agency Itar-Tass said Sergey Gorenko, the prosecutor general for the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, died at the scene. Zelenskiy’s senior adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine was not behind Friday’s mysterious explosion. The Russian-backed separatist authority in Berdiansk has blamed Kyiv for “the double murder” of the deputy head of the military civil administration, and his wife, who headed the city’s territorial election commission for a proposed referendum on whether the region would join the Russian Federation. Iryna Vereshchuk, the minister of reintegration of temporarily occupied territories, has said Ukraine’s government has approved a draft law that will punish people for forcing Russian passports on to Ukrainian citizens. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Ukraine’s counterattack against Russian troops had been very effective, but warned nations should prepare for the long haul as this did not signal the beginning of the end of the war. He said: “We need to understand that this is not the beginning of the end of the war, we need to be prepared for the long haul.” Germany has taken the German subsidiary of the Russian oil giant Rosneft under state control, putting three refineries into a trusteeship ahead of a partial European embargo on Russian oil at the end of the year. The federal network regulator will become the temporary trust manager of Rosneft Germany and its share of refineries in Schwedt, near Berlin, in Karlsruhe and in Vohburg, Bavaria, Germany’s ministry for economic affairs announced on Friday. The European Union chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said she wanted the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to face the international criminal court over war crimes in Ukraine. “That Putin must lose this war and must face up to his actions, that is important to me,” she told the TV channel of the German news outlet Bild on Thursday. Pope Francis said it was morally legitimate for countries to provide weapons to Ukraine to help it defend itself from Russian aggression. “This is a political decision which it can be moral, morally acceptable, if it is done under conditions of morality … Self-defence is not only licit but also an expression of love for the homeland,” he said. “Someone who does not defend oneself, who does not defend something, does not love it. Those who defend [something] love it.” Vladimir Putin thanked the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, for his “balanced” approach to the Ukraine crisis and blasted Washington’s “ugly” policies, at a meeting that followed the recent setbacks for Moscow on the battlefield. Ukraine has lost nearly 15% of its grain storage capacity in the war, threatening its role as a key food supplier to the world, a report said. The US government-backed Conflict Observatory said Russians had seized 6.24m tonnes of food storage capacity, and another 2.25m tonnes of capacity in Ukrainian hands had been destroyed, Agence France-Presse reported. As a result, farmers were running out of room to store their output for shipment, which could discourage plantings for the next crop, especially winter wheat, the report said. Germany will supply Ukraine with additional armoured vehicles and rocket launch systems but will not provide the battle tanks that Kyiv has long asked for, says the German defence minister, Christine Lambrecht. She said on Thursday that Soviet-made BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles would also “very quickly” head to Ukraine from Greece. The UN nuclear watchdog’s 35-nation board of governors passed a resolution demanding Russia end its occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, Reuters reports. Thursday’s resolution was the second on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine passed by the International Atomic Energy Agency’s board. The US president, Joe Biden, announced a new $600m arms package for Ukraine, according to a White House memo sent to the state department on Thursday. Reuters reports the memo does not detail how the money will be used, but sources said it was expected to include munitions and more Himars rocket systems."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/30/theres-no-doubt-its-a-war-horror-of-missile-strike-on-ukrainian-convoy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-30T14:23:46Z","webTitle":"‘Deliberate war crime’: horror as Russian missile hits civilian convoy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/30/theres-no-doubt-its-a-war-horror-of-missile-strike-on-ukrainian-convoy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/30/theres-no-doubt-its-a-war-horror-of-missile-strike-on-ukrainian-convoy","fields":{"headline":"‘Deliberate war crime’: horror as Russian missile hits civilian convoy","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In the dirt car park of a sprawling car parts market just outside the city of Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, the bodies told horrific stories of the moment a Russian missile struck a civilian convoy, killing 25 and injuring scores more. A man in late middle age was slumped inside his car, one hand holding the steering wheel. Not far away, partially covered in a sheet, another person appeared to be kneeling, collapsed next to the wheelie case they had been pulling. Two women, limbs broken and twisted, lay where it appeared they had been talking next to a car in a queue of shattered vehicles that had been waiting to form into a convoy that – in a grim irony – would have taken them into Russian-occupied territory to the south, approved to enter by Russian forces. While some had died instantly, others had managed to escape their cars and stagger a few brief steps before succumbing. Police and soldiers zipped the bodies of the dead into black bags and searched through wallets and handbags to find identification. At 7.15am on Friday, dozens of cars had gathered to wait for a routine convoy to set off for the Russian-occupied territory that begins 12 miles away. About 150 cars are allowed each day by the Russians to make the journey south heading for cities such as Mariupol and Melitopol. The cars and minivans were full of items to bring to families still in the south – bedding and children’s toys, clothes and food. Some travellers would have hoped to pick up relatives to bring them back to Ukrainian-controlled territory amid fears that Russia’s annexation of four regions in Ukraine will leave many trapped. At that moment, a Russian S-300 missile ploughed into the ground 10 metres from the cars as they waited for an escort for their journey. The blast tore through metal, shattered windscreens and blew out the windows of food kiosks and shops over a wide distance. Volodymyr Marchuk, a spokesperson for the local governor’s office, told the Guardian what had happened. “[The car parts market] is a logistic hub to allow people go into the temporarily Russian-occupied territories. The Russians only accept 150 cars a day so that’s why we created a programme where people could go there to register and get their number in the line. “At 7.15 this morning there were a large number of cars waiting for their turn to cross, mostly people who want to go to and drop off aid to relatives. Maybe pick up people who want to leave on the way back. “That was the queue they hit with an S-300 missile. There’s no doubt it is a deliberate war crime. They always say they are aiming at a military object and hit something else. But there are no military objects near that site. That’s why there’s no doubt that it’s a terrorist act.” With scores of injured removed to local hospitals, emergency workers carried on with the grim task of identification and removal of bodies. Among the dead were eight people who were travelling with drivers from Help People, a Ukrainian NGO, including a three-month-old child. The group’s founder, Alex Voronin, said they had intended to travel to Melitopol to meet family members. “We had a car and a minibus going to Melitopol. Out of that group, two survived, a nine-year-old boy and his mother, but we don’t know their condition. They were going to their family who live there. They were trying to get home and get stuff and help relatives get evacuated.” He added: “Every day there are a lot of vans going to Melitopol and Mariupol, but the rules of the Russians have been becoming more strict. There’s only one road – the green corridor, we call it.” Standing on the road near the car park, Dalina Yakushava, 48, had arrived after the explosion to see if she could confirm her place in a convoy. “This is where people are told to come and register by the authorities to join a convoy. You register online but I came to make sure my permission had been received,” she said. “I live in Mariupol. We just drove our daughter to Poland but we need to go back because my parents are there. It’s terrible but it is our home. There were a lot of cars waiting to leave this morning because no one has been able to go into the occupied areas for the past week.” On Friday, the traffic was in both directions. A short drive away along the same road towards the Russian lines, hundreds of cars queued near a Ukrainian checkpoint waiting for an escort, their occupants relieved to be crossing over. At the front of the queue, Nadya Nekustorova was playing with her 11-month-old daughter, Maria, as her husband, Dymytro, watched. “We’re coming from Melitopol,” Nadya said. “We won’t go back until it is back under Ukrainian control. My parents are staying, which is a worry, but we wanted to leave because the Russians have said they will close the crossing to men from 1 October. We realised this might be our final chance. The Russians came to ask us if we were voting in the [sham] referendum. We said no so it seemed like we should leave.” “It was a joke,” said Dymytro. “They were all just voting for themselves. The voting paper was a piece of copied A4. There were no seals or numbers to identify the vote was genuine. It was all fake. My brother has rented a flat in Zaporizhzhia so we’ll stay with him.” Further down the line of cars, Alla Votovska, 68, and her son Viktor said they had waited for four days to come to the checkpoint from a village near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. “Everyone is trying to leave,” said Viktor. “But they would only let a few cars leave from our village each day, so we had to keep coming back. Other people are trying to leave as well via the Crimea for Poland and Europe. Half of our village has left.” Suddenly the cars were moving, heading for Zaporizhzhia on a road that would take them past the dead whose convoy had not been so lucky."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/01/ukraine-forces-encircle-thousands-of-russian-troops-in-key-city","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-01T14:42:25Z","webTitle":"Ukrainian forces perform victory dance after liberating eastern city of Lyman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/01/ukraine-forces-encircle-thousands-of-russian-troops-in-key-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/01/ukraine-forces-encircle-thousands-of-russian-troops-in-key-city","fields":{"headline":"Ukrainian forces perform victory dance after liberating eastern city of Lyman","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russia suffered a humiliating military defeat on Saturday when Ukrainian troops liberated the key eastern city of Lyman, with videos showing them raising a blue and yellow national flag and performing a victory dance. In a severe embarrassment for Vladimir Putin, Russia’s ministry of defence admitted its soldiers had retreated. They had been “withdrawn to more advantageous lines”, the ministry said, after their encirclement by Ukrainian forces. The debacle came hours after Putin announced on Friday that the city, which is a part of the Donetsk region, was Russia’s “for ever”. In a ceremony in the Kremlin he announced the province’s annexation, together with the territories of Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. But Putin’s high-stakes strategy appeared to be unravelling on the battlefield. Russian nationalist bloggers vented their fury at the military command in Moscow, while Chechnya’s president, Ramzan Kadyrov, published a scathing critique of its many failures. Writing on Telegram, Kadryov called on the Kremlin to consider using a “low-yield nuclear weapon” in the wake of its Lyman setback. He asked sarcastically what cities Russia might lose next, adding: “Everything would be good if it wasn’t so bad.” Earlier on Saturday Ukraine’s armed forces said they had entirely surrounded the city, trapping thousands of Russian soldiers inside. The governor of Luhansk province, Serhiy Haidai, said the besieged troops had begged on Friday to be allowed to leave Lyman. Their commanders refused, he claimed. With no way out, the Russians could either surrender, try to escape or die together, Haidai said. “A colossal grouping” of up to 5,000 enemy soldiers was facing defeat, he added. Ukrainian drone footage from Friday showed a column of vehicles heading west, together with civilian vehicles. Russian military bloggers reported that Ukrainian servicemen had entered the centre of the city, and were handing out food to residents. Shelling and small arms fire had stopped. “Whatever promises there were to send us reinforcements never materialised,” one admitted. Mobile phone footage showed Ukrainian soldiers walking calmly over a destroyed bridge near the village of Torske. Ukrainian forces also liberated several other surrounding settlements including Yampil, south of Lyman, Novoselivka, Shandrigolovo and Drobysheve. Video from Shandrigolovo showed Ukrainian soldiers pulling down the Russian tricolour. They threw it to the ground and stamped on it. The Kremlin’s debacle in Lyman followed a series of dramatic advances by Ukrainian forces. Last month they almost completely liberated the north-eastern Kharkiv region. On Saturday its governor, Oleh Synyehubov, said Russia had shelled a civilian evacuation convoy, killing 20 people. They had been fleeing from Kupiansk, a town about 3.5 miles (6 km) from the frontline. The attack appears to have happened several days ago. The victims reportedly included several children. Footage showed bodies slumped in cars and the skeletons of two passengers sitting in front seats who appear to have been incinerated. Synyehubov said Moscow was guilty of “cruelty that can’t be justified”. On Thursday Russian troops attacked another convoy waiting to enter Russian-controlled territory in Zaporizhzhia, killing 30 civilians, including two children, and wounding dozens. In recent days Ukrainian battalions pushed further into occupied territory around Lyman. On Saturday Russia’s defences crumbled. It was unclear how many Russian-armoured vehicles managed to escape. Video showed the apparent aftermath of an artillery strike, with burnt-out vehicles by the side of a forest road, personal belongings strewn in the mud and dead Russian soldiers. The rapid Ukrainian counteroffensive appears to have triggered Putin’s speech on Friday, when he announced that Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts were now irrevocably part of Russia, after so-called “referendums” last week. The Kremlin controls almost all of Luhansk and Kherson provinces, but only parts of the other two regions. The UN, the US, UK and other western nations have condemned Russia’s attempted annexation as illegal and meaningless. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said Kyiv will liberate all of its territory including Crimea. On Friday he formally applied for Ukraine to join Nato as soon as possible. The Kremlin has not commented on its stunning military rout in Lyman. Ukrainian commentators pointed out gleefully that Putin was the first invader in world history to announce the annexation of new territory at the same moment his troops were retreating from it. In Friday’s rambling and grudge-filled speech Putin denounced the west and portrayed his invasion of Ukraine as a just and necessary response to an attempt by the US and its allies to “colonise” Russia. He promised to “protect” the newly annexed lands “with all the forces at our disposal”. Zelenskiy has shrugged off Putin’s nuclear threats and made clear negotiations would only be possible with a new Russian leader. On Saturday he tweeted his thanks to President Biden, and to bipartisan legislators in Washington, for the US’s latest $12.3bn support package for Ukraine. It includes 18 additional Himars long-range artillery systems. The high-precision weapon has played a critical role in Ukraine’s recent successful offensives, in the east and in the south around the occupied city of Kherson, where the Ukrainian army is squeezing fortified Russian positions. Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it was seeking information following reports that a Russian patrol had abducted the head of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which Moscow has occupied since March. Igor Murashov disappeared on his way to work on Friday. His whereabouts are unknown. Unverified reports suggested the Russians were seeking to force Murashov to work for Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear energy agency. He and about 7,000 other Ukrainian staff at the plant are employed by Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear organisation, based in Kyiv. The plant’s six reactors are in cold storage. Rosatom experts sent from Moscow have been trying to connect the station with the Russian power grid, in order to supply energy to Crimea. “We have contacted Russian authorities and are requesting clarifications,” a IAEA spokesperson said. The sudden collapse of Russia’s forces in Lyman opens up the possibility of further Ukrainian gains. Ukrainian battalions can push north towards the town of Svatove or east to Kreminna, Haidai, the Luhansk governor, said. Beyond that are a cluster of cities which Russia seized over the summer after long pulverising battles – Sievierodonetsk, Rubizhne and Lysychansk. In its Kharkiv region offensive Ukraine’s eastern command captured dozens of armoured vehicles left behind by fleeing Russians including T-90 tanks, fuel trucks, and mortars. It was unclear how much Russian equipment had been left behind in Lyman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/20/erdogan-russia-iran-syria-putin-khamenei","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-20T09:50:44Z","webTitle":"Erdoğan asks Russia and Iran to back Turkey’s incursion into Syria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/20/erdogan-russia-iran-syria-putin-khamenei","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/20/erdogan-russia-iran-syria-putin-khamenei","fields":{"headline":"Erdoğan asks Russia and Iran to back Turkey’s incursion into Syria","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has used trilateral talks with his Iranian and Russian counterparts in Tehran to make the case for a further Turkish incursion into north-western Syria. Erdoğan cited Kurdish forces in Tel Rifaat and Manbij, two towns in north-west Syria where Russian and Iranian forces are present, as justification for Turkey extending its zone of control in the country. “What we expect from Iran and Russia is to support Turkey in its fight against terrorist organisations,” he told a press conference following the meeting. The Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Erdoğan against a further invasion during talks at his office, stating that “a military incursion of Syria will benefit terrorists”. The visit to Tehran provided Erdoğan with an opportunity to reaffirm ties to both Tehran and Moscow, along with plentiful opportunities to court Moscow’s cooperation on key issues. Putin and Erdoğan greeted each other warmly at the start of their bilateral talks, despite a brief moment where the Turkish leader kept his counterpart waiting. The talks provided an opportunity for Erdoğan to secure Moscow’s backing for a tentative agreement to evacuate grain across the Black Sea with a control centre in Istanbul, with UN-backed talks expected to continue in Istanbul this week. “With your mediation, we have moved forward. True, not all issues have yet been resolved, but the fact that there is movement is already good,” Putin told Erdoğan. The Turkish president later referred to his counterpart as “my dear friend Putin” during a roundtable discussion on Syria. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, Turkish authorities have insisted on balancing the country’s Nato membership with its longstanding relationship with Moscow. Turkey has hosted peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, and sold Ukraine armed drones for use against Russian forces. Haluk Bayraktar, who heads the company manufacturing the TB2 drones used in Ukraine, told CNN shortly before Erdoğan arrived in Tehran that his company would never sell drones to Russia, as “we support Ukraine, its sovereignty and its resistance”. But Turkey has declined to join sanctions against Russia, stepped up its purchases of Russian oil since the invasion, and continues to push ahead with construction of a nuclear power plant by the Russian state company Rosatom, under threat due to western sanctions on Sberbank, a major backer of the project. “Russia can’t afford not to engage with Turkey. They want a relationship with Turkey as a Nato ally – that wouldn’t change even if Putin and Erdoğan step aside tomorrow,” said Hanna Notte, an analyst at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation. “But the fact they deal so efficiently and closely on issues, that you can put down to the Putin-Erdoğan rapport,” she added, saying the leaders share elements of anti-western sentiment that has fuelled a longstanding personal relationship. “They share a view of the world as multipolar, where countries outside of the west should have a say on how things are run.” Yet Erdoğan’s approach to foreign policy rests on showing that Turkey acts independently, putting its interests first. This aids his appeal to a domestic audience ahead of an election expected in the coming year, where Erdoğan faces increasing opposition. Despite previously lifting objections to Finland and Sweden joining Nato and securing the lifting of some weapons sales in the process, Erdoğan this week repeated threats to “freeze” their accession if Turkish demands aren’t met. At a Nato summit in Madrid in late June, Erdoğan’s tactics secured him a meeting with the US president, Joe Biden, who stated his support for sales of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey, despite ongoing opposition from Congress. Last week, the Turkish president leaned on Putin during a phone call in which he pressed for Russian agreement on the UN security council’s cross-border aid mechanism providing vital aid to more than 2 million Syrians in rebel-held areas in the north-west, blunting Russian threats to veto the aid renewal altogether. “There’s all this leverage building up because of Ukraine and all these crises at once; it would be surprising if Erdoğan doesn’t try to squeeze something out of this moment, as this is what he does,” said Aron Lund, of the Washington-based thinktank the Century Foundation. “Under Erdoğan, especially in the latter half of his rule, Turkey is always stirring up crises and then getting something in return for stopping them. That’s been the modus operandi all along,” said Lund. “It damages Turkey’s standing in a lot of countries. We witnessed a severe lack of appreciation for this in Congress and in the EU parliament, for example. But Erdoğan doesn’t care, or doesn’t seem to. He can show off the results to aid public opinion and he benefits domestically – plus Turkey benefits in real foreign policy terms, they do get results,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/19/a-guide-to-the-uk-energy-security-strategy-cost-of-living-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-19T09:00:22Z","webTitle":"A guide to the UK energy security strategy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/19/a-guide-to-the-uk-energy-security-strategy-cost-of-living-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/19/a-guide-to-the-uk-energy-security-strategy-cost-of-living-crisis","fields":{"headline":"A guide to the UK energy security strategy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"What is the energy security strategy? Soaring energy prices are helping to create a cost-of-living crisis, with the average family’s energy bill rising by 54%. The energy price cap has been raised to £1,971 and a further increase is expected later this year, which would take the average household bill to about £2,300. The government has responded by offering a one-off £200 discount on bills from October, to be paid back over five years. The UK is not alone: energy prices are rising around the world as industries struck by Covid-19 lockdowns resume operations, and energy supplies still need to ramp up after plunging two years ago during the first lockdowns. The war in Ukraine is adding to the problem: Vladimir Putin has used his dominance over EU energy supplies (Russia supplies 40% of Europe’s gas, and 60% of Germany’s) as a weapon of war, and turned down the gas taps by a quarter before the invasion. Putin could tighten supplies still further, and in any case the EU wants to move away from Russian fossil fuels to stem the flow of money to the Kremlin war machine – Europe has paid more than €15bn (£12.6bn) for Russian gas, oil and coal since the invasion began. The UK relies less on Russian fuel, which makes up only 3% of UK gas supplies and about 8% of oil, but British consumers will be hit anyway as the price of gas is set by international markets that are badly affected by the war. Now the government is publishing a strategy to secure the UK’s energy supplies and try to dampen soaring costs for consumers and industry. What will be in it? Renewable energy will play a significant role, with the government planning to rapidly increase the goal for offshore wind generation, and relax the planning rules that have prevented onshore windfarms being built in England for most of the last decade. Nuclear power will get a boost, with the government seeking to help investors expand the UK’s reactor fleet. Keeping the UK’s existing nuclear power stations open as long as possible will help provide stability through the current crisis and beyond, but any new reactors are likely to take more than a decade to start producing power. Fossil fuels will also be a big focus for the strategy, with the government seeking to expand the UK’s supplies of gas and oil, pumping more from the North Sea and making overtures to big Middle Eastern suppliers such as Saudi Arabia. New licences for the North Sea, already under way, will be brought forward. What about fracking? The government is leaving the door open to fracking, saying that it could be allowed if health and safety conditions are met, but few in Whitehall see any real future for fracking in the UK. Fracking at scale would require the industrialisation of swathes of the UK’s landscape, would face huge local opposition, would be expensive and would take years to produce any gas. It is not a solution to the current crisis and the carbon dioxide emissions it would generate make it unsuitable for any future crisis. Could we go back to coal? Coal, the dirtiest form of electricity generation, is to be phased out in the UK by 2024. But the government is understood to have made informal contacts to the UK’s remaining coal operators – EDF, Uniper and Drax, which has converted its boilers to biomass but could feasibly return to coal – as a contingency. Whitehall sources claim this is only a question of sensibly keeping options open in case of deepening crisis, rather than overtures to a coal renaissance. What will not be in the strategy? A windfall tax on fossil fuel companies. Such a tax would have serious backing – the International Energy Agency, regarded as the gold standard on energy policy advice and not known for its radicalism, has advocated a windfall tax in the EU, with the proceeds to be used to ease energy bills for vulnerable people. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have also called for one in the UK. Unfreezing the fuel duty escalator would raise billions that could be recycled to the poorest. Petrol taxes have been kept steady since 2010, resulting in an £11bn loss to the Treasury in 2019, and fuel-guzzling SUVs now make up about half of new cars bought. Making public transport free would be a radical move to get people out of cars overnight, and slash petrol and diesel demand while leading to clearer skies, less air pollution and safer roads for walking and cycling. And a nationwide push to insulate every home to decent standards, and install heat pumps in place of gas boilers, would slash the UK’s energy bills and end the need to import fossil fuels from this year if pursued at speed. But these measures have been ruled out by the Treasury and other departments. What is happening to fossil fuel companies? Party time. They are enjoying a bonanza, with BP’s chief boasting his company was a “cash machine”, and his finance chief that he has “more money than we know what to do with”. Dangerously for the Earth’s climate, they are using this to cement their lobbying power, telling governments they should invest in expanding oil, gas and even coal. But an increasing number of political leaders are seeing the war in Ukraine as a sign that clean, domestically produced renewable energy can bolster national security. What will all of this do to net zero? The government is expected to reaffirm its commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, despite agitation from a small number of rightwing Tory backbenchers and Nigel Farage. Boris Johnson is said to be a personal champion of green issues within the cabinet, and Michael Gove, the secretary for levelling up, spoke out strongly in favour of net zero this week. Are energy prices the only factor behind the cost-of-living crisis? No, the prices of food, clothing and other goods are also rising. Inflation is affecting many countries as economies recover from the Covid-19 recession, and the war in Ukraine has added to pressures, particularly over food as Ukraine and Russia are leading grain and oil exporters. But another factor unique to the UK that is raising prices is Brexit, as imports and exports now face extra costs, paperwork, staff shortages and other barriers.

Biden will visit a coal-turned-wind power plant in Massachusetts on Wednesday, to promote his climate action efforts. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said Biden would announce “additional actions” to fight the climate crisis on Wednesday but ruled out the declaration of a national emergency for now. “He’s not going to just stop with the actions of tomorrow but I would not plan an announcement this week on national climate emergency,” Jean-Pierre said at the daily White House briefing. “Again, everything is on the table. It’s just not going to be this week on that decision … I don’t have a date circled on the calendar.” The president indicated last week that he would take steps to reduce carbon emissions after the West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin – a crucial swing vote in the evenly divided Senate – withdrew support for climate legislation Democrats had hoped to pass before leaving Washington for the August recess and as they face tough midterm elections in November. But the president’s ability to work around Congress remains limited and the impact of declaring a climate emergency, for all its symbolism, remains ambiguous. Lack of comprehensive action puts at risk goals to curb global heating. The Post’s report noted that some climate activists have argued that declaring an emergency would allow Biden “to halt crude oil exports, limit oil and gas drilling in federal waters, and direct agencies including the Federal Emergency Management Agency to boost renewable energy sources”. However, such measures could face legal challenges from Republicans critical of what they perceive as executive overreach. Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review magazine, tweeted in response to the report: “Yet again [the White House] advertises contempt for the rules of our constitutional republic.” The constraints were underlined last month when the supreme court effectively restricted the Environmental Protection Agency from issuing emissions rules involving matters of great “economic and political significance”. Democrats, however, are eager to see Biden take action as the planetary alarm rings ever louder: CNN reported that nearly 20% of the US population will probably see a temperature at or above 100F (37.7C) this week. Britain recorded its highest ever temperature of 104F (40C) as the heatwave gripping Europe intensified. Two Senate Democrats, Jeff Merkley and Sheldon Whitehouse, urged the president to declare a climate emergency and use the Defense Production Act – designed for use in wartime – to increase production of renewable energy products and systems including solar panels. Merkley tweeted: “[Biden] needs to go big on climate – starting by declaring a climate emergency so we can take bold action NOW on the disastrous impacts climate chaos has on our health, environment, and economy.” Whitehouse, who has called for tighter carbon regulations for vehicles and power plants and possible federal litigation against the fossil fuel industry, told reporters: “I’ve talked to the White House about going on offense and being aggressive and doing all the things that it is within the executive powers to do that have not so far been done.” The brutal contrast between political inaction and catastrophic global heating has led some to question whether America’s institutions of government are fit for purpose. David Axelrod, a former strategist for Barack Obama, tweeted: “We are fiddling as the world burns.” Biden has been trying to signal to voters that he is tackling global heating at a time when some supporters have despaired about the lack of progress. He has pledged to push forward on his own in the absence of congressional action. Jared Bernstein, a White House economic adviser, told reporters: “The president will aggressively fight to attack climate change because he knows it’s one of the reasons he’s here. And it is absolutely core to transitioning from where we are to where we need to be.” Manchin and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, had been in talks about $300bn in tax credits for industries including solar and wind power, carbon capture from power plants and nuclear power, which generates virtually emissions-free electricity. Manchin has blamed inflation for his rejection of spending on climate legislation. Activists have warned that time is running out for the US to cut emissions and encourage other countries to do the same. Scientists say inaction will lead to “irreversible” impacts such as heatwaves, floods, wildfires and a mass upheaval of displaced people. Ben King, an associate director at the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, told the AP the US is “nowhere close” to meeting goals set by Biden for reducing emissions. Biden escalated the US emissions reduction target of 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030. Under policies in place at the federal and state level, the US is on track to reach a reduction of 24% to 35%, according to the Rhodium Group."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/24/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-182-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-24T00:45:34Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 182 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/24/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-182-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/24/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-182-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 182 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russian opposition politician Yevgeny Roizman was shown being detained at his home in a video published on social media on Wednesday. Video of the arrest showed Roizman, former mayor of the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, being taken away by law enforcement officials. Roizman was seen in the video telling reporters that he was being investigated under a law against discrediting the armed forces. He said he was being arrested “basically for one phrase, ‘the invasion of Ukraine’”. Pope Francis has called for “concrete steps” to end the war in Ukraine and avert the risk of a nuclear disaster at the Zaporizhzhia power plant, reports Reuters. IAEA, the UN nuclear watchdog, said on Tuesday it would visit the Russian-occupied plant in Ukraine within days if talks to gain access succeed. Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of firing at the facility, the largest of its kind in Europe and which pro-Moscow forces took over soon after the 24 February invasion. The United Nations has called for the area to be demilitarised. A Russian-installed head of the town of Mykhailivka in the Russian-controlled part of the Zaporizhzhia region in south-eastern Ukraine was killed in a car bomb on Tuesday, an official said. Ivan Sushko was critically injured when a bomb placed under his car exploded, Zaporizhzhia region administration member Vladimir Rogov said on Telegram. Norway and Britain will jointly supply micro drones to Ukraine to aid in its war with Russia, reports Reuters. The cost of the Teledyne Flir Black Hornet drones, used for reconnaissance and target identification, will be up to 90m Norwegian crowns (£7.4m), the Norwegian defence ministry said in a statement. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told Ukrainians on Wednesday in an emotional speech to mark 31 years of independence that Ukraine was reborn when Russia invaded and would recapture annexed Crimea and occupied areas in the east. In the recorded speech aired on the six-month anniversary of Russia’s 24 February invasion, Zelenskiy said Ukraine no longer saw the war ending when there was peace, but when Kyiv was actually victorious. Former Conservative leadership contender Tom Tugendhat has disclosed he is in Kyiv as Ukraine marks 31 years since it declared independence from the Soviet Union. “Here in Kyiv we’re in shelters after being woken by the air raid siren,” the Commons foreign affairs committee chairman tweeted in response to a post by British journalist John Sweeney. He later posted a video of himself next to destroyed tanks in the centre of Kyiv and praised the commitment of Britain in helping Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Ukraine is bracing for possible Russian strikes as it marks its independence day and 31 years since the end of Soviet rule. Authorities have cancelled celebrations in Kyiv as officials warn that Russia is preparing to attack the capital. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he had information from Ukraine’s intelligence services and international partners that there was an increased threat, as the US said it believed Russia would target civilian and government infrastructure in the next few days. Ukraine’s defence ministry advised Ukrainians to be especially careful, citing the threat of missile attacks and “provocations” from Russia. Many civilians were attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack, according to an adviser to Ukraine’s president. Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” an attack may strike the centres of decision-making on Wednesday. Russia and the Putin regime “are really obsessed with dates and symbols, so it would be logical to be on the lookout and be prepared for independence day to be attacked”, said Andriy Yusov, the head of the ministry’s intelligence directorate. Zelenskiy has warned Russia of a strong response to any independence day attacks. Russia “will receive a response, a powerful response”. Zelenskiy said Ukraine will not agree to any proposal to freeze the current frontlines in order to “calm” Moscow, which controls about 22% of Ukraine including Crimea. “At the point where we are, we are not ready for a ceasefire. We explained that there will be no Minsk-3, Minsk-5, or Minsk-7. We will not play these games, we have lost part of our territories this way … it is a trap,” he said during a press conference after a summit of the Crimea Platform in Kyiv. Zelenskiy also vowed to return Crimea to Ukraine, saying it would become part of the EU along with the rest of the country. “We will return Crimea, because it is our territory. In any way we decide. We will decide it on our own, without consulting any other state. It all began with Crimea, and it will end with Crimea.” The UN nuclear watchdog said it would visit the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine “within the next few days if ongoing negotiations succeed”. The US is set to announce a fresh security assistance package for Ukraine of about $3bn (£2.5bn), officials have said, to equip it for a war of attrition and secure its medium- to long-term defence posture. The money will fund contracts for as many as three types of drones, and other weapons, ammunition and equipment that may not see the battlefront for a year or two, US officials told the Associated Press. Hundreds of people gathered in Moscow for the funeral of Darya Dugina. Dugina, daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was killed on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside Moscow. Russia’s FSB security service has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of ordering her killing, which Kyiv denies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/mar/04/boris-johnson-tories-labour-ukraine-russia-latest-politics-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T18:03:58Z","webTitle":"UK politics: BBC temporarily halts news operation in Russia after new law threatens journalists with prison – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/mar/04/boris-johnson-tories-labour-ukraine-russia-latest-politics-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/mar/04/boris-johnson-tories-labour-ukraine-russia-latest-politics-live-news","fields":{"headline":"UK politics: BBC temporarily halts news operation in Russia after new law threatens journalists with prison – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here’s a roundup of Friday afternoon’s news in response to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, as the BBC has stopped its news operation in Russia. The BBC will “temporarily suspend” the work of all its BBC News journalists and support staff in Russia. This is after new legislation has been passed by the Russian authorities, which imposes a jail term of up to 15 years for people who intentionally spread “fake” information about Russia’s armed forces. The Metropolitan police’s war crimes team is gathering evidence in relation to alleged war crimes in Ukraine to support the international criminal court (ICC) investigation, the force said. The shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been strongly condemned by both the foreign secretary Liz Truss and defence secretary Ben Wallace. Truss called it a “completely reckless act”. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has asked government lawyers to “find literally any way” to crack down on “Slapps” – or strategic lawsuits against public participation – where the wealthy exploit lengthy and expensive legal procedures to silence journalists, critics and watchdogs. The Disasters Emergency Committee’s (DEC) Ukraine appeal has raised 55 million in its first day.The total includes “generous” donations from the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, DEC said. Priti Patel has said Ukrainians fleeing into Poland were escaping “the most atrocious set of circumstances where they are being persecuted by President Putin”. Boris Johnson is concerned for the safety of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, Downing Street has said. The prime minister has regularly spoken to the Ukrainian leader and has expressed his personal admiration of him. Former prime minister Gordon Brown criticised Russia for not making a statement regarding safety on the nuclear power station in south-eastern Ukraine it has taken control of, saying that is a “failure to respond to the pleas of the international community”. That’s it from us for today. For the latest news on Ukraine, follow our dedicated live blog: Here’s a bit more detail from Reuters about the legislation that has prompted the BBC to suspend its work in Russia: Russia’s upper house of parliament approved a draft law on Friday that would impose a jail term of up to 15 years for people who intentionally spread “fake” information about Russia’s armed forces, the TASS news agency reported. The bill will become law once President Vladimir Putin signs it, as he is widely expected to do. Moscow says it is fighting back in what it casts as an information war with the West over the conflict in Ukraine. Meanwhile The Moscow Times reports that the document was adopted unanimously. Examples of “fakes” about military operations that are punishable by up to 15 years in prison were provided to the lawmakers including the use of old photos of burned military equipment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces that have been photoshopped to have markings of the Russian military. The explanatory note to the bill also states that Ukrainian media is using footage of the devastation in the Donbas region from 2014-2015 and passing it off as crimes perpetrated by the Russian military in order to “create a global negative image of Russia as a ‘bloody aggressor’ and whip up panic in society.” The news about the BBC suspending operations in Russia comes amid a debate about the Kremlin-backed RT news channel, formerly known as Russia Today. Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has opened 27 investigations into the “due impartiality” of programmes broadcast on the channel. Meanwhile culture secretary Nadine Dorries has said RT should lose its licence and “never again” be able to broadcast “poisonous propaganda”. But Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, warned earlier this week that the BBC risked being banned in Russia if RT was shut down in the UK. Reports that BBC News services were being blocked in Russia prompted the broadcaster to issue a statement on Friday morning, saying it would “continue our efforts to make BBC News available in Russia, and across the rest of the world”. It also shared a link to an article reminding viewers that its Ukrainian and Russian language services are available on the dark web. The BBC has made its international news website available through the Tor network, a privacy-focused software used to access the dark web, in a bid to thwart censorship attempts. The Metropolitan police’s war crimes team is gathering evidence in relation to alleged war crimes in Ukraine to support the international criminal court (ICC) investigation, the force said. The team is part of counter-terrorism command and has “national responsibility for carrying out any UK enquiries into war crimes and core international crimes”. Detectives are appealing for anyone in the UK who may have direct evidence of war crimes in Ukraine from 21 November 2013 onwards to come forward, and are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed or been the victim of any war crimes in Ukraine during this period, PA News reports. Evidence given to and gathered by the war crimes team may then be shared with the international criminal court to assist with their investigation. The BBC will “temporarily suspend” the work of all its BBC News journalists and support staff in Russia. This follows the news that new legislation has been passed by the Russian authorities, which BBC director general Tim Davie said appeared to “criminalise the process of independent journalism”. The Russian parliament approved the law on Friday. It would make it a criminal offence punishable by up to 15 years in prison to spread “fake” or “false” news about the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine. It comes after the Kremlin accused the BBC of playing a “determined role in undermining the Russian stability and security”. Davie said: It leaves us no other option than to temporarily suspend the work of all BBC News journalists and their support staff within the Russian Federation while we assess the full implications of this unwelcome development. Our BBC News service in Russian will continue to operate from outside Russia. Davie said the safety of the BBC’s staff was paramount and they are are “not prepared to expose them to the risk of criminal prosecution simply for doing their jobs”. He continued: I’d like to pay tribute to all of them, for their bravery, determination and professionalism. We remain committed to making accurate, independent information available to audiences around the world, including the millions of Russians who use our news services. Our journalists in Ukraine and around the world will continue to report on the invasion of Ukraine. As the UK government seeks ways to take on Russian oligarchs with links to Vladimir Putin’s regime, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has asked government lawyers to “find literally any way” to crack down on “Slapps” – or strategic lawsuits against public participation – where the wealthy exploit lengthy and expensive legal procedures to silence journalists, critics and watchdogs. How do Slapps differ from ordinary defamation lawsuits? While Slapps generally arise out of defamation lawsuits and ostensibly have the same purpose – of protecting the claimant’s reputation – they are seen as an attempt to shut down public criticism, with the claimant often indifferent about whether they actually win the case. What is the threat posed by Slapps? The fear is that they discourage investigative reporting into rich and powerful people because of the potential costs of defending a claim, even if it has little or no merit. In a parliamentary debate on Slapps in January, David Davis, a Conservative MP and former cabinet minister, said “nefarious” actors were using the justice system “to threaten, intimidate and put the fear of God into British journalists, citizens, officials and media organisations”. He described such tactics as “lawfare”. The Foreign Policy Centre said the UK was “the most frequent country of origin” for foreign legal threats against investigative journalists. How are Slapps connected to Russian oligarchs? The use of Slapps is not confined to Russians but one of the most notorious recent examples, characterised as such by MPs as well as free speech campaigners, related to Putin’s People, a book written by the journalist Catherine Belton about the Russian leader. She and her publisher, HarperCollins, were sued over a number of matters in the book by multiple Russian billionaires, including Roman Abramovich, who owns Chelsea football club, Mikhail Fridman, the owner of Russia’s largest non-state bank, and the Russian state oil company Rosneft. All of the claims were subsequently settled or withdrawn. Abramovich ended his case after HarperCollins accepted some information concerning him was inaccurate and agreed to make revisions to the book. HarperCollins apologised and agreed to make a payment to charity in recognition of a particular error, but otherwise no damages were paid and both sides agreed to pay their own costs.

Having led applause in support of Ukraine earlier in the day, the Scottish Labour leader argued that Vladimir Putin “will not win” and insisted peace will prevail. Sarwar said: We unequivocally reject any - any - false attempts to justify Russian aggression, and we stand in solidarity with those fleeing war and those who are staying to defend their homeland. Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine is unprovoked and unjustifiable. Across the world today the message is clear - peace and democracy must prevail and we will not bend to Vladimir Putin’s imperial ambitions. We must provide more humanitarian assistance to defeat the horrors of war: hunger, destitution and need. We must further tighten the economic measures taken against Vladimir Putin’s regime and we must, once and for all, root out the free flow of Russian money and influence and the Russian disinformation campaign from our public life, across the UK and here in Scotland. The first minister of Wales has said that he regrets the ending of free coronavirus testing, but that it was inevitable after the UK government ended the programme. Mark Drakeford said he had attempted to persuade the UK government to take a “more gradual” approach to the running down of test and trace but had been rebuffed. Drakeford said: I think that is a genuine anxiety and it is why we have attempted unsuccessfully to persuade the UK government to take a more gradual approach to the rundown of testing and the infrastructure that has served us so well over the last two years, We will devote some of the testing that we have available to us through our own means in ways that will allow surveillance to continue. We continue to have conversations with the UK government about the need to ensure both that there is sufficient surveillance in place and that should it be necessary to step up the level of protection again through a more widespread testing regime, there’s a proper plan and proper capacity to be able to do that. In the end, when the UK government makes these decisions, they have a direct effect on us. We’ve had to plan within the constraints that we unavoidably face. Covid-19 infection levels have fallen in England and Northern Ireland but increased in Scotland, while the trend in Wales is “uncertain”, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS figures reveal that in England, around one in 30 people in private households are estimated to have had the virus in the week to 26 February, or 1.9 million people – down from one in 25, or 2.1 million people in the week to 19 February. For Northern Ireland the proportion of people with Covid-19 has fallen to one in 17, or 106,300 people, from one in 14, 132,700 people. But Scotland saw a slight increase week-on-week, up from one in 20, or 240,700 people, to one in 19, or 280,500. In Wales the estimate remains around one in 30, or 94,200, with the ONS describing the trend in the most recent week as “uncertain”. The Disasters Emergency Committee’s (DEC) Ukraine appeal has raised 55 million in its first day. The total includes “generous” donations from the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, DEC said. It said hundreds of thousands of members of the public donated to the humanitarian appeal within hours of its launch on Thursday. The total includes 20 million donated by the UK Government as part of its UK Aid Match scheme - the largest commitment ever made to a DEC appeal through the initiative. Saleh Saeed, the chief executive of the DEC, said: We are also very grateful for the generous support of the royal family.” We also thank the UK Government who have matched pound for pound the first 20 million donated by the public, as well as our broadcast partners and celebrities for having aired and joined the appeal, reaching millions of viewers and listeners. Giving through the DEC is the most effective way to get the right assistance to the right people. While wanting to collect clothes and other items for people in need is laudable, the things people give today may not be what people need tomorrow and aid workers say they can’t use much of what is arriving. Donating through the DEC is the most helpful way people Ben Wallace accused Russia of “playing with fire” by shelling a nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Speaking at a news conference in Copenhagen, the defence secretary added that the UK government “call upon the Russian president in the strongest possible terms to absolutely cease attacking sites” such as the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. He said: It is incredibly dangerous. It is not just dangerous for Ukraine and Russia, it is dangerous for Europe, and it is playing with fire that really is beyond anything that has to do with logic or necessity. Liz Truss, who is in Brussels to meet with her counterparts to discuss next steps in responding to Russia’s aggression, has said the meeting will be used to show “the strength of our unity in challenging Vladimir Putin”. The foreign secretary said: We are doing all we can to support the Ukrainians through defensive weapons where the UK led – we were the first European country to donate defensive weapons – and we are also going to be talking about sanctions. We have been very co-ordinated in sanctions, we have shown huge unity, it is having a big effect in Russia – but we now need to do more. We particularly need to look at the oil and gas sector, how do we reduce our dependence across Europe on Russian gas, how do we cut off the funding to Vladimir Putin’s war machine? That is what I am going to be advocating at both the G7 and the discussions with the EU. The shelling of a nuclear power plant in Ukraine by Russian troops is “a threat to European security and stability”, Liz Truss has said. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been seized by Russian military forces, according to regional authorities, after a fire sparked by overnight shelling burned for several hours at the largest facility of its kind in Europe. Speaking in Brussels, where ministers from across the West are gathering today to discuss how to respond to Russian aggression, the foreign secretary told journalists that those responsible for the “completely reckless act” must be “held to account”. Asked how concerned she is about the incident, Truss said: Well this was a completely reckless act. We’ve heard now that the fire has been extinguished, but it is extremely concerning that forces are prepared to do this. We have called for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council. This is a threat to European security and stability and we need those responsible to be held to account. Here’s more about what has happened at the nuclear plant: Priti Patel has said Ukrainians fleeing into Poland were escaping “the most atrocious set of circumstances where they are being persecuted by President Putin”. Speaking on a visit to the Polish border, the home secretary told reporters she was in the country “very much in terms of standing in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, but also with our friends here in Poland”. She said she wanted to “to see the work that they’re doing and also to see how we can support Poland much more in terms of helping those Ukrainians with links to the United Kingdom to come to Britain, and actually we’ve been discussing some of that work here today”. Patel said: We’re also launching our new family extension route today to enable Ukrainian families with links to the UK to come over to Britain. That scheme is live, that is now working, that’s up and running. We stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Ukraine but also with our dear friends here in Poland, who are working really [hard] night and day, we can all see this, under incredible circumstances. Boris Johnson is concerned for the safety of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, Downing Street has said. The prime minister has regularly spoken to the Ukrainian leader and has expressed his personal admiration of him and a spokesman for the PM was asked whether Johnson was worried about attempts reportedly made on Zelenskiy’s life. He said: Of course, everybody’s concerned for the safety and welfare of the president of Ukraine and the rest of the government, as well as the people of Ukraine who we’ve seen indiscriminately targeted over recent days. Former prime minister Gordon Brown criticised Russia for not making a statement regarding safety on the nuclear power station in south-eastern Ukraine it has taken control of, saying that is a “failure to respond to the pleas of the international community”. He told an online event organised by the Chatham House thinktank: I am surprised that this morning, now that the Russian government have taken over a second nuclear power station in Ukraine, and now are in control of it, they have not made a statement that they will not allow that nuclear station to be used to endanger and to threaten human life. It is these very instances of Russia’s failure to respond to the pleas of the international community, that make us determined that we will step up our campaign to make sure that Russia is brought to justice for what is a crime of aggression but of course could – and I support the international criminal court’s actions – be in other areas too. Boris Johnson does not want someone in Russia to assassinate Vladimir Putin, HuffPost UK reports. Republican US senator Lindsey Graham last night called for the Russian president to be killed on Twitter, asking if there was a “Brutus” in Russia. For those who don’t know Brutus, Marcus Junius Brutus was a Roman politician and the most famous of Julius Caesar’s assassins. Asked if the Johnson agreed with Graham, the prime minister’s spokesperson said: No. We stand with the Ukrainian people in demanding the immediate end to the Russian invasion. We have said before Putin must be held account in front of an international court for the horrific acts he has committed. Anatoly Antonov, the Russian ambassador to the US, said Graham’s comments, see below, were “unacceptable and outrageous”. The price of food including pork is likely to rise significantly as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a UK environment minister has warned. Victoria Prentis, the Defra minister responsible for farming, also suggested Britons may want to stop buying Russian white fish, which makes up about a third of the volume consumed in the UK. Prentis warned that British people would have to become more willing to pay premium prices for quality food produced domestically. Speaking at the launch of the Conservative Environment Network’s Green Albion essay collection, she said: “I’ve been having really important meetings with the fishing industry. Thirty per cent of our white fish, for example, is imported from Russia. Get real, guys.” The minister told the Guardian that further sanctions were being considered, which could affect the fishing industry, but suggested consumers boycott the fish. She said: “For now, do we really want to be buying Russian fish?” Prior to the invasion, Prentis had been mostly focused on the cost of living crisis as well as the shift to more environmentally-friendly farming, implementing the environmental land management schemes (Elms) which would have farmers paid subsidies for improving biodiversity and nature on their land. However, she has found herself dealing with potential supply-chain failures as a result of the war. “I am going to dial down the optimism because we are in the middle of the most extraordinary series of world events,” she said. You can read the full story here: Former prime minister Gordon Brown has called on countries to support the creation of a special tribunal to punish Vladimir Putin for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. He joined Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba at an online event organised by the Chatham House think-tank, where pleas were made for Western nations to set up a tribunal to prosecute the Russian president and his accomplices, PA Media reports. Brown said the plan to set up a new international tribunal is modelled on the actions of the nations which met in London during the Second World War to draft a resolution on Nazi war crimes, which led to the creation of the international military tribunals and the Nuremberg trials. Brown said a new international tribunal is needed as well as existing international investigations by the international criminal court. The former Labour leader said: Ukraine wants our full support to expose and punish the crime of aggression, and that can be done by setting up a special tribunal on the lines proposed in 1942. President Putin has posed a fateful challenge to the post-1945 international order. He has sought to replace the rule of law with a misuse of force. If we were to acquiesce in any way, none of us could ever take freedom or democracy for granted ever again. For all these reasons, and because of the scale of the suffering of the people of Ukraine, I believe that most people would agree that this act of aggression cannot go uninvestigated, unprosecuted or unpunished. The proposal Brown is supporting has been formulated by senior international legal experts who are demanding that the UK and other countries join Ukraine to grant jurisdiction to a dedicated criminal tribunal to investigate both the perpetrators of the crime of aggression and those complicit in that crime. Brown added: Currently the ICC can investigate crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes. As evidence mounts acts against innocent civilians including children and the use of vapour bombs, it may be that Russia can be prosecuted for these crimes. But we lack a crucial extra weapon in the legal fight against Putin. because Russia has not signed up to a separate ICC statute under which nations pledge not to commit so-called ‘crimes of aggression’. We need the special tribunal. Mr Kuleba wants us to act and I believe we must do so now. Putin must not be able to escape justice. Keir Starmer said it was clear Ukraine wanted the strongest possible response from Nato members, adding that the people of the country were “bravely” fighting back. Asked for his view of Vladimir Putin’s state of mind and the way he was acting, the Labour leader answered: Putin is a dangerous aggressor who is in breach of international law. I think he is gambling that Ukraine and our allies, the United Kingdom and Nato would not be united. He will be surprised by how united we are. Keir Starmer called for Conservative fundraiser and co-chair Ben Elliot to be sacked for his role in links between the Tories and Russian money. Speaking during a visit to Birmingham Erdington following his party’s byelection success, the Labour leader, said there was “growing concern” about the links between the Conservative Party and Russian money. He said: Ben Elliot is at the heart of that. We need to strip Russian money away from our politics, not to allow it to influence our politics. There will always be this danger if the Conservative government doesn’t go really hard on this that people will say it must be because you are reliant on Russian money that you are not going more quickly. So, it’s in everybody’s best interests that Ben Elliot steps back from his role – and I think he should actually be sacked from it. Russian elites could have their property seized and handed over to Ukrainian refugees, the deputy prime minister has suggested. Dominic Raab made the remarks as he defended the UK’s response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and the prime minister, Boris Johnson, called for an emergency UN summit after a Russian attack on a nuclear power station in Ukraine. Asked on LBC radio whether Britain could capture property assets owned by Russian oligarchs in punishment for Moscow’s invasion on Ukraine, Raab said: “If we’ve got the evidence and the legal basis, then we’ll do it.” Pressed on whether he would back using those properties to house Ukrainian refugee – a move called for by the Liberal Democrats and reportedly argued for in government by the housing secretary, Michael Gove – Raab replied: “Yes, absolutely. “We are looking at everything in the round, it is a team effort across government, from the foreign and defence secretary through to Michael Gove and, of course, the prime minister is driving this very hard.” The UK government has faced criticism for being too slow in its approach to implementing sanctions against Russian figures and linked assets. The Labour party chairwoman, Anneliese Dodds, said the UK had got to “stop dragging” its feet in clamping down on funds that have come from figures linked to Putin. Read the full story here: Keir Starmer has said Labour wants to see a rule brought in to force oligarchs to register assets over a “very, very short” period measured in days. The Labour leader said: Otherwise what will happen – it’s inevitable – is that people will remove their assets ... they will remove and sell their properties in the UK, and put the money somewhere else. This is the powerful weapon we have to support Ukraine. We’ve got to use it. I say to the government – get rid of the 18-month timeline. Bring it down to a number of days and we will vote it through on Monday. The strongest provisions, we will be united in voting through. But I don’t want to see the government slowing down here or losing the ambition to take that opportunity. Liz Truss said the UK government was doing “all we can to support the Ukrainians”. Speaking in Brussels, the foreign secretary said she was holding various meetings to show “the strength of our unity in challenging Vladimir Putin, in stopping Vladimir Putin, in Ukraine”. We’re doing all we can to support the Ukrainians through defensive weapons, where the UK led – we were the first European country to donate defensive weapons, and we’re also going to be talking about sanctions. She said sanctions were having a “big effect in Russia” but she said she was looking at how to speed up the process. We’ve sanctioned more companies than our counterparts across the world, we’ve just sanctioned two more major oligarchs last night. What I’m doing is looking how we can speed up that process to make even more progress on that front. The number one thing (that’s) important though, is that we are unified with our partners across the world in putting the toughest ever sanctions we’ve had on Russia. Asked for his view of the UK government’s efforts to sanction Russian oligarchs, Keir Starmer said the government could go “further and faster”. The Labour leader said: Where the government is taking action on sanctions, we support them. But they have got to go further and faster. We must go after every oligarch. This is the weapon we have to use and we need to use it now. I am particularly concerned about the arrangements where the government is suggesting there could be 18 months for those overseas owners to register their assets and their ownership. That gives them 18 months to remove their assets from this country, so I want to see the government move on this. Keir Starmer says it seems there is evidence of war crimes and that those responsible needed to be held to account. Asked how Nato and western governments could stop the escalating attacks on Ukraine, the Labour leader said: We need the retreat from the Russian aggression in Ukraine – it’s as simple as that. Every day we are seeing these attacks and the devastation that they are bringing about. Starmer said of Putin: From what I’ve already seen, it seems to me there is evidence of war crimes and it’s very important that all of those responsible are held to account. What’s really important now is the gathering of evidence to make sure that the most powerful case can be brought whenever it can be brought. Keir Starmer described the overnight attack on a nuclear plant in Ukraine as “deeply alarming”. Speaking during a visit to Birmingham, the Labour leader said: I think the whole world will be shocked. I think it’s very important that we unite now and renew that message that Russia must withdraw. We need a ceasefire – and we need to stop this aggression from Russia because this escalation is deeply, deeply concerning. Meanwhile, the head of the UN’s atomic watchdog said there has been no release of radioactive material at the Ukrainian nuclear plant following shelling by Russian forces. Vladimir Putin is “at risk” of ending up in prison for war crimes carried out by his Russian forces in Ukraine, the Justice Secretary said. Dominic Raab was asked on Times Radio whether he saw the conflict ending with the Russian president “imprisoned for war crimes”. The deputy prime minister said: I think it is a very real risk that he must now contemplate. Beyond his personal situation, every commander operating in Ukraine, or indeed Moscow, when they are faced with illegal orders, whether it is to target civilians or otherwise, attack illegal or unlawful sites, they now know the ICC [international criminal court] is investigating and the chief prosecutor Karim Khan is, I believe, travelling to Ukraine. They must now know that they face the very real risk of ending up in the dock of a court and, ultimately, in a prison if they follow through on those illegal, unlawful orders. The Welsh government is to provide £4m in aid to Ukraine. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, who told Sky News that Wales hoped to be “a nation of sanctuary” for Ukrainian refugees, said the aid would help people on the frontline. He told the programme: We know that cash is what is really needed here and now on the ground for people who can obtain those goods and put that money to good use - and that is why the £4m from the Welsh government will go to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal that we launched here in Wales yesterday. He could not say how many refugees that Wales could be dealing with and that many of them might like to stay near family or friends who may live elsewhere. He said: What we would like to see through the UK government is a simple, fast, safe and legal route for those needing to seek sanctuary elsewhere in the world and in Wales to be able to come here. For those people for whom Wales could be even a temporary home, a temporary place of sanctuary, we will want to do everything we can to welcome them and to provide for them. The UK has got to “stop dragging” its feet in clamping down on funds that have come from figures linked to Vladimir Putin, the Labour party chair, Anneliese Dodds, has said. She told Sky News: I certainly would say that we have been far too soft, especially over the last 10 years, on those funds that have come from Putin-linked oligarchs and business people. She rejected the government’s claims that it has been working strongly against economic levers for Putin-linked individuals. She said: I have got to say that, for many, many years, Labour has been calling on the Conservatives to, for example, force transparency around property ownership, especially in London where we know that many of these Putin-linked oligarchs have been stashing their funds in property. We see, even with the new measures that finally have been extracted from the government now that they say they will announce on Monday, an 18-month window before they will come into action – that’s just not good enough. We need immediate action now. We can put those registers of foreign-owned property into place in 28 days, we believe we could get those running and force that transparency. We should have had it many years ago but, above all, we need it right now. We have got to act right now and we have got to stop dragging our feet as the Conservative government has been doing. Keir Starmer has tweeted his congratulations to Paulette Hamilton, Labour’s new MP for Birmingham Erdington. Hamilton won the byelection with a majority of 3,266 and is the city’s first black MP. The Labour leader said in the tweet that she had “made history”. He added: “As a dedicated community champion I know that you will bring security, prosperity and respect to the people of Erdington.” In her victory speech last night, Hamilton said: I’m truly humbled and honoured to be elected as a member of parliament. I will not take your vote for granted, I have met many of you and I have heard what you have to say and I commit to you now, I will work for you … I will be your voice in Westminster. The byelection was triggered by the sudden death in January of the Labour MP Jack Dromey, who had held the seat since 2010. If you are just catching up, here’s the full report on the byelection results from my colleague Jessica Murray: Dominic Raab said it was “doubly reprehensible” that Russian forces had continued to shell a nuclear site after Ukrainian emergency services had looked to put a fire out at Europe’s largest power station. The deputy prime minister told Sky News the Russians had inflicted a bombardment on a “very sensitive, precarious and dangerous facility” in Zaporizhzhia. He said: The fact that the Russians kept on bombarding after there was the fire and the Ukrainian emergency rescue team were trying to get to that makes it doubly reprehensible. Raab said the UN security council meeting being called for by Boris Johnson was needed to “ramp up the pressure on these appalling tactics we are seeing from the Kremlin”. The international community needs to “come down hard on Putin” after Russian forces shelled a nuclear power station in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, according to Dominic Raab. The deputy prime minister told Times Radio: It is clearly reckless, irresponsible and not only the fact they were shooting, bombarding that particular site, but when the Ukrainian emergency authorities were trying to put out the fire, the shelling continued. It must stop. We support the Ukrainians in dealing with the security situation there but also I think come down hard on Vladimir Putin. That’s why the prime minister has called for an emergency United Nations security council meeting in New York so the entire international community can address this, because of course it is a much wider threat, given the nuclear implications. It is an affront to the world at large. The UK is “at the vanguard” of imposing sanctions on Kremlin-linked money, according to the deputy prime minister, as he sought to defend the government’s actions on targeting Russian oligarchs. Dominic Raab was asked during broadcast interviews why the European Union had sanctioned more individual Russian elites than Britain. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Raab said it was a “false distinction” to make, adding: The question is not whether it is individuals or companies – it is where the money is flowing. Separately, he said: There has been a running commentary that the UK has somehow been slow – we’ve not been slow. We’ve been at the vanguard of taking action and, of course, what is really important is we act in concert with our allies, European, American and other Nato allies. For example, we have sanctioned more Russian banks than the EU, including Sberbank, which is the biggest Russian bank. We’ve made it clear and introduced measures so that three million Russian companies cannot raise loans or get listed on the UK stock market. These measures – and each country has slightly different sanctions regimes – are all aimed at tightening the noose, if you like, and starving off the finance that is going into Putin’s war machine. Here’s more on why the UK seems so slow at acting against Putin’s oligarchs: Dominic Raab said he would “absolutely” support giving over seized Russian oligarch property in the UK to Ukrainian refugees. Asked on LBC whether Britain could capture property assets owned by Russian elites in punishment for Moscow’s invasion on Ukraine, the deputy prime minister said: “Yeah, if we’ve got the evidence and the legal basis, then we’ll do it.” Pressed on whether he would back using those properties to house Ukrainian refugees – a move called for by the Liberal Democrats and reportedly argued for in government by housing secretary Michael Gove – Raab replied: Yes, absolutely. We are looking at everything in the round, it is a team effort across government, from the foreign and defence secretary through to Michael Gove and, of course, the prime minister is driving this very hard.

Crucially, the impending crisis could lead energy companies to cut their output, one of the country’s biggest gas companies has said. Businesses located along the Rhine or dependent on it to transport or receive goods are warning that they have been forced to scale back activities and reduce loads drastically – and are now on the verge of having to close some production if cargo ships are no longer able to access the river. The Rhine, which runs about 760 miles from the Swiss Alps to the North Sea, is the second largest river in central and western Europe after the Danube. The majority of nearly 200 million tons of cargo shipped on German rivers – from coal to car parts, food to chemicals – is transported on the Rhine. Its dangerously low levels recall the drought that shut it down for around six months in 2018. Cologne’s Waterway and Shipping Authority has said the “unusually low levels” for this time of year meansbarges have had to reduce their cargo “in order to be able to navigate the river”. This increases prices and reduces the speed with which goods can be transported. Of major concern, as Germany braces itself for a winter of energy rationing due to an 80% reduction in gas flows from Russia, is the knock-on effect the depletion in river traffic could have on energy output. Uniper, Germany’s biggest distributor of Russian gas, which already recently needed a multi-billion euro bailout by the German government to stop it collapsing, has cautioned of potentially “irregular performance” for the next month at Staudinger-5, its coal-fired, 510-megawatt power plant east of Frankfurt – a major tributary of the Rhine – due to interruptions to coal delivery supplies along the river. As demand for coal has increased, Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, has decided to recommission coal-fired power plants, which had previously been mothballed but are now seen as a temporary solution to help Germany wean itself off Russian gas. Industry bosses in Germany, seeking to stave off recession amid high energy prices and rampant inflation, are now paying almost as much attention to daily river levels as they are to the amount of gas flowing from Russia (20%, or 33 million cubic metres). Of more immediate concern are the levels of gas stored at almost two dozen facilities around the country, standing on Thursday at 70.39%. Low water levels usually occur much later in the year, but reflect the drought conditions affecting large parts of Europe. This week, the French energy supplier EDF said it was temporarily reducing output at its nuclear power stations on the rivers Rhône and Garonne as heatwaves restricted its ability to use river water to cool the plants. Meanwhile, in the UK the source of the River Thames was reported on Thursday to have dried up for the first time since records began due to a lack of rainfall. To take a snapshot of the situation in Germany, in Cologne, the largest city on the Rhine, areas of the river have been reduced to a mere trickle. On Thursday the overall level was 1.03 metres with experts saying there was little chance of change in the coming weeks and the level could fall even further due to lack of rainfall. According to Cologne’s city drainage operations, ships wanting to navigate the river have a total height allowance of 111 centimetres plus the water level of 103cm – in other words, just 2.14 metres beneath their keel. Any ship deeper than that was likely to get stuck, they warned, adding that captains carry the sole responsibility for the safe manoeuvre of their vessels. According to Christian Lorenz, of Ports and Freight Traffic Cologne, a lot of freight traffic had already reduced its cargo by half in order to be light enough to travel safely. “Typically a cargo ship carrying salt from Heilbronn would be carrying 2,100 tons on board, but on Monday this had to be reduced to just 900 tons due to the river level,” he told German media. To make up for the reduced capacity, companies are facing the more expensive options of either using more ships or reloading on to lorries or goods trains – but both are currently in short supply. Ships, in particular, are in demand in the Black Sea to bring grain supplies from Ukraine, now possible for the first time in months. Plans are under way for the construction of low-lying barges and ships as well as for the deepening of the Rhine, and better forecasting of water levels as a result of the 2018 crisis, but these measures are slow in being realised. The timing of the Rhine’s shrinking could hardly be worse from an economic perspective. Many of the businesses dependent on it have been racing to fix supply chains massively interrupted by the pandemic and urgently trying to replenish their stocks. Environmentalists are also raising the alarm as rising temperatures lead to a high concentration of pollutants which can be damaging to the flora, fauna and fish. Swimmers have also been warned to keep away from the river because a reduction in water levels can lead to narrower channels and stronger currents."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/commentisfree/2022/sep/25/letters-in-the-uk-far-right-works-from-within","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-25T05:00:24Z","webTitle":"In the UK, the far right works from within | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/sep/25/letters-in-the-uk-far-right-works-from-within","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/sep/25/letters-in-the-uk-far-right-works-from-within","fields":{"headline":"Letters: in the UK, the far right works from within","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"That “Sweden shows that nowhere in Europe is immune to the rise of the far right” is probably true (Editorial). It is also true, as you say, that far-right parties have not gained the significance in the UK that they have elsewhere. The first-past-the-post voting system effectively excludes the representation of small, far-right parties in parliament. More effective, in the UK, is entryism into an existing party. In recent years, the Conservative party has become the vehicle for far-right policies and politicians who promote those policies, not least: cultural intolerance; leaving the EU; the linking of racist anti-immigration politics and Europhobia; promoting a “hostile environment” for asylum seekers and attempting to deport legal asylum seekers to Rwanda; the marginalising of experts (elites); promoting nationalism with those union flags that now drape every minister’s office; attacking democracy by illegally proroguing parliament and denigrating human rights lawyers as “lefties” and “do-gooders” and restricting freedoms to protest. The new secretary of state for health and social care has been less than supportive of abortion rights. Today’s Conservative party has adopted policies and taken positions not that dissimilar to those in Sweden, Orbán’s Hungary, Duda’s Poland and Erdoğan’s Turkey. Dr Robin Richmond Bromyard, Herefordshire Thank you for Drude Dahlerup’s article on Sweden (“Sweden’s mainstream parties cravenly opened the door to anti-immigrant populists”, Comment). The previous Social Democrat-Green party-Left party coalition government, which in one form or another has governed for much of the last 60 years, lost the recent election as over the past decade its policies have been disastrous in regard to education, immigration, finance, healthcare, defence and the environment. One example is that Sweden’s death rate from Covid was double that of other Scandinavian nations. Another is that Sweden let its top-class nuclear power capabilities wither without any viable, nationally controlled alternative(s) in place. The election gave Swedes the choice between “bad” and “maybe not as bad”. I predict there will be a new election before the end of 2023. James Van Alstine Stockholm The Queen’s final gift? Like Catherine Bennett, I had already enjoyed Boris Johnson’s absence last week and his probable frustration at being absent from this historic time (“Tiring of all the pomp? Cheer up – at least Boris Johnson is not there to upstage the royals”, Comment). I found particular pleasure in imagining that the late Queen may have decided to wait for the end of the interminable Conservative leadership election and for Johnson’s formal resignation. I like to think of this as a final dutiful gift to the people of Britain. Thank you, Ma’am. Kate Blok Brighton In metric we trust Jon Ungoed-Thomas summarises well the government’s “consultation” on weights and measures: a deeply flawed questionnaire over an unnecessary, wasteful and potentially damaging proposal (“Want to axe the metric system? Say yes here”, News). Currently, customers have a legal right to be informed of the quantity and price of any product on supermarket shelves in metric units, allowing comparisons to be made. The effect of the proposal is to take away this right. Not more choice, less. Metric units have been the primary units taught in British schools since 1974; pounds/ounces are alien to most young people. You are right: the history of metrication in the UK dates from Victorian times. A firm decision to metricate was made in 1965, long before EEC/EU entry. Pretending that metric units were imposed by the EU is wrong. It is equally wrong to believe that something is desirable merely because Brexit makes it possible. Metric units are used in science, medicine, building, engineering and sport. British imperial units are in common use nowhere else in the world, not even the USA or the Commonwealth. They are complex and poorly understood. Dual units cause confusion and sometimes danger. The consultation outcome may be greeted by the government as giving it the answer it wanted. It is not, however, valid and it deserves to be thrown forcefully in the bin. Dr Peter Burke, chair, UK Metric Association, London N11 Beware tarantula tirades Andrew Rawnsley reminds us that “the author of the notorious ‘black spider’ memos to ministers has sought to pre-empt anxieties about how he will conduct himself” (“Liz Truss can’t speak for the national mood because she really doesn’t understand it”, Comment). But we have also heard about his exasperation at a leaking fountain pen (“I can’t bear this bloody thing. Every stinking time…”). There are lots of opportunities now, as Charles moves from prince to king, for tiny black spidery missives to become overwhelming tarantula tirades. I don’t see him being restrained by leaky pens. Julia Edwards Winchester Physician, heal thyself Thank you to Sian Harding for raising awareness of sex inequality in cardiac health outcomes (“Heart disease: why gender is a matter of life or death”, the New Review). However, I was concerned by the implication that this inequality is the responsibility of the patients rather than the medical personnel. In future, perhaps, her phrasing could be adjusted from “What is it about female patients that makes the male doctors treat them differently?” to “What is it about male doctors that makes them treat female patients differently?”. Also worth noting is that our behaviour does not affect how “male” or “female” we appear, but how “masculine” or “feminine”. The distinction is clear and vital: male and female refer to biological sex; masculine and feminine to the socially constructed expectations associated with our sex, referred to as gender. Women experience different typical heart attack symptoms than men due to their sex, as described in Dr Alyson McGregor’s book Sex Matters. That they are stereotyped as hysterical when they seek help is due to gender. Amy Holland London, SE11 What Picasso can teach Putin Like the visitor photographed in Kenan Malik’s article on Guernica, (“The web has expanded the reach of art but nothing beats standing in front of a Picasso”, Comment), I too stood in front of Picasso’s masterpiece in the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid a few days ago. And, like Malik more than 30 years ago, “I was overcome by a sense of dislocation and horror”. A feeling that was magnified and contemporised when the middle-aged American woman standing next to me turned and said: “Putin should see this.” Mick Beeby Westbury on Trym, Bristol • The first letter on this page was amended on 25 September 2022.

To sceptics, the cryptocurrency is a tool of kleptocrats and gangsters, environmentally monstrous in its consumption of energy, a digitally glamorised Ponzi scheme whose eventual crash will most hurt those least able to afford a loss. Confidence may or may not have been enhanced by the unveiling, by President Nayib Bukele, of images of a proposed bitcoin-shaped Bitcoin City in El Salvador, funded with a bitcoin bond, the currency’s logo embedded in the central plaza, a metropolis powered with geothermal energy from a nearby volcano. Bukele, the self-styled “coolest dictator in the world”, a former publicist who wears baseball caps back to front, has already made El Salvador the first country to adopt bitcoin as the official currency. “The plan is simple,” he said. “As the world falls into tyranny, we’ll create a haven for freedom.” Leaving aside the worrisome Pompeii vibe of the city’s location, some shine has come off the president’s vision with the news that the country’s investments in cryptocurrency have lost 45% of their value, that it scores CCC with the credit rating agency Fitch, and that the perceived risk of its bonds is up there with that of war-torn Ukraine. And Bukele’s talk of freedom doesn’t sit well with Amnesty International’s claim that his recent state of emergency has created “a perfect storm of human rights violations”. But why worry about any of this when you have shiny computer-generated images of a fantasy city to distract you? Unsecured credit line The use of constructional bluster by populist leaders – Trump’s wall, for example – is not in itself anything new. See also the island airport, garden bridge, Irish Sea bridge, 40 new hospitals and 300,000 homes a year promised but not delivered by Boris Johnson, and the nuclear power stations he has implausibly pledged to build at a rate of one a year. Last week his fondness for Potemkin infrastructure took a new twist. Rather than over-promise illusory schemes and under-deliver them, he decided to take credit for something actually built, the £19bn Elizabeth line in London, formerly known as Crossrail, whose central section opens to the public on Tuesday. “We get the big things done,” he boasted to the House of Commons, choosing to ignore the fact that the line was initiated under a Labour prime minister and a Labour mayor of London. He almost makes Nayib Bukele look credible. Behind the red wall If you want a light-hearted night out – a date, a birthday treat – then The House of Shades, a new play by Beth Steel, might not, unless you are an unusual person, be for you. It is a cross between Greek tragedy and what was once called kitchen sink drama, a story of ever-mounting misery set in a Nottinghamshire town from 1965 to 2019. It covers the collapse of manufacturing, the rise of Thatcherism, the promises of New Labour and the disillusionment that led to “red wall” seats voting Conservative in 2019. It features illegal abortion, graphically portrayed, and the effects of inflation, both newly significant. All presented at the Almeida theatre in the famously metropolitan London borough of Islington, not far from the former restaurant where Tony Blair and Gordon Brown did the 1994 deal that shaped some of the events in the play. There’s irony here to make this audience squirm.

Gas prices are soaring globally, largely because of the resurgence of demand for fossil fuels after the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns, depleted storage and the difficulty of ramping up supply after the disruptions of the past two years. But prices have also been significantly affected by Russia’s recent decision to tighten gas supplies to Europe, which experts believe was driven by Vladimir Putin’s desire to move against Ukraine. Europe is dependent on Russia for about 40% of its natural gas supplies, and despite the expansion of renewable energy over the past two decades, that dependency is increasing as countries shift to gas, away from dirtier coal. Germany is particularly vulnerable, as it has shut down nearly all of its nuclear power stations and aims to eliminate coal by 2030. A major new gas pipeline, Gazprom’s $11bn Nord Stream 2 from Russia across the Baltic to Germany, which would heat 26m German homes, has been the focus of Germany’s diplomatic relations with Russia since it was announced in 2015. Construction on the 1,200km pipeline was completed last year, but no gas has yet flowed and its future is now in doubt as Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz dramatically halted approval for the project on Tuesday. Concerns that Russia is using its gas supplies as a weapon to achieve its political aims are well founded. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, noted that Russia’s decision to drop gas supplies to Europe by a quarter came as it was heightening tension towards Ukraine. “I hope this was only a coincidence,” he told the Guardian. Is this really another war over fossil fuels? No. Energy resources are not the focus of this threatened conflict. Vladimir Putin has a long history of territorial ambitions in former Soviet nations, which he made explicit this week, and of attempts to exert political control over Ukraine. Putin is said by supporters to be concerned over the possibility of Nato expansion, although many analysts say this is a pretext. So the Ukraine crisis is not a war over resources, but it has many implications for resource use. Russia is effectively weaponising its dominance over European gas supply for political ends. Reducing reliance on Russian gas is an urgent necessity for the EU to reach net zero emissions, and would also diminish Putin’s political leverage over the EU. It is also worth noting that in the longer term, as Europe weans itself off gas and pursues net zero emissions, the value of this political weapon will wane rapidly. Russia’s industries have never recovered from the fall of communism, and its economy is now based overwhelmingly on the export of fossil fuels, with much of the rest made up of energy-dependent mineral resources, such as iron, steel, aluminium and other metals, and some agriculture. Four in 10 roubles accruing to Russia’s federal budget pre-pandemic came from oil and gas, which made up 60% of Russian exports in 2019. Kremlin strategists are therefore keenly aware that in the longer term the global move to net zero threatens the whole basis of Russia’s economy and global influence. Why is Europe so dependent on Russian gas? Historically, much of Europe was heavily dependent on coal for power and heating. Renewable energy generation has more than doubled since 2004, and reached 22% of final energy production in 2020. However, at the same time the share generated from nuclear power has fallen, from about a third of the EU’s electricity in 1995 to about a quarter today. After the accident at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear power plant in 2011, Germany’s then chancellor Angela Merkel announced an “Energiewende” – an energy shift – that would see all of the country’s reactors shut down. This has increased Germany’s need for gas, and similar moves away from coal and towards lower emissions in other countries – including the UK, which despite North Sea gas production is a net importer of gas – have heightened the dependency. The geopolitical implications of this dependency, as well as the climate impacts, are now unignorable. Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington DC, says: “It has taken the current crisis for Germany and the EU to recognise that its co-dependence on Russian gas is a geopolitical and climate nightmare from which they must finally awake. Reducing Russian gas reliance is a huge climate and moral imperative that Europe must prioritise.” Will Russia turn off gas supplies to Europe if the EU and the UK impose sanctions? That would be a momentous move from Russia. Any further reductions of Russian gas supply to Europe would have severe consequences, for Europe but also for Russia itself. Birol said earlier this month, before sanctions were imposed: “If Russia stops the gas supply to Europe, it could have a seismic impact on European energy. [Russia] has to consider the consequences if existing oil and gas supplies to Europe are halted.” He added: “Failure to maintain [supplies] would shatter Russia’s reputation as a reliable partner and that would be a tectonic shift. Russia would be seen as a threat and that would have far-reaching consequences for European economies, but even more consequences for Russia. Europe would choose a strategy to diverge from Russia.” What impact will Russia’s actions in Ukraine have on climate diplomacy? Russia was almost invisible at the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow last November, after a surprising public commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2060. But the Kremlin has left the details of the goal vague and shown little sign of updating Russia’s emissions commitments for 2030, which are key to limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C. This is a crucial year for climate diplomacy, as the pledges from all countries in Glasgow are still inadequate for the 1.5C goal, and the UK Cop26 presidency is hoping for major progress before the next UN climate meeting in Egypt this November. Russia’s stance on Ukraine will certainly have an impact on those discussions, not least as any conflict will focus attention on the move from fossil fuels. It is also notable that Russia’s oil and gas operations are among the worst in the world for the climate. Data released this week by the IEA shows that emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas and the major component of natural gas, are 70% higher than countries had claimed. Russia makes little or no attempt to capture methane from its oil and gas drilling, and to stop its pipelines leaking, so there are huge opportunities. If Putin were serious about tackling the climate crisis, Russia could provide an invaluable service to the rest of the world by plugging these leaks – reducing methane globally by a third by 2030 could reduce temperatures by 0.2C – and at current gas prices this could be done at no net cost and could even be profitable. Should the UK be fracking more, or producing more from the North Sea, to reduce dependency on Russian gas? No. Attempts to frack in the UK started more than a decade ago, but went nowhere, in part because of protests but also because the economics of industrial fracking in a densely populated country make it impractical. Any move to restart fracking now would take many years to produce any gas, long after the current gas price crisis has been forgotten. New licences for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea are also currently under consideration by the government, and on Thursday the Committee on Climate Change will publish its advice to ministers on whether these licences can be compatible with the UK’s climate goals. However, any newly licensed fields would also take years to come into production, so would have no impact on the current crisis. Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, warns of falling for false solutions: “We know that some opponents of climate policy will try to hide the truth and instead fool the public into falsely believing that the soaring prices are due to green energy. If they are successful, they might slow down the transition to clean domestic energy.” Far more good could be done in the shorter term by insulating homes and ramping up renewable energy generation. What is the answer to the crisis? Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University in the US and an adviser to the UN secretary-general on the climate, says: “The west needs to meet Putin’s flagrant breach of international law with tough sanctions to force a change in calculus in Moscow. Putin believes he has to the largest extent sanction-proofed Russia, but Russia earns hundreds of millions of dollars a day from sales of oil and refined products, and more from sales of gas and minerals. “Weaning ourselves off these as quickly as possible is one route available to the west. In fact, Putin’s understanding of what decarbonisation would mean for Russian energy exports in the medium and long term may be a factor in the timing of Putin’s attack on Ukraine now.” Ending the use of fossil fuels is imperative, to reach net zero emissions and stave off the worst impacts of climate breakdown. But the shift will also create geopolitical tensions as the world’s massive fossil fuel exporters – Russia, Saudi Arabia and some other Middle Eastern countries, Latin American oil producers, Australia – begin to lose out economically. The crisis in Ukraine shows that some fossil fuel producers at least may not want to give up without a struggle the political leverage they gain from their resources."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jun/28/malaysian-foreign-minister-says-concerns-remain-about-aukus-pact-after-meeting-with-penny-wong","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-28T10:02:33Z","webTitle":"Malaysian foreign minister says concerns remain about Aukus pact after meeting with Penny Wong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/28/malaysian-foreign-minister-says-concerns-remain-about-aukus-pact-after-meeting-with-penny-wong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jun/28/malaysian-foreign-minister-says-concerns-remain-about-aukus-pact-after-meeting-with-penny-wong","fields":{"headline":"Malaysian foreign minister says concerns remain about Aukus pact after meeting with Penny Wong","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Malaysia’s foreign minister, Saifuddin Abdullah, has said that his country’s concerns about the Aukus nuclear submarine pact remain unchanged, after a meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday with his Australian counterpart, Penny Wong. Saifuddin told reporters he communicated Malaysia’s ongoing concern about the security deal between Australia, the UK and the US during a “very candid” discussion with Wong on her first visit to the Malaysian capital as Australia’s foreign minister. Regional objections to Australia’s planned acquisition of nuclear-propelled submarines surfaced almost immediately after Aukus was unveiled by Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison. Saifuddin and Indonesia’s foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, pointed to the risk of a regional arms race at a time of increasing tensions in the East and South China Seas. Last November, the Morrison government deployed then foreign minister Marise Payne to Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia in an effort to smooth over tensions. Since being sworn in just over a month ago, Wong has embarked on a diplomatic offensive in the region to reset relationships disturbed by Aukus and to counter increasingly assertive regional outreach by China in the Pacific. Asked on Tuesday whether or not his negative view of Aukus had ameliorated since the unveiling of the pact last September, Malaysia’s foreign minister said: “Malaysia highly values regional peace and security of the Asean region.” “We want to maintain the South China Sea in particular and the region as a whole as a region of peace, of commerce, of prosperity. “We had a very candid discussion on Aukus just now and I thank [Australia’s] foreign minister for explaining the government’s position. Malaysia’s position remains the same. I have mentioned that to the foreign minister.” Wong said she appreciated the opportunity “to explain how we see Aukus to [Saifuddin] and to other counterparts in the visits I have made prior to this visit, which are obviously to Vietnam and to Jakarta”. In early June Wong travelled to Jakarta with Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, meeting her Indonesian counterpart during the visit. She also visited Vietnam before arriving in Malaysia for Tuesday’s meeting with Saifuddin. “It is important that we listen to concerns, we respond to them respectfully,” Wong said in Kuala Lumpur. “That’s how the new government will seek to deal with some of the issues that have been raised and we hope that over time, people’s concerns will be able to be allayed.” Wong said Labor had taken the decision to support the Aukus pact while in opposition, and she said Australia had no nuclear ambitions. “We are not a nuclear power,” she said. “There are nuclear powers in this region but Australia is not one of them.” “What we are doing is replacing an existing capability with a new capability, and that is nuclear-propelled submarines. We remain very clear that we do not seek and nor would we ever seek to have any nuclear capability on our submarines.” In an implicit reference to China’s growing assertiveness, Wong said Australia understood the region was being “reshaped economically and strategically” and countries in the region, including Malaysia and others south-east Asia were attempting to “navigate this period of change”. She said Australia’s objective was not to meet aggression with aggression, but rather bolster the rules-based order. “Australia will always operate on the basis that we have this objective: a region that is peaceful, a region that is stable, a region that is prosperous, a region in which sovereignty is respected, and importantly, a region where rules enable some predictability to state behaviour and the way in which disputes are dealt with,” Wong said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Tuesday’s meeting was cordial apart from the pre-existing differences on Aukus and the two foreign ministers pledged to work together to bolster trade and bilateral cooperation on cybersecurity. While Wong is in Asia, Albanese has begun a series of meetings with foreign counterparts in Madrid as part of the Nato summit. The focus in Europe is on rising Russian aggression, but Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Korea have been invited to Madrid as part of efforts to build an Indo-Pacific focus. As Wong attempts to reset relationships in the region, Albanese will travel to France after Madrid to execute a rapprochement with Emmanuel Macron. Ahead of the visit, the Australian government agreed to pay €550m (A$830m) in a settlement with Naval Group over the former Morrison government’s controversial decision to ditch the French attack class submarine project when it signed the Aukus pact."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/11/russia-ukraine-war-putin-live-news-missile-strikes-g7-zelenskiy-crisis-talks-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-11T20:15:57Z","webTitle":"G7 leaders warn Putin over use of nuclear weapons; Zelenskiy calls for international mission along Belarus border – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/11/russia-ukraine-war-putin-live-news-missile-strikes-g7-zelenskiy-crisis-talks-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/11/russia-ukraine-war-putin-live-news-missile-strikes-g7-zelenskiy-crisis-talks-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"G7 leaders warn Putin over use of nuclear weapons; Zelenskiy calls for international mission along Belarus border – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We’re closing the blog for now, but we’ll be back soon with more. For now, some key links and updates from the day: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked G7 leaders to supply more air defence systems and for an international monitoring mission on the Belarusian border. The UN and some Nato countries warned that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, described the attack, in which cruise missiles and armed drones rained down on parks, playgrounds, power stations and other civilian targets, as “a profound change in the nature of this war”. Roughly 30% of the Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been hit by Russia since Monday, officials said. The Kremlin has confirmed that President Vladimir Putin will meet his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Thursday to discuss Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has told the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency that he is “open to dialogue” on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Elon Musk denied a report that he spoke with Putin before tweeting a proposal to end the war in Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia. Belarus’ defence ministry has said the joint deployment of forces with Russia on its borders is a defensive measure. The moves were to ensure “security” along the border between Belarus and Ukraine, it claimed. A deputy head of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been kidnapped by Russian forces, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Russia’s military strikes have damaged hundreds of cultural sites around Ukraine, the AP reports. In a speech to Unesco, the Ukrainian president urged the UN cultural agency to expel Russia, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the Unesco World Heritage Committee. Zelenskiy said Ukraine was nominating the Black Sea city of Odesa to be inscribed on the agency’s World Heritage list, AP reported. He also said that 540 “objects of cultural heritage, cultural institutions and religious buildings” have been destroyed or damaged since the start of Russia’s invasion in February. He added: Why are representatives of Russia still among you? What are they doing at Unesco?” As millions in Ukraine are facing blackouts due to the Russian missile attacks on energy infrastructure, the government has urged civilians to cut their electricity use and not use domestic appliances such as ovens and washing machines, Reuters reports: Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukrainians had voluntarily cut their electricity consumption by an average of 10% on Monday after Russia’s attacks, and urged them to limit use between 5pm and 11pm local time on Tuesday. “We are united and will stand firm,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “Please don’t turn on energy-intensive appliances: electric stoves, electric kettles, power tools, heaters and air conditioners, ovens and irons, microwave ovens, coffee makers, washing machines and dishwashers.” Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, has told CNN that Russian missiles have hit roughly 30% of the country’s energy infrastructure since Monday. Halushchenko said: We send this message to our partners: we need to protect the sky. Russians they are not playing on some games on international laws. They don’t care about any kind of international agreements or conventions.” He also told CNN that this was the first time since the start of war that Russia had “dramatically targeted” Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and that Ukraine was working to reconnect quickly from other sources. Russia’s defence ministry earlier confirmed that its troops were continuing long-range air strikes on Ukraine’s military and energy infrastructure. Reports suggested that six people were injured in a second Russian strike at the Ladyzhyn thermal power plant (LTPP) in Ukraine’s Vinnytsia region. Halushchenko’s comments come after some Nato countries and the UN have warned that Russia may be committing a war crime with its ongoing attack on civilian targets. Ukrainians in Prague rallied this evening to protest Russian missile strikes, the AP reports: The protesters held blue-and-yellow crosses with the names of the cities hit by the Russian missiles. “Ukraine needs air defenses to be able to prevent the massacres of the civilian population and destruction of our cities,” Anastasiia Sihnaievska told the crowd. “We are protecting our right to live,” said Sihnaievska, who fled her town of Zhytomyr because of the Russian invasion. People chanted “Russia’s terrorist!” and “More weapons for Ukraine!” They unveiled a giant Ukrainian flag and displayed banners that read “Air defense systems for Ukraine,” “We will not forget, We will not forgive,” and “Stop bombing Ukraine.” Some photos below from the demonstration, which as the AP noted, came the same day that the presidents of Czechia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Montenegro said the missile strikes against Ukrainian civilians “constitute war crimes under international law”. The US will be watching which nations side with Russia at Wednesday’s General Assembly vote on the resolution condemning Russian annexations in eastern Ukraine, the US ambassador to the UN said today, CNN reports. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said there were roughly 70 co-sponsors of the resolution and that the vote was geared toward “defending the UN” and its charter, the network reported. She said she couldn’t predict how China, India or other nations would vote. Earlier in the week, Russia unsuccessfully pushed for a secret ballot for the vote. Forensic workers in protective gear pulled several bodies wrapped in black plastic from a mass grave in Ukraine’s liberated city of Lyman today as authorities work to assess the death toll and damage from more than four months of Russian occupation, the Associated Press reports. An AP reporter said that 10 body bags lay beside a roughly 100ft (30-metre) trench, and that authorities said 32 bodies had been exhumed so far in the city, which is in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. The head of the Donetsk region’s military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said the victims in the mass grave were Ukrainian soldiers, and that there were also 22 civilians buried in individual graves at the site, located by a cemetery on the outskirts of Lyman. This was the second burial site uncovered in Lyman so far. More background from the AP: As Ukrainian authorities entered the city, they found that many civilian residents had been killed by shelling. Others, mostly older people, had died during the Russian occupation because of a lack of food and medicine, Mark Tkachenko, communications inspector for the Kramatorsk district police of the Donetsk region, told the AP. The destruction in Lyman, a key rail and transit hub, is so widespread that large portions of the city have been completely destroyed. Ukrainian authorities are now working to restore basic infrastructure and investigate how civilians lived and died during the Russian occupation. Forensic investigators on Tuesday lifted a black plastic bag from the trench and unzipped it to reveal a decomposed body in a bloody uniform of the Ukrainian armed forces. The remains were briefly inspected by investigators, then placed in another body bag and set among several others beside the trench. Authorities said children have been found among the dead, and that most victims appeared to have died as the result of the heavy shelling that besieged the city for months. Authorities said the investigation was ongoing and that it was too soon to say whether the victims showed signs of execution or torture, the AP also reported. More from the AP reporter on the ground: It’s 9pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s where we stand: Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday. Amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets, Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range air strikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure. The leaders of the G7 have condemned Russia’s most recent missile attacks in Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms”, and vowed to stand “firmly” with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. The “indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilian populations constitute a war crime” by Russian forces, they said in a joint statement following their meeting with President Zelenskiy. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has warned leaders of the G7 nations that President Vladimir Putin still has “room for escalation”. Zelenskiy also called on G7 leaders for more air defence capabilities to stop Russia and to help Ukraine fund an air defence system after dozens of Russian attacks knocked out power facilities across the country. President Zelenskiy has accused Russia of trying to directly draw Belarus into its war in Ukraine. Zelenskiy, who joined a virtual meeting with heads of the Group of Seven nations on Tuesday, called on leaders to support an international monitoring mission on the Ukraine-Belarus border. Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, said the mobilisation of troops in Belarus poses a threat to Ukraine’s supply lines in the north of the country. Belarus’ defence ministry has said the joint deployment of forces with Russia on its borders is a defensive measure. The moves were to ensure “security” along the border between Belarus and Ukraine, it claimed. On Monday, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said he had ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what he said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and its western allies. Nato is “closely monitoring” Russia’s nuclear forces, its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said. The Russian leader’s veiled nuclear threats are “dangerous and irresponsible”, Stoltenberg said. He added that any deliberate attack against allies’ critical infrastructure “would be met with a united and determined response”. A deputy head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been kidnapped by Russian forces, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom has said. Valeriy Martynyuk was seized on Monday and is being detained in an unknown location, Energoatom said in a post on Telegram. President Vladimir Putin has told the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, that the situation around Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is “of concern”. At a meeting in St Petersburg broadcast on Russian state television, Putin told Grossi that Moscow was open to dialogue and would discuss “all issues” concerning the nuclear facility’s operations. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has called for a ceasefire in Ukraine just days ahead of a meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and President Vladimir Putin. Çavuşoğlu urged “a viable ceasefire and a just peace” based on Ukraine’s territorial integrity. Erdoğan and Putin are expected to meet on Thursday in Kazakhstan’s capital Astana to discuss Ukraine and bilateral relations, the Kremlin confirmed. Moscow would not turn down a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, at the G20 meeting next month, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Moscow was open to talks with the west on the Ukraine war but had yet to receive any “serious offers” to negotiate, Lavrov said in an interview on Russian state television. Vladimir Putin has made strategic errors in his pursuit of the war in Ukraine partly because there are so few restraints on his leadership, according to the head of the British spy agency GCHQ. Russia’s soldiers are running out of supplies and munitions and initial gains made by Moscow are being reversed, Jeremy Fleming said in a rare public address. Western diplomats are predicting that the number of countries voting to oppose the illegal annexation of parts of eastern Ukraine will have fallen from a similar vote held at the UN in March. The UN’s general assembly is due to vote this week on an EU-sponsored motion condemning the annexation of parts of eastern Ukraine off the back of sham referendums. The US is speeding up the shipment of two National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) to Ukraine, the White House said. President Joe Biden had pledged to support Kyiv’s air defences in a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday, following a wave of devastating Russian missile attacks on cities across Ukraine. The US has approved sending Ukraine a total of eight NASAMS air defences so far, with two expected to be delivered soon and six more sent over a longer time frame. Speaking to reporters, the White House’s national security council spokesperson John Kirby said: We think that we’re on track to get those first two over there in the very near future. We are certainly interested in expediting the delivery of NASAMS to Ukraine as soon as we can. A British businessman has been arrested on US charges of conspiring to violate sanctions placed on the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, according to prosecutors. Graham Bonham-Carter was arrested in the UK, and New York federal prosecutors will be seeking his extradition, Reuters reports. Bonham-Carter was also charged with wire fraud for funding US properties purchased by Deripaska and efforts to expatriate Deripaska’s artwork in the US. There was scant attempt to sugarcoat the assessment. With the trams stilled, lights going down across the city and the mobile network intermittent, arguably there was little point in doing otherwise. “We have to brace ourselves for hard times,” said Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, as he addressed local and international journalists in a building off the western Ukrainian city’s cobbled Rynov Square. Winter was coming and with it “perhaps the worst-ever period for our country”, the mayor said. For all that the missiles would continue to rain down it was the cold that the Russians believed could break the Ukrainian spirit. Stock up on fire wood, buy in heaters, insulate where you can, Sadovyi counselled. It was time for Ukrainians to resort to the “old-time methods”. We are in for hard weeks and months ahead. Four [electricity] substations in the region have been put out of operation and to bring them back into operation they need transformers that are not available. It is hard right now to predict what will happen tomorrow. We will do all we can to keep the medical facilities operating. Lviv, just 50 miles from the Polish border, has at times felt somewhat removed from Vladimir Putin’s war. Direct attacks have been few and far between. Following the initial shock over the launch of the Russian president’s “special military operation”, the bars and restaurants had swiftly rediscovered the liveliness that one would expect of an old university town. When air raid sirens would go off to warn that Russian missiles had been launched, destination unknown, the danger could be barely acknowledged at times. Spring gave way to a relatively care-free summer. The attacks of Monday and Tuesday changed all that. Read the full story here: Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine. Russia has added the US tech giant Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, to its list of “terrorists and extremist” organisations, Russian news agencies have reported. Facebook and Instagram were both banned in Russia in March for “carrying out extremist activities” and the company was accused of tolerating “Russophobia”. Meta had announced back then that the platforms would allow statements such as “death to Russian invaders” but not credible threats against civilians. A Moscow court in June rejected an appeal by Meta, whose lawyer said it was not carrying out extremist activity. The company has now been added to a list of “terrorists and extremists” by Russia’s financial monitoring agency, Rosfinmonitoring. The list concerns “organisations and individuals with regard to which there is information about their involvement in extremist activities or terrorism”. The ban does not apply to WhatsApp, which Meta also owns. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has asked G7 leaders to supply more air defence systems and for an international monitoring mission on the Belarusian border, as Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with a new wave of missile strikes on Tuesday. Zelenskiy’s comments came amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets. Warning that the Russian president “still has room for further escalation”, Zelenskiy added that the prompt supply of more air defence systems would accelerate the end of the war. “When Ukraine receives a sufficient quantity of modern and effective air defence systems, the key element of Russia’s terror, rocket strikes, will cease to work,” Zelenskiy said in a video-streamed address. Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine reported on Tuesday that Ukraine had received a delivery of the German Iris-T air defence system and the White House National Security Council spokesman, John Kirby, said the US was working to expedite the shipment of sophisticated Nasams air defences capable of engaging Russian cruise missiles that was first announced in August. While Zelenskiy had been expected to press for additional air defence systems to counter the Russian missile threat, and renewed his call for more sanctions against Moscow, his request for international monitoring of Ukraine’s border with Belarus comes amid mounting fears that Minsk is being drawn ever further into the Kremlin’s war. Read the full story here: Elon Musk has denied a report that he spoke with Vladimir Putin before tweeting a proposal to end the war in Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia. The Tesla CEO was asked about the report, which was first written about by Ian Bremmer to his subscribers and later picked up by Vice. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance has been monitoring Russia’s nuclear forces and that any deliberate attack against allies’ critical infrastructure “would be met with a united and determined response”. Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday, amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets. Vladimir Putin’s veiled nuclear threats are “dangerous and irresponsible”, Stoltenberg added. He said Nato had not noticed any changes in Russia’s “posture”, but would be monitoring it. Here’s more on the report that the Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk, spoke directly to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, before tweeting his peace plan to end the war in Ukraine. According to Ian Bremmer’s mailout sent to Eurasia Group subscribers, Musk also appeared concerned about direct threats from Putin. From the Financial Times’ Max Seddon: President Vladimir Putin has told the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, that the situation around Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is “of concern”. At a meeting in St Petersburg broadcast on Russian state television, Putin told Grossi that Moscow was open to dialogue and would discuss “all issues” concerning the nuclear facility’s operations. Ahead of his meeting with the UN’s nuclear watchdog head, Putin said: We see that today there are elements of an excessively dangerous politicisation of everything connected with nuclear activity. We very much hope that, thanks to your efforts, we will be able to reduce all rhetoric and bring this area of our cooperation to normal, despite all the turbulence and complex processes that are taking place on the world stage. The Russian president said he was “happy” to discuss “all issues that are of mutual interest to us and may even cause concern to someone”: For example, as far as the situation around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is concerned. In any case, we are open to this dialogue and are glad to see you. Elon Musk spoke directly to Vladimir Putin before tweeting his peace plan to end the war in Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia, according to a report. In a mailout sent to Eurasia Group subscribers, Ian Bremmer claimed Musk told him that the Russian president was “prepared to negotiate” if Crimea remained in Russian hands. Putin also reportedly insisted to the Tesla chief executive that Ukraine would have to accept permanent neutrality and recognise Russia’s annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. According to Bremmer, Musk said Putin told him these goals would be reached “no matter what”, including the possible use of nuclear weapons if Ukraine invaded Crimea. Bremmer wrote that Musk told him that “everything needed to be done to avoid that outcome”. Following the alleged conversation with Putin, Musk posted a Twitter poll with his suggestions for ending the war in Ukraine. Musk argued that to reach peace, Russia should be allowed to keep the Crimea Peninsula that it seized in 2014. He also proposed holding votes in parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia that the Kremlin says it is annexing. “Russia leaves if that is will of the people,” he said. Ukraine has received a delivery of the German Iris-T air defence system, Der Spiegel magazine reported. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, confirmed yesterday that the first of four Iris-T SLM air defence systems would be delivered within days. Lambrecht’s statement, delivered hours after Russia unleashed a massive wave of aerial strikes on cities across Ukraine on Monday, said: The renewed missile fire on Kyiv and the many other cities show how important it is to supply Ukraine with air defence systems quickly. Russia’s attacks with missiles and drones terrorise the civilian population in particular. That is why we are now providing support especially with air defence weapons. Britain’s prime minister, Liz Truss, is “firmly committed” to visiting Ukraine “as soon as possible”, Downing Street has said in the wake of Russian missile attacks on Ukrainian cities this week. Asked about what impact the renewed threat of Russian strikes on Kyiv could have on a potential visit by Truss, a No 10 spokesperson said: I couldn’t get into the security considerations around trips like that nor could I get into speculation on dates. As you’ll appreciate, the Prime Minister is firmly committed to visiting as soon as possible. The leaders of the G7 have condemned Russia’s most recent missile attacks in Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms”, and vowed to stand “firmly” with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. The “indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilian populations constitute a war crime” by Russian forces, they said in a joint statement following their meeting with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. They vowed to hold President Vladimir Putin and those responsible for the attacks on Ukraine to account. They also said they would “never recognise” Russia’s “illegal annexation” of Ukrainian territory or “the sham referenda that Russia uses to justify it”. The statement continued: No country wants peace more than Ukraine, whose people have suffered death, displacement and countless atrocities as the result of Russian aggression. Leaders “deplore deliberate Russian escalatory steps’, including the partial mobilisation of reservists and “irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, it said: We reaffirm that any use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences. It added: We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military, diplomatic and legal support and will stand firmly with Ukraine for as long as it takes. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has told leaders of the G7 nations that President Vladimir Putin still has “room for escalation” after two days of widespread strikes on cities across Ukraine. The Russian leader “is now in the final stage of his reign” and is “a threat to all of us”, Zelenskiy said during the video address to G7 leaders. He also called on G7 leaders for more air defence capabilities to stop Russia: When Ukraine receives a sufficient quantity of modern and effective air defence systems, the key element of Russia’s terror, rocket strikes, will cease to work. The Ukrainian president thanked Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for speeding up the delivery of the IRIS-T air defence system and the US president, Joe Biden, for deliveries of air defence systems. He also asked G7 leaders to help Ukraine fund an air defence system after dozens of Russian attacks knocked out power facilities across the country: I am asking you to strengthen the overall effort to help financially with the creation of an air shield for Ukraine. Millions of people will be grateful to the Group of Seven for such assistance. It’s 6.15pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday. Amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets, Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range air strikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure. The death toll from Monday’s Russian missile attacks on a swathe of Ukrainian cities has risen to 19 people, with over 100 wounded, according to figures from the Ukrainian state emergency services. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, warned on Monday of even more “severe retaliation” following Saturday’s attack on the Kerch bridge linking Russia and Crimea. An attack on the Lviv region in western Ukraine on Tuesday left parts of the city without electricity. The mayor of the city, Andriy Sadovyi, appealed to residents to keep water supplies on hand ahead of expected service interruptions following Russian strikes which appear to have hit critical power infrastructure in the region. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Russia of trying to directly draw Belarus into its war in Ukraine. Zelenskiy, who joined a virtual meeting with heads of the Group of Seven nations on Tuesday, called on leaders to support an international monitoring mission on the Ukraine-Belarus border. Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, said the mobilisation of troops in Belarus poses a threat to Ukraine’s supply lines in the north of the country. Belarus’ defence ministry has said the joint deployment of forces with Russia on its borders is a defensive measure. The moves were to ensure “security” along the border between Belarus and Ukraine, it claimed. On Monday, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said he had ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what he said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and its western allies. Nato is “closely monitoring” Russia’s nuclear forces, its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said. The Russian leader’s veiled nuclear threats are “dangerous and irresponsible”, Stoltenberg said. He added that any deliberate attack against allies’ critical infrastructure “would be met with a united and determined response”. Six people have been injured in a second Russian strike at the Ladyzhyn thermal power plant (LTPP) in Ukraine’s Vinnytsia region, according to reports. Russia targeted Ukrainian energy infrastructure in a series of coordinated attacks across Ukraine for the second day in a row on Tuesday. A deputy head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been kidnapped by Russian forces, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom has said. Valeriy Martynyuk was seized on Monday and is being detained in an unknown location, Energoatom said in a post on Telegram. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has called for a ceasefire in Ukraine just days ahead of a meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and President Vladimir Putin. Çavuşoğlu urged “a viable ceasefire and a just peace” based on Ukraine’s territorial integrity. Erdoğan and Putin are expected to meet on Thursday in Kazakhstan’s capital Astana to discuss Ukraine and bilateral relations, the Kremlin confirmed. Moscow would not turn down a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, at the G20 meeting next month, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Moscow was open to talks with the west on the Ukraine war but had yet to receive any “serious offers” to negotiate, Lavrov said in an interview on Russian state television. Vladimir Putin has made strategic errors in his pursuit of the war in Ukraine partly because there are so few restraints on his leadership, according to the head of the British spy agency GCHQ. Russia’s soldiers are running out of supplies and munitions and initial gains made by Moscow are being reversed, Jeremy Fleming said in a rare public address. Western diplomats are predicting that the number of countries voting to oppose the illegal annexation of parts of eastern Ukraine will have fallen from a similar vote held at the UN in March. The UN’s general assembly is due to vote this week on an EU-sponsored motion condemning the annexation of parts of eastern Ukraine off the back of sham referendums. Hello, Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest news from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Western diplomats are predicting that the number of countries voting to oppose the illegal annexation of parts of eastern Ukraine will have fallen from a similar vote held at the UN in March, but still expect more than 100 UN states to vote against Russia’s actions. The UN general assembly is due to vote on Wednesday or Thursday on an EU-sponsored motion condemning the annexation of parts of Eastern Ukraine off the back of sham referendums. The motion has been carefully worded to draw maximum support, stressing the need for dialogue and the inviability of national borders. But even so, many African and Gulf states are refusing to take sides. In March, in the immediate wake of the invasion, 141 countries opposed Russia’s action, 35 abstained and five supported Russia. The diplomats said Russia had been “trying very hard in Africa to frame this as a west versus the rest conflict”, adding “lots of things play into these votes that are not necessarily the question in hand”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, last week visited the foreign ministers of Ghana, Senegal and Ivory Coast on his first African tour since the Russian offensive. He is also trying to build what Ukraine admits has been previously inadequate contacts in India and China. A western diplomat said: To any straight-thinking person this is a slam dunk, but countries relationships with each other and their interdependencies are complex and very messy. But western diplomats said an “important shift” was under way amongst some powerful non-aligned countries that had shown themselves “increasingly uncomfortable” with Putin. The diplomats pointed to a Chinese official statement reaffirming the importance of national sovereignty, and the urging by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, for an end to the fighting. India, the diplomat pointed out, is dependent on Russia for oil and military equipment: They think twice about whether they can afford to trim their principles or more probably rely on countries like the UK to defend them and to allow them to operate in a slightly grey area. The sources added that they “could not see China cutting Russia adrift since it would fear that Russia might ultimately be drawn into the western orbit”. But they claim the repeated requirement of Russia to go in front of the UN General Assembly to explain why it is using its veto to then to be defeated humiliatingly is having the cumulative effect of making Russia feel diplomatically isolated. “It is a case of reducing the space for authoritarian dictators”, the source said. Russia, it was pointed out, has in recent months been thrown off the UN Human Rights Council board for UN women, and the board for Unicef, and efforts are under way to squeeze them off the UN Economic and Social Committee. Ukraine has been calling for Russia to be declared a terrorist state, a move that could have an impact on Russia’s seat as one of the permanent five on the UN Security Council, although that is extremely unlikely under the existing rules. The US is likely to say if about 100 member states in the General Assembly vote to support the EU resolution that compares favourably with the vote held in 2014 at the time of the annexation of Ukraine. • This post was amended on 18 October 2022. An earlier version said that Russia being declared a terrorist state would see it “lose its seat as one of the permanent five on the UN Security Council”. However, there is nothing in the UN charter that explicitly states this, and the wording has been amended accordingly. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has said Russia’s possible use of nuclear weapons is highly unpredictable. Speaking to reporters after the virtual G7 meeting on Russia’s invasion fo Ukraine, Kishida said: The situation does not at all allow any prediction. It requires serious, close attention. For the past 77 years, the world has continued to put a stop to using nuclear weapons. This history of not using nuclear weapons must continue further. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for an international monitoring mission on the Ukraine-Belarus border. Zelenskiy, who joined a virtual meeting with heads of the Group of Seven nations, called on leaders to support the international mission. He told G7 leaders: Russia is trying to directly draw Belarus into this war, playing a provocation that we are allegedly preparing an attack on this country. It comes after the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said he had ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what he said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and western backers. During the G7 meeting, which has now ended, Zelenskiy also called on leaders to give Ukraine enough air defence capabilities to defend itself against Russia, as well as tough new sanctions on Moscow. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance is “closely monitoring” Russia’s nuclear forces and that any deliberate attack against allies’ critical infrastructure “would be met with a united and determined response”. The Nato military alliance “is not party” to the conflict in Ukraine, Stoltenberg said during a news conference. “But our support is playing a key role,” he added. Allies remained “united in their support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and self-defence”, he said. Stoltenberg told reporters: Ukraine has the momentum and continues to make significant gains. While Russia is increasingly resorting to horrific and indiscriminate attacks on civilians and critical infrastructure. President Putin is “failing in Ukraine” and his “attempted annexations, partial mobilisation, and reckless nuclear rhetoric represent the most significant escalation since the start of the war”, he said. The Russian leader’s veiled nuclear threats are “dangerous and irresponsible”, Stoltenberg added: Russia knows that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. We are closely monitoring Russia’s nuclear forces. We have not seen any changes in Russia’s posture. But we remain vigilant. The speech was heavily trailed, but here is what Jeremy Fleming, head of the British spy agency GCHQ, had to say about Vladimir Putin and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this afternoon: Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machines spouted, it is clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefields and in cyberspace is turning the tide. Having failed in two major military strategies already. Putin’s plan has hit the courageous reality of Ukrainian defence. With little effective internal challenge, Putin’s decision making has proved flawed. Yesterday’s attacks in Kyiv and across Ukraine are another example. It is a high stakes strategy that is leading to strategic errors in judgement. Their gains are being reversed, and the costs to Russia in people and equipment are staggering. We know – and Russian military commanders know – that their supplies and ammunition are running out. Russia’s forces are exhausted. The use of prisoners as reinforcements, and now the mobilisation of tens of thousands of inexperienced conscripts, speaks of a really desperate situation. And the Russian people have started to understand all of that, too. They’re seeing just how badly Putin has misjudge the situation. They’re fleeing the draft, realising they can no longer travel, and they know their access to modern technologies and external influences will be drastically restricted. And they’re feeling the extent of the dreadful human cost of his war of choice. During her foreign ministry briefing, Russia’s Maria Zakharova has also expressed Russian displeasure with Moldova and Estonia. She said Russia was concerned at statements by Estonia’s foreign minister, Urmas Reinsalu, and was also concerned about an incident affecting Russian diplomats in Moldova. Zakharova also accused the west of hypocrisy in not criticising Ukrainian officials for statements that appear to support violence, accusing the west of “conniving at Kyiv’s impunity”. While Nato’s Jens Stoltenberg has been speaking to the media about nuclear exercises, and the GCHQ boss Jeremy Fleming has been giving his lecture, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has also been giving a briefing. The key point to emerge so far appears to be that Russia has not yet formally received a Turkish proposal to host peace talks between Moscow and western countries. The Kremlin says it has not ruled out that Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan could discuss a Turkish proposal to host peace talks when they meet on Thursday, but the foreign ministry said it is yet to hear about this through diplomatic channels. Nato’s Jen Stoltenberg has given details of Nato’s annual nuclear deterrence training exercises, which are scheduled for next week, and unlikely to ease nuclear tensions between the alliance and Russia. Stoltenberg said “This is routine training which happens every year to keep our deterrence safe, secure and effective. President Putin’s veiled nuclear threats are dangerous and irresponsible. Russia knows that a nuclear war can never be won and can never be fought.” The FT reports that the weeklong ‘Steadfast Noon’ exercise will “involve 14 Nato alliance members, and nuclear-capable aircraft alongside additional capabilities such as intelligence and refuelling planes. The weeklong exercise is to ensure that relevant personnel and equipment are prepared.” Jeremy Fleming, the head of GCHQ, is about to start speaking. RUSI is the Royal United Services Institute. The title of the lecture is “If China is the Question, What is the Answer?”, but he is expected to also address the UK’s views on Russia’s current campaign in Russia. You should be able to watch it in the video window above the live blog. It is being chaired by Shashank Joshi, defence editor of the Economist. The speech was previewed earlier by our defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh. We have got a video feed of GCHQ head Jeremy Fleming’s speech this afternoon at the top of the live. It is due to start shortly. You may have to refresh the page to get the play button to appear. The Kyiv Independent, citing a Facebook post by the operators DTEK, is reporting that six people were injured in a second strike at the Ladyzhyn thermal power plant (LTPP) in the Vinnytsia region. The post reads: Unfortunately, the LTPP has suffered a second blow from Russian terrorist troops. This happened at the moment when rescuers were working on site. There are some victims. According to preliminary information, there are six people. The victims were promptly provided medical care, they were taken to the hospital. There are no employees of the company among the injured. As a result of the shelling, the company’s energy equipment was damaged again. When the security situation will allow, workers will start with repairs. Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, has said that repairs are already underway to the glass bridge in Kyiv popular with tourists which was struck by Russian missiles yesterday. He posted to Telegram, alongside some images, saying that replacement glass had been ordered and would take three weeks. He said: Soon our renovated bridge will once again delight the residents of Kyiv and guests of the capital. Because it is now not only one of the tourist symbols of Kyiv, but also a symbol of the indomitability and stability of Ukraine. The White House has confirmed that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, joined President Joe Biden and other G7 leaders for their virtual meeting today. The call began at 13:09 GMT, the White House said. We’ll bring you more information about the G7 meeting as soon as we hear it. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has called for a ceasefire in Ukraine just days ahead of a meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and President Vladimir Putin. “Unfortunately [both sides] have quickly moved away from diplomacy” since the talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in Istanbul in March, Çavuşoğlu said in a televised interview, cited by AFP. The situation “gets worse and more complicated” as the war drags on, he said: A ceasefire must be established as soon as possible. The sooner the better. He called for a “just peace” based on Ukraine’s territorial integrity, adding: A process that will ensure Ukraine’s border and territorial integrity should start. Without a ceasefire, it is not possible to talk about those issues in a healthy way: a viable ceasefire and a just peace. Erdoğan and Putin are expected to meet on Thursday in Kazakhstan’s capital Astana to discuss Ukraine and bilateral relations, the Kremlin confirmed earlier. A deputy head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been kidnapped by Russian forces, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom has said. Valeriy Martynyuk, a deputy director general for human resources at the nuclear plant, was seized on Monday and is being detained in an unknown location, Energoatom said in a post on Telegram. It said Russian kidnappers were “probably using methods of torture” on Martynyuk in an attempt to obtain information from the personnel files of the Zaporizhzhia staff “in order to force Ukrainian staff to work for Rosatom [the Russian state-owned nuclear power supplier] as soon as possible”. Energatom appealed to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, and the international community to “take all possible measures” for Martynyuk’s immediate release. In September, the director general of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was detained by Russia while on his way from the plant, Europe’s largest, to the town of Enerhodar. Ihor Murashov was later released, the IAEA confirmed. The bodies of 62 Ukrainian soldiers have been “returned home” following “difficult negotiations”, Ukraine’s ministry responsible for temporarily-occupied territories has said. The ministry said it had negotiated the return of the soldiers’ remains, including servicemen killed at the Olenivka prison, in a statement on social media. It said: Another transfer took place: 62 fallen heroes were returned home. Olenivka prison, in Russian-occupied Donetsk, was bombed in an attack in July that left at least 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war dead, according to both the Ukrainian and Russian authorities. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for the attack. A meeting between Group of Seven leaders and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was scheduled to begin a few moments ago at 1200 GMT. G7 leaders are expected to discuss their commitment to support Ukraine and hold President Vladimir Putin accountable for Russia’s aggression, including its recent missile strikes across Ukraine, the White House said yesterday. President Zelenskiy is scheduled to participate at the top of the meeting, where he will ask leaders to urgently supply Ukraine with air defence weapons. Speaking with reporters earlier today, the Kremlin said it had limited expectations of the G7 meeting. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: The mood of this summit is already obvious and predictable. The confrontation will continue. Belarus has said the joint deployment of forces with Russia on its borders is a defensive measure. In a statement, the Belarusian defence ministry said: The tasks of the Regional Grouping of Forces are purely defensive. All the activities currently being carried out are aimed at responding adequately to actions near our borders. The moves were to ensure “security” along the border between Belarus and Ukraine, the statement continued. It also said it would begin a military inspection today to ensure “combat readiness”: During the inspection, military units and sub-units will work out the issues of putting on combat readiness. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said on Monday he had ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what he said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and its western allies. The remarks by Lukashenko mark a potential further escalation of the war in Ukraine, possibly with a combined Russian-Belarus joint force in the north of Ukraine. Our Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth, writes that the first deaths are being reported among Russians who were mobilised late last month. The Kremlin has confirmed that President Vladimir Putin will meet his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Thursday to discuss Ukraine. The meeting will take place in Astana, Kazakhstan, the Kremlin spokesperson said. Dmitry Peskov had told reporters yesterday that it was “possible” the two leaders would discuss a Turkish proposal to host talks between Russia and the west on peace in Ukraine. The pair will meet on the sidelines of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia summit in the Kazakhstan capital. They last met in mid-September in Uzbekistan on the sidelines of a summit of the leaders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine. My colleague Peter Beaumont writes that he has seen a number of newly mobilised Russian fighters who have arrived on the frontline of the war with barely any training, including around the town of Svatove in Luhansk region. Moscow would not turn down a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, at the G20 meeting next month, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Moscow was open to talks with the west on the Ukraine war but had yet to receive any “serious offers” to negotiate, Lavrov said in an interview on Russian state television. He said US officials including the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, had said the US was willing to engage in discussions but Russia had refused. Lavrov said: This is a lie. We have not received any serious offers to make contact. He suggested Russia was willing to listen to any suggestions regarding peace talks: We have repeatedly said that we never refuse meetings. If there is a proposal, then we will consider it. Speaking about the possibility that Turkey could host talks between Russia and the west, Lavrov said Moscow would be willing to listen to any suggestions but could not say in advance whether this would lead to results. He said Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, would have the opportunity to put forward proposals to Putin when both visit Kazakhstan this week. Lavrov also claimed the US had long been involved in the war in Ukraine, which he said was “being controlled by the Anglo-Saxons”. Russia’s defence ministry has confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range air strikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure today. In a statement, it said: The purpose of the strike has been achieved. All designated facilities have been hit. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has accused Russia of committing war crimes by targeting energy facilities to create “unbearable conditions for civilians”. Kuleba wrote: These are war crimes planned well in advance and aimed at creating unbearable conditions for civilians - Russia’s deliberate strategy since months. A children’s doctor working at a cancer hospital in Kyiv was reportedly among those killed by yesterday’s wave of Russian strikes on cities across Ukraine. Oksana Leontieva was a doctor in the children’s bone marrow transplant department at the Okhmatdyt children’s cancer hospital, according to the hospital. She was on her way to work on Monday morning after dropping her son at kindergarten when a Russian missile hit the Ukrainian capital. In a statement on Facebook, the hospital described Leontieva as a “dedicated and responsible person and doctor” who was a “true professional and support for her patients and colleagues”. Anton Gerashchenko, a senior presidential adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said her five-year-old son is now an orphan, having lost his father six months ago. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Martin Belam to bring you all the latest developments on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The death toll from Monday’s Russian missile attacks on a swathe of Ukrainian cities has risen to 19 people, with over 100 wounded, according to figures from the Ukrainian state emergency services. Strikes continued on Tuesday. An attack on the Lviv region in western Ukraine on Tuesday left parts of the city without electricity. Governor Maksym Kozytskyi has said “At this moment, it is known about three explosions at two energy facilities in the Lviv region”. Mayor of the city, Andriy Sadovyi, appealed to resident to keep water supplies on hand ahead of expected service interruptions. The Ladyzhyn thermal power plant (LTPP) in the Vinnytsia region was struck on Tuesday morning. Regional head Serhiy Borzov said: “An attack was launched on the LTPP. Two Shahed-136 kamikaze drones.” There has been a lengthy air raid warning in place all morning in Kyiv, with governor Oleksiy Kuleba claiming that at least one rocket had been shot down. Valentyn Reznichenko, the governor of Dnipro, has claimed that air defence systems had shot down four missiles over the region. Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, has said that “there are still missiles in the air” and that Ukraine’s air defences continue to work. The head of GCHQ has said the UK spy agency has not seen any indicators that Russia is preparing to use a tactical nuclear weapon in or around Ukraine despite recent bellicose statements from Vladimir Putin. Jeremy Fleming, speaking on Tuesday morning, said it was one of GCHQ’s tasks to monitor whether the Kremlin was taking any of the preliminary steps needed before a tactical weapon was being made ready. Fleming is expected to say in a rare public speech delivered later on Tuesday that Putin is making strategic errors due to unconstrained power. “Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, it’s clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,” Fleming will say. “With little effective internal challenge, Putin’s decision-making has proved flawed” The deployment of a joint task-force of Russian and Belorussian troops within Belarus poses a threat to Ukraine’s supply lines in the north of the country, according to Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK. Prystaiko also said that Russia is “running out of sophisticated weapons” and using missiles like “dumb bombs”, and said that Ukraine was still making progress on the frontline but “not as spectacular as it used to be a couple weeks ago”. He said in the south “we are closing the circle” and that “there are almost 20,000 Russian soldiers there. If you manage to capture them it will be a huge blow for the whole campaign.” Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus, has called on Russian soldiers to leave the country. Belarus could face more sanctions if it gets more and more involved in the Ukraine conflict, France’s foreign affairs minister Catherine Colonna told French radio A spokesperson for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has said “We are gravely concerned that some of the attacks appear to have targeted critical civilian infrastructure … indicating that these strikes may have violated the principles on the conduct of hostilities under international humanitarian law.” Mass bombardments of Ukrainian cities by Russia constitute war crimes under international law, the presidents of the Bucharest Nine group of countries, accompanied by the presidents of North Macedonia and Montenegro, said on Tuesday. Thérèse Coffey, deputy prime minister of the UK, said Monday’s strikes showed “this is a time for other countries to continue the level of support that they’ve been showing, and where necessary to escalate their level of support directly to the Ukrainian armed forces.” The German chancellor has attempted to make reassurances that the country’s energy supply will be secure this winter. Olaf Scholz said: “I am happy to say to you today, if we all continue to adapt to the changed situation – the citizens, the companies and the politicians – then we will get safely through this winter.” Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, has called Russia a “terrorist state” at a General Assembly meeting on Monday night. Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, in turn accused Ukraine of rivalling “the most outrageous terrorist organisations” after a bridge linking Russia to the annexed Ukrainian territory of Crimea was attacked. Andriy Sadovyi, mayor of Lviv, has asked residents to store a small supply of water in anticipation that there may be outages later today following Russian strikes which appear to have hit critical power infrastructure in the region and has knocked out electricity in some parts of the city. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus, has called on Russian soldiers to leave the country. She stated that the oppositions position was: Belarus must officially withdraw from Russian war participation. Every Russian soldier must leave Belarus unconditionally. All involved in Russia’s attack from Belarus must be held accountable. Democratic Belarus and Ukraine should build an alliance against Russian aggression. Tsikhanouskaya has been in exile since Alexander Lukashenko claimed his own victory in the August 2020 election in Belarus. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv in western Ukraine, has posted an update to Telegram saying: At this moment, it is known about three explosions at two energy facilities in the Lviv region. Information about victims is yet to be received. The danger still continues. The Lviv region borders Poland, and is one of the furthest regions of Ukraine from the four areas in the east which Russia partially occupies and has claimed to “annex”. A spokesperson for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has said “We are gravely concerned that some of the attacks appear to have targeted critical civilian infrastructure … indicating that these strikes may have violated the principles on the conduct of hostilities under international humanitarian law.” Reuters reports Ravina Shamdasani told a news conference on Tuesday “We urge the Russian Federation to refrain from further escalation, and to take all feasible measures to prevent civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure.” Moscow has repeatedly denied that it targets civilians and civilian infrastructure during what it has termed its “special military operation” in Ukraine, despite the widespread evidence of damage to civilian areas and the discovery of mass graves in areas formerly occupied by invading Russian troops. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, has said on the Telegram messaging app that parts of the city are again without electricity following what he described as a “rocket attack on a critical infrastructure facility.” More details soon … Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, has just posted to Telegram to say “there are still missiles in the air” and that Ukraine’s air defences continue to work. There are reports of explosions in Lviv, which have impacted electricity supplies. The mayor of the city, Andriy Sadovyi, has posted to Telegram: “Explosions are heard in Lviv. There are problems with electricity.” The regional governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, has posted a similar message. At 12.08pm local time he wrote: “An attack on an energy facility in Lviv region. Stay in shelters. Do not spread photos, videos and rumours.” Valentyn Reznichenko, the governor of Dnipro, has posted to Telegram to claim that so far today air defence systems had shot down four missiles over the region. He told residents to stay in shelters as “the attack continues”. The region borders Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, three of the occupied areas of Ukraine that Russia has claimed to “annex”. Ukrinform is reporting that the Ladyzhyn thermal power plant (LTPP) in the Vinnytsia region was struck this morning. It quotes the regional head, Serhiy Borzov, as saying: “An attack was launched on the LTPP. Two Shahed-136 kamikaze drones.” The report says that emergency services are at the scene. The mobilisation of troops in Belarus poses a threat to Ukraine’s supply lines in the north of the country, according to Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK. He told viewers of Sky News in the UK: “The Belorussian case is difficult because they are on top of Ukraine, the north of Ukraine. The danger this is actually posing is to cut the supply lines. We are receiving everything from the west, they’re coming through these western borders.” However, he also said one factor that might be causing the Belarus leader Lukashenko to be cautious was that “some people believe he’s not mobilising people because he is not sure whether the Kalashnikov’s will be turned against him maybe”. Russia is “running out of sophisticated weapons” and using missiles like “dumb bombs”, according to Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK. Vadym Prystaiko also told viewers of Sky News that Ukraine was still making progress on the frontline but “not as spectacular as it used to be a couple weeks ago”. He said in the south “we are closing the circle” and that “there are almost 20,000 Russian soldiers there. If you manage to capture them it will be a huge blow for the whole campaign.” On diminishing weapons stockpiles, he said: “What Russians are using now is old rockets from the 1960s, the 1970s. What they’re doing, more or less, utilising some of the rockets that used to be quite sophisticated, now they are throwing them like dumb bombs. So they are running out of sophisticated equipment, that’s for sure. “But it has been research done for many years how the new wars will look like, and how fast the sides will run out of sophisticated equipment, and we’ll have to get back to all of this 1960s when they can actually fix the old tank with a hammer and just simple simple instruments.” Mass bombardments of Ukrainian cities by Russia constitute war crimes under international law, the presidents of the Bucharest Nine group of countries, accompanied by the presidents of North Macedonia and Montenegro, said on Tuesday. “We, the presidents of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia condemn the mass bombardments of Ukrainian cities recently carried out by Russia, which constitute war crimes under international law,” Reuters reports they said in a statement. Here are the quotes from head of GCHQ Jeremy Fleming’s interview with the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. PA Media quotes him saying: We believe that Russia is running short of munitions, it’s certainly running short of friends. We’ve seen, because of the declaration for mobilisation, that it’s running short of troops. So I think the answer to that is pretty clear. Russia and Russia’s commanders are worried about the state of their military machine. The word I’ve used is ‘desperate’. We can see that desperation at many levels inside Russian society and inside the Russian military machine. It certainly doesn’t imply complacency. Russia, as we’ve seen in the dreadful attacks yesterday, still has a very capable military machine. It can launch weapons, it has deep, deep stocks and expertise. And yet, it is very broadly stretched in Ukraine. Fleming was also asked about the prospect of Russia using nuclear weapons. “I would hope that we will see indicators if they started to go down that path,” he said. “But let’s be really clear about that, if they are considering that, that would be a catastrophe in the way that many people have talked about.” The German chancellor has this morning attempted to make reassurances that the country’s energy supply will be secure this winter. Speaking at an engineering conference, Reuters reports that Olaf Scholz said: “I am happy to say to you today, if we all continue to adapt to the changed situation – the citizens, the companies and the politicians – then we will get safely through this winter.” Scholz added that Germany was almost at the target of having its gas storage facilities 95% full. The head of the British spy agency GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming, is making a rare public appearance today, with a speech planned later on. He is also appearing on the BBC’s Today programme, where he has been interviewed about Russia and China. Our defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, has been listening. The Russian foreign ministry’s social channels are this morning pushing out links to a response that the foreign ministry spokesperson gave late yesterday to recent statements coming from the US. In it, Maria Zakharova says: We repeat for the US once again: the objectives we set in Ukraine will be achieved. Russia is open to diplomacy, the terms are known. The longer Washington encourages Kiev’s bellicosity, encouraging rather than preventing terrorist incursions by Ukrainian saboteurs, the more difficult the search for a diplomatic settlement will become. Official figures from Ukraine suggest that yesterday at least 19 people were killed and more than 100 civilians were wounded after Russia launched a barrage of more than 80 missiles and rockets at cities throughout Ukraine, well away from the frontline of the occupied territory which the Russian Federation claims to have “annexed”. Oleksiy Kuleba, the governor of Kyiv, has just reported in the last minutes on Telegram “another shot down rocket. We stay in the shelters.” Today’s First Edition newsletter has Archie Bland talking to Andrew Roth, the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, and to Peter Beaumont, who is in Kyiv. Here’s an extract: The vital question over the next few days, Peter said, is whether “this is a screw-you retaliatory strike or the start of something bigger and more serious”. But there are doubts over whether Russia has the stocks of missiles to maintain such an approach, as Dan Sabbagh notes in this analysis. The chief of GCHQ will say in a rare speech today that Russian forces are exhausted and their supplies of munitions are running out. “These attacks don’t make a lot of sense for the military picture on the ground,” Peter said. “Shooting up cities doesn’t advance your troops. What I think would worry Ukraine more is some change on the frontlines.” In that context, there may be more concern over the news yesterday that Russian forces will be allowed to return to Belarus, potentially stretching Ukrainian forces further on the northern border. Meanwhile, as G7 leaders meet today, with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in attendance, western leaders appear to have acknowledged the renewed urgency of the case for additional help: Germany said it would begin to deliver four long-awaited advanced air defence systems in the next few days, while Joe Biden also pledged the provision of advanced air defence systems in a call with Ukraine’s president yesterday. “Those systems aren’t infallible,” Peter said. “But you cannot have a conversation with anyone in this country, whether they’re a farmer in Kherson or a senior official, where they don’t come up.” Behind all of this is an unthinkable threat: nuclear attack. “Everybody here knows it’s a shoe that hasn’t dropped, and it overshadows life to some degree,” Peter said. “But one of the features of the last few days is that if something like what happened to the Kerch bridge doesn’t prompt that, when it was so humiliating for Putin, we may have a long way to go to get there.” You can read it in full here: Tuesday briefing – After Russia retaliates, what might happen next? The Ukrainian MP Volodymyr Ariev has told Sky News in the UK that he believed Vladimir Putin launched the wave of attacks so he could look like a strong leader at the G20 summit in Bali, rather than a weak one who had been losing ground in Ukraine. He said: We understand that it was planned in advance. Putin would like to present it like a response to the explosion on the Crimea bridge, but it hasn’t been proven who was behind that attack. But for Putin it makes no sense to find a truthful reason for escalation in Ukraine. The reason for it, for me, is pretty understandable. In one month, Putin is going to the meeting of G20 countries in Indonesia. So he would like to present himself not a weak leader, after defeats of the Russian army on conventional battlegrounds. He would like to speak to the world from a position of strength. So that’s why he changed the commander of operations against Ukraine, and his first day was an airstrike to scare Ukraine. Of course, Ukrainians were not scared. The missile attacks on Ukrainian cities yesterday were mostly well away from the front line, where Ukrainian forces had been making progress in both the Donbas to the north and towards Kherson in the south in recent weeks. Kirill Stremousov, one of the Russian-imposed leaders in occupied Kherson, has messaged on Telegram this morning to claim that pro-Russian forces have been repulsed in Kherson, as well as an attack on the key Antonovsky bridge. He also wrote: The denazification of the Ukronazis and the fascist leadership of Ukraine continues. The time has come for residents of the remaining Ukraine to see clearly and stop self-destruction for the sake of the collective West. Separately, an appeal to the Ukronazis – stop hiding behind playgrounds, you will all be condemned as war criminals. Stremousov provided no evidence to back up his claims. The Russian Federation has claimed to “annex” Kherson region after a widely-derided “referendum”, despite not being in full control of the territory. The head of the British spy agency GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming, is expected to make a rare public address later today at the Rusi thinktank, and parts of what he will say have been briefed out in advance. Dan Sabbagh reports: The GCHQ director will highlight the costs to Russia from the months of fighting, arguing that Moscow’s forces have become exhausted and its recent mobilisation of conscripts shows signs of desperation. “We know – and Russian commanders on the ground know – that their supplies and munitions are running out,” he will say. “Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, it’s clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,” Fleming will say. Focusing on the Russian president directly, Fleming is expected to say that “with little effective internal challenge, his decision-making has proved flawed” and that he has engaged in “a high-stakes strategy that is leading to strategic errors in judgment”. Fleming is also expected to speak about the future threat posed by China, according to a pre-released extract of the remarks. Read more of Dan Sabbagh’s report here: GCHQ head – Putin making strategic errors due to unconstrained power The Interfax news agency in Russia reports that there are now four ferries plying the route across the Kerch Strait between Russia and Crimea. The service runs every two hours, reports Interfax, and a return journey takes four hours. It is to replace the road and rail link of the Kerch bridge, which was hit by an explosion at the weekend causing a section to partially collapse. The Russian Federation annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine’s state emergency services have updated their count of the dead and wounded from yesterday’s attacks. In a message posted to Telegram earlier this morning, the agency said that “according to preliminary data, 19 people died, there were another 105 injured”. The service also said that over 1,000 people and 120 units were involved in extinguishing fires and emergency rescue operations yesterday. They suggest that around 300 settlements in four oblasts remains without power. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has stated on Telegram that electricity supplies have been restored to everywhere in the region, and that electricity and water supplies have been fully restored in the city of Lviv. The areas suffered outages yesterday after Russian strikes, leading to power failures that included at one point border crossings between Ukraine and Poland. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, has posted a status update for his region to the Telegram messaging app. He gave the casualty count in the last 24 hours for Mykolaiv as one woman killed. He said that yesterday air defence systems destroyed 14 cruise missiles over Mykolaiv. He also claims that between 3.30am and 5,30am local time this morning Ukrainian forces destroyed five “Shahed-136” kamikaze drones. The claims have not been independently verified. Thérèse Coffey, who is deputy prime minister of the UK, has been interviewed on Sky News this morning. She was asked what the UK could do to offer further support to Ukraine following yesterday’s wave of Russian missile strikes on cities. She called for other countries to offer support, saying: We have been continuing the support that we’ve been giving. The prime minister [Liz Truss] was foreign secretary beforehand, working in step with our defence secretary Ben Wallace and at the time prime minister Boris Johnson, and we continue to do that. So we need to make sure that the west is also resolved to making sure that Putin must fail. And the people of Ukraine succeed. Pressed on something specific the UK could offer, she continued: Well, of course, some of these operational matters, of the direct support [that] will be given will be discussed confidentially, both within government, but also with the Ukrainian president. And I know that we have always stepped up to deliver what we can. But this is a time for other countries to continue the level of support that they’ve been showing, and where necessary to escalate their level of support directly to the Ukrainian armed forces, as we have done Belarus could face more sanctions if it gets more and more involved in the Ukraine conflict, French foreign affairs minister Catherine Colonna told French radio, Reuters reports. Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko said yesterday that he had ordered troops to deploy jointly with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what he said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and its backers.

My colleague Martin Belam will take you through the latest for the next while. Israeli-Russian billionaire Yuri Milner said on Monday he has renounced his Russian citizenship after leaving the country in 2014. Milner is the founder of internet investment firm DST Global, and made a fortune by betting on Chinese tech companies like e-commerce platforms Alibaba and JD.com. “My family and I left Russia for good in 2014, after the Russian annexation of Crimea,” Milner said in a tweet. “And this summer, we officially completed the process of renouncing our Russian citizenship.” Milner has been an Israeli citizen since 1999 and has not visited Russia since 2014, according to a fact sheet on DST Global’s website. Milner also has no assets in Russia, 97% of his personal wealth was created outside of the country and “Yuri has never met Vladimir Putin, either individually or in a group,” according to the website. Ukraine’s state emergency service has reported that the death toll from Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian cities on 10 October has risen to 19, with the number of injured rising to over 105. Hong Kong’s leader John Lee said Tuesday he will implement only United Nations sanctions – not US, UK or EU sanctions – after the US warned the territory’s status as a financial centre could be affected if it acts as a safe haven for sanctioned individuals, AP reports. Lee’s statement Tuesday came days after a luxury yacht connected to Russian tycoon Alexey Mordashov docked in the city. Mordashov, who is believed to have close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was sanctioned by the US, UK and the European Union in February after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Hong Kong authorities have said that they do not implement unilateral sanctions imposed by other governments. “We cannot do anything that has no legal basis,” Lee told reporters. “We will comply with United Nations sanctions, that is our system, that is our rule of law,” he said. A US State Department spokesperson said in a statement Monday that “the possible use of Hong Kong as a safe haven by individuals evading sanctions from multiple jurisdictions further calls into question the transparency of the business environment.” The State Department spokesperson also said the city’s reputation as a financial centre “depends on its adherence to international laws and standards.” The UK Ministry of Defence has published its daily update from Ukraine, reporting that “the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) announced that General Sergei Surovikin had been appointed as overall commander of its Joint Group of Forces conducting the ‘special military operation’ in Ukraine” on 8 October. “For much of its operation, Russia has likely lacked a single empowered field commander,” the MoD tweeted. “Surovikin’ s appointment likely reflects an effort by the Russian national security community to improve the delivery of the operation. However, he will likely have to contest with an increasingly factional Russian MOD which is poorly resourced to achieve the political objectives it has been set in Ukraine.” Ukraine’s Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Emine Dzheppar, reports that Russia fired at least fifteen rockets on Zaporizhzhia last night, targeting “an educational institution, a medical institution and residential buildings.” Citing the Oblast Military Administration, media outlet Ukrainska Pravda reports that that Ladyzhynska power plant in the southwestern city of Vinnytsia was shelled a short while ago by two Shahed-136 kamikaze drones. Reuters reports via RIA that Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov has warned the US and Nato against “the West’s growing involvement in the Ukrainian conflict”, saying that Moscow would respond and hope[s] that they realise the danger of uncontrolled escalation in Washington and other Western capitals”. Ukranian state news agency Ukrinform reports that 98 miners are still trapped underground following Russia’s shelling of Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian president Vlodymyr Zelensky’s home town. Power outages caused by the strikes have left 98 miners stick underground., the news agency reports, with rescuers working to release them. Almost 900 miners had been trapped in four mines following the strikes, but most have since been freed. Despite – or because of – yesterday’s missile strikes on several Ukranian cities, people in Lviv, which was among the cities targeted by Russia, went dancing last night. Wall Street Journal correspondent Matthew Luxmoore posted the below video on Twitter late on Monday night, adding that “Ukranian songs were interspersed tonight with chants of ‘Death to Enemies!’ and ‘Putin is a dick’!’” Air rid sirens are sounding this morning in Kyiv, the BBC’s Paul Adams and others report, as Ukrainians wake up after yesterday’s strikes in cities across the country, which have killed 14 people and left almost 100 injured. Further strikes were reported in Zaporizhizhia overnight. Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, has called Russia a “terrorist state” at a General Assembly meeting on Monday night. “Deliberate targeting of civilians is a war crime. By launching missile attacks on civilians, sleeping in their homes or rushing to work, children going to schools, Russia has proven once again that it is a terrorist state that must be deterred in the strongest possible ways,” he said. Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, in turn accused Ukraine of rivalling ‘the most outrageous terrorist organisations’ after a bridge linking Russia to the annexed Ukrainian territory of Crimea was attacked Vladimir Putin has made strategic errors in his pursuit of the war in Ukraine partly because there are so few restraints on his leadership, the head of the British spy agency GCHQ will say in a speech on Tuesday. Russia’s soldiers are running out of supplies and munitions and initial gains made by Moscow are being reversed, Jeremy Fleming is expected to add in a rare public address. “Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, it’s clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,” Fleming will say. Focusing on the Russian president directly, Fleming is expected to say that “with little effective internal challenge, his decision-making has proved flawed” and that he has engaged in “a high-stakes strategy that is leading to strategic errors in judgment”. There are a few events and meetings planned for today, so here is a summary of what we can expect, among the unexpected: G7 leaders will hold crisis talks with Zelenskiy in attendance. The leaders are likely to discuss the global energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion, amid plans to introduce a global cap on the price of Russian oil to target Putin’s revenues. UK Prime Minister Liz Truss is expected to call for a full meeting of Nato leaders to happen in the coming days United Arab Emirates president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan will visit Moscow on Tuesday to meet Putin. Jeremy Fleming, the head of the British spy agency GCHQ will say in a speech on Tuesday that Vladimir Putin has made strategic errors in his pursuit of the war in Ukraine partly because there are so few restraints on his leadership. The UK Prime Minister, Liz Truss, is expected to call for a full meeting of Nato leaders in coming days as the G7 holds crisis talks on Tuesday following Russian strikes on Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities. Russian forces rained more than 80 missiles on cities across Ukraine on Monday, according to Kyiv, in apparent retaliation for an explosion that damaged a key bridge linking the Crimean peninsula to Russia. The G7 video call will also be attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. G7 leaders are also likely to discuss the global energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion, amid plans to introduce a global cap on the price of Russian oil to target Putin’s revenues, PA reports. Ukraine stepped up calls for western allies to provide anti-air and anti-missile systems in response to Monday’s strikes, which have so far killed 14 and injured 97. Kyiv was targeted for the first time in months, while Russia also hit civilian areas and energy infrastructure across the country, from Kharkiv in the east to Lviv near the Polish border. The death toll from Russia’s strikes on Kyiv and other cities on 10 October has risen to 14, while 97 have been injured, Ukraine’s State Emergency Services said in an update on Monday night. More than 1,300 settlements across the country were without power, the emergency service said. Many of the locations hit by cruise missiles and kamikaze drones during the morning rush hour appeared to be solely civilian sites or key pieces of infrastructure, apparently chosen to terrorise Ukrainians. Oleksandr Starukh, Governor of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, announced the attacks overnight in a post on Telegram: “The occupier attacked the regional center with rockets. Infrastructure objects became the targets of the enemy. Information about the destruction and victims is being ascertained.” Zaporizhzhia was also hit in the 10 October strikes. The Kyiv Independent reports that there have been strikes on Zaporizhzhia overnight, saying in a tweet shortly before 7am local time that, “Russian forces targeted an infrastructure site in the city of Zaporizhzhia, according to Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Oleksandr Starukh. Information on casualties and damages has not yet been reported.” The Guardian has not confirmed this independently. We will bring you more shortly. Hello and welcome to our ongoing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be taking you through the latest as it happens. If there is news you think we may have missed, let me know on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. The Kyiv Independent reports that there have been strikes on Zaporizhzhia overnight, saying in a tweet shortly before 7am local time, “Russian forces targeted an infrastructure site in the city of Zaporizhzhia, according to Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Oleksandr Starukh. Information on casualties and damages has not yet been reported.” The Guardian has not confirmed this independently. Meanwhile the death toll from Russia’s attacks on Ukraine on 10 October has risen to 14, with the number of injured rising to 97, Ukraine’s State Emergency Services said in an update on Monday night. Liz Truss is expected to call for a full meeting of Nato leaders in the coming days, as G7 leaders hold crisis talks on Tuesday, with Ukraine’s president, Vlodymyr Zelenskiy, attending, following Russian strikes on Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities. In the meantime, here are the other key recent developments: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his country was “dealing with terrorists” and accused Russia of targeting power facilities and civilians following the missile attacks. “They deliberately chose such a time, such goals, in order to cause as much harm as possible,” the Ukrainian leader said. US president Joe Biden said the US “strongly condemns” the Russian missile strikes on cities across Ukraine, which demonstrate Putin’s “utter brutality” against the Ukrainian people. In a separate statement, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the international community “has a responsibility” to make clear that Putin’s actions are “completely unacceptable”. The United Nations general assembly voted to reject Russia’s call for the 193-member body to hold a secret ballot later this week on whether to condemn Moscow’s move to annex four partially occupied regions in Ukraine. Diplomats said the vote on the resolution would likely be on Wednesday or Thursday. Australian troops could help train Ukraine’s armed forces following Russia’s “appalling” attack on Kyiv, the country’s Defence Minister, Richard Marles, said on Tuesday. Members of the Group of Seven, and Zelenskiy, will hold emergency talks on Tuesday, a German government spokesperson has confirmed. Zelenskiy confirmed he would address G7 leaders, adding that he had spoken to Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, about increasing pressure on Russia as well as aid for Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has made strategic errors in his pursuit of the war in Ukraine partly because there are so few restraints on his leadership, the head of the British spy agency GCHQ will say in a speech on Tuesday. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has been included on a list of wanted persons put together by Ukraine security officials. A statement released by Ukraine’s security service, the SBU, said Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia’s Security, was wanted under a section of the criminal code dealing with attempts to undermine Ukraine’s territorial integrity and the inviolability of its borders. Most of the Russian Security Council’s members are on the list. The International Committee of the Red Cross has confirmed its teams have paused their field work in Ukraine for security reasons. The Norwegian Refugee Council have also said that it has paused its aid operations in Ukraine until it is safe to resume. “Our aid workers are hiding from a barrage of bombs and in fear of repeated attacks,” it said. The president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, will visit Moscow on Tuesday to meet Putin, UAE state media reported. Mohamed “will discuss with President Putin the friendly relations between the UAE and Russia along with a number of regional and international issues and developments of common interest”, the UAE’s state-owned news agency WAM said. The European Union has announced it will extend a bloc-wide protection scheme for Ukrainian refugees into 2024. Ukrainians in the EU who choose to return to their country will still be able to maintain their refugee status, as long as they notify the relevant EU country of their move, according to the EU’s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/mar/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-bakhmut-offensive-slowing-says-us-thinktank-eu-leaders-gather-for-summit","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-23T19:01:03Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zelenskiy renews calls to EU for long-range weapons; Moscow says relations with west ‘worse than ever’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-bakhmut-offensive-slowing-says-us-thinktank-eu-leaders-gather-for-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/mar/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-bakhmut-offensive-slowing-says-us-thinktank-eu-leaders-gather-for-summit","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zelenskiy renews calls to EU for long-range weapons; Moscow says relations with west ‘worse than ever’ – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We’re closing this blog down now. Thanks for reading. Here’s a summary of the day’s main events: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has renewed his call for more long-range weapons from western allies, as he addressed EU leaders meeting in Brussels. Speaking to the EU summit via video link, the Ukrainian president’s account of the “devastating” scenes he had witnessed where the fighting has been fiercest was said to be emotional and to have had a big impact on the 27 EU leaders and top officials in Brussels listening to him. Russian leaders should be put on trial for the invasion of Ukraine even if they cannot be arrested and brought to court in person, Kyiv’s top prosecutor said. Gen Andriy Kostin said a planned tribunal for the crime of aggression should hold so-called trials in absentia. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia’s Putin-chaired security council, said Moscow’s relations with the west have hit an all-time low. Asked whether the threat of a nuclear conflict has eased, he said: “No, it hasn’t decreased, it has grown. Every day when they provide Ukraine with foreign weapons brings the nuclear apocalypse closer.” Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, signed legislation to make his country part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato). Last year, Finland sought to join the military alliance in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine, and legislation incorporating Nato’s founding treaties was passed in parliament in Helsinki on 1 March. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant “remains perilous” after a Russian missile strike this month disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Ukraine’s state emergency service said on Thursday that it had ended rescue attempts in Rzhyshchiv, Kyiv region, where it is now known that nine people died in a suspected Russian drone attack in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that on Wednesday shelling in the Donetsk region killed two people and injured four others, while one person was killed and two were wounded in the Kherson region. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, said: “The aggressor does not give up hope of taking Bakhmut at any cost, despite the losses in manpower and equipment.” He added that Russia was losing “considerable strength” and that “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliia and Kupiansk”, all areas that Ukraine has previously liberated from Russian occupation. The UK Ministry of Defence said that “Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres” in the Luhansk region, and that “Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River. They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node.” Any attempt to arrest Vladimir Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for the Kremlin chief would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, his ally Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday, while directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. A video is circulating on social media of the Ukrainian national flag flying from a tall mast in Crimea, a region annexed by Russia in 2014. It appears to have been filmed near the village of Hrushivka. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said on Thursday he would discuss a peace plan for Ukraine with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during an official visit to China next week. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, on Thursday spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia under a deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and called for the G7 to tighten its oil cap to squeeze Russia’s revenue more. A former New Zealand soldier who drew an online following with his dispatches from the frontline of the Ukraine war has been killed. The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand’s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. Ukraine’s military has now withdrawn its claim Russian troops had left Nova Kahkovka. The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces, in a rare retraction, said Russian troops remained in the town on the east bank of the Dnipro River. It said the initial report had been issued “as a result of incorrect use of available data” but gave no details. Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed governor of Kherson region, had denied the report. The EU has denounced Russian police raids against the Nobel prize-winning human rights group Memorial, describing them as being part of an intimidation and harassment campaign. Reuters, citing Memorial, reports that Russian security forces raided the homes of former employees of the group on Tuesday and took some of them in for questioning. Founded to document political repression in the Soviet Union, Memorial was officially banned in late 2021 after the authorities claimed it supported terrorism and extremism, charges the group called absurd. The spokesperson for the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, Peter Stano, said: The recent actions by the Russian authorities constitute yet another step in the ongoing intimidation and persecution of independent and critical voices in the Russian society. Memorial’s work in Russia has been invaluable in defence of human rights and against “attempts to manipulate the historical memory of political repression in Russia in the 20th century”, he added. The EU calls upon the Russian authorities to stop the unfounded prosecution and police harassment of Memorial and its staff – and to respect the rule of law. Tuesday’s raids were carried out after Russian investigators accused the now dissolved group of allegedly including the names of second world war-era Nazi collaborators on their historical list of victims of political terror. The raids were condemned by rights groups internationally as well as what remains of Russia’s domestic opposition, Reuters reports. We reported earlier that the Ukrainian military was claiming Russian forces had left the town of Nova Kakhovka in the southern Kherson region. Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed governor of Kherson region, has denied that. Reuters quotes him as saying on Telegram: All Russian military personnel in Nova Kakhovka, as well as in other locations on the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro remain in their place. Russian forces redeployed to the east bank of the Dnipro River last November after abandoning positions on the west bank in the face of a counteroffensive by Ukrainian troops. Russian athletes will remain barred from track and field “for the foreseeable future” because of the country’s invasion of Ukraine, the World Athletics president, Sebastian Coe, has said. The International Olympic Committee is exploring a pathway for Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutrals at next year’s Olympic Games in Paris. But it appears likely they will not be able to feature in athletics in Paris, arguably the highest-profile Olympic sport. Lord Coe told a press conference: The World Athletics Council approved to continue to exclude Russian and Belarus athletes from all World Series events for the foreseeable future due to the invasion and ongoing war in Ukraine. Russian forces have left the town of Nova Kakhovka in the southern Kherson region, the Ukrainian military’s general staff has said. Reuters quotes its evening report outlining conditions on the front lines as saying: As of 22 March 2023, all units of the occupying army that had been deployed in the town of Nova Kakhovka in Kherson region, have left the city. The town is located on the east bank of the Dnipro River, where Russian forces redeployed last November after abandoning positions on the west bank in the face of a counter-offensive by Ukrainian troops. The report said Russian troops had stolen appliances, valuables, clothing and mobile telephones from nearby houses as they departed. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, has signed legislation to make his country part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) during a ceremony on Thursday. Last year, Finland sought to join the military alliance in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine, and legislation incorporating Nato’s founding treaties was passed in parliament in Helsinki on 1 March. Hungary and Turkey, the only Nato members that have yet to ratify Finland’s membership, have both signalled they will soon do so. European Union leaders have held talks with the UN chief, António Guterres, on sanctions imposed on Russia and are also expected to endorse a plan to supply more artillery shells to Kyiv. Reuters reports that Guterres’ participation in the EU summit, where global food security was also discussed, comes days after the renewal of a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey on the safe export of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea that is seen as crucial to overcoming a global food crisis. The 27 EU leaders were also due to get an update on the war from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, via video link. Arriving for the two-day summit, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said: We need to ensure that grain exports, for example from Ukraine, can continue. The Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, spoke against any easing of sanctions on Moscow under the grain deal and called for a tighter price cap on Russian oil exports. The US has pushed back against Russian demands that western sanctions be eased before Moscow allows Ukrainian Black Sea grain exports to continue beyond mid-May, saying there are no restrictions on Russian farm products or fertilisers. Inside the EU, the issue of fertiliser exports is blocking more sanctions against Russia’s ally Belarus. The bloc says new sanctions are needed to stop Belarus from serving as a route to bypass the existing Russia trade restrictions. But Lithuania opposes what it calls “fertiliser oligarch” exemptions proposed to ensure Belarusian fertilisers continue flowing to third countries, arguing that that would weaken the sanctions regime overall, diplomats said. Proponents say such carve-outs, similar to those the EU has in place under its sanctions against Russia, are necessary to ensure food security and refute Moscow’s charge that EU measures – rather than Russia’s invasion – are driving the global crisis. Diplomats involved in preparing the summit were sceptical of any imminent breakthrough. Earlier, William met Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, at the presidential palace, where they discussed the war in Ukraine. The former’s spokesperson said: The conversation was warm and friendly, and predominantly focused on the ongoing conflict with the war in Ukraine, particularly its impact on Polish society. The Prince of Wales took the opportunity to thank the president and the Polish people who have done so much to support the people of Ukraine who’ve fled here. They discussed the importance of the need for ongoing support to Ukraine and its people. The prince said he was very much looking forward to seeing the president and first lady at the coronation. He also thanked him for attending the late queen’s funeral. William also echoed his grandmother the queen by laying a wreath at a monument dedicated to soldiers. Queen Elizabeth II and the late Duke of Edinburgh did the same during their state visit to Poland in 1996. William was greeted by a guard of honour and carried the assortment of flowers to the monument, spending around 10 minutes there before leaving. On the wreath was a note reading: “In memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice.” The Prince of Wales has praised the resilience of young Ukrainian refugees living in Poland. William, on the second day of his surprise trip to the country, visited the Hala Koszyki food hall in Warsaw to speak to those who have fled Ukraine. He joined them at tables on Thursday afternoon and heard about their experiences settling into Polish life. William told them: It must be very difficult to start an entire new life in a new country. It’s amazing how resilient you are. That shines out. He also spoke to people who have hosted refugees, and thanked them for their kindness. William was greeted by well-wishers outside the venue and given flowers. Three women held a sign thanking him for the visit. One of them, Olga Mieszejewska-Buchalik, who travelled three hours from south Poland, told reporters: I said that we really appreciated his support for our nation and Ukraine. Vonya Bultruski, 26, who spoke to the prince, told the PA news agency: I told him how much his support for refugees means, he’s a very kind man. I’m very happy to see him in Poland, it is a big moment for my country. Marta Galinska, 47, a milliner, gave William a pink felt hat she made for the Princess of Wales. Jennifer Rankin reports for the Guardian from Brussels: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has renewed his call for more long-range weapons from western allies, as he addressed EU leaders meeting in Brussels. The Ukrainian president was speaking to the EU summit via video link, from a moving train in an undisclosed location in Ukraine, where he recounted news from the frontline. On Wednesday, Zelenskiy visited frontline military positions near the besieged city of Bakhmut, where he met Ukrainian serviceman and held a moment of silence for those killed in the war. Earlier today he was in Kherson region. His account of the “devastating” scenes he had witnessed was said to be emotional and to have had a big impact on the 27 EU leaders and top officials in Brussels listening to him. On one occasion the secure line cut out, but was soon reconnected. According to an EU source, he warned European leaders of five factors that could prolong the war, including delays in the delivery of long-range missiles, lack of modern aircraft and weaknesses in western sanctions. EU leaders are now discussing the Russian invasion, where they are expected to endorse a decision to supply a million rounds of ammunition to Ukraine within the next 12 months to replenish its dwindling stocks. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, has this report from Kherson on its official Telegram channel, citing the state emergency department: Four fires broke out in the Kherson region during the day as a result of shelling by the Russian army. A warehouse was on fire in Kherson, a car and the remains of a cable caught fire in Beryslav. And in Antonivka, a private house and a non-residential building were on fire. The office of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, have issued a couple of photographs of his visit to Kherson region today. It is Zelenskiy’s second trip outside Kyiv this week, having visited the frontline city of Bakhmut yesterday. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, visited the occupied city of Mariupol on Saturday evening in his first trip to one of the areas that Russia has claimed to annex from Ukraine. Medvedev may have dismissed western claims that Russia is running out of weapons with which to continue its war on Ukraine, but Reuters is reporting that the conflict has left Moscow unable to deliver vital defence supplies it had committed to India’s military. New Delhi has been worried about just such a situation, with Moscow its largest source of defence equipment. An Indian air force statement on Thursday is the first official confirmation it has come about. The statement was made to a parliamentary committee, which published it on its website on Tuesday. An air force representative told the committee that Russia had planned a “major delivery” this year that would not take place. A spokesperson for the Russian embassy in New Delhi told Reuters: “We don’t have information which may confirm the stated.” There has been no immediate response from Rosoboronexport, which is the Russian government’s weapons export arm. The report does not mention specifics of the delivery, Reuters says. Medvedev also dismissed any suggestion of talks with western European powers as “useless” and spoke contemptuously about western politicians, claiming a “catastrophic drop in competence and elementary literacy of EU leaders”. I have no illusions that we could communicate with them again any time soon. It makes no sense to negotiate with certain countries and blocs – they only understand the language of force. Medvedev, who heads a panel coordinating weapons production, derided western claims that Moscow is running out of weapons and said Russian weapons industries had increased output. He said Russia would produce 1,500 battle tanks this year and boost production of other weapons to meet its army’s needs. His claims could not be independently verified. The most important thing now is to make it all in necessary volumes, and we are launching new factories to do that. He said that the Russian military already had good intelligence drones and loitering munitions, but acknowledged that it had yet to deploy long-range strike drones. Here’s some more detail on those comments made by Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia’s Putin-chaired Security Council, who we quoted earlier as saying that any attempt to arrest the Russian president would amount to a declaration of war. According to the Associated Press (AP), he has told reporters in Russia that Moscow’s relations with the west have hit an all-time low. Asked whether the threat of a nuclear conflict has eased, he said: No, it hasn’t decreased, it has grown. Every day when they provide Ukraine with foreign weapons brings the nuclear apocalypse closer. Medvedev also denounced the ICC’s decision to issue an arrest warrant for Putin as legally null and void, claiming the move added to a “colossal negative potential” in the already bitterly strained ties. Our relations with the west are already worse than they have ever been in history. Medvedev challenged Ukraine’s sovereignty in comments that could reflect Moscow’s plans to extend its gains. Honestly speaking, Ukraine is part of Russia. But, due to geopolitical reasons and the course of history, we had tolerated that we were living in separate quarters and had been forced to acknowledge those invented borders for a long time. The AP reports that, since Putin sent troops into Ukraine, Medvedev has emerged as one of the most hawkish Russian officials, with observers interpreting his position as an apparent attempt to curry favour with Putin. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has visited the southern region of Kherson, where he toured local infrastructure the he promised to restore after Russia’s invasion. The visit, to a region where Ukraine staged a successful counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces late last year, was his second outside Kyiv this week, Reuters reports. On Wednesday, he visited troops near the eastern frontline city of Bakhmut. On Thursday, under footage of his visit to Kherson region that was posted on Telegram, Zelenskiy wrote: I spoke with local residents about their current issues and needs. We will restore everything, we will rebuild everything. Just like with every city and village that suffered because of the occupiers. The Ukrainian counteroffensive last year pushed Russian troops out of the regional capital after months of occupation. Workers in the region are now busy restoring power and the water supply. In a separate post showing him inspecting energy infrastructure, the Ukrainian president wrote: We have to ensure full restoration and protection of our energy sector. I am grateful to everyone who works for this and returns the light to our people. Russian leaders should be put on trial for the invasion of Ukraine even if they cannot be arrested and brought to court in person, Kyiv’s top prosecutor has said. Gen Andriy Kostin said a planned tribunal for the crime of aggression should hold so-called trials in absentia. He was speaking to Reuters after meeting the international criminal court (ICC)‘s chief prosecutor in The Hague, where the court is based. Last week, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accusing him and his children’s commissioner of the war crime of deporting children from Ukraine to Russia. While the ICC can prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in Ukraine, it cannot prosecute the crime of aggression due to legal constraints. International support is growing for the creation of a special tribunal that would prosecute Russian leaders for the 13-month-old invasion itself, considered by Ukraine and western leaders to be a crime of aggression. Kostin said the special tribunal should go after “the highest political and military leadership, including Putin, for the crime of aggression”. I believe that it could be (held) in absentia, because it’s important to deliver a matter of justice for international crimes even if perpetrators are not in the dock. International courts very rarely hold trials in absentia and the ICC’s rules state specifically that an accused suspect shall be present during trial. The only recent example of an international trial in absentia was in the case of Lebanon, for which a UN-backed tribunal convicted three men for the 2005 assassination of Lebanese politician Rafik Hariri. Russia has publicly said it has brought thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia in what it presents as a humanitarian campaign to protect orphans and abandoned children in the conflict zone. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant “remains perilous” after a Russian missile strike this month disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Ukraine’s state emergency service said on Thursday that it had ended rescue attempts in Rzhyshchiv, Kyiv region, where it is now known that nine people died in a suspected Russian drone attack in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that on Wednesday shelling in the Donetsk region killed two people and injured four others, while one person was killed and two were wounded in the Kherson region. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, said: “The aggressor does not give up hope of taking Bakhmut at any cost, despite the losses in manpower and equipment.” He added that Russia was losing “considerable strength” and that “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliia and Kupiansk”, all areas that Ukraine has previously liberated from Russian occupation. The UK Ministry of Defence said that “Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres” in the Luhansk region, and that “Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River. They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node.” Any attempt to arrest President Vladimir Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for the Kremlin chief would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, his ally Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday, while directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. A video is circulating on social media of the Ukrainian national flag flying from a tall mast in Crimea, a region annexed by Russia in 2014. It appears to have been filmed near the village of Hrushivka. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said on Thursday he would discuss a peace plan for Ukraine with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during an official visit to China next week. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, on Thursday spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia under a deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and called for the G7 to tighten its oil cap to squeeze Russia’s revenue more. A former New Zealand soldier who drew an online following with his dispatches from the frontline of the Ukraine war has been killed. The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand’s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said on Thursday he would discuss a peace plan for Ukraine with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during an official visit to China next week. “We will also talk about Ukraine where the most important thing is to be able to guarantee a stable and lasting peace,” Reuters reports Sanchez told the media in Brussels. Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, on Thursday spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia under a deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and called for the G7 to tighten its oil cap to further squeeze Russia’s revenue. “We know that Russia is earning less from the oil. We see the economic sanctions, including the oil price cap, are having am effect on the Russian economy and their ability to fuel the war machine,” Reuters reports her saying on arriving to talks among the EU’s 27 national leaders in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. “We should continue with that,” she said, adding that Estonia would agree to raise the cap again should oil prices rise. She spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia as sought by Moscow in the grain deal talks. “We shouldn’t weaken the sanctions,” she said. A video is circulating on social media, reported by Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, of the Ukrainian national flag flying from a tall mast in Crimea, a region annexed by Russia in 2014 in a move which is not widely recognised internationally. It appears to have been filmed near the village of Hrushivka. The Guardian has not independently verified the location, or the date the video was made. The air alarm which has been in force across Ukraine for much of the last two hours has ended. Any attempt to arrest President Vladimir Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for the Kremlin chief would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, his ally Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday, while directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. The ICC issued an arrest warrant on Friday, accusing Putin of the war crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. It said there were reasonable grounds to believe that Putin bore individual criminal responsibility. Reuters reports that the hawkish former president Medvedev told Russian media that the ICC, which countries including Russia, China and the US do not recognise, was a “legal nonentity” that had never done anything significant. Any attempt to detain Putin, though, would be a declaration of war, said Medvedev, who serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s security council. “Let’s imagine – obviously this [is a] situation which will never be realised – but nevertheless let us imagine that it was realised: the current head of the nuclear state went to a territory, say Germany, and was arrested,” Medvedev said. “What would that be? It would be a declaration of war on the Russian Federation,” he said in a video posted on Telegram. “And in that case, all our assets – all our missiles – would fly to the Bundestag, to the Chancellor’s office.” Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, offers this news roundup this morning on its official Telegram channel: As a result of an attack by Russian drones [yesterday] on a hostel in Rzhyshchiv, Kyiv region, nine people were killed, the state emergency service reported. Rescue operations are completed. In the middle of the night, the Russian military shelled Kramatorsk in Donetsk region: residential buildings, a boiler house and garages were damaged. On 22 March, shelling in the region killed two people and injured four others. At night, the Russian army shelled the Kherson regional cardio centre; there were no casualties. Fifty-four times during the day, the Russian Federation fired heavy artillery and “Grad missiles” in the Kherson region; one person was killed, two were wounded. The claims have not been independently verified. Donetsk and Kherson are two of the partly occupied regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, has posted to Telegram to say: “The aggressor does not give up hope of taking Bakhmut at any cost, despite the losses in manpower and equipment.” He goes on to write that the enemy is losing “considerable strength” and that “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, [Balakliia] and Kupiansk”, all areas that Ukraine has previously liberated from Russian occupation. He praised his troops for “superhuman resilience, courage and bravery” under “the continuous fire of the enemy’s artillery and aircraft”. An air alert is being declared across Ukraine.

The UK Ministry of Defence has issued its daily intelligence briefing on the situation in Ukraine. It writes: Since the start of March 2023, heavy fighting has continued in parts of the Svatove-Kremina sector of the frontline in northern Luhansk oblast. Russia has partially regained control over the immediate approaches to Kremina town, which was under immediate Ukrainian threat earlier in the year. In places, Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres. Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River. They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node. A former New Zealand soldier who drew an online following with his dispatches from the frontline of the Ukraine war has been killed in fighting there. The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand’s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. For many in New Zealand, Te Tai was the face of the country’s unofficial involvement in Ukraine’s war. He fundraised for equipment and undertook news interviews before he left New Zealand in May 2022, and documented his friendships, battles and daily life on Instagram and Facebook. A video he posted earlier this month captured a moment when he was unexpectedly reunited with a Ukrainian friend who had been held hostage for months by Russian troops, and whom Te Tai recognised when the man began to call out: “New Zealand! New Zealand!” “My brother!” Te Tai replied. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said Wednesday that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant “remains perilous” following a Russian missile strike this month that disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Since a Russian strike on March 9, the plant has relied on a single backup power line that remains “disconnected and under repair”, according to Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. “Nuclear safety at the ZNPP remains in a precarious state,” Grossi said in a statement on Wednesday. The plant’s lack of access to the grid and necessary repair work on its last emergency power line could cause a complete loss of power, making it reliant on diesel generators for the seventh time since Russia captured it a year ago, Grossi said. “I once again call for a commitment from all sides to secure nuclear safety and security protection at the plant.” The statement continues: The situation at the plant remains perilous. The IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ) team currently present at the plant was informed that restoration of the line had been planned for 5, 10 and then 13 March but had not been possible. The latest reconnection date is scheduled for 23 March. Six weeks after European leaders last gathered in Brussels, they’re meeting again for two days. The war in Ukraine is high on the agenda (though tensions between France and Germany over nuclear energy and combustion engines loom large) and UN secretary general, António Guterres, will be joining the summit for the first day. Among the items on the agenda over the next two days are, according to the council: Accountability of perpetrators Further increasing collective pressure on Russia The use of frozen assets for the reconstruction of Ukraine Support to help meet Ukraine’s military and defence needs Global food security Address high energy prices Reduce gas demand Ensure security of supply Phase out dependency on Russian fossil fuels Wording on the summit points out that the EU has “made available” €67bn (US$73bn) to Ukraine since the start of the war. That’s equivalent to about 27% of Ukraine’s total GDP for 2021, before Russia invaded. A months-long ground assault on the eastern town of Bakhmut could be stalling in the face of fierce resistance, according to US, Ukrainian and British military experts. Russian forces unleashed a wave of air strikes in the north and south of Ukraine as President Vladimir Putin bid farewell on Wednesday to Chinese leader Xi Jinping following a two day visit to Moscow by his fellow autocrat and “dear friend”. Bakhmut is the site of Europe’s deadliest infantry battle since World War Two. The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, said in its most recent update that the pace of Russian operations around Bakhmut “appears to be slowing amid Western reporting that Russian forces may be attempting to launch offensives in other directions.” The update goes on to say: Russian forces are currently increasing the tempo of their offensive operations around Avdiivka aiming to encircle the settlement, and it is possible that Russian forces are doing so at the expense of their operations around Bakhmut and the stalled offensive around Vuhledar. British military intelligence believes Russia’s assault on the town could be running out of steam. There was still a danger, however, that the Ukrainian garrison in Bakhmut could be surrounded, Britain’s defence ministry said in its intelligence update on Wednesday. Ukraine’s military General Staff agreed that Russia’s offensive potential in Bakhmut was declining. Bakhmut has become a key objective for Moscow, which sees the town as a stepping stone toward completing its conquest of the eastern Donbas region. Hello and welcome back to our continuing live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan taking you through the day’s news. Our top story this morning: Russia’s months-long ground assault on the eastern town of Bakhmut could be stalling in the face of fierce resistance, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank. In its latest update, the ISW writes, “The tempo of Russian operations around Bakhmut appears to be slowing amid Western reporting that Russian forces may be attempting to launch offensives in other directions”. And the European Council is meeting today in Brussels, where leaders will discuss the war and Europe’s continuing support for Ukraine. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres will also take part in today’s meeting. We’ll bring you the latest on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said China is watching “very carefully” to see how Washington and the world respond to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at the end of president Xi Jinping’s visit to Moscow, Blinken said that if Russia was allowed to attack Ukraine with impunity, it would “open a Pandora’s box” for would-be aggressors and lead to a “world of conflict”. He added that China has not yet crossed the line of providing lethal aid to Moscow. Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia was a “journey of friendship, cooperation and peace”, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said, as China’s president ended his three-day visit to Moscow. Wang Wenbin reiterated Beijing’s claims that it remained neutral in the Ukraine conflict and said China would “continue to play a constructive role in promoting a political settlement of the Ukrainian issue”. Vladimir Putin has no immediate plans for peace in Ukraine, so the west needs to brace itself to supply lethal aid to Kyiv for a long time to come, Nato’s secretary general has warned in an interview with the Guardian. The fierce fighting, currently centred around Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine, demonstrated Russia was willing “to just throw in thousands and thousands more troops, to take many casualties for minimal gains”, the head of Nato said. At least one person was killed and 33 wounded by a twin Russian missile strike on two residential buildings in Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine’s east, according to officials. Footage from a security camera captured the moment the strike hit, causing an explosion and a large plume of smoke to rise from two nine-storey buildings. Residential areas “where ordinary people and children live are being fired at”, said the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. At least eight people were killed overnight in a drone attack on Rzhyshchiv in the Kyiv region, regional police chief Andrii Nebytov said. The strike is reported to have hit a dormitory building and a school. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that one of the people who died was “an ambulance driver who came to the call”. Russia’s foreign ministry has warned that Moscow will not leave “unanswered” a UK plan to supply Ukraine with tank shells made with depleted uranium. “This decision will not remain without serious consequences both for Russian-British bilateral relations and at the international level,” it said on Wednesday. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Britain’s decision took the situation to new and dangerous levels. The UK foreign secretary has said there is no “nuclear escalation” in the country’s decision to supply Ukraine with shells made with depleted uranium. “They are not nuclear munitions. They are purely conventional munitions,” James Cleverly said, a day after Vladimir Putin accused the west of “beginning to use weapons with a nuclear component”. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said the risk of a nuclear conflict is at its highest level in decades. Russia was committed to keeping the world “safe and free” from the threat of nuclear war, he said, but added later that business could not continue as usual, given that Moscow was now “in a de facto state of open conflict” with Washington. Rebuilding Ukraine’s economy is now expected to cost $411bn, 2.6 times Ukraine’s expected 2022 gross domestic product, a new study by the World Bank, United Nations, European Commission and Ukraine found. Sweden’s parliament has formally approved a bill to allow the country to join Nato. Sweden and its neighbour Finland applied to join Nato in May 2022, abandoning decades of non-alignment after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The process has been held up by Turkey, which along with Hungary has yet to ratify the memberships. Zelenskiy made a surprise visit on Wednesday to Ukrainian troops near the frontline city of Bakhmut. During his visit, the president heard “reports on the operational situation and the course of hostilities on the frontline”, a statement from his office said. Zelenskiy, dressed in a dark sweatshirt and military khaki trousers, was seen handing out medals to soldiers he said were heroically defending their country’s sovereignty. There is a possibility that the Russian assault on the town of Bakhmut is losing the limited momentum it had obtained, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. This could be happening because “some Russian MoD units have been reallocated to other sectors”, it said. The Prince of Wales travelled to Warsaw as part of a surprise two-day trip to Poland to thank British and Polish troops for their efforts supporting Ukraine, as well as to learn more about how the country has cared for displaced Ukrainian refugees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/mar/08/coalition-shortlist-for-nuclear-submarines-base-were-not-in-defences-top-five-in-2011-review","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-07T16:30:48Z","webTitle":"Coalition shortlist for nuclear submarines base were not in Defence’s top five in 2011 review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/08/coalition-shortlist-for-nuclear-submarines-base-were-not-in-defences-top-five-in-2011-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/mar/08/coalition-shortlist-for-nuclear-submarines-base-were-not-in-defences-top-five-in-2011-review","fields":{"headline":"Coalition shortlist for nuclear submarines base were not in Defence’s top five in 2011 review","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The mayors of Newcastle and Wollongong have expressed unease at the Morrison government naming their cities as a potential base for nuclear-powered submarines, with one describing the Aukus plans as a “fantasy”. Questions have also been raised about the government’s process for shortlisting Newcastle, Port Kembla in Wollongong and Brisbane for a new east coast base, given that a previous Defence review had not backed them as most-preferred sites. The South Australian independent senator Rex Patrick, a former submariner, said Scott Morrison’s announcement on Monday was “thick with political fog” with an election looming, noting the final site would not be selected until 2023. Patrick said: “Why pork barrel in one electorate when you can – for the same price – pork barrel in three?” Morrison said the government had “provisioned more than $10bn to meet the facilities and infrastructure requirements” for the transition from Australia’s existing Collins-class submarines to the nuclear-powered submarines to be acquired under the Aukus pact with the UK and the US. He said Defence had looked at 19 potential sites and narrowed them down to the three preferred locations. Defence would now discuss the plans further with state and local governments and “begin negotiations on what will be an enormous undertaking”. The moves come amid continuing uncertainty about when the first of the nuclear-powered submarines will be operating. Morrison originally estimated it would be by about 2040 but the government now insists it may be sooner. The new base – which the Coalition wants to build in either Brisbane, Newcastle or Port Kembla – would “enable the regular visiting of US and UK nuclear-powered submarines”, Morrison said in a virtual address to the Lowy Institute. However, the mayors of Newcastle and Wollongong both said they were not consulted about the decision. With both cities historically home to anti-war movements they expected considerable community opposition. Both cities have passed official resolutions to make them nuclear-free zones. There is also believed to be opposition to nuclear power, particularly where it is used to propel a weapon of war – although spent fuel rods from the Lucas Heights reactor have passed through Port Kembla on their way for processing in France. Wollongong’s lord mayor, Gordon Bradbery, an independent, said he was waiting for more detail about the proposal before he would consult the local community. “It’s not only nuclear power and nuclear-powered submarines, but it’s the location of a strategic defence asset and that would make anyone who gets this particular facility a target,” Bradbery said. “International tensions now are playing on a lot of people’s minds and there would be concerns about our city as a location for nuclear-powered submarines.” Bradbery said Wollongong city council had previously worked with Regional Development Australia to make a submission to the federal government to relocate naval activities from Garden Island in Sydney Harbour to Port Kembla, but this was for conventional submarines only. “It just disappeared into the ether at the time,” Bradbery said. “Many suggested it was pie in the sky as the navy wasn’t keen on relocating from Garden Island.” Newcastle’s Labor lord mayor, Nuatali Nelmes, said the city had no intention of giving up its nuclear-free status over a “fantasy”. “The whole deal is a fantasy,” Nelmes said. “This announcement, the Aukus decision and the absolutely hopeless way they have handled this submarine contract – we are not getting lumped with their mess. “It is also typical of the federal government to have unilateral decision making where cities like Newcastle, which have been for many decades, a nuclear-free zone, would even be considered.” But the Liberal premier of New South Wales, Dominic Perrottet, welcomed the inclusion of Port Kembla and Newcastle on the federal government’s shortlist, saying the world faced “very uncertain times”. “Defence protection for our country is paramount and we have worked very closely with the federal government to identify these sites for our state,” Perrottet told the Nine Network. A spokesperson for the Queensland Labor government said it was “yet to receive any detailed information from the commonwealth”. Study found Port Kembla ‘impractical’ A 2011 Defence report ranked potential options for a new east coast home port for submarines. The top three options were in Sydney Harbour, followed by two options in Jervis Bay, south of Sydney. “Newcastle has its strengths, but the slight edge that it has with respect to positive people factors is compromised by its isolation from any other naval infrastructure, its susceptibility to flooding, and its sometimes difficult harbour entrance,” the future submarine basing study said. Newcastle Port was sixth on the list and the Port of Brisbane was eighth. The report included the caveat that detailed costing and environmental impact analysis “may generate a different outcome”. It placed a priority on the proximity to fleet assets in Sydney. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The same 2011 Defence study said it “would be impractical” to develop a future submarine basing capability at Port Kembla, noting it was previously found to be “a small and congested harbour with little space for substantial expansion”. Patrick, a senator who obtained the 2011 report under freedom of information laws, said it had been “a pure study” completed “without political considerations”. Although that study was focused on a new base for conventionally powered submarines, Patrick said he believed the presence of the Lucas Heights reactor in Sydney and associated specialists would only strengthen the case for Sydney. Patrick accused Morrison of dangling a “carrot” for three electorates prior to the election due in May. “In some sense, it’s a toxic carrot because it will divide communities, but he’s particularly good at that,” Patrick said. In a statement, Morrison said an east coast submarine base “would enhance Australia’s strategic deterrent capability in the Pacific Ocean”. The locations were “selected on submarine basing criteria, which included access to exercise operating areas, proximity to industrial infrastructure, and significant population centres to support personnel and recruitment”. Labor demanded a “proper briefing” on the base plans. The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, who has supported the Aukus partnership, said the government had made “an announcement about there being an announcement down the track”. “You can’t actually defend the country with a media release,” Albanese said. Comment was also sought from Defence, Regional Development Australia and Brisbane city council."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-238-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-19T14:03:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 238 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-238-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-238-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 238 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has declared martial law in the four provinces of Ukraine where it controls territory after Russian officials warned of a looming Ukrainian assault on the key southern city of Kherson. The law, published on the Kremlin website, gives far-reaching emergency powers to the Russian-installed heads of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson provinces, which Russia recently proclaimed as annexed after sham referendums. Putin also ordered an “economic mobilisation” in eight provinces bordering Ukraine. The measures apply to the southern regions of Krasnodar, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk and Rostov, which are all near Ukraine, and the territories of Crimea and Sevastopol, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. Putin said he was granting additional authority to the leaders of all Russian provinces to maintain public order and increase production in support of Moscow’s war, which is entering its eighth month. The Russian-installed leader of the occupied Ukrainian region of Kherson, said Wednesday that authorities plan a mass removal of 50-60,000 people over the next six days. Vladimir Saldo said authorities were moving civilians to the left bank of the Dnipro in order to “keep people safe” and allow the military to “act resolutely”. Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-installed deputy administrator of the Kherson region, echoed the message on Telegram late on Tuesday: “The battle for Kherson will begin in the very near future. The civilian population is advised, if possible, to leave the area of the upcoming fierce hostilities.” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, described the Russian announcements as “a propaganda show”. He said “The Russians are trying to scare the people of Kherson with fake newsletters about the shelling of the city by our army, and also arrange a propaganda show with evacuation”. He described it as “a rather primitive tactic, given that the armed forces do not fire at Ukrainian cities – this is done exclusively by Russian terrorists”. The new commander of Moscow’s army in Ukraine described the military situation as “tense”. “The enemy continually attempts to attack the positions of Russian troops,” Sergei Surovikin said in his first televised interview since being appointed earlier this month, adding that the situation was particularly difficult around the occupied southern city of Kherson. Kyiv has recently introduced a news blackout in the south of the country, leading to speculations that it was preparing a new major offensive on Kherson. “When the Ukrainians have a news blackout it means something is going on. They have always done this before when there is a big offensive push on,” Michael Clarke, a former director general of the Royal United Services Institute, told Sky News. Several Russian missiles have been shot down over Kyiv, its mayor Vitalii Klitschko said, after loud explosions were reported in the centre of the Ukrainian capital. “Air defence shot down several Russian missiles over Kyiv. Air raid alarm is still on! Stay in shelters! Air defence continues to work,” he said. Oleksiy Kuleba, the governor of Kyiv region, indicated that “kamikaze” drones had been shot down. The head of Kryvyi Rih’s military administration, Oleksandr Vilkul, said Russia launched rocket fire overnight on an energy facility, causing “serious destruction” Ukrainian forces shot down 13 “kamikaze” drones over Mykolaiv overnight, according to the region’s governor, Vitaliy Kim. An attempt to retake control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) by boats loaded with Ukrainian special forces has been repulsed, according to one of the Russian-installed officials in occupied eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian officials are working to create mobile power points after Russia launched new strikes against the country’s energy infrastructure, President Zelenskiy said. Zelenskiy held a “strategic meeting” with senior officials today to discuss measures to “eliminate the consequences in the event of a breakdown of the energy system of Ukraine”, he said on Telegram. Ukraine has withdrawn its ambassador to Kazakhstan after a row over Petro Vrublevsky;s comments about killing Russians. Russia’s strikes on critical energy infrastructure in Ukraine are “acts of pure terror” that amount to war crimes, the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has said. The Belarus defence ministry said in a statement that it has begun summoning citizens to check their eligibility for military service, but that it is not planning mobilisation. The military registration and enlistment activities are strictly routine and are expected to be completed by the end of this year,” it said. The White House is taking “every step possible” to avoid a direct encounter between President Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Indonesia next month, according to reports. US officials are also reportedly taking measures to avoid even a hallway run-in or photo meeting between the two leaders. Finland’s main political parties have backed building a fence along parts of the country’s border with Russia, with work on a short pilot section expected to start as soon as funds have been allocated, Finnish media have reported. Israel’s defence minister has reiterated that the country will not sell weapons to Ukraine, despite a request from Kyiv for air defence supplies in the face of Russia’s growing use of Iranian-made drones. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Thursday that Russia no longer sees a need to maintain a diplomatic presence in the west, the Daily Beast reports. “There is neither point nor desire to maintain the previous presence in western states. Our people work there in conditions that can hardly be called human,” Lavrov said, according to the Russian news agency Tass. Military advisers from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were on Ukrainian soil at a Russian military base in occupied Crimea, the New York Times reports. The Iranians were reported to have been deployed to help Russian troops deal with problems with the Tehran-supplied fleet of Shahed-136 drones, rebranded as Geran-2 by the attackers. Iran has deepened its commitment to supplying arms for Russia’s assault on Ukraine by agreeing to provide a batch of medium-range missiles, as well as large numbers of cheap but effective drones, according to US and Iranian security officials. Russian airstrikes have destroyed 30% of Ukraine’s power stations since 10 October, causing massive blackouts across the country, said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday. Russian strikes on Tuesday hit a power plant in Kyiv, killing three people, as well as energy infrastructure in Kharkiv in the east and Dnipro in the south. A man sheltering in an apartment building in the southern port city Mykolaiv was also killed and the northern Ukrainian city of Zhytomyr was without water or electricity. Ukraine’s foreign minister said Tuesday he was proposing a formal cut in diplomatic ties with Tehran after a wave of Russian attacks using what Kyiv says are Iranian-made drones. Iran has denied supplying drones and Russia has denied using them. Ukrainian intelligence said 1,750 drones, each costing only £20,000 to manufacture, have been delivered. They can be fired from mobile trucks and, despite their slow speeds, are hard to detect until the last minute. Nato said Ukraine would receive anti-drone defence systems in coming days. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, said on Tuesday that member countries would “step up” and deliver more air defences to help stabilise the situation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/08/severn-estuary-tidal-energy-plan-back-on-agenda-amid-ukraine-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-08T14:31:12Z","webTitle":"Severn estuary tidal energy plan back on agenda amid Ukraine crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/08/severn-estuary-tidal-energy-plan-back-on-agenda-amid-ukraine-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/08/severn-estuary-tidal-energy-plan-back-on-agenda-amid-ukraine-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Severn estuary tidal energy plan back on agenda amid Ukraine crisis","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A major infrastructure project harnessing the vast tidal power of the Severn estuary is back on the agenda after the UK government said the Russian invasion of Ukraine had highlighted the need to find more secure sources of energy. An independent commission was launched on Tuesday to explore using the Severn estuary, which has the second largest tidal range in the world, to create energy. Michael Gove, the UK secretary of state for levelling up, backed the commission, which comes 12 years after the government dashed ambitious plans for a 10-mile energy-generating barrage. Gove said: “Russia’s invasion has served to heighten concerns about energy security and costs. Sustainable forms of energy cannot come soon enough. The launch of an independent commission on tidal energy for the Severn is very welcome news.” The commission has been set up by the Western Gateway “powerhouse”, a coalition of politicians, business and public sector leaders and academics covering an area stretching from Swansea to Swindon and straddling the Severn, designed to rival the Northern Powerhouse and Midlands Engine. At its inaugural conference, delegates were told a Severn estuary tidal project could provide up to 7% of the UK’s energy needs. Huw Thomas, the leader of Cardiff council and one of the leaders of the project said: “We’re becoming painfully aware of the need for greater energy security.” Thomas acknowledged that concerns over possible damage to an internationally important marsh and mudflat habitat, harming wildlife had blighted previous schemes. In 2010 the UK government said there was no “strategic case” for investing in a barrage and, instead, paved the way for new nuclear power plants. But Thomas said: “The changing landscape of the climate emergency, energy insecurity, rising costs, and rapid technological improvements, indicate that many of these policy, cost and environmental barriers may no longer be as significant.” Thomas said the powerhouse was not wedded to any particular technology but he said the possibility of a barrage – which is likely to cost more than £25bn and take 10 years or more to come to fruition – or tidal lagoons would be explored. Vaughan Gething, the Welsh government’s economy minister, told the conference it was committed to helping Wales become a leading centre for emerging tidal technology. The leader of Newport city council, Jane Mudd, said: “It feels like the time is right to look at this again.” She said it was exciting that people on both sides of the estuary could work on the project. “The Severn is something that can unite us rather than divide us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/jun/05/russia-ukraine-war-latest-explosions-shake-kyiv-macron-rebuked-for-saying-russia-cant-be-humiliated-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-06T00:25:11Z","webTitle":"Putin warns that Moscow will hit new targets if the west supplies Ukraine with long-range missiles – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jun/05/russia-ukraine-war-latest-explosions-shake-kyiv-macron-rebuked-for-saying-russia-cant-be-humiliated-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/jun/05/russia-ukraine-war-latest-explosions-shake-kyiv-macron-rebuked-for-saying-russia-cant-be-humiliated-live","fields":{"headline":"Putin warns that Moscow will hit new targets if the west supplies Ukraine with long-range missiles – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"That’s all from me, Samantha Lock, for now. Please join me a little a later when we launch our new live blog covering all the latest developments from Ukraine. Here is a comprehensive run-down of where things currently stand as of 3.30am. Russia struck Ukraine’s capital Kyiv with missiles early on Sunday for the first time in more than a month. A railway depot was hit in the eastern suburb of Dniprovsky. Five cruise missiles fired from the Caspian Sea were launched from Tu-95 bombers, one of which was intercepted, Ukraine’s air force said, in an attack that represented a change of approach on the part of Russian forces. A Russian cruise missile “flew critically low” over the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant, in the south of the country, at about 5.30am, apparently heading for Kyiv. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company Energoatom said Russian forces “still do not understand that even the smallest fragment of a missile that can hit a working power unit can cause a nuclear catastrophe and radiation leak” in a statement on Sunday. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that Moscow will hit new targets if the west supplies Ukraine with long-range missiles. “We will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting,” Putin told Rossiya state television, without specifying what those targets were. The comments were made in response to a pledge from the US went through with the delivery of Himars rocket artillery that the White House promised last week. Ukrainian forces have counterattacked and retaken half of the city of Sievierodonetsk in the east of the country, officials said. “It had been a difficult situation, the Russians controlled 70% of the city, but over the past two days they have been pushed back,” Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai told Ukrainian television. “The city is now, more or less, divided in half.” The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, also said Ukrainian forces were “successfully slowing down Russian operations” in Donbas and were making “effective local counterattacks in Sievierodonetsk”. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited his troops on Ukraine’s eastern frontlines in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as well as the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia on Sunday. A Russian general, Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov, was killed in eastern Ukraine, a Russian state media journalist said on Sunday, adding to the string of high-ranking military casualties sustained by Moscow. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s visit to Serbia has been cancelled after countries around Serbia closed their airspace to his aircraft, according to local media reports. A senior foreign ministry source told the Interfax news agency that Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro had closed their airspace to the plane that would have carried Moscow’s top diplomat to Belgrade on Monday. “Our diplomacy has yet to master teleportation,” the source said. Britain is to supply long-range rocket artillery to Ukraine, including a handful of tracked M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which can hit targets up to 80km (50 miles) away. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said the decision to ship the rocket launchers was justified because “as Russia’s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine”. Spain is also to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard battle tanks in a step up of its military support to the country, according to government sources cited by newspaper El Pais. Spain will provide essential training to the Ukrainian military in how to use the tanks, according to the reports. Nato kicked off nearly a two-week US-led naval exercise on the Baltic Sea on Sunday with more than 7,000 sailors, airmen and marines from 16 nations, including Finland and Sweden whom aspire to join the military alliance. “It is important for us, the United States, and the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,” US Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said. A Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, Moldova’s border police said on Sunday. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption. Russia’s sanctions against Gazprom Germania and its subsidiaries could cost German taxpayers and gas users an extra €5bn ($5.4bn) a year to pay for replacement gas, the Welt am Sonntag weekly reported, citing industry representatives. Spain is to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard battle tanks in a step up of its military support to the country, according to government sources cited by newspaper El Pais. Spain will also provide essential training to the Ukrainian military in how to use the tanks, according to the reports as cited by Reuters. Training would take place in Latvia, where the Spanish army has deployed 500 soldiers within the framework of Nato’s Enhanced Advanced Presence operation. A second phase of training could take place in Spain, according to the sources cited by El Pais. The paper said Spain’s defence ministry is finalising a delivery to Kyiv of low-level Shorad Aspide anti-aircraft missiles, which the Spanish army has replaced with a more advanced system. Spain has so far supplied ammunition, individual protection equipment and light weapons. Russia’s sanctions against Gazprom Germania and its subsidiaries could cost German taxpayers and gas users an extra €5bn ($5.4bn) a year to pay for replacement gas, the Welt am Sonntag weekly reported, citing industry representatives. In May, Russia decided to stop supplying Gazprom Germania, which had been the German subsidiary of Gazprom, after Berlin put the company under trustee management due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since then, the Bundesnetzagentur energy regulator, acting as trustee, has had to buy replacement gas on the market to fulfil supply contracts with German municipal utilities and regional suppliers. Welt am Sonntag reported that Economy Minister Robert Habeck estimates an extra 10m cubic meters per day are required, which would currently cost about €3.5bn a year. Further costs arise from the filling of the Rehden natural gas storage facility which Habeck ordered on Wednesday, it said. The paper also said the additional costs would be passed on to energy suppliers and end customers in the form of a gas levy from October. Nato kicked off nearly a two-week US-led naval exercise on the Baltic Sea on Sunday with more than 7,000 sailors, airmen and marines from 16 nations, including two aspiring to join the military alliance, Finland and Sweden. The annual BALTOPS naval exercise, initiated in 1972, is not held in response to any specific threat. But the military alliance said that “with both Sweden and Finland participating, Nato is seizing the chance in an unpredictable world to enhance its joint force resilience and strength” together with two Nordic aspirant nations, according to a report from the Associated Press. Finland and Sweden decided to apply to join Nato in May as a direct result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, despite repeated warnings from Moscow against joining the western military alliance. Ahead of the naval drill, which involved 45 vessels and 75 aircraft, the top US military official said in Sweden the host of the BALTOPS 22 exercise that it was particularly important for Nato to show support to the governments in Helsinki and Stockholm. It is important for us, the United States, and the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,” US Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Saturday during a news conference aboard the large amphibious warship USS Kearsarge, which was moored in central Stockholm. Milley said from Moscow’s perspective, Finland and Sweden joining Nato will be “very problematic” and leave Russia in a difficult military position as the Baltic Sea’s coastline would be almost completely encircled by Nato members, except for Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad and the Russian city of St. Petersburg and its surrounding areas. The United States has never before moved such a large warship as the 843-foot USS Kearsarge in the Swedish capital, where it sailed through narrow passages in the Stockholm archipelago, Milley said. As Nato’s close partners, Finland and Sweden have participated in the naval drill since the mid-1990s. Vice Adm. Gene Black, commander Naval Striking and Support Forces Nato and US Sixth Fleet, added: In past iterations of BALTOPS we’ve talked about meeting the challenges of tomorrow. Those challenges are upon us - in the here and now.” BALTOPS 22 is scheduled to end in the German port of Kiel on June 17. Participating nations include Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These countries will exercise a myriad of capabilities demonstrating the inherent flexibility of maritime forces. Exercise scenarios include amphibious operations, gunnery, anti-submarine, air defence, mine clearance operations, explosive ordnance disposal, unmanned underwater vehicles, and medical response, according to an official statement. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s visit to Serbia has been cancelled after countries around Serbia closed their airspace to his aircraft, according to reports. A senior foreign ministry source told the Interfax news agency that Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro had closed their airspace to the plane that would have carried Moscow’s top diplomat to Belgrade on Monday “Our diplomacy has yet to master teleportation,” the source said. Serbia, which has close cultural ties with Russia, has fended off pressure to take sides over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has not joined western sanctions against Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic agreed last month that Russia would continue supplying natural gas to Serbia, while other countries have been cut off for refusing to pay for Russian gas in roubles. Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić will address the nation on Monday night regarding the cancellation of Lavrov’s visit to Belgrade, according to local media reports. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited his troops on Ukraine’s eastern frontlines on Sunday to understand the position of Ukrainian defenders as Russia’s assault on Donbas continues. According to a release from his office, Zelenskiy visited command posts and frontline positions of Ukrainian troops in the area of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region and Lysychansk in the Luhansk region. “The president heard information on the operational situation in these parts of the front, as well as a report on the logistics of Ukrainian defenders,” the statement read. Earlier in the day, Zelenskiy visited frontline troops in the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia. Oleksandr Starukh, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region told Zelenskiy that some 60% of the region’s territory is under Russian occupation, with more than 2,700 infrastructure objects either damaged or destroyed. Humanitarian hubs have been set up in the Zaporizhzhia region to shelter residents of the temporarily occupied territories and settlements where hostilities continue. “Over the last 15 days the largest number of people have come from the Kherson region. They also come from Mariupol,” Starukh said. Zelenskiy’s office later said the president also visited a medical facility in the region and spoke with people forced to leave their homes, including from Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands after being under siege for weeks. He promised action to ensure that all displaced people would be properly rehoused. “We will truly help you tackle this issue,” the president’s office quoted him as saying. It’s 2am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: A Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, Moldova’s border police said on Sunday. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption. Russia has announced that it destroyed tanks supplied by eastern European countries in airstrikes on Kyiv. On Sunday, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said that Kyiv had been targeted by “several explosions in Darnytsky and Dniprovsky districts of city”, the first such strikes on the capital since 28 April. Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited frontline troops in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia, his office said on Sunday, a week after a similar trip to the north-eastern Kharkiv region. “I want to thank you for your great work, for your service, for protecting all of us, our state,” he said. Vladimir Putin said today that Moscow would strike at new targets if the west supplied Ukraine with long-range missiles, hours after several explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The Russian leader said long-range missile supplies being sent to Ukraine meant that “we will draw the appropriate conclusions and use our arms ... to strike targets we haven’t hit before”. A Russian general, Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov, was killed in eastern Ukraine, a Russian state media journalist said on Sunday, adding to the string of high-ranking military casualties sustained by Moscow. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister has reaffirmed the country’s need for continous military assistance from western countries in order to overcome Moscow’s military campaign. “We have already entered into a protracted war and we will need constant support,” Ganna Malyar told local media on Sunday. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, today as I hand the blog over to my colleague, Samantha Lock, in Australia. Thank you. A Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, Moldova’s border police said on Sunday. Reuters reports: Yakovenko was placed in a pretrial detention centre, a press service representative of the border police said. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption. A search of public records for wanted persons on the Interpol website for Yakovenko’s name did not produce any results on Sunday night. Ukraine and Belarus officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Yakovenko was elected to the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, from the Donetsk region, according to information on the parliament’s website. Fears have grown recently that Moldova could be drawn in to the conflict in neighbouring Ukraine, after pro-Russian separatists in a breakaway region reported a number of attacks and explosions there, which they blamed on Kyiv. Moldova, a country of around 2.6 million people wedged between Ukraine and Romania, has taken a decisive pro-Western political turn since President Maia Sandu took office at the end of 2020, defeating a Moscow-aligned incumbent. The country has an ethnic Romanian majority but a large and influential Russian-speaking minority, and close economic ties to Moscow. Russia has announced that it destroyed tanks supplied by eastern European countries in airstrikes on Kyiv. “High-precision, long-range missiles fired by the Russian Aerospace Forces on the outskirts of Kyiv destroyed T-72 tanks supplied by eastern European countries and other armoured vehicles that were in hangars,” Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. On Sunday, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said that Kyiv had been targeted by “several explosions in Darnytsky and Dniprovsky districts of city”, the first such strikes on the capital since April 28. Several cruise missiles were fired towards Kyiv by Russian TU-95 planes from the Caspian Sea, one of which was destroyed, said the Ukrainian air force. Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited frontline troops in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia, his office said on Sunday, a week after a similar trip to the north-eastern Kharkiv region. Reuters reports: “I want to thank you for your great work, for your service, for protecting all of us, our state,” the statement quoted the Ukrainian president as saying, adding that he held a minute of silence for fallen troops. Zelenskiy’s office later said the president also visited a medical facility in the region and spoke with people forced to leave their homes, including from Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands after being under siege for weeks. He promised action to ensure that all displaced people would be properly rehoused. “We will truly help you tackle this issue,” the president’s office quoted him as saying. Vladimir Putin said today that Moscow would strike at new targets if the west supplied Ukraine with long-range missiles, hours after several explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The Russian leader said long-range missile supplies being sent to Ukraine meant that “we will draw the appropriate conclusions and use our arms ... to strike targets we haven’t hit before”. He did not specify which targets he meant. Images have emerged from the Russian missile attack this morning that struck a facility working on railway cars used for grain transport. A Russian general was killed in eastern Ukraine, a Russian state media journalist said on Sunday, adding to the string of high-ranking military casualties sustained by Moscow. Reuters reports: The report, published on the Telegram messaging app by state television reporter Alexander Sladkov, did not say precisely when and where Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov was killed. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister has reaffirmed the country’s need for continous military assistance from western countries in order to overcome Moscow’s military campaign. “We have already entered into a protracted war and we will need constant support,” Ganna Malyar told local media on Sunday. “The west must understand that its help cannot be a one-time thing, but something that continues until our victory,” she said. Earlier this week, the US announced that long-range weapons were being sent to Ukraine as part of a $700m (£560m) package that includes air-surveillance radar, additional Javelin short-range anti-tank rockets, artillery ammunition and helicopters. Russia has said the new military deliveries put Washington at risk of being directly involved in the conflict with Moscow. An adviser to the mayor of Mariupol has said that the shortage of drinking water has reached a critical level. Petro Andrushenko said people had to register to get drinking water and could only get it every two days. Basic infrastructure and services like water, gas and electricity are yet to be restored to the city after the prolonged siege from Russian forces as they tried to take it over. According to CNN, Andrushenko said: “The amount of water was small before, but now it has decreased altogether. It is necessary to register in the queue ... In the future, the temperature will rise, the water level will fall, and the water will be less.” He said that water being provided is “very conditional drinking water”, which needs boiling. He added that he feared illnesses could break out in the south-eastern city because of the amount of rubbish and dead bodies buried in shallow graves. “We expect cholera [or] any viral epidemic related to the gastrointestinal tract. As a result of unsanitary conditions, this can happen. The worst thing is that such a basic thing as dysentery in the current conditions and with the dysfunctional medical system, lack of drugs, lack of laboratories and everything we are used to, lack of vaccines in Mariupol ... Even dysentery can kill tens of thousands.” Away from the conflict, but linked to the invasion, Ukraine are due to kick off against Wales shortly for the right to play at this year’s men’s football World Cup in Qatar. Their recent playoff game against Scotland, which was won by Ukraine was originally due to take place in March, but was delayed by the war. My colleague Will Unwin will be bringing you live updates with kick-off a few minutes away. Earlier today, in his weekly address from St Peter’s Square at the Vatican, Pope Francis called for “real negotiations” to end the “increasingly dangerous” war. “I renew my appeal to the leaders of nations: please do not lead humanity to destruction,” the 85-year-old said. US congress member Victoria Spartz has been on a two-day visit to Chernihiv, northern Ukraine, being pictured with the governor of the region, Viacheslav Chaus. President Vladimir Putin said Russia would strike new targets if the US started supplying Ukraine with longer-range missiles, the Russian state Tass news agency reported on Sunday. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear power operator Energoatom said a Russian cruise missile flew “critically low” on Sunday morning over an important nuclear power plant. As of this morning, 262 children have been killed and 467 injured, according to the latest figures from Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament. Control of Sievierodonetsk is split in half between Ukrainian and Russian forces, Serhiy Gaidai, governor or the Luhansk region where the eastern city is located, said on Sunday. Ukraine’s air force and the Kyiv mayor have said Russian Tu-95 strategic bombers launched missiles at Kyiv from the Caspian Sea early on Sunday and two of the Ukrainian capital’s eastern districts were rocked by explosions in an attack that targeted railway infrastructure in Kyiv. Russian strikes destroyed tanks and other armoured vehicles on the outskirts of Kyiv that had been provided to Ukraine by European countries, Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine’s gas transit system operator has said the volume of Russian gas nominations at Sudzha transit point has totalled 40.08 mcm for 6 June. Britain’s Ministry of Defence says Ukraine has counterattacked in the contested city of Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, “blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained through concentrating combat units and firepower”. France is in talks with the United Arab Emirates to replace Russian oil purchases, which will stop after the imposition of a European Union ban on Russian crude after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, said Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister. Ukrainian police on Sunday shared video showing the aftermath of Russian shelling in the city of Lysychansk, in the Luhansk region. The video shows damaged administrative buildings, residential buildings and roads. Police said the headquarters for distributing humanitarian aid had been burned to the ground. They said more than 40 people had been living permanently in the building but no information on casualties was provided. Luke Harding and Isobel Koshiw in Bakhmut have the following dispatch from Ukraine: In eastern Ukraine there was intense fighting on Sunday all across the Donbas frontline. Ukrainian forces deployed their existing Smersh multiple launcher rocket system near the city of Bakhmut. Sepia streaks were visible in the sky as rockers were fired at Russian army positions. Another - or possibly the same - Smersh system was seen on Sunday morning on the road between Slavyansk and Bakhmut. Ukrainian army sources admitted their Smersh MLRS were older than the modernised version used by Russia, and had a range of just 40kms. There was no evidence this weekend that the advanced MLRS promised by the Biden administration had reached the eastern theatre. Armoured personnel carriers, ammunition trucks and ambulances could be seen on the roads, as well as battered civilian vehicles painted in military green. There was also a spectacular 220mm 2S7 heavy artillery piece, nicknamed Godzilla. It was mounted on a long lorry.Doctors in Bakhmut’s military hospital said the battle for the Donbas had become a grinding artillery war, seven weeks after Vladimir Putin abandoned his attempt to seize Kyiv. Most of the soldiers brought in for treatment were suffering from shrapnel wounds, they said, with relatively few bullet injuries. Outgoing artillery could be heard near continuously, as well as the odd burst of unexplained gunfire. Most of the city’s 100,000 residents have fled. The city is 10km from the frontline. Denis Babenko, a pastor turned soldier, now evacuating civilians, said morale on the Ukrainian side was high. “We have soul but we don’t have the arms. They have the arms but no spirit or motivation. To win this war we need more heavy weapons.” Ukraine’s gas transit system operator has said the volume of Russian gas nominations at Sudzha transit point has totalled 40.08 mcm for 6 June. More soon... Columns of smoke rise over Kyiv after airstrikes early on Sunday. Missiles hit eastern areas of the Ukrainian capital and injured at least one person, according to the city’s mayor, Vitaly Klitschko. Russia’s defence ministry said the strikes had targeted tanks and other armoured vehicles on the outskirts of the city. Ed Vulliamy has written a column about why he is supporting Ukraine in this year’s Fifa World Cup, despite his Welsh heritage. On Sunday evening, every football fan in the world – apart from the Welsh – will be joined by many others who do not even care for the game in rooting for the national team of battered and besieged but resilient Ukraine as they face Wales for a place in the World Cup in Qatar later this year. Watching here in St Davids, Pembrokeshire, even I, with a substantial quotient of Welsh DNA, will be wearing my official Ukraine yellow football shirt with “Malinovskyi 8” on the back. You can read the article here: Dan Sabbagh reports from Kyiv that Russia launched airstrikes into Kyiv for the first time in five weeks on Sunday, claiming it had destroyed western-supplied tanks – while the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, warned more targets would be struck if weapons deliveries continued. Perhaps signalling the new approach, Putin told Rossiya state television that Russia would hit fresh targets in Ukraine if the US delivered the longer-range rockets that it had promised to Kyiv last week. If such missiles were supplied, “we will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting”, said Putin, who is believed to be closely involved in military decision-making. The Russian leader did not specify what would be struck, although logistics points would be amongst the most logical targets. Russia has been irritated by the US decision to supply Ukraine with Himars truck mounted multiple-launch rocket systems, with missiles that have a range of about 20 to 40 miles, greater than anything in Kyiv’s armoury. You can read more of the reporting below: Russia’s strike on Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, has been the first attack in over a month on the city. Ukrainian officials have said that a counterattack in the east had retaken half of the city of Sievierodonetsk. Reuters reports: Dark smoke could be seen from many miles away after the attack on two outlying districts of Kyiv. Moscow said it had hit a repair shop housing tanks sent from eastern Europe. Ukraine said Russia had carried out the strike using long-range air-launched missiles fired from heavy bombers as far away as the Caspian Sea – a weapon far more valuable than the tanks Russia claimed to have hit. At least one person was hospitalised but there were no immediate reports of deaths from the strike - a sudden reminder of war in a capital where normal life has largely returned since Russian forces were driven from its outskirts in March. “The Kremlin resorts to new insidious attacks. Today*s missile strikes at Kyiv have only one goal - kill as many as possible,” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhailo Podolyak wrote in a tweet. Ukraine’s nuclear power operator said a Russian cruise missile had flown “critically low” over the country’s second largest nuclear power plant. The attack was the first big strike on Kyiv since late April, when a missile killed a journalist. Recent weeks have seen Russia focus its destructive might mainly on frontlines in the east and south, although Moscow occasionally strikes elsewhere in what it calls a campaign to degrade Ukraine’s military infrastructure and block Western arms shipments. Matthew Cantor has spoken to Lee Zion, a journalist in Minnesota who plans to fly to Europe to help Ukrainians “in any way he can”. Lee Zion is preparing to head to Ukraine this summer. “I have gotten all my shots. I have started putting personal possessions into storage, giving other things away. I’ve adopted out two cats,” he said. “And minor things – I’m trying to learn the language. I can at least communicate some basic needs. Like ‘me want cookie,’” he said. For four years, Zion has worked seven days a week at a small-town Minnesota newspaper. But now, disgusted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he plans to fly to Europe and help the Ukrainians in any way he can.

Nato’s reluctance to seize the initiative, rather than passively reacting to Russian actions, is unfathomable, too. Proposals for a no-fly zone and safe havens in western Ukraine are repeatedly rejected as too risky. So dare to try something else! Nato has the muscle and means. It could do much more to stop the systematic killing of civilians and push Russia back, as previously argued here. Left to fight alone, Zelenskiy pleads for heavy weapons but his pleas still often go unmet or responses are delayed. “We need to get serious about supplying [Ukraine’s] army so that it can do what the world is asking it to do: fight a world superpower alone on the battlefield,” says US Gen Philip Breedlove, formerly Nato commander in Europe. He’s right. You can read more here: Russian strikes destroyed tanks and other armoured vehicles on the outskirts of Kyiv that had been provided to Ukraine by European countries, Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday. The ministry’s statement came after the Ukrainian capital experienced by several explosions early on Sunday. Ukraine’s air force and the Kyiv mayor have said Russian Tu-95 strategic bombers launched missiles at Kyiv from the Caspian Sea early on Sunday and two of the Ukrainian capital’s eastern districts were rocked by explosions in an attack that targeted railway infrastructure in Kyiv. The mayor, Vitaly Klitschko said at least one person was taken to hospital; no deaths were immediately reported. Reuters reports: Dark smoke rose into the sky above the Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts where the explosions rang out. The missiles were the first to hit the capital since late April when a Radio Liberty producer was killed when a Russian missile hit the building she lived in. According to preliminary data, Russia launched missiles from Tu-95 aircraft from the Caspian Sea,” the Ukrainian air forces said in a statement. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called on the west to impose more sanctions on Russia to punish it for the strikes and to supply more weapons to Ukraine. The Kremlin resorts to new insidious attacks. Today*s missile strikes at Kyiv have only one goal: kill as many as possible,” he wrote. The mayor of the historic town of Brovary some 12 miles (12km) from Kyiv’s centre, urged people to remain inside their houses as there had been reports of the smell of soot coming from the smoke. President Vladimir Putin said Russia would strike new targets if the United States started supplying Ukraine with longer-range missiles, the TASS news agency reported on Sunday. The TASS news agency reports: Putin said that if such missiles are supplied, that Russia will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting”, in an Rossiya-1 state television channel Putin did not name the targets Russia planned to pursue if western countries began supplying Ukraine with longer-range missiles. He said the “fuss” around western weapon supplies to Ukraine was designed to drag out the conflict. Ukraine has been seeking Multiple Rocket Launch Systems (MLRS) such as the M270 and M142 HIMARS to strike troops and weapons stockpiles at the Russian forces’ rear. France is in talks with the United Arab Emirates to replace Russian oil purchases, which will stop after the imposition of a European Union ban on Russian crude following Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday. “There are discussions with the United Arab Emirates. We have to find an alternative to Russian oil,” Le Maire told Europe 1 radio. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear power operator Energoatom said a Russian cruise missile flew “critically low” on Sunday morning over a major nuclear power plant. Reuters, although they could not immediately verify the claim, reports: “It’s probable that was the missile that was fired in the direction of Kyiv,” the operator of the Pivdennoukrainska plant, also called the South Ukraine Nuclear Plant, said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Early on Sunday, several explosions rocked Kyiv. Pivdennoukrainska is Ukraine’s second largest nuclear plant located near in the Mykolaiv region, about 350 km (220 miles) south of Kyiv. As of this morning, 262 children have been killed and 467 injured, according to the latest figures from Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament. Those figures are not final, the parliament said on Telegram: Work is underway to establish them in places of active hostilities, in the temporarily occupied and liberated territories. The true number is likely significantly higher. In parts of Ukraine that are occupied or under active attack by Russia, local authorities have said it is impossible to clear bodies from the street, or count the numbers of citizens killed or injured. The parliament said 1938 schools or educational facilities had been damaged by bombing, and 182 were completely destroyed. Control of Sievierodonetsk is split in half between Ukrainian and Russian forces, Serhiy Gaidai, governor or the Luhansk region where the eastern city is located, said on Sunday. Reuters reports that Gaidai said on Ukrainian television: It had been a difficult situation, the Russians controlled 70% of the city, but over the past two days they have been pushed back.” “The city is now, more or less, divided in half.” Reuters could not immediately verify Gaidai’s claims. If you’d like a fuller report on fight for territory in Sievierodonetsk, here’s a report from our Ukraine-based correspondents: For a little more context on these strikes in Kyiv, they come after a period of relative calm in the city, after Moscow turned its military focus to the east and south. Politico’s Ukraine-based correspondent Christopher Miller said “It was eerily silent this morn, save for the birds. Then came the explosions in the distance.” He called it “the first attack on Kyiv in weeks”. An update on the explosions that shook Kyiv in the early hours of this morning - Mayor Vitali Klitschko has said that so far there have been no deaths reported. The mayor said on Telegram on Sunday morning: Friends! Regarding the morning explosions in Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts of the capital. There are currently no casualties from missile strikes on infrastructure. One victim was hospitalized. Services are still working in the affected areas This morning, Kyiv Regional Military Administration said that as well as the missiles that hit, one “enemy missile was shot down over Obukhiv district by air defense forces”. It asked residents to remain in shelters during air raids. Britain’s Ministry of Defence says Ukraine has counterattacked in the contested city of Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, “blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained through concentrating combat units and firepower”. The intelligence report backs up claims by Ukrainian officials on Saturday that their forces had recaptured parts of the city. The MoD said on Sunday morning: Over the last 24 hours, Ukrainian forces have counterattacked in the contested city of Sieverodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, likely blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained through concentrating combat units and firepower. Several explosions shook the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Sunday, mayor Vitali Klitschko said. “Several explosions in Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts of the capital,” Klitschko wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “Services are already working on site. More detailed information - later.” A Reuters witness saw smoke in the city after the explosions. Air raid sirens had gone off earlier across much of Ukraine, including in the Kyiv region Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. If you’re just waking up, or just dropping in to find the latest information, here’s a summary of the main points of the past few hours. Powerful explosions were heard early on Sunday in Kyiv, a Reuters witness said. Smoke was seen in the Ukrainian capital following the explosions. Earlier, air raid sirens were going off across much of Ukraine, including in the Kyiv region. Ukrainian forces have been managing to push back against Russian troops in fierce fighting in Sievierodonetsk despite Moscow “throwing all its power” into capturing the key eastern city, Ukrainian officials said on Saturday. In an interview aired online, the Luhansk regional governor, Sergiy Gaiday, said the Russian army has taken control over most of Sievierodonetsk, but that Ukrainian forces were still pushing them back. But the Russian army claimed some Ukrainian military units have been withdrawing from Sievierodonetsk. “Some units of the Ukrainian army, having suffered critical losses during fighting for Sievierodonetsk, are pulling out towards Lysychansk”, Sievierodonetsk’s twin city, which sits just across a river, the defence ministry said in a statement. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said Moscow’s anti-aircraft forces have shot down dozens of Ukrainian weapons and are “cracking them like nuts”, in an interview that aired on Saturday. According to Reuters, Russian news agency RIA, which first cited the comments, quoted Putin as responding to a question about US-supplied arms by saying Russia was coping easily and had already destroyed the weapons by the dozen. Kyiv has rebuked the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for saying it was important not to “humiliate Russia”. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted in response: “Calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it. Because it is Russia that humiliates itself. We all better focus on how to put Russia in its place. This will bring peace and save lives.” Western sanctions would not have an effect on Russia’s oil exports, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Lavrov also predicted a significant increase in profits from energy shipments this year, Russian news agency Tass reported. A EU decision to extend sanctions against Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko to his wife is “irrational” because she has never held Russian citizenship or resided in Russia, a representative for the couple said. The EU sanctioned Melnichenko’s wife on Friday as part of a sixth round of sanctions against Russia for waging a war against Ukraine. Negotiations with Russia will only resume after new weapons arrive from the west and Ukraine’s position is “strengthened”, said David Arakhamia, a member of Ukraine’s negotiation group with Russia. Another negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said there was no point in talks with Russia until Moscow’s forces are pushed back as far as possible towards Ukraine’s borders. Ukraine’s intelligence services are in communication with hundreds of captured Azovstal steelworks fighters and Kyiv is doing all it can to ensure their release, according to Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrskiy. Ukraine wants the fighters to be returned in a prisoner swap. However, some Russian officials have said forces could be tried or executed. The US expressed support for international investigations into war crimes committed in Ukraine, the US embassy in Kyiv announced. “Those responsible for war crimes – including direct perpetrators and those who ordered them – must face justice,” the embassy tweeted on Saturday. A famous monastery in eastern Ukraine, Svyatohirsk Lavra, caught fire after it was hit by Russian shelling. The monastery is affiliated with the Moscow Patriarchate, which is run by Putin’s ally Patriarch Kirill. There were reports that four monks were killed as a result of the attack . The Ukrainian first lady, Olena Zelenska, and other officials commemorated 261 children killed by the Russian war against Ukraine by hanging bells near St Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv. The bells symbolise the voices of killed children, Euromaidan Press reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/15/boris-johnson-david-king-uk-energy-bills-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T10:19:26Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson told to tackle rising energy bills to avoid ‘extreme suffering’ this winter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/15/boris-johnson-david-king-uk-energy-bills-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/15/boris-johnson-david-king-uk-energy-bills-winter","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson told to tackle rising energy bills to avoid ‘extreme suffering’ this winter","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Boris Johnson should intervene urgently to start insulating British homes and introduce fiscal policies to reduce bills, as further delay will mean more people face “extreme suffering” this winter as energy bills soar, a former government chief scientific adviser has warned. David King said: “This could be the worst possible time for the leadership of this country to be simply sitting back. We’re waiting until what? We have an energy crisis right now and we need good leadership. We need alert leadership, leadership that is thinking about this – and that is missing.” Johnson, who has vowed to take no major decisions in his remaining time in office, attended a meeting of energy companies last week that had no conclusive outcome, and is now on his second holiday since resigning last month. King told the Guardian: “He is the prime minster. He wanted to stay on, so he must deliver as prime minister. There is no one else who can do that.” He called for higher taxes on energy companies, which he said were riding soaring energy prices since the Ukraine invasion for a bonanza, rather than investing or becoming more efficient. “They are taking bigger and bigger profits, as the prices are so high. That can only mean that they are tying their profits to the price, not the volume they are delivering,” he said. King – a former government chief scientist and UK climate envoy from 2000 to 2007, and as the government’s special representative on climate from 2013 to 2017 he was an adviser to prime ministers and foreign secretaries including Johnson – said valuable time had been wasted while the government failed to act. Waiting several more weeks for a new Conservative leader to take the reins of government would only add to the problem, he said. “There will be extreme suffering, at the lower-paid end of our society,” King warned. “We need fiscal policies that help people in the lower-paid bracket, that manage the costs of energy.” He said home insulation must also be a priority. “Insulating homes is a massive benefit to individuals and the country at large. Home insulation programmes have always been on the back burner for government for such a long time, though the benefits are enormous.” Even starting now would help people across the country with bills, he said, adding: “It’s never too late – if you start now, we could see good progress before winter.” Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, will announce new proposals on Monday for how to deal with the UK’s home insulation problem, while calling for the energy bill cap to be retained at its current £1.971, according to a report in the Observer on Sunday. King was scathing of the Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss’s emphasis on tax cuts to tackle with the cost of living crisis, though she has also hinted further support could not be ruled out. Rishi Sunak, the other leadership hopeful, proposed to cut VAT on energy bills and offer support to bill payers. “The big beneficiaries of low tax are people who can already afford higher energy prices,” he said. King also criticised the government for turning to increased production of oil and gas in the North Sea to lower energy bills, a move he said would do nothing to alleviate high gas prices and would lock in high greenhouse gas emissions for decades. “It’s completely the wrong timescale – it will take 10 or 20 years for new oil and gas projects [started now] to come online,” he warned. The Climate Crisis Advisory Group, an international coalition of scientists chaired by King, will publish a report this week arguing that governments do not need to return to fossil fuels in response to rising gas prices and energy shortages. International cooperation, expanding investment in renewable energy as well as pursuing energy efficiency through home insulation and in industries would be enough to limit the energy crisis, the report says. Interest rate rises should also be avoided as that would risk a damaging recession. “The remaining global carbon budget of around 400 gigatonnes of CO2 simply does not allow new fossil fuel expansion,” the report says. “A fossil-fuel rush is simply an unsustainable position and is a big mistake.” Critics sometimes argue that renewable energy is variable and intermittent – but King says overhauling energy grids and diversifying clean sources of power would solve this problem. “Offshore wind is very reliable, as the wind blows a very large percentage of the time from the North Sea,” he added. Hydropower in some areas could be used to store energy in dams for release when wind was low. Nuclear energy also has a part to play, in the UK and around the world, according to King. He said Germany should return to nuclear power, instead of reviving its coal-fired power stations. “I worry about the fact that the fossil fuel lobby has been amazingly powerful,” in the UK and other countries, King said. Ministers had delayed again a decision on a potential new coalmine in Cumbria, which King warned could be approved by the next prime minister on the “excuse” of energy security. In the US, important climate legislation was passed last week that will provide hundreds of billions of dollars in funding to key technologies, but owing to pressure from the fossil fuel lobby it still contains sops to gas and oil production. “The power of the fossil-fuel lobby has been such that the US has never been able to play a leading role in negotiations on the climate,” King said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/apr/20/first-thing-ukraine-repelling-intense-russian-offensive-in-east","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-20T09:38:51Z","webTitle":"Ukraine repelling intense Russian offensive in east | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/20/first-thing-ukraine-repelling-intense-russian-offensive-in-east","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/apr/20/first-thing-ukraine-repelling-intense-russian-offensive-in-east","fields":{"headline":"First Thing: Ukraine repelling intense Russian offensive in east","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning. Russia has increased the intensity of its eastern offensive but has been repeatedly repelled by Ukrainian forces, the UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said, as western governments pledged to send more artillery, and a new deadline for surrender in Mariupol approached. The MoD said late on Tuesday that shelling and strikes were increasing over the line of control in Donbas but that Russian forces continued to be hampered by logistical and technological problems. It also noted an “inability to stamp out resistance” in Mariupol as a sign of failure to achieve Moscow’s objectives. The Russian defence ministry has said it will offer the besieged port city a ceasefire today to allow Ukrainian defenders holed up in the Azovstal steelworks to lay down their arms. About 1,000 civilians are reportedly hiding in underground shelters beneath the steel plant in Mariupol, according to the city council. Most of the civilians are believed to be women with children and elderly people. How are Ukrainian troops faring in Mariupol? A commander for the Ukrainian marines in Mariupol said his forces were “maybe facing our last days, if not hours” and appealed for extraction, in a Facebook post published early this morning. What is happening with the diplomatic effort? Western nations are preparing to stage coordinated walkouts and other diplomatic snubs in protest at Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Washington. Janet Yellen, the US treasury secretary, is planning to avoid sessions attended by Russian officials. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 56 of the invasion. January 6 ‘was a coup organized by the president’, says Jamie Raskin Donald Trump attempted a coup on 6 January 2021 as he tried to salvage his doomed presidency, and that will be a central focus of forthcoming public hearings of the special House panel investigating events surrounding the insurrection at the US Capitol, the congressman Jamie Raskin has said. Raskin is a prominent Democrat on the committee and also led the House efforts when Trump was impeached for a historic second time, in 2021, accused of inciting the storming of the US Capitol by his extremist supporters who were trying to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. “This was a coup organized by the president against the vice-president and against the Congress in order to overturn the 2020 presidential election,” Raskin said in an interview with the Guardian, Reuters news agency and the Climate One radio program. Public hearings by the bipartisan special committee investigating January 6 and related actions by Trump and his White House team and other allies, chaired by the Mississippi Democrat Bennie Thompson, are expected next month. What else did Raskin say? “We’re going to tell the whole story of everything that happened. There was a violent insurrection and an attempted coup and we were saved by Mike Pence’s refusal to go along with that plan.” Texas advocates file new legal challenge to near total abortion ban Reproductive rights advocates in Texas have filed a new legal challenge to halt a near total abortion ban that has been in effect for more than half a year. Senate bill 8 bars abortion once embryonic cardiac activity is detected – typically as early as six week of pregnancy, which is before most people are aware they are pregnant – and offers no exception for rape or incest. The lawsuit, filed yesterday, asks a federal court to rule the extreme law unconstitutional. It cites public threats and legal action from anti-abortion activists against Texas abortion funds, groups that have been instrumental in helping patients travel out of state for care, arguing that this conduct has chilled their first amendment rights. “Plaintiffs urgently need this court to stop Texas’s brazen defiance of the rule of law, uphold the federal constitutional rights of pregnant Texans, and restore the ability of abortion funds and their donors, employees and volunteers to fully serve Texas abortion patients,” the federal court filing reads. Wendy Davis, a former Texas senator who famously led an 11-hour filibuster against an anti-abortion bill in 2013, said: “We are asking the courts today to stop the unconstitutional harassment of abortion funds by confirming SB 8 cannot be used to silence donors with bogus threats.” In other news … Prince Harry has said the Queen was “on great form” during their recent meeting, and he wanted to make sure she had “the right people around her”. Speaking to NBC about his meeting with the monarch, Harry said: “Being with her it was great, it was just so nice to see her, she’s on great form.” In a 59-page opinion on Monday, the US district judge Kathryn Mizelle of Tampa, Florida, overturned the federal requirement that people wear masks on planes and public transportation. She has become an instant heroine of the Republican right hailed for “courage” and “common sense”. The Fantastic Beasts star Ezra Miller has been arrested on suspicion of assault in Hawaii. Miller already faces charges of harassment and disorderly conduct after an incident last month at a karaoke bar on the island. A growing number of cities and states have restricted the information that local law enforcement departments can exchange with immigration authorities. But new documents reveal that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has tapped private technology companies to skirt such sanctuary policies. Netflix lost subscribers for the first time in 10 years at the start of the year and said it expects to lose even more in the spring, sending its share price crashing again yesterday. The streaming giant’s share price initially fell close to 20% on news that it had lost 200,000 subscribers globally during the first quarter. Stat of the day: most workers at large retail and food firms get less than $15 an hour – study Some of the largest, most profitable companies in retail and food services are still paying most of their workers less than $15 an hour, and many staff still make less than $10 an hour, according to a company wage tracker developed by the Economic Policy Institute and the Shift Project. According to a 2021 report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a worker needs to make at least $20.40 an hour to afford the rent of the average one-bedroom apartment in the US.

Surovikin’s statements on Tuesday came amid repeated military setbacks for Russian forces prompting Moscow’s dependence on Iran, which is sending missiles and drones. On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that military advisers from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were on Ukrainian soil, at a Russian military base in occupied Crimea. The Iranians were reported to have been deployed to help Russian troops deal with problems with the Tehran-supplied fleet of Shahed-136 drones, rebranded as Geran-2 by the attackers. Russian forces have been trying to hold off a fierce Ukrainian counter-assault in Kherson, a region in the south of Ukraine that Moscow claimed to have annexed last month after staging a sham referendum. Surovikin admitted that the situation in Kherson was “not easy”. “Further actions and plans regarding the city of Kherson will depend on the developing military-tactical situation, which is not easy. We will act consciously, in a timely manner, without ruling out difficult decisions,” he added. The comments appeared to mark a rare acknowledgment of the difficulties facing Russian forces. But it was not immediately clear whether Surovikin, the ruthless general now in charge of the war, was hinting at a looming Russian withdrawal from Kherson or a fresh round of airstrikes. Kherson, which lies near the mouth of the Dnipro on the west bank, was one of the first cities to fall to Russia after the invasion on 24 February and is a crucial strategic and symbolic target for Ukraine’s government. Gruelling fighting has been reported in the region since the start of Ukraine’s counter-offensive at the end of the summer, with both sides suffering steep casualties. The Ukrainian army has sought to pinch off Russian supply lines to Kherson by destroying the two main road bridges across the Dnipro. Kyiv has recently introduced a news blackout in the south of the country, leading to speculations that it was preparing a new major offensive on Kherson. “When the Ukrainians have a news blackout it means something is going on. They have always done this before when there is a big offensive push on,” Michael Clarke, a former director general of the Royal United Services Institute, told Sky News. “I am guessing in the next 48-72 hours they might tell us what is happening,” he added. Shortly after Surovikin’s statements, the Russian-installed head of Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, said in a video address that people in four towns in the Kherson region were being moved, in anticipation of a “large-scale offensive”. Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-installed deputy administrator of the Kherson region, echoed the message on Telegram late on Tuesday. “The battle for Kherson will begin in the very near future. The civilian population is advised, if possible, to leave the area of the upcoming fierce hostilities,” he said. Since Surovikin’s appointment on 8 October, Moscow has unleashed a barrage of cruise missiles and “kamikaze” drones targeting Ukrainian critical infrastructure as well as the civilian population. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said that Moscow’s use of Iranian-made drones was a symbol of the Kremlin’s “military and political bankruptcy”. “The very fact of Russia’s appeal to Iran for such assistance is the Kremlin’s recognition of its military and political bankruptcy,” Zelenskiy said in his daily address on Tuesday. “For decades, they spent billions of dollars on their own military industrial complex. And in the end, they bowed down to Tehran in order to secure quite simple drones and missiles.” But, Zelenskiy added, “strategically, it will not help them anyway. It only further proves to the world that Russia is on the path of defeat and is trying to draw someone else into its accomplices in terror.” The bombing is often inaccurate and civilians have been killed in residential buildings in Kyiv and other big cities. But enough have got through to cause problems for a power grid already short of generation after the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was shut down. Nearly a third of Ukraine’s power stations have been destroyed by Russian attacks since Monday last week – prompting Nato’s secretary general to announce that new counter-drone defences would be delivered within days. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the presidential office, said energy infrastructure and power supply were targeted overnight in an eastern district of Kyiv, where two people were killed, and in the cities of Dnipro and Zhytomyr. “The situation is critical now across the country because our regions are dependent on one another … it’s necessary for the whole country to prepare for electricity, water and heating outages,” Tymoshenko told Ukrainian television. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, said member countries would “step up” and deliver more air defences to help stabilise the situation. “Nato will in the coming days deliver counter-drone systems to counter the specific threat of drones, including those from Iran,” he said. Although there are signs that Moscow is running short on guided missiles, it has acquired up to 2,400 Iranian drones, according to Ukraine, and is using them as cheaper substitutes to hit the energy targets and strike fear into civilians. Iran denies supplying the drones to Russia, while the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he did not have any information about their origin. “Russian equipment with Russian names is being used,” Peskov said. Ukraine, experts and western governments believe the Gerans are rebranded Shahed drones, identifiable by their distinctive delta wing shape and from an examination of fragments recovered from the ground. A western official, speaking on condition of anonymity in a briefing on Tuesday, said they believed Russia was “pursuing a deliberate strategy of attempting to destroy Ukraine’s electricity network”. Reuters reported that Iran had promised to provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles, in addition to more drones, citing two senior Iranian officials and two Iranian diplomats. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, and the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, flew to Washington on Tuesday to discuss how to respond to Iran’s intervention, as officials briefed that a new air defence package for Ukraine was being prepared. Last week Germany delivered the first of four Iris-T air defence systems it had promised to supply Ukraine, but the US has been wary of strengthening Ukraine’s air force and defences for fear it would be seen as an escalation. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the US House of Representatives, warned on Tuesday that Congress would not “write a blank cheque to Ukraine” if his party wins next month’s midterm elections. Hours later, however, another senior Republican, Michael McCaul, said that he thought that the Ukrainians should “get what they need” – including longer-range missiles than those the Biden administration has so far been prepared to supply. Analysts say the mixed messages reflect an internal debate between traditional national security conservatives and the Trumpist wing of the party, where pro-Russian sentiment is much stronger."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/30/russia-ukraine-war-live-fresh-missile-strikes-on-zaporizhzhia-region-zelenskiy-says-russians-planning-something-in-the-south","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-30T18:45:17Z","webTitle":"Blast at Ukraine embassy in Madrid injures staff member; UK imposes fresh sanctions – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/30/russia-ukraine-war-live-fresh-missile-strikes-on-zaporizhzhia-region-zelenskiy-says-russians-planning-something-in-the-south","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/30/russia-ukraine-war-live-fresh-missile-strikes-on-zaporizhzhia-region-zelenskiy-says-russians-planning-something-in-the-south","fields":{"headline":"Blast at Ukraine embassy in Madrid injures staff member; UK imposes fresh sanctions – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is 8.45pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s top headlines: A security officer at Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid was injured when he opened a letter bomb addressed to the ambassador on Wednesday, and Kyiv ordered a bolstering of security at all its representative offices abroad. The security officer suffered light injuries and went under his own steam to hospital for treatment, Spanish government official Mercedes Gonzalez told broadcaster Telemadrid. In the wake of the incident, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba ordered all Kyiv’s embassies abroad to “urgently” strengthen security, a ministry spokesperson said. The European Commission president has proposed a special tribunal to investigate and prosecute Russia’s crime of aggression against Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen also wants to use the proceeds of Russian funds that have been frozen under western sanctions to aid Ukraine (see 8.19 GMT). Behind each proposal, questions remain. Ukraine needs the US made Patriot missile defence systems to protect its civilian infrastructure, under heavy attack by Russia, foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said, adding he would be working with the German government on this issue. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato on Tuesday against providing Ukraine with Patriot systems, Reuters reported. The UK has announced a fresh round of sanctions against 22 Russians, including those the Foreign Office says were involved in enlisting criminals to fight in Ukraine. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said on Wednesday his department would target a new set of officials, including Denis Manturov, the deputy prime minister, who is responsible for troop equipment supplies. Ukraine’s state emergency service has said nine people have been killed in fires in the past 24 hours after breaking safety rules in an attempt to heat their homes after Russian attacks on power facilities. The number of fires had risen, it said, with Ukrainians increasingly resorting to using emergency generators, candles and gas cylinders in their homes because of power outages, Reuters reported. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has arrived in Kyiv for a three-day visit to show solidarity with the people and churches of Ukraine. Welby will meet leaders of Ukraine’s churches, refugees and internally displaced people. The EU will try to set up a court, backed by the UN, to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine, according to the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen. In a video statement, she said: “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought death, devastation and unspeakable suffering. We all remember the horrors of Bucha. It is estimated that more than 20,000 civilians and more than 100,000 Ukrainian military officers have been killed so far.” The head of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, discussed nuclear issues and Ukraine in a meeting this month with the CIA director, William Burns, the RIA news agency reported. Elizabeth Rood, the charge d’affaires at the US embassy in Moscow, previously told RIA that Burns “did not negotiate anything and he did not discuss a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine”. Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) officials found weapons and Russian cash on Wednesday after searching properties in around Kyiv linked to a pro-Russian former politician, the agency said. In a statement, the SBU said its searches of homes and offices belonging to Yevhen Murayev, who it said was “hiding from justice abroad”, and his associates were part of a criminal investigation into treason. Moscow has promoted the chief engineer of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Yuriy Chernichuk, to become its head, according to Russia’s nuclear agency Rosenergoatom. The position has been vacant since October, when Kyiv says the plant’s boss Ihor Murashov was abducted by Russian authorities. One person was killed and another wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Wednesday, the regional governor said. Yaroslav Yanushevych wrote on the Telegram messaging app that several residential buildings and medical facilities had been damaged in the city, which was liberated this month after months of Russian occupation. Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said on Telegram early on Wednesday morning that Russian strikes in the region overnight hit a gas distribution point, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no injuries or casualties. Ukraine claims to have killed another 500 Russian soldiers in the last 24 hours, bringing the total who have died in combat since 24 February to about 88,880. The general staff of the armed forces said it had taken out three more tanks and six armoured personnel carriers. Ukrainian forces have downed three Russian reconnaissance drones in the last 24 hours, according to its armed forces. In an early morning bulletin from Ukraine, the spokesperson for the general staff of the armed forces, Alexander Štupun, said Ukraine had been subjected to a number of missile attacks from planes and artillery, including on Kivsharivka in Kharkiv and Sloviansk in Donetsk. A teenager was killed in Russian shelling of a hospital in the northern Ukrainian region of Sumy, a presidential aide has said. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian forces had pounded the region with artillery and mortar bombs over the past 24 hours. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he did not believe Russian president Vladimir Putin will use nuclear weapons. He made the comment while speaking by video link at the New York Times ‘DealBook’ summit in New York City. It comes as Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said it was vital to avoid any kind of military confrontation between nuclear powers, even if it only involved conventional weapons, the TASS news agency reported. The city council in the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa has voted to remove and relocate a monument to Empress Catherine the Great of Russia that has been daubed with red paint at least twice. The statue to the city’s founder, which towers over a central square, has been vandalised repeatedly since the invasion of Ukraine that has prompted many Ukrainians to reject their country’s historical ties to Moscow, Reuters reported. Five Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian forces on Tuesday, according to a senior government official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, posted on Telegram that the five were killed in Donetsk, with 15 people also injured. The Donetsk region has continued to face shelling by Russian troops. Others were wounded in the Kharkiv, Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Russia’s defence minister has said it will focus on nuclear arms infrastructure in 2023, including facilities to accommodate new missile systems. Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the board of the department on Wednesday that it would be a priority for Russia next year. “When preparing the list of major construction facilities for 2023, special attention will be paid to construction in the interests of the strategic nuclear forces,” Shoigu was quoted by RIA news agency as saying. The head of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, Andriy Yermak, spoke to Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday morning. They discussed the US’s support for the Grain from Ukraine scheme, which is running to get grain out of the port of Odesa, and its support for Ukraine over the winter months. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has highlighted Russia’s new foreign agents act in its daily update, which it says will be used to crack down on critics and dissidents. Vladimir Putin has changed the 2012 law so that personal details including the address of designated “foreign agents” can be published, meaning they could become targets of harassment. The change will come into force on Thursday. The European Commission gave an update on Wednesday on its plans to freeze and confiscate Russian assets. Von der Leyen said: “We have blocked €300bn of the Russian Central Bank reserves and we have frozen €19bn of Russian oligarchs’ money. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the live blog for today. Thanks following along. I’ll be back in the morning with more up-to-the-minute news of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) officials found weapons and Russian cash on Wednesday after searching properties in around Kyiv linked to a pro-Russian former politician, the agency said. In a statement, the SBU said its searches of homes and offices belonging to Yevhen Murayev, who it said was “hiding from justice abroad”, and his associates were part of a criminal investigation into treason. Murayev’s political party and a television channel under his control were seen as vehicles for Kremlin interests in Ukraine before Moscow’s invasion, Reuters reported. The party, Nashi, was banned after Russian forces swept into Ukraine. He had promoted views that aligned with Russian narratives on Ukraine, including that the 2014 Maidan protests in Kyiv were a western-backed coup and the Kremlin-fuelled war in eastern Ukraine that followed was an internal conflict. Weeks before Russia’s full-scale attack on Ukraine this year, Britain’s foreign ministry said Russia was considering installing Murayev to lead a new puppet government, a claim denied both by him and by Moscow. The SBU said an independent analysis of Murayev’s public statements “testify to the presence in his actions of signs” of treason. It said the materials seized in Wednesday’s searches would be examined further. Ukraine’s state emergency service has said nine people have been killed in fires in the past 24 hours after breaking safety rules in an attempt to heat their homes after Russian attacks on power facilities. The number of fires had risen, it said, with Ukrainians increasingly resorting to using emergency generators, candles and gas cylinders in their homes because of power outages, Reuters reported. “Only in the last day there were 131 fires in Ukraine, 106 of them in the residential sector. Nine people died, eight were injured,” the emergency service said. “Generators on balconies, gas cylinders in apartments, lit candles ... Due to violations of fire safety rules, the use of uncertified products for heating and cooking, incidents of fires and explosions in high-rise and private buildings have become more frequent.” The service urged Ukrainians to take more care in their homes and to explain fire risks to children. The UK has announced a fresh round of sanctions against 22 Russians, including those the Foreign Office says were involved in enlisting criminals to fight in Ukraine. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said on Wednesday his department would target a new set of officials, including Denis Manturov, the deputy prime minister, who is responsible for troop equipment supplies. The Russian officials join more than 1,000 others, including 120 the UK has sanctioned since the invasion of Ukraine in February, including Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian prime minister, and Roman Abramovich, the former owner of Chelsea FC. Cleverly said: “The Russian regime’s decision to partially mobilise Russian citizens was a desperate attempt to overwhelm the valiant Ukrainians defending their territory. It has failed. “Today we have sanctioned individuals who have enforced this conscription, sending thousands of Russian citizens to fight in Putin’s illegal and abhorrent war. “The UK will continue to use both sanctions and military aid to support Ukraine in the defence of their independence.” Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has arrived in Kyiv for a three-day visit to show solidarity with the people and churches of Ukraine. Welby will meet leaders of Ukraine’s churches, refugees and internally displaced people. Arriving in Kyiv on Wednesday, Welby said: “The people of Ukraine have shown extraordinary courage in the face of Russia’s illegal, unjust and brutal invasion. This visit is about showing solidarity with them as they face a profoundly difficult winter. “I look forward to meeting with church leaders and local Christians in Kyiv, and learning how we can continue to support them amid the ongoing devastation, loss and destruction of this war. “I urge Christians in the Church of England and around the world to keep praying for the people of Ukraine in this Advent season – along with all people caught up in conflicts around the world – and offering our solidarity and support in every way we can.” The president of the European Commission appears to have caused some confusion on Wednesday in her speech on Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen said an estimated 100,000 Ukrainian military personnel had died as well as 20,000 civilians. Ukraine has been tight-lipped about its wartime military losses, saying figures would give Russia an advantage. The commission later apologised, saying the speech was inaccurate and the estimate had included injured as well as dead. The sentence was then removed from the transcript on the commission’s website and edited from the video of her speech. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s general staff told Ukrainian journalists that it would not comment on the figure quoted but vowed that Russia would face punishment for its actions in Ukraine. Von der Leyen also said the EU would set up a special tribunal for the “crime of aggression” – in other words Russia’s military transgressing Ukraine’s borders. The statement appears to have caught Ukraine off guard. Oleh Gavrysh, a spokesperson of Andriy Smyrnov, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, who is leading the effort to establish a tribunal, said they were “exploring” what Von der Leyen had said and needed to confirm if this tribunal would include removing the immunity of key Russian leaders, including the Russian president Vladimir Putin. If it did, said Gavrysh, then Ukraine would accept her proposal. A special tribunal for the crime of aggression has been the subject of a months-long campaign by Kyiv. It would lead to Russia’s top figures prosecuted, including Putin and the foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, and would require little investigation as the fact that the crime of aggression was committed was something overwhelmingly accepted by the UN general assembly. But states will need to back the tribunal individually as they will be responsible for enforcing any sentencing of Russia’s leaders as international criminals (even if in absentia). The European Commission president has proposed a special tribunal to investigate and prosecute Russia’s crime of aggression against Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen also wants to use the proceeds of Russian funds that have been frozen under western sanctions to aid Ukraine (see 8.19 GMT). Behind each proposal, questions remain. On the special tribunal, she said: … while continuing to support the international criminal court, we are proposing to set up a specialised court, backed by the United Nations, to investigate and prosecute Russia’s crime of aggression. The EU wants a specialised court, because Russia has not signed the ICC treaty, leaving the court without jurisdiction over “crimes of aggression”. The ICC can only judge specific war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine. EU officials are certain that Russia, a permanent member of the UN security council, will block any move to create a specialised court. Nevertheless they intend to table a resolution to the security council and when it is shot down, seek support from the general assembly of all UN members. One EU official said they expected “good enough numbers” to support the proposal. Uncertainties also surround the proposed money for Ukraine. Von der Leyen said: We have blocked €300bn of the Russian Central Bank reserves and we have frozen €19bn of Russian oligarchs’ money. In the short term, we could create, with our partners, a structure to manage these funds and invest them. We would then use the proceeds for Ukraine. But officials do not yet know much the proceeds could be worth. For legal reasons they believe they can use only the proceeds generated from managing the assets to aid Ukraine, rather than the assets themselves. Eventually the funds would have to be returned to their owners, although the commission proposes to offset the Russian central bank’s €300bn against any future reparations to Ukraine, made as the result of a peace agreement. But buy-in from other western allies is not yet clear. Both ideas will be presented to a G7 taskforce next month. Some more on that blast at the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid, Spain, now from the Reuters news agency. It reports: A security officer at Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid was injured when he opened a letter bomb addressed to the ambassador on Wednesday, and Kyiv ordered a bolstering of security at all its representative offices abroad. The security officer suffered light injuries and went under his own steam to hospital for treatment, Spanish government official Mercedes Gonzalez told broadcaster Telemadrid. In the wake of the incident, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba ordered all Kyiv’s embassies abroad to “urgently” strengthen security, a ministry spokesperson said. The minister also urged Spain to “take urgent measures to investigate the attack”, the spokesperson added. The perpetrators, he added, “will not succeed in intimidating Ukrainian diplomats or stopping their daily work on strengthening Ukraine and countering Russian aggression”. Russia invaded Ukraine nine months ago. The letter, which arrived by ordinary mail and was not scanned, caused “a very small wound on the ring finger of the right hand” of the employee after he opened it in the garden of the embassy, Gonzalez said. It was addressed to ambassador Serhii Pohoreltsev, she said. Detectives were probing the incident, aided by forensic and intelligence investigators, Spanish police said. Spain’s High Court will lead the investigation. An officer at the embassy declined to comment. Correos, the Spanish state-run postal company, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the origin of the letter. The residential area surrounding the embassy in northwestern Madrid was cordoned off and a bomb disposal unit was deployed to the scene. Reuters footage showed scores of police officers, armed with assault rifles and blocking roads with vans, in the neighbourhood around the embassy. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he did not believe Russian president Vladimir Putin will use nuclear weapons. He made the comment while speaking by video link at the New York Times ‘DealBook’ summit in New York city. It comes as Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said it was vital to avoid any kind of military confrontation between nuclear powers, even if it only involved conventional weapons, the TASS news agency reported. Lavrov also said the West was pushing Ukraine to continue fighting against Russia. “It is necessary to avoid any military clash between nuclear powers, even with the use of conventional weapons. The escalation may become uncontrollable,” TASS quoted Lavrov as saying. Putin has issued a series of thinly veiled nuclear threats during the course of the war in Ukraine, but several top officials have repeatedly denied Moscow plans to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine and have accused the West of upping the nuclear ante. The UK has imposed sanctions on another 22 Russians who it says have been behind the further mobilisation of troops in Ukraine. Among them is the Russian deputy prime minister Denis Manturov, who oversees the Russian weapons industry and is responsible for arming soldiers. Arkady Gostev, the director of the Russian prison service, is also on the list because of his support for the Wagner Group’s recruitment of inmates for the war effort. A total of 10 governors and regional heads have been hit with sanctions, including those in charge of Dagestan, Ingushetia and Kalmykia, from where a number of conscripts have been called up. Another 29 regional governors were already placed under sanctions in July for providing financial support to Russian proxy administrations in Ukraine. Others include Ella Pamfilova and Andrey Burov, who helped organised referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine, which Vladimir Putin used as a basis to annex the regions in September. Those under sanctions are subject to asset freezes, travel bans and transport sanctions. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said: The Russian regime’s decision to partially mobilise Russian citizens was a desperate attempt to overwhelm the valiant Ukrainians defending their territory. It has failed. Today we have sanctioned individuals who have enforced this conscription, sending thousands of Russian citizens to fight in Putin’s illegal and abhorrent war. The UK will continue to use both sanctions and military aid to support Ukraine in the defence of their independence. The full list of those hit with sanctions by the British government can be found here. Nine people have died in fires in Ukraine over the last 24 hours, according to the authorities, as Russian attacks on power infrastructure has caused people to resort to using emergency generators and gas cylinders. Ukraine’s state emergency services said there had been more than 130 fires in the last day. It said eight people had been injured. The blackouts have led to a surge in accidents “due to the violation of fire safety rules”, the service said. The number of fires and explosions in high-rise and private houses has increased, Agency France-Presse reports. In a press conference on Wednesday, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, described Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure as “barbaric”. “Over the past several weeks, Russia has bombed out more than a third of Ukraine’s energy system, plunging millions in the cold,” Blinken said after a meeting with Nato counterparts in Bucharest. As we are less than three weeks from Christmas, the sight of trees being erected in city squares around the world is commonplace. It will be no different in Kyiv despite the ongoing conflict. The city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said a 12-metre artificial tree would go up as a “symbolic Christmas tree of indomitability”. The tree in Sofia Square will be decorated with “energy-saving” garlands that will be powered by a generator, he said in a Telegram post. After Christmas, the generator will be donated to the military. There will also be phone charging points set up nearby. Atop the festive structure will be Ukraine’s coat of arms, and around its base will be flags of countries that have helped Ukraine. Germany has said it will have trained 5,000 Ukrainian soldiers by the summer of 2023. The defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, also told the Berlin security conference that Germany understood the importance of supplying weapons to Ukraine, and working with others to support the government in Kyiv. A teenager was killed in Russian shelling of a hospital in the northern Ukrainian region of Sumy, a presidential aide has said. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian forces had pounded the region with artillery and mortar bombs over the past 24 hours. Russian forces pulled back from northern Ukraine weeks after its invasion but have continued shelling some areas, Ukrainian officials have said. Spanish police said an employee at the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid was injured on Wednesday in an explosion that occurred while he was handling a letter. The staff member received light injuries and went to hospital under his own steam, police said. Detectives are investigating the incident, aided by forensic and intelligence investigators. Ukraine’s embassy to Spain was not immediately reachable, Reuters reported. The area surrounding the embassy has been cordoned off, the state broadcaster TVE reported. Vladimir Putin has focused his “fire and ire” on Ukraine’s civilian population, bombing more than a third of Ukraine’s energy system – water and electricity supply – in a strategy that will not work, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Wednesday. “These are President Putin’s new targets. He’s hitting them hard,” Blinken said after a Nato meeting in Bucharest. “His strategy has not, and will not, work.” Ukraine needs the US made Patriot missile defence systems to protect its civilian infrastructure, under heavy attack by Russia, foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said, adding he would be working with the German government on this issue. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato on Tuesday against providing Ukraine with Patriot systems, Reuters reported. Kuleba also said Ukraine would eventually become a member of Nato, saying that didn’t mean nothing could be done now in that respect. “The discussions on Ukraine’s Nato application should begin,” he said during a press conference after a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Bucharest. The city council in the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa has voted to remove and relocate a monument to Empress Catherine the Great of Russia that has been daubed with red paint at least twice. The statue to the city’s founder, which towers over a central square, has been vandalised repeatedly since the invasion of Ukraine that has prompted many Ukrainians to reject their country’s historical ties to Moscow, Reuters reported. The city council announced the decision to remove the statue on its website on Wednesday. Local lawmakers had also voted to remove and relocate a monument to an 18th-century Russian general, Alexander Suvorov. A slim majority of Odesa residents had already voted – in an online poll organised by city authorities – to remove the statue to Catherine the Great, who was empress of Russia from 1762 to 1796. Several petitions had also been submitted to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy calling for the statue to be removed, but only local authorities were legally empowered to make the decision. One person was killed and another wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Wednesday, the regional governor said. Yaroslav Yanushevych wrote on the Telegram messaging app that several residential buildings and medical facilities had been damaged in the city, which was liberated this month after months of Russian occupation. The head of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, discussed nuclear issues and Ukraine in a meeting this month with the CIA director, William Burns, the RIA news agency reported. Elizabeth Rood, the charge d’affaires at the US embassy in Moscow, previously told RIA that Burns “did not negotiate anything and he did not discuss a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine”. Alexei Kudrin has become the latest high-profile Russian government official to leave their post since the invasion. Kudrin, who was head of the audit committee and previously served as finance minister and deputy prime minister, is expected to take up a role at a Russian tech firm Yandex. Yandex has announced a review of its governance. The time in Kyiv is 1.20pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s top stories so far: The EU will try to set up a court, backed by the UN, to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine, according to the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen. In a video statement, she said: “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought death, devastation and unspeakable suffering. We all remember the horrors of Bucha. It is estimated that more than 20,000 civilians and more than 100,000 Ukrainian military officers have been killed so far.” Moscow has promoted the chief engineer of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Yuriy Chernichuk, to become its head, according to Russia’s nuclear agency Rosenergoatom. The position has been vacant since October, when Kyiv says the plant’s boss Ihor Murashov was abducted by Russian authorities. Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said on Telegram early on Wednesday morning that Russian strikes in the region overnight hit a gas distribution point, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no injuries or casualties. Ukraine claims to have killed another 500 Russian soldiers in the last 24 hours, bringing the total who have died in combat since 24 February to about 88,880. The general staff of the armed forces said it had taken out three more tanks and six armoured personnel carriers. Ukrainian forces have downed three Russian reconnaissance drones in the last 24 hours, according to its armed forces. In an early morning bulletin from Ukraine, the spokesperson for the general staff of the armed forces, Alexander Štupun, said Ukraine had been subjected to a number of missile attacks from planes and artillery, including on Kivsharivka in Kharkiv and Sloviansk in Donetsk. Five Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian forces on Tuesday, according to a senior government official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, posted on Telegram that the five were killed in Donetsk, with 15 people also injured. The Donetsk region has continued to face shelling by Russian troops. Others were wounded in the Kharkiv, Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Russia’s defence minister has said it will focus on nuclear arms infrastructure in 2023, including facilities to accommodate new missile systems. Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the board of the department on Wednesday that it would be a priority for Russia next year. “When preparing the list of major construction facilities for 2023, special attention will be paid to construction in the interests of the strategic nuclear forces,” Shoigu was quoted by RIA news agency as saying. The head of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, Andriy Yermak, spoke to Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday morning. They discussed the US’s support for the Grain from Ukraine scheme, which is running to get grain out of the port of Odesa, and its support for Ukraine over the winter months. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has highlighted Russia’s new foreign agents act in its daily update, which it says will be used to crack down on critics and dissidents. Vladimir Putin has changed the 2012 law so that personal details including the address of designated “foreign agents” can be published, meaning they could become targets of harassment. The change will come into force on Thursday. The European Commission gave an update on Wednesday on its plans to freeze and confiscate Russian assets. Von der Leyen said: “We have blocked €300bn of the Russian Central Bank reserves and we have frozen €19bn of Russian oligarchs’ money.” Nato doubled down on Tuesday on its commitment to one day include Ukraine, a pledge that some officials and analysts believe helped prompt Russia’s invasion this year. The world’s largest security alliance also pledged to send more aid to Ukrainian forces locked in battle with Russian troops. Ukraine’s supplies of spare parts for its battered electricity grid are running out amid sustained Russian bombing. European companies are being asked to urgently donate surplus kit to help the country get through the winter. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato against providing Ukraine with Patriot missile defence systems and called the alliance a “criminal entity”. “If, as [Nato secretary general Jens] Stoltenberg hinted, Nato were to supply the Ukrainian fanatics with Patriot systems along with Nato personnel, they would immediately become a legitimate target of our armed forces,” Medvedev wrote on Telegram. Hello, I’m Tom Ambrose, taking over from my colleague Harry Taylor. Moscow has promoted the chief engineer of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Yuriy Chernichuk, to become its head, according to Russia’s nuclear agency Rosenergoatom. The position has been vacant since October, when Kyiv says the plant’s boss Ihor Murashov was abducted by Russian authorities. The nuclear power plant, Europe’s biggest and in the east of Ukraine, has been occupied by Russian forces since March. It has not been producing electricity since September but is still run by its Ukrainian staff to keep it safe. Moscow said in October it was putting the plant under control of Russia’s nuclear authorities, Reuters reports, a move Kyiv says is illegal. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear power operator Energoatom said in May that Russia had forbidden Chernichuk from leaving the city of Enerhodar, where the plant is based, holding him and other staff as “hostages”. The six-reactor plant has since come under repeated shelling, drawing condemnation from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has called for a safety zone around it, a proposal so far resisted by Moscow. Russia and Ukraine each blame the other for the shelling at the plant, located on a Russian-held bank of the Dnipro River across from Ukrainian-held territory. Kyiv also accuses Moscow of hiding military equipment at the plant, which Russia denies. Five Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian forces on Tuesday, according to a senior government official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, posted on Telegram that the five were all killed in Donetsk, with 15 people also injured. The Donetsk region has continued to face shelling by Russian troops. Others were wounded in the Kharkiv, Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Russia’s defence minister has said it will focus on nuclear arms infrastructure in 2023, including facilities to accommodate new missile systems. Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the board of the department on Wednesday that it would be a priority for Russia next year. “When preparing the list of major construction facilities for 2023, special attention will be paid to construction in the interests of the strategic nuclear forces,” Shoigu was quoted by RIA news agency as saying. On Monday, Russia postponed talks with the US on nuclear weapons, saying they would be rescheduled but not giving any reasons for the delay. The Start treaty will expire in 2026. Shiogu said 300,000 reservists, including volunteers, were trained in two months after Vladimir Putin’s partial mobilisation order was given, Russian news agency Tass reports. The defence minister said more than 100 training camps were used in Russia and Belarus. The head of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, Andriy Yermak, spoke to Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday morning. They discussed the US’s support for the Grain from Ukraine scheme, which is running to get grain out of the port of Odesa, and its support for Ukraine over the winter months. According to the Interfax news agency, a spokesperson said: “Yermak informed the interlocutor about the operational situation at the front, as well as about the possible steps Russia is preparing to continue terror against the civilian population of Ukraine. “The parties discussed providing support to our state to ensure the passage of the winter period.” The UK is to sign a new digital trade agreement with Ukraine that will give the country access to Britain’s financial services industry. Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, will sign the agreement with the UK’s trade secretary, Kemi Badenoch, on Wednesday. Officials say the deal – based on a similar agreement earlier this year between the UK and Singapore – will support digital commerce through the facilitation of cross-border data flows. Digital trade is considered to be particularly important in the current conflict with Russia, PA Media reports, with the fighting and damage to infrastructure making physical trade more difficult. The agreement also allows for greater cooperation between the UK and Ukraine on cybersecurity and emerging technologies. Badenoch said: “The landmark digital trade deal agreed today between our two countries paves the way for a new era of modern trade between us. This agreement will mean our businesses and governments can collaborate even more and ensure Ukrainians have access to essential goods and services [that] digital trade opens up.” The EU will try to set up a court, backed by the UN, to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine, according to the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen. In a video statement, she said: “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought death, devastation and unspeakable suffering. We all remember the horrors of Bucha. It is estimated that more than 20,000 civilians and more than 100,000 Ukrainian military officers have been killed so far. “Russia must pay for its horrific crimes, including for its crime of aggression against a sovereign state. This is why, while continuing to support the international criminal court, we are proposing to set up a specialised court backed by the United Nations to investigate and prosecute Russia’s crime of aggression. “We are ready to start working with the international community to get the broadest international support possible for this specialised court. “Russia must also pay financially for the devastation that it has caused. The damage suffered by Ukraine is estimated at €600bn. Russia and its oligarchs have to compensate Ukraine for its damage and for the costs for rebuilding the country.” She proposes that the EU could seize Russian money in Europe, invest it, and use it to finance the rebuilding (see 8.02am). “Russia’s horrific crimes will not go unpunished,” she said. Russia has denied targeting civilians and said it has not committed war crimes, despite evidence of a massacre in Bucha. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said more than 400 war crimes were committed in Kherson during the occupation of the city. The European Commission gave an update on Wednesday on its plans to freeze and confiscate Russian assets. “We have blocked €300bn of the Russian Central Bank reserves and we have frozen €19bn of Russian oligarchs’ money,” said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU’s executive. She said that in the short term the EU and its partners could manage the funds and invest them. The proceeds would go to Ukraine so that ultimately they would compensate for damage caused to the country, Reuters reports. “We will work on an international agreement with our partners to make this possible. And together, we can find legal ways to get to it,” she said. An interesting story here, as the BBC has been given details of calls made to a hotline set up for Russian soldiers to surrender. The “I Want to Live” scheme was started in September by Ukraine, and gives Russian troops a way to give themselves up to Ukrainian forces. It includes a hotline and a messaging app. Officials in Kyiv have told the BBC they have had 3,500 inquiries from personnel, some on the frontline and some in Russia before deployment, and their families. Svitlana, not her real name, is one of the call handlers who speaks to them. “First of all, we hear a voice, mainly male. It’s often part-desperate, part-frustrated, because they don’t fully understand how the hotline works, or whether it’s just a set up. “There’s also curiosity because many call not to surrender but to find out how they could if needed. It’s different every time.” Recordings provided to the broadcaster include soldiers asking what to do when Ukrainian troops arrive. “Do I drop to my knees, or what? What do I do, how do I surrender?” one asked. Another said: “I am from Moscow. I haven’t received a conscription ticket yet, but there were attempts to give it to me. Do you have any advice as to what I should do? I won’t kill Ukrainians. I would like to save my life.” Ukraine claims to have killed another 500 Russian soldiers in the last 24 hours, bringing the total who have died in combat since 24 February to about 88,880. The general staff of the armed forces said it had taken out three more tanks, and another six armoured personnel carriers. The casualty figures published by Ukraine are disputed by Russia, which says its death toll from the war is much lower. Ukrainian forces have downed three Russian reconnaissance drones in the last 24 hours, according to its armed forces. In an early morning bulletin from Ukraine, the spokesperson for the general staff of the armed forces, Alexander Štupun, said Ukraine had been subjected to a number of missile attacks from planes and artillery, including on Kivsharivka in Kharkiv and Sloviansk in Donetsk. Both are in Ukraine’s east. “The threat of missile strikes by Russian invaders on energy system facilities and critical infrastructure throughout Ukraine remains,” he continued. Štupun said attacks from Russian jets had caused fires in Kizomis, a small town on the outskirts of Kherson near the Dnipro River estuary. Artillery shelling continues on Kherson city itself, according to the update. He added that in response Ukrainian planes had launched 15 strikes on Russian positions and equipment, and two air attacks on anti-aircraft missile systems. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has highlighted Russia’s new foreign agents act in its daily update, which the MoD says will be used to crack down on critics and dissidents. Vladimir Putin has changed the existing 2012 law to mean that the personal details, including the address, of designated “foreign agents” can be published – meaning they could become targets of harassment. It will come into force on Thursday. Previously it was limited to people who the Kremlin alleged had received financial support from abroad. However, it will now extend to those the government perceives as under the “influence or pressure” of foreign actors. The MoD said: “The Kremlin is likely acting pre-emptively to prevent greater domestic dissent as the conflict remains unresolved and increasingly impacts Russians’ everyday lives.” In his late-night update, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wrote on Telegram: “Despite extremely big Russian losses, the occupiers are still trying to advance in the Donetsk region, gain a foothold in the Luhansk region, move in the Kharkiv region, they are planning something in the south. “But we are holding out and – most importantly – do not allow the enemy to fulfil their intentions.” Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said on Telegram early on Wednesday morning that Russian strikes in the region overnight hit a gas distribution point, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no injuries or casualties. “In one of the settlements of the Zaporizhzhia district, a gas distribution point was damaged as a result of a rocket (probably S-300) hit, resulting in a fire. It was quickly eliminated, but three streets remained without gas. Fortunately, people were not hurt,” he wrote. Hi, this is the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan. Oleksandr Starukh, the head of the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said on Telegram a short while ago that Russian strikes overnight hit a gas distribution point, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no injuries or casualties. In his late-night update, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wrote on Telegram: “Despite extremely big Russian losses, the occupiers are still trying to advance in the Donetsk region, gain a foothold in the Luhansk region, move in the Kharkiv region, they are planning something in the south. “But we are holding out and – most importantly – do not allow the enemy to fulfil their intentions.” Meanwhile, Nato leaders will meet for a second day of talks in Romania on Wednesday, after vowing more help for Ukraine to restore power and heat knocked out by strikes as Russia attacks on multiple fronts. Here are the other key recent developments: Nato doubled down on Tuesday on its commitment to one day include Ukraine, a pledge that some officials and analysts believe helped prompt Russia’s invasion this year. The world’s largest security alliance also pledged to send more aid to Ukrainian forces locked in battle with Russian troops. Ukraine’s supplies of spare parts for its battered electricity grid are running out amid sustained Russian bombing. European companies are being asked to urgently donate surplus kit to help the country get through the winter, after the latest step in Russian bombings targeting power plants and substations resulted in power cuts lasting 48 hours or more across the country. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato against providing Ukraine with Patriot missile defence systems and called the alliance a “criminal entity”. “If, as [Nato secretary general Jens] Stoltenberg hinted, Nato were to supply the Ukrainian fanatics with Patriot systems along with Nato personnel, they would immediately become a legitimate target of our armed forces,” Medvedev wrote on Telegram. Ukrainian forces struck a power plant in multiple attacks on Russia’s Kursk region on Tuesday, causing some electricity outages, the local governor said. “In total, there were about 11 launches. A power plant was hit,” Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region, said on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility and made no immediate comment. Ukraine’s state energy operator, Ukrenegro, has said it is still struggling to restore full power nearly a week after Russian strikes damaged energy facilities across the country. The power deficit was running at 30% as of 11am local time on Tuesday, Ukrenegro said in a statement, a slight rise from the previous day. The jailed Belarusian senior opposition leader Maria Kolesnikava has been taken to intensive care in the city of Gomel, according to reports. Belarusian opposition politician Viktor Babariko posted to Telegram that Kolesnikova, one of the most prominent opponents of President Alexander Lukashenko, was taken to hospital on Monday for unknown reasons. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said Moscow had been left with “no other choice” but to cancel nuclear weapons talks with the US, state-run news agencies reported. He said it was unlikely any meeting would take place this year. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, accused the US of “the highest level of toxicity and hostility” and of “a pathological desire to harm our country”. China’s president, Xi Jinping, has said Beijing is ready to “forge a closer partnership” with Moscow to “maintain international energy security”. “China is willing to work with Russia to forge a closer energy partnership, promote clean and green energy development and jointly maintain international energy security and the stability of industry supply chains,” Xi was cited by state-owned broadcaster CCTV as writing. Ukraine has detained a deputy head of newly liberated Kherson’s city council on suspicion of aiding and abetting Russian occupation forces, Ukraine’s state prosecutor has said. The official, who was not named, cooperated with the occupation authorities and helped with the functioning of public services under the Russians, according to the prosecutor. European Union countries are inching towards a deal this week on a price cap on Russian oil, a way to adjust the cap in future, and on linking it to a package of new sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, diplomats said on Tuesday. The deadline for a deal is 5 December because that is when the EU’s own full embargo on purchases of Russian seaborne oil, agreed at the end of May, kicks in. The G7 group has agreed to set up a network to coordinate investigations into war crimes, as part of a push to prosecute suspected atrocities in Ukraine. In a joint declaration, G7 justice ministers said member countries would ensure there is a central national contact point in each state for the prosecution of international crimes. Pope Francis has sparked fury in Russia over an interview in which he suggested that Chechen and Buryat members of its armed forces showed more cruelty in Ukraine than ethnic Russian soldiers. He said soldiers from Buryatia, where Buddhism is a major religion, and the Muslim-majority Chechnya republic, were “the cruellest” while fighting in Ukraine. Germany’s justice minister, Marco Buschmann, said his country contributed to the outbreak of war by “adhering” to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline despite Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Buschmann also said Russian missile strikes on energy infrastructure constituted a “terrible war crime”, adding that he was “certain that at the end, we will see war crimes cases at the international criminal court against senior Russian leadership too”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/30/morning-mail-tax-cuts-to-turbocharge-inequality-parental-leave-call-sea-level-rise-locked-in","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-29T20:50:13Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: tax cuts to ‘turbocharge inequality’, parental leave call, sea level rise locked in","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/30/morning-mail-tax-cuts-to-turbocharge-inequality-parental-leave-call-sea-level-rise-locked-in","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/30/morning-mail-tax-cuts-to-turbocharge-inequality-parental-leave-call-sea-level-rise-locked-in","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: tax cuts to ‘turbocharge inequality’, parental leave call, sea level rise locked in","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning. Labor is under renewed pressure to rethink a $243bn tax cuts plan as new analysis reveals startling imbalances in who will benefit. A massive expansion of paid parental leave could add billions to the economy, a new report suggests. And scientists say a significant sea level rise from the melting of the Greenland ice cap is now inevitable. The richest 1% of Australians will get as much benefit from the stage three tax cuts as the poorest 65% combined, new parliamentary budget office analysis has projected, putting more pressure on the Albanese government to rethink its commitment to the controversial $243bn plan. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, again called for the tax cuts – which were legislated in 2019 with Labor support – to be discussed at this week’s jobs and skills summit. He warned they would “turbocharge” inequality. Unions have called for a massive expansion of paid parental leave by extending it to 52 weeks, paying parents their actual wage and including superannuation, with unions saying the move could add billions to the economy. A report released by the Australian Council of Trade Unions says halving the gap in women’s pay and participation would boost the economy by $111bn. Unions also want Labor’s childcare subsidies brought forward by six months and an expansion in gender pay gap reporting. Major sea-level rise from the melting of the Greenland ice cap is now inevitable, scientists have found, even if the fossil fuel burning that is driving the climate crisis were to end overnight. The research shows the global heating to date will cause an absolute minimum sea-level rise of 27cm (10.6in) from Greenland alone as 110tn tonnes of ice melt. With continued carbon emissions, the melting of other ice caps and thermal expansion of the ocean, a multi-metre sea-level rise appears likely.

Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson from Ukraine’s foreign ministry, said the packages were simultaneously sent from one European country, which he could not disclose while the investigation was ongoing. Ukrainian authorities in Kherson have urged people on the east of the Dnieper River to evacuate. The governor, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said that authorities would help people to evacuate during the daytime of Saturday to Monday, according to the Kyiv Independent. The west should consider how to address Russia’s need for security guarantees if Vladimir Putin agrees to negotiations about ending the war in Ukraine, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said. He said Europe needed to address Putin’s fear that “NATO comes right up to its doors”, and the deployment of weapons that could threaten Russia, as Europe prepares its future security architecture, Reuters reports. More than 7,000 explosives have been removed from around Kherson, the Ukrainian state emergency service said. The Ukrainian army has recaptured 13 settlements in the Luhansk region, the eastern-most oblast in the country, according to the head of the regional administration, Serhiy Haidai. He said that artillery was still being fired at the villages by Russian forces. Doctors are due to visit next week and firewood is being organised for residents, Haidai posted on Telegram. Russian forces are concentrating most of their strength on taking the town of Bakhmut in Donetsk, according to the British ministry of defence. The price cap on Russian seaborne oil has been adopted by the G7 and Australia, after it was agreed by EU countries. Poland had held out on a lower amount than the $60 a barrel that was agreed. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would “not accept this ceiling”. Another 510 Russian troops were killed on Friday according to Ukraine, bringing the total killed since the invasion in February to 90,600. A tank and eight drones were also lost by the Russians. Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyak’s estimate seem conservative. Speaking to Ukraine’s 24 Kanal, Podolyak said they were official figures from Ukraine’s general staff. One person was killed and six were injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine on Friday. Zelenskiy aide Kyrylo Tymoshenko said one civilian was killed and four injured in the Donetsk region, one was injured in Kharkiv and another in Kherson. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnieper River. The evacuations were to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday. Russian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the country’s museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers’ organisation, PEN. The International Atomic Energy Agency hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine to create a protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the end of the year, the head of the UN atomic watchdog was quoted as saying. The nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on backup generators a number of times, Reuters reported. Ukraine has detained eight people over the theft of a mural painted by the elusive British street artist Banksy from a wall in the Kyiv suburbs, authorities said. The stencil image of a person in a nightgown and gas mask holding a fire extinguisher next to the charred remains of a window in the town of Hostomel went missing on Friday, they said. Around mid-October, almost a month after Vladimir Putin called for the partial mobilisation of Russian citizens to fight the war in Ukraine, there was a knock at the door of the Moscow flat that is registered as my official residence in the country. The family friends who reside there opened the door and were greeted by two officers from the Russian military administration, who asked them whether I was at home. They said I had not been home in more than 20 years. The mobilisation was declared by Putin on the 21 September, after half a year of strategic failures, senseless deaths and humanitarian atrocities at the hands of the Russian army in Ukraine. There are an estimated 356,520 Russian casualties to date, close to 40% of the entire Russian armed forces. The west should consider how to address Russia’s need for security guarantees if Vladimir Putin agrees to negotiations about ending the war in Ukraine, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said in remarks broadcast on Saturday. Macron said Europe needed to address Putin’s fear that “NATO comes right up to its doors” and the deployment of weapons that could threaten Russia as Europe prepares its future security architecture, Reuters reports. Russia has rejected a price cap on its oil after the Group of Seven nations plus Australia joined the EU in adopting a $60-a-barrel price cap on seaborne Russian oil. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow “will not accept this cap”, according to the RIA news agency. He said Russia would conduct a rapid analysis of the agreement and then respond. Moscow’s permanent representative to international organisations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, warned the cap’s European backers would regret their decision. “From this year, Europe will live without Russian oil,” Ulyanov tweeted. “Moscow has already made it clear that it will not supply oil to those countries that support anti-market price caps. Wait, very soon the EU will accuse Russia of using oil as a weapon.” Moldova’s deputy prime minister, Andrei Spinu, has announced an energy deal he said would reduce the risk of large-scale electricity outages. Spinu said state utilities firm Energocom would buy enough electricity from Cuciurgan, the country’s largest power station, to cover all of Moldova’s needs for December when combined with existing imports from Romania, Reuters reports. Moldova, one of Europe’s poorest countries, has suffered from widespread power outages amid a reduced flow of natural gas from Russia and Kremlin air strikes on energy infrastructure in neighbouring Ukraine. The power station, located in Transnistria, a breakaway territory loyal to Moscow, depends on Russian gas dispensed by the Moldovan government in Chișinău. The Cuciurgan station had stopped providing electricity to the rest of Moldova after Russian state energy giant cut flows by 40%. Moldova has since relied on more expensive Romanian electricity but has still suffered blackouts linked to Russian strikes on Ukraine. Spinu said the power station, which sits across the Dniester River, would receive 5.7m cubic meters of gas a day in exchange for selling electricity for $73 a megawatt per hour. “This contract is a reasonable compromise to ensure the citizens on both banks of the Dniester [have] electricity and gas,” Spinu wrote on his Telegram channel. After Britain’s National Crime Agency arrested a “wealthy Russian businessman” on suspicion of money laundering and other offences, the Russian embassy in London has demanded information from the UK’s Foreign Office on the reasons and circumstances of the detention of the unidentified businessman and the conditions in which he is being held, Russian news agencies said. Ukraine has detained eight people over the theft of a mural painted by the elusive British street artist Banksy from a wall in the Kyiv suburbs, the authorities said. The stencil image of a person in a nightgown and gas mask holding a fire extinguisher next to the charred remains of a window in the town of Hostomel went missing on Friday, they said. “A group of people tried to steal a Banksy mural. They cut out the work from the wall of a house destroyed by the Russians,” the Kyiv governor, Oleksiy Kuleba, said in a post on Telegram. He attached the image of a gaping hole in the wall where the image once stood. Moldova’s deputy prime minister, Andrei Spînu, announced an energy deal on Saturday he said would reduce the risk of “massive electricity outages” in the former Soviet republic, Reuters reports. Moldova has had widespread power outages amid Russian airstrikes on energy infrastructure in neighbouring Ukraine and a reduced flow of natural gas from Russian state energy giant Gazprom. The Ukrainian army has recaptured 13 settlements in the Luhansk region, the eastern most oblast in the country, according to the head of the regional administration, Serhiy Haidai. He said that artillery was still being fired at the villages by Russian forces. Doctors are due to visit next week and firewood is being organised for residents, Haidai posted on Telegram. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has landed in Belarus’ capital, Minsk, to meet his opposite number Viktor Khrenin. Belarus is one of Russia’s closest allies, and was used as a launchpad for the invasion in February. As it approaches 5pm in Kyiv, here’s a roundup of today’s news so far. Eighteen Ukrainian diplomatic missions in 12 countries have received bloody packages, including animal parts, in what Ukraine has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson from Ukraine’s foreign ministry, said the packages were simultaneously sent from one European country, which he could not disclose while the investigation was ongoing.

Russian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the country’s museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers’ organisation PEN. The Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, has called for Europe to build its own defence capabilities in the wake of the war in Ukraine, saying that without US help Europe is not resilient enough. The International Atomic Energy Agency hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine to create a protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the end of the year, the head of the UN atomic watchdog was quoted as saying. The nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on backup generators a number of times, Reuters reported.

He said one civilian was killed and four injured in the Donetsk region, one was injured in Kharkiv and another in Kherson. Ukrainian authorities in Kherson have urged people on the east of the Dnipro River to evacuate. The river been the front line between Ukrainian and Russian troops in the area since Russia pulled out of the city itself. Shelling towards the city has continued since then. The governor, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said authorities would help people to evacuate during the daytime of Saturday to Monday, according to the Kyiv Independent. Russian government spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has responded to the price cap imposed by the G7 and its allies on the exportation of seabound crude oil from Russia. Peskov said the Kremlin was prepared for the price cap and was analysing it. “We will not accept this ceiling,” the Tass news agency quoted him as saying. He added that the analysis would be carried out quickly and Russia would then say how it would respond. Eighteen Ukrainian diplomatic missions in 12 countries have received bloody packages in what Ukraine has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson from Ukraine’s foreign ministry, said the packages were simultaneously sent from one European country, which he could not disclose while the investigation was ongoing. As of Friday, Ukraine said 17 embassies had been targeted, indicating that another was delivered on Saturday. A Ukrainian embassy employee in Madrid was injured on Wednesday by a letter bomb, which was addressed to Ukraine’s ambassador to Spain. A further four letter bombs were sent on Wednesday to addresses in Spain, including to a Spanish arms manufacturer that has produced rockets donated to Ukraine, as well as Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the US embassy in Madrid. A Russian businessman has been arrested in London by officers investigating potential criminal activity by oligarchs. The 58-year-old man, who has not been named, was held by the National Crime Agency (NCA) on Thursday on suspicion of offences including money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the Home Office and conspiracy to commit perjury. A 35-year-old man, who works at the residence, was arrested nearby on suspicion of money laundering and obstruction of an officer after he was seen leaving with a bag containing thousands of pounds in cash. A third man, 39, who is the former boyfriend of the businessman’s current partner, was arrested at his home in Pimlico, London, for offences including money laundering and conspiracy to defraud. They have all been bailed, according to PA Media. Graeme Biggar, director general of the NCA, said: “The NCA’s combatting kleptocracy cell, only established this year, is having significant success investigating potential criminal activity by oligarchs, the professional service providers that support and enable them and those linked to the Russian regime. “We will continue to use all the powers and tactics available to us to disrupt this threat.” The NCA said it is the latest operation carried out as part of its efforts to disrupt the activities of corrupt international business figures and their enablers. A statement said the NCA has already helped with the freezing of numerous properties, eight yachts and four aircraft. The graphic below shows the latest developments in Russia’s war in Ukraine. On Friday, it was reported that Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnipro River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday. You can read Isobel Koshiw’s report here for more in-depth reporting regarding the price cap of Russian oil. “G7 countries and Australia have agreed to cap the price of Russian seaborne oil, with the aim of reducing Moscow’s income and limiting its ability to finance its war in Ukraine. But critics, including Ukraine, say the cap of $60 a barrel is still higher than the current market price for Russian crude oil and is unlikely to affect the KremlinRussia’s war coffers. In a statement on the deal, the UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, described the country’s support for Ukraine as unwavering and said it would “continue to look for new ways to clamp down on [the Russian president, Vladimir] Putin’s funding streams wherever we can”. The cap on the price of Russian oil transported by sea is designed to affect the country’s exports worldwide, in addition to the EU-wide embargo on Russian crude oil, which comes into force on 5 December, which the UK is also adopting. Andrey Kurkov has written an opinion piece, arguing that Ukrainians enjoying the festive season and a local chess championship is an “act of defiance for our country’s future”. “While Ukraine lives in fear of the next mass bombing of its energy infrastructure by Russian missiles and Iranian drones, and constantly monitors the actions of troops located in Belarus, there are still small forms of normalcy, small forms of resistance. A blitz chess championship was recently held in Zhytomyr, a city 140km west of Kyiv and a regular target of missile attacks. “Blitz chess – because slow chess is impossible in today’s Ukraine, where everything has to be done quickly or very quickly. The games were played according to the Swiss system, and with nine rounds in which players have only three minutes a move. If in peacetime a person appreciates every hour of tranquility, during a war we appreciate every minute.” You can read the full article here: The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said that 17 Ukrainian embassies or diplomatic missions around the world have received letter bombs or packages containing animal parts, including cows eyes, in recent days. In an interview with CNN, he said: “It started with an explosion at the embassy of Ukraine in Spain,” Kuleba said. “But what followed this explosion was more weird, and I would even say sick.” A letter bomb at the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid left a staff member with minor injuries on Wednesday. Others have been sent to the Spanish prime minister, the deputy prime minister and the US embassy. Ukraine’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Oleg Nikolenko, said that embassies in Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Croatia, Italy and Austria are among those to receive the packages. When asked who he thought was behind the letters, Kuleba told CNN said: “I feel tempted to say, to name Russia straight away, because first of all you have to answer the question, who benefits? “Maybe this terror response is the Russian answer to the diplomatic horror that we created for Russia on the international arena, and this is how they try to fight back while they are losing the real diplomatic battles one after another.” Russia has denied any responsibility for the packages in Madrid. On Wednesday, its embassy in Spain said: “Any terrorist threat or act, even more so directed against a diplomatic mission, is totally reprehensible.” More details have been published about attacks on Ukraine on Friday, in an update from the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces. They said Russia continues to shell civilian infrastructure and is trying to go on the offensive in Avdiivka and Bakhmut. Russia launched five missile strikes, 27 airstrikes and 44 rocket launcher attacks on Ukrainian towns, cities and troops. The main target for Russian airstrikes was Bakhmut and Avdiivka, both in Donetsk oblast in the east of Ukraine. Kherson city has continued to be shelled since its recapture by Ukrainian troops. Two Russian missiles hit the region of Zaporizhzhia in the south-east of Ukraine overnight. The governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said they had damaged buildings near the regional capital, Zaporizhzhia, but no casualties were reported. Spain has sent its first Hawk air-defence missile system to Ukraine. The American-built Raytheon system can be used against aircraft and missiles, both of which have been used by Russia to attack Ukraine, including power stations and homes. Spain has promised to supply six units to Ukraine. Russia has said it will continue to find buyers for oil, despite a price cap for seabourne oil being set at $60 a barrel. A group of western countries, including EU nations, G7 countries and Australia have agreed the cap as they try to limit Moscow’s income and its ability to finance its ongoing war in Ukraine. In retaliation, Vladimir Putin and Kremlin officials have said that they won’t sell oil to countries that implement it. Russia’s embassy to the US on Saturday said that the policy was “reshaping” the free market, and insisted oil would continue to be sold. In a post on Telegram, it said: “Steps like these will inevitably result in increasing uncertainty and imposing higher costs for raw materials’ consumers. “Regardless of the current flirtations with the dangerous and illegitimate instrument, we are confident that Russian oil will continue to be in demand.” Ukrainian forces killed another 510 Russian troops on Friday, bringing the total number of soldiers lost by Russia since the invasion to 90,600. They also downed another eight drones and managed to take out a tank, according to statistics provided by the Ukrainian general staff of the armed forces. A total of 7,042 explosive items have been “removed and neutralised” from Kherson oblast, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service. Work to rid the area of mines and other traps has been going on since the Russian retreat from the city last month. Ukrainian emergency workers say they have surveyed almost 700ha of open territory, 60km of railway tracks and 326 households. Authorities are urging anyone who returns to Kherson or the area around it to be extremely careful. Last month, the Guardian reported that ridding Kherson of mines could take years. Here’s a bit more detail about the oil price cap instituted by the G7 and its allies. The EU had already agreed on an embargo of seaborne crude oil from Russia in a package of sanctions announced earlier this year. The G7 and Australia agreement will allow non-EU countries to continue importing seaborne Russian crude oil using western insurance and maritime services as long as they do not pay more a barrel than the agreed limit. Because the most important shipping and insurance firms are based in G7 countries, the price cap would make it very difficult for Moscow to sell its oil for a higher price. A senior US Treasury Department official told reporters on Friday that the $60 a barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil will keep global markets well supplied while “institutionalising” discounts created by the threat of such a limit. Under the terms of the deal the price cap will be reviewed in mid-January and every two months after that. It also includes a mechanism that would keep the price cap at least 5% below the market rate. Security experts from the CSIS thinktank have warned a cap at $60 is toothless since it is above the price of existing Russian oil prices of about $52 a barrel. It has been estimated that Russian oil is sold at a profit from $40-$45 a barrel, but Russia’s true extraction costs are hard to estimate. The UK Ministry of Defence has released an update on Russia’s military efforts in Ukraine. Russian forces continue to invest a large part of their overall firepower on an approximately 15km-long sector of entrenched frontline around the Donetsk oblast town of Bakhmut, the defence ministry says. In recent days, Russia has likely made small advances on the southern axis of this assault and is likely to be planning to encircle the town. Russia has prioritised Bakhmut as its main offensive effort since early August 2022. The capture of the town would have limited operational value although it would potentially allow Russia to threaten the larger urban areas of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. The statement from the ministry adds that the campaign has been disproportionately costly, relative to these possible gains. There is a realistic possibility that Bakhmut’s capture has become primarily a symbolic, political objective for Russia. The G7 and Australia have agreed to cap the price paid for Russian seaborne crude oil at $60 a barrel, hours after EU members overcame internal resistance to reach the same decision earlier in the day. The EU agreed the price after holdout Poland gave its support, paving the way for formal approval over the weekend. In a statement, the Group of Seven leading economies and Australia said the price cap would take effect on 5 December or very soon after. The price cap aims to reduce Russia’s income from selling oil, while preventing a spike in global oil prices after an EU embargo on Russian crude oil takes effect on 5 December. Poland had pushed in EU negotiations for the cap to be as low as possible in order to squeeze Russian revenues and limit Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine. The final deal includes a mechanism to keep the oil price cap at least 5% below the market rate. US officials said the deal was unprecedented and demonstrated the resolve of the coalition opposing Russia’s war. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the price cap would significantly reduce Russia’s revenues. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Jonathan Yerushalmy and I’ll be with you for the next while. The G7, EU and Australia have agreed to cap the price of Russian seaborne crude oil at $60 a barrel, in a move that could result in Russian oil output falling by 500,000 barrels a day by early 2023. The decision by the Group of Seven nations and Australia followed an earlier announcement from the EU that the bloc had overcome internal resistance to a $60 a barrel price. The G7 and Australia said in a statement the price cap would take effect on 5 December or very soon thereafter. More on this shortly. In the meantime, here are the other key recent developments: The US president, Joe Biden, said on Thursday that he was prepared to speak to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, if he was looking for a way to end the war but that Putin had not yet indicated that. Putin is open to talks on a possible settlement in Ukraine but the refusal of the United States to recognise annexed territories as Russian is hindering a search for any potential compromise, the Kremlin said. Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyak’s estimate seem conservative. Speaking to Ukraine’s 24 Kanal, Podolyak said they were official figures from Ukraine’s general staff. Three people were killed and seven wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson over the past 24 hours, the regional governor said. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnipro River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday. Russian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the country’s museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers’ organisation PEN. The Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, has called for Europe to build its own defence capabilities in the wake of the war in Ukraine, saying that without US help Europe is not resilient enough. The International Atomic Energy Agency hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine to create a protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the end of the year, the head of the UN atomic watchdog was quoted as saying. The nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on backup generators a number of times, Reuters reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/04/ukraine-war-european-reappraisal-energy-supplies-coal-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T06:00:30Z","webTitle":"Ukraine war prompts European reappraisal of its energy supplies ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/04/ukraine-war-european-reappraisal-energy-supplies-coal-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/04/ukraine-war-european-reappraisal-energy-supplies-coal-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine war prompts European reappraisal of its energy supplies ","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin is using Russia’s hold over fossil fuel supplies to Europe as “a political and economic weapon” in the war in Ukraine, the world’s foremost energy adviser has said, presenting western governments with crucial questions over how they face down the threat to democracy while also heading off climate disaster. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, said: “Nobody is under any illusions any more. Russia’s use of its natural gas resources as an economic and political weapon shows Europe needs to act quickly to be ready to face considerable uncertainty over Russian gas supplies next winter.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted European governments, including the UK’s, to make a frantic reappraisal of their energy supplies – one that arguably should have come much sooner. The first outcome has been a fresh resolve in some countries – including from the UK business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng – to push for more renewable energy generation and energy efficiency to cut dependence on fossil fuels. Kwarteng’s intervention – “The long-term solution is obvious: gas is more expensive than renewable energy, so we need to move away from gas,” he tweeted – was unexpectedly firm, cheering green campaigners who had feared that rightwing voices in the Tory party who have sought to make scrapping the net zero target a “culture war” issue were in the ascendant. Doug Parr, the chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, said: “Kwasi Kwarteng has clocked it. Our dependence on gas is a problem, and warmer homes powered by renewables are the cheapest and quickest solution. Kwarteng must convince chancellor Rishi Sunak that we need a masterplan, and the money to get the UK off gas. We need to insulate our homes, roll out heat pumps and renewable power to rapidly address Putin’s grip on European gas markets, our sky-high energy bills, and the climate crisis unfolding before our eyes.” Germany has announced plans to ramp up energy efficiency and renewable energy, and is considering delaying the closure of its remaining nuclear power stations. France’s Emmanuel Macron called for a “renaissance” of low-carbon nuclear power to secure domestic energy supplies. In the US, Joe Biden used his state of the union speech to bang the drum again for his proposed clean energy stimulus programme. Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington, said: “The Russian invasion of Ukraine greatly increases the likelihood that the US Congress will pass huge new clean energy incentives this year because of an increased focus on energy security. Such a massive expansion of zero-emission US energy will also free up more US natural gas to flow to Europe to displace Russian gas, which has far higher fugitive emissions of methane. Together these actions would represent a significant improvement not only in global energy geopolitics, but result in major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions as well.” But as the war in Ukraine continues to rage, there is also a significant danger that – particularly if Putin goes further and cuts off gas supplies – governments could pivot the opposite way. As the IEA noted: “Other avenues are available to the EU if it wishes or needs to reduce reliance on Russian gas even more quickly … The major near-term option would involve switching away from gas consumption in the power sector via increased use of Europe’s coal-fired fleet, or by using alternative fuels such as oil within existing gas-fired power plants.” The decision may be taken by private-sector companies with coal-fired power stations that were recently closed or scheduled to close and could be brought back on stream quickly, said Richard Howard, the research director at Aurora Energy Research. “The high gas prices being seen in the market will in any case create an economic incentive for generators to shift from gas power stations towards coal,” he said. A further complication is that Europe also depends on Russia for coal. In the US, the opportunities to export gas from fracking, and coal for power stations, may also expand temptingly as fossil fuel prices rise, and to fill the gaps that open up as countries move away from Russian supplies. Then there is the question of how much consumers will stand. Petrol prices in the US, as in many places around the world, are now at the highest in a decade and still rising. Phillip Braun, a professor of finance at Northwestern University in the US, said: “American consumers need to accept that rising gas prices are a necessary cost to help the Ukrainian people in the midst of their profound crisis.” Whether consumers will continue to pay this price for democracy has not yet been tested. After years of grindingly slow progress in shifting away from coal and oil, if countries were to resume fossil fuel use under the impact of Russia’s war, it would spell disaster for attempts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. This week the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned of global devastation already under way and set to intensify if temperatures rise further, in what scientists termed “the bleakest warning yet”. Tim Crosland, the director of Plan B, a climate campaign group, said the IPCC report showed that reaching for more fossil fuels as a response to Putin would only put the world in greater peril. “There is no option of ramping up fossil fuel production as a counter to Putin,” he said. “A strategy for deescalation of the war in Ukraine can and must be integrated with a strategy for the urgent and radical reduction of carbon emissions, starting with an end to new fossil fuel supply projects, as required to limit warming to 1.5C. Separate the two logics [of climate and dealing with the war] and it’s all over.” These issues will come into sharp focus at the next UN climate meeting, Cop27, due to be held in Egypt in November. So far preparations have been unaffected, and diplomats privately note that climate negotiations have carried on through 30 years of political upheavals, including wars among UN members. But the key questions over energy policy will need to be resolved long before countries meet again on the climate. Given the time it takes to change energy systems, as the IEA made clear, governments must prepare now for what next winter will bring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/26/friday-briefing-why-recycling-plastic-may-not-be-as-good-for-the-planet-as-we-thought","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-26T05:42:23Z","webTitle":"Friday briefing: Why recycling plastic may not be as good for the planet as we thought","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/26/friday-briefing-why-recycling-plastic-may-not-be-as-good-for-the-planet-as-we-thought","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/26/friday-briefing-why-recycling-plastic-may-not-be-as-good-for-the-planet-as-we-thought","fields":{"headline":"Friday briefing: Why recycling plastic may not be as good for the planet as we thought","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning. “Reduce, reuse, recycle” is an environmentalist mantra that everyone has been able to get behind because, in the age of overconsumption, humans are producing more waste than ever before. Every year we dump 2bn tonnes of municipal solid waste on to the planet and – according to the World Bank – that number is expected to rise by 70% to 3.4bn tonnes by 2050. For years, campaigners and scientists have said that this level of waste generation is unsustainable and is detrimental to the natural environment, wildlife and humans. To ensure that less of our stuff ends up in landfills, more and more people are advocating for a circular economy. No one wants to be seen to be destroying the planet, so corporate actors are also getting on board, with many big retailers pledging to reduce single-use plastics in their products, as well as opting to use recycled materials. For most of us, the process of recycling ends when we throw the coffee cup or plastic packaging into the relevant bin. Someone comes to collect it and off it goes, leaving our conscience clear. The story does not end there, however: plastic recycling increasingly looks like a futile endeavour. Much of it still ends up in landfill, or in poorer countries where it is melted down into pellets, dumped, or burned. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Guardian environment correspondent Damien Gayle about the secretive recycling industry and whether it actually makes a difference. That’s right after the headlines. Five big stories Politics | Leaked documents show that more than 3,000 asylum seekers could be detained and deported from the UK every month to enforce Suella Braverman’s flagship asylum bill. The news comes after figures revealed that net migration hit a record high last year at 606,000, a 24% increase on the previous year’s high of 488,000. Education | One in 10 childcare providers in England is facing closure and more than half are struggling to cover their costs, according to the government’s own research into the impact of the cost of living crisis on the sector. UK news | An 11-year-old boy was hit by a police van in Lancaster as he crossed the road, leaving him in critical condition. Lancashire police said they were attending an emergency call on Thursday night when the collision occurred with the boy. The police have voluntarily referred themselves to the Independent Office for Police Conduct to review the incident. Transport | At least 50 British Airways flights were cancelled on Thursday afternoon because of a “technical issue”, with many passengers facing the possibility of further delayed or cancelled flights at Heathrow heading into the bank holiday weekend. UK news | Armed officers arrested a man on suspicion of criminal damage and dangerous driving after a car was driven into the gates outside Downing Street. Police are not treating the incident as terrorism-related. In depth: ‘Each time we recycle plastics they become more dangerous to us and the planet’ “Waste and recycling are the dirty secrets of our consumer society,” Damien Gayle says. “The fact is everything that we consume has waste attached. We throw it in the bin or the recycling and we like to just forget about it.” But we shouldn’t, Damien says. Because, as uncomfortable as it is to think about where our used tissues and empty crisp packets go, the pile of rubbish will just continue to grow and pollute, infecting the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe. *** What happens to most plastic? Last year, world leaders, environment ministers and other representatives from 173 countries endorsed a historic UN resolution that seeks to end plastic pollution and create a legally binding global treaty by the end of 2024. At the moment, only 9% of plastics are recycled globally. In the United States that number is even lower, at just 5%. In the run up to the latest round of negotiations in this agreement, Greenpeace warned that ultimately we cannot safely recycle plastic. “What [the studies they reference] have found is that the toxic chemicals that are found in virgin plastic become more concentrated when they’re repurposed into recycled plastics for further use,” Damien explains. “Greenpeace are basically saying plastics cannot ever be regarded as compatible with a circular economy, because each time we recycle them they become more dangerous to our health and the health of the planet.” The campaign group are part of a larger chorus of voices who doubt the effectiveness of recycling as a way to deal with plastic pollution. And then there is the small issue of microplastics. One recent study found that the process of recycling plastic could be releasing huge quantities of microplastics – which can be toxic to humans and to animals – into the environment. They’re already everywhere: microplastics have been found deep in the lungs of living people, in freshly fallen snow in Antarctica and in the depths of the ocean. As one writer put it, microplastics have “moved into virtually every crevice on Earth”. Researchers say that they do not know what the long-term health implications are, but early studies are already indicating that microplastics are harmful to human bodies as many of the chemicals they contain are carcinogenic. *** Exporting the problem For years, many rich countries outsourced their recycling, shipping it overseas to be sorted out by other people. Until 2017, China was the world’s biggest importer of such material, but decided to close its borders to almost all types of waste because of concerns about contamination and pollution, effectively killing an industry worth $24bn a year. In the years that followed, poorer countries like Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand have picked up the slack, as well as Poland, India, and Turkey. For Damien, this shift represents “neo-colonialism – offloading our toxic waste on to the people who can least deal with it”. After receiving waste that was not sufficiently recyclable or which caused significant pollution, many of these countries have followed China and are drastically limiting the amount of waste they import or banning it outright. *** Is there any point to recycling? Before you put your recycling bin in, er, the recycling bin, the general consensus is that the solution is not to stop recycling altogether. While imperfect, it is the best option we have – the alternative is creating more landfill sites or incinerating more waste, which produces more carbon emissions than natural gas. Ultimately, the only real way to tackle plastic pollution – and to curb the growth of already gigantic levels of waste – is to produce less stuff. Recycle is the last R — the first two, reduce and reuse, are perhaps the key to stop humanity drowning in its own castoffs. “Greenpeace are calling for a pathway to the total elimination of the production of virgin plastic,” Damien explains. However, high profit margins mean that there is little will to create a plastic-free future. “It’s everywhere because it’s cheaper. The petrochemical sector is one of the biggest industries on the planet and it’s cheaper for them to produce virgin plastic than almost any other equivalent,” Damien says. Alternatives are more expensive for the consumer too, he adds. In a world that is moving – albeit slowly – away from fossil fuels, plastic is a key way that these companies are planning to keep the lights on for the next few decades. Producers of plastic have pushed recycling as a viable way to deal with waste – but it seems the solution may be closer to home. Says Damien on eliminating virgin plastic: “I think that’s the only logical and realistic path that we can have for us as a species to survive”.

But the International Energy Agency has identified the shock in the market caused by Russia’s invasion as a potential inflection point for investment in green energy. A report from the IEA has found that clean energy investment is significantly outpacing spending on fossil fuels, and is on track to reach $1.7tn (£1.4tn) this year, as investors turn to renewables, electric vehicles, nuclear power, grids, storage and other low-carbon technologies. At the same time, investment in coal, gas and oil will rise to just over $1tn, the IEA said. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said: “This is a dramatic shift which will have consequences for the energy markets and climate change.

The issues identified by the environment watchdog in its early assessments of the plans for the site at Bradwell-on-Sea include concerns over how China General Nuclear Group (CGN) will dispose of radioactive waste. The agency has opened a consultation calling for views on its assessment and there is likely to be strong criticism from environmentalists and local community groups who oppose the new plant. CGN is helping to build the first new nuclear power plants in the UK in a generation as a junior partner at EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C site in Somerset and at EDF’s planned plant at Sizewell C in Suffolk, both of which will use a reactor type designed by the French energy company. The Chinese state-owned company also plans to build a nuclear power plant using its own reactor design, the UK Hualong pressurised water reactor, at Bradwell. It hopes to have the design approved by UK authorities by 2022. The plans have raised concerns among those who believe that Chinese-owned companies should not be involved in the UK’s critical national infrastructure over security and surveillance concerns following the Huawei controversy. Alan McGoff, of the Environment Agency (EA), said he expects CGN to resolve the potential issues identified by the agency “over the next year or so”, but warned that the agency will accept the reactor design “only if we are satisfied that all the issues have been addressed”. The EA has been scrutinising the plans since 2017 and has also identified concerns over how CGN plans to use its operational experience “to inform and improve the design”, its plans to respond to safety and environment protection assessments, and its use of high-efficiency particulate air filters. “If the issues are not resolved or new issues are identified but not resolved, then we would consider only issuing an interim statement of design acceptability. Our aim is to complete our detailed assessment of the design in early 2022,” McGoff said. • This article was amended on 13 January 2021 to clarify the location of the nuclear site at Bradwell-on-Sea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/oct/04/surging-gas-prices-and-fuel-bills-focus-tory-minds-on-the-nuclear-option","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-04T05:00:48Z","webTitle":"Surging gas prices and fuel bills focus Tory minds on the nuclear option","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/04/surging-gas-prices-and-fuel-bills-focus-tory-minds-on-the-nuclear-option","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/oct/04/surging-gas-prices-and-fuel-bills-focus-tory-minds-on-the-nuclear-option","fields":{"headline":"Surging gas prices and fuel bills focus Tory minds on the nuclear option","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Among the subjects preoccupying delegates at the Conservative party conference in Manchester on Monday, energy will be near the top of the list. Soaring global gas prices, a lack of windpower and surging household bills have focused minds on Britain’s energy needs – and the role of nuclear power in particular. For the past decade, Britain’s ambitions to build more nuclear power plants have been entwined with China’s. Hinkley Point C, the long-delayed and over-budget £23bn plant in Somerset that will be the first new power station in a generation, is being bankrolled with Chinese cash. China’s nuclear ambitions – at least as far as Britain is concerned – may be about to collide with a new political reality. Opponents of Chinese involvement in UK infrastructure are turning cartwheels at reports that the government is planning to eject the People’s Republic from Sizewell C – a £20bn sister to Sizewell B on the Suffolk coast, which is intended to power 6m homes. Beijing’s international nuclear ambitions have suffered a “body blow”, according to Iain Duncan Smith. The former Conservative party leader’s Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China campaigned, successfully, for the telecoms giant Huawei to be kicked out of the UK’s 5G network, after pressure from Donald Trump’s administration. “The British government has learned the hard way that we’re going to have to stand up to them,” he said. Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Sinosceptic China Research Group, hailed the “more realistic approach”. “Chinese state-owned companies shouldn’t be building nuclear power plants in Britain,” he said. “As the China Research Group has shown, Beijing’s attempts to interfere in other countries are growing and the UK should not make itself vulnerable.” The duo were reacting to suggestions, first reported in the Guardian, that officials are examining methods by which China General Nuclear (CGN), which has a 20% stake in the Sizewell C project due to be built by France’s EDF, can be removed from the equation. An announcement could come as early as this month, with taxpayers’ cash used instead. CGN was due to step up its involvement in British nuclear post-Sizewell, through a majority position in Bradwell B in Essex, intended to be a showcase for the Chinese-designed Hualong One (HPR1000) reactor. If China is forced out of a minority financial position in a plant built by French state-backed EDF, the prospect of a Chinese-controlled facility a mere 40 miles from London is surely a non-starter. Bradwell would have been a major coup, demonstrating to the world that a major economy such as the UK was open to Beijing’s proprietary nuclear technology. Duncan Smith thinks the UK’s decision could scupper the plan. “If we do this, other countries will follow suit and it will turn out to be a very big decision indicating direction of travel with China. It’s a big strategic decision.” He also has price on his side. It costs around twice as much to produce a kilowatt hour of nuclear power compared with offshore wind and solar power. But have the anti-China hawks started celebrating too soon? One industry source, who has been observing China’s nuclear ambitions for years, sees no reason to believe that CGN will bow to pressure to withdraw. Forcing China out would create a diplomatic row. “There has been a sustained effort […] to make the atmosphere so hostile that the company will just give up and go away,” the source said. “That seems a really heroic assumption.” CGN is deeply involved in the 3.2GW Hinkley project, which could yet run beyond its current £23bn budget and its 2027 completion date. “Of course it [continued Chinese investment in Hinkley] could be at risk,” said the source. “CGN is making a big contribution [to the plant] but it’s not the big flagship ‘welcome to the world’ thing that building an HPR1000 would be.” Pressure on the UK government from its own MPs, but also from abroad, seems to be behind the decision to keep China at arm’s length. Opposition from the likes of Duncan Smith and Tugendhat is one thing but American intervention is quite another. The former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo last year urged Britain to look across the Atlantic for its nuclear future, saying the US “stands ready to assist our friends in the UK with any needs they have”. The Trump administration was vocally opposed to Chinese technology incursions into the west and the Biden administration is no different. But jilting China to please America leaves Britain facing a problem. The UK nuclear fleet has a capacity of 8.9GW, about a sixth of peak demand in winter and 20% of our average needs annually. More than 7GW of that capacity – seven out of the eight existing power stations – is due to for retirement between now and 2030. Hinkley is the only project with a completion date in sight, with one reactor firing up in 2026 and the next in 2027 but it is an optimistic assumption that no delays will occur. Even if Hinkley proceeds as planned, UK nuclear capacity will still fall to 4.4GW by 2030 if nothing else is done. The upcoming Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow has reminded everyone of the UK’s commitment to decarbonise the economy entirely by 2050, while the gas price crisis has underscored the risks of relying solely on fossil fuels and renewable energy. Big nuclear power plants and their spinning turbines provide the vital inertia that is required to balance the grid and keep its frequency stable. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is keen to emphasise that nuclear is part of the solution but something needs to happen to speed up these multibillion-pound projects. At Sizewell, the government’s great hope is regulated asset base (RAB) financing, an investment structure that offers potential investors safe returns but requires legislation. A government spokesperson described it as a “credible model”, indicating moves are afoot to pursue that as a means of funding Sizewell – not to mention projects such as Wylfa, on Anglesey, which Japan’s Hitachi recently walked away from, citing funding concerns. The new financing model, used in water and power networks, could lure in American investors such as the construction giant Bechtel. If Beijing and London can find a diplomatic solution to remove CGN from UK nuclear, this funding model is a solution that could attract backers to replace the Chinese. If nuclear has a major role to play in Britain’s decarbonised future, time is of the essence. Nuclear options The UK has struggled to get nuclear projects moving in the past decade but it does have options. The first is to find investors for major new-build projects. While investors in Sizewell C are already lined up, China’s involvement is in doubt after signals that ministers are preparing to buy out its share of Bradwell B in Essex. Offering more attractive funding options could be the key to kickstarting the £20bn Wylfa project on Anglesey after Hitachi walked away last year. But the UK’s National Infrastructure Commission is cool on large-scale nuclear new projects. Advanced modular reactors (AMR), which use new coolants instead of water, are seen as a potential technological leap forward. Earlier this year, the government published a call for evidence about launching a programme to demonstrate their viability. However, even this pilot stage won’t be ready until the 2030s. There is plenty of excitement about Rolls-Royce’s plans for small modular reactors (SMRs), dubbed mini-nukes that could, in theory, be rolled out quickly and easily to boost capacity. The British engineering giant thinks it could plug them into the grid by 2030. Then there is the tantalising moonshot prospect of cracking nuclear fusion, harnessing the power of the stars to create, in theory, limitless energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/17/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-putin-warns-attacks-on-ukrainian-infrastructure-could-be-ramped-up-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-17T19:54:21Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: discovery of mass grave in Izium prompts call for war crimes tribunal – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/17/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-putin-warns-attacks-on-ukrainian-infrastructure-could-be-ramped-up-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/17/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-putin-warns-attacks-on-ukrainian-infrastructure-could-be-ramped-up-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: discovery of mass grave in Izium prompts call for war crimes tribunal – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s almost 11pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Satellite imagery has emerged of the recently discovered mass grave site near Izium. The images, released by Maxar Technologies, show the “Forest Cemetery” entrance from March to August of this year. Activists from environmental group Greenpeace on Saturday blocked a shipment of Russian gas from unloading at a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in northern Finland, the terminal owner and Greenpeace said. The activists demanded Helsinki stop importing Russian gas after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. The EU presidency on Saturday called for the establishment of an international tribunal for war crimes after new mass graves were found in Ukraine. “In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent,” said Jan Lipavsky, foreign minister of the Czech Republic which holds the European Union’s rotating presidency. The Security Service of Ukraine said that Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSU) officers tortured residents in Kupiansk, a city in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. The Kyiv Independent reports that when FSU officers were in then-occupied Kupiansk, they tortured residents and threatened to send them to minefields and kill their families. Satellite imagery has emerged of the recently discovered mass grave site near Izium. The images, released by Maxar Technologies, show the “Forest Cemetery” entrance from March to August of this year. Hundreds of hastily buried bodies were discovered two days ago, including those of children and Ukrainian soldiers, after Izium was liberated from Russian forces. Activists from the environmental group Greenpeace on Saturday blocked a shipment of Russian gas from unloading at a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in northern Finland, the terminal owner and Greenpeace said. The activists demanded Helsinki stop importing Russian gas after Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. “The shipment contained liquefied natural gas coming from Russia,” Olga Vaisanen, a spokesperson for Gasum, the Finnish company that imported the blocked gas, told Agence France-Presse. Mika Kolehmainen, the director for the terminal’s operator, Manga LNG, said the action took place around 7am (0400 GMT) at Tornio port. The operator said the activists climbed the loading arms that allow for the transfer of material and there were two Greenpeace ships outside the terminal’s area, close to the Swedish border. “It’s completely unacceptable that Russian gas is still allowed to flow in Finland, more than six months after Putin launched his invasion,” a Greenpeace activist, Olli Tiainen, said in a statement. “The Finnish government and Prime Minister Sanna Marin must ban all fossil fuel imports from Russia immediately,” he added. There are currently no EU or Swedish sanctions on gas imports from Russia, only on oil and coal. In May, Russia cut gas deliveries by pipeline to Finland, claiming there were issues with payments, but deliveries by sea continue. The EU presidency on Saturday called for the establishment of an international tribunal for war crimes after new mass graves were found in Ukraine. In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent,” said Jan Lipavský, foreign minister of the Czech Republic, which holds the European Union’s rotating presidency. “We must not overlook it. We stand for the punishment of all war criminals,” he said on Twitter. “I call for the speedy establishment of a special international tribunal that will prosecute the crime of aggression.” The appeal follows the discovery by Ukrainian authorities of around 450 graves outside the formerly Russian-occupied city of Izium, with most of the bodies showing signs of torture. Among the bodies that were exhumed today, 99 percent showed signs of violent death,” Oleg Synegubov, head of Kharkiv regional administration, said. “There are several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one person is buried with a rope around his neck,” he added. The Security Service of Ukraine said that Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSU) officers tortured residents in Kupiansk, a city in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. The Kyiv Independent reports that when FSU officers were in then-occupied Kupiansk, they tortured residents and threatened to send them to minefields and kill their families. For 40 minutes, they had been using a stun gun on me, then they shot at me with either an airgun or a gas gun, I don’t know – I was in a bag,” the Kyiv Independent reported one victim saying. Hi everyone, I’m Maya Yang and I’ll be taking over the blog next with the latest updates. Stay tuned. Hundreds of people gathered in Kyiv to say farewell to beloved Ukrainian ballet dancer Oleksandr Shapoval, who was killed in fighting in eastern Ukraine. Some dropped to their knees and others clapped as soldiers carried his casket draped in a Ukrainian flag into the National Kyiv Opera. Relatives, colleagues, soldiers and fans came holding flowers walking past photos of the artist on stage and on the frontlines, AFP reports. Shapoval’s two teenage daughters were in the crowd. Shapoval, 47, had been a ballet dancer with the Kyiv Opera since 1994. He retired and started teaching dance in 2021, before volunteering to help defend his country on 25 February, the day after Russia’s invasion. After Russian troops withdrew from Kyiv, Shapoval fought in the eastern industrial Donbas region. He died in mortar shelling near Mayorsk, in the Donetsk region, on 12 September. Ukrainian authorities exhumed more corpses from a burial site by a cemetery in the town of Izium where officials say hundreds are buried in territory recaptured from Russian forces. Up to 30 emergency service officers carefully dug up bodies at the wooded burial site in Izium using shovels. Police experts and investigators documented the findings on camera and inspected the bodies. Some bodies found so far have been of Ukrainian soldiers while others were civilians, Reuters reports. Some more details on the situation at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, from Reuters. Even though the six reactors have been shut down, the fuel in them still needs cooling to avoid a potentially catastrophic meltdown. That means the plant needs electricity to pump water through the core of the reactors. The power supply at Zaporizhzhia has been a source of major concern after the last main line went down and then three backup lines that can connect it to a nearby coal-fired power plant were also disconnected. That prompted the plant to go into so-called “island mode” where its last operating reactor provided it with power, though that mode is not sustainable. A backup power line was reconnected a week ago, enabling that reactor to shut down, too. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling at the site of Zaporizhzhia that has damaged buildings and caused the disconnection of power lines. One of the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant’s four main power lines has been repaired and has resumed supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid two weeks after it went down, the UN nuclear watchdog said. “With the main line’s reconnection yesterday afternoon, the three backup power lines are again being held in reserve,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said. “The three other main external 750kv (kilovolt) power lines that were lost earlier during the conflict remain down.” It is just after 6pm in Kyiv. Here is what you might have missed: The Czech Republic, who currently hold the EU presidency, have called for a “special international tribunal” after a mass grave was discovered in Izium, a town in north-eastern Ukraine. More than 440 bodies have been discovered by Ukrainian officials, with some found with their hands tied behind their backs. In a series of tweets on Saturday, Jan Lipavský, the Czech Republic’s minister of foreign affairs said: “Russia left behind mass graves of hundreds of shot and tortured people in the Izyum area. In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent. We must not overlook it. We stand for the punishment of all war criminals. #StandwithUkraine. I call for the speedy establishment of a special international tribunal that will prosecute the crime of aggression.” Russia is likely to stubbornly defend the Luhansk oblast in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region amid Kyiv’s counteroffensive, but it is unclear if Moscow’s forces have “sufficient reserves or adequate morale” to withstand another concerted Ukrainian assault, the UK Ministry of Defence says. Its latest intelligence briefing says: “Any substantial loss of territory in Luhansk will unambiguously undermine Russia’s strategy.” The assessment comes after Ukrainian forces recently recaptured more than 6,000 sq km of territory including the city of Izium, long regarded as the gateway to the Donbas. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, has reported today that two civilians were killed on Friday after Russian shelling in the cities of Bakhmut and Sviatohirsk. In an update on the operational situation, Kyrylenklo added that overnight in the region “passed relatively calmly” and there was only “isolated” shelling on the front line. The governor of Kharkiv oblast, Oleh Synyehubov, has said an 11-year-old girl was killed in a Russian rocket attack in the city of Chuhuiv, in the eastern Ukrainian region. Synyehubov said the rockets also caused damage to “critical infrastructure, the private sector, an enterprise, and a gas station”. Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine despite Kyiv’s latest counteroffensive and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces target facilities in Russia. Associated Press reported that the Russian president said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. Speaking to reporters on Friday after attending a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Putin said: “We aren’t in a rush.” Joe Biden has warned Vladimir Putin not to use chemical or tactical nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine. The US president was asked in an interview with CBS News what he would say to Putin if he was considering using the weapons. Biden said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II.” Ukraine’s foreign minister has renewed criticism of Germany for failing to send tanks to help fight Russian forces, saying the new weapons pledged by Berlin were “not what we need most”. Berlin announced on Thursday it would send Kyiv more multiple rocket launchers and “Dingo” armoured troop-carriers as Ukraine’s troops carry out a counteroffensive against Moscow’s forces. But Agence France-Presse reported the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, as saying Germany’s decisions were a “mystery” and that there was a “weapon wall” in Berlin that the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, had to tear down. Mexico will present a peace plan for Ukraine to the United Nations general assembly next week, president Andrés Manuel López Obrador says. Agence France-Presse reports that the proposal is for Pope Francis, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to form a dialogue and peace committee. United Nations member states have voted to make an exception to allow Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address next week’s general assembly by video, despite Russian opposition. Of the 193 member states, 101 voted on Friday in favour of allowing the Ukrainian president to “present a pre-recorded statement” instead of in-person as usually required. Seven members voted against the proposal, including Russia. Nineteen states abstained. Virtually all the exhumed bodies in Izium had signs of violent death, Ukraine’s regional administration chief said of the mass burial site discovered after Kyiv’s forces recaptured the east Ukrainian town. Exhumers had uncovered several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one “with a rope around his neck”, Oleg Synegubov, head of Kharkiv regional administration, said on Friday. “Among the bodies that were exhumed today, 99% showed signs of violent death,” he said on social media. The European Union was “deeply shocked” at the mass graves discovered by Ukrainian officials in Izium, said the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell. “We condemn these atrocities in the strongest possible terms.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, also condemned what he described as the “atrocities” committed in Izium, joining growing outrage in western countries over the burial site. Ukrainian armed forces have hit four areas held by Russian troops, according to the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces. The military also targeted an unloading station, it said, in turn preventing Russian forces from deploying additional reserves. Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out targeted strikes in the cities of Kherson and Luhansk against top local officials who have been collaborating with Moscow. At least five Himars missiles crashed into the central administration building in Kherson, which Russian troops have occupied since March after arriving from Crimea. Video from the scene showed smoke pouring out of the complex. In the eastern city of Luhansk, a pro-Russian prosecutor died with his deputy when their office was blown up. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s senior adviser, Mikhailo Podolyak, said Ukraine was not behind the blast. Further south, the Russian-backed separatist authority in Berdiansk also blamed Kyiv for the “double murder” of a deputy head of the military civil administration and his wife, who headed the city’s territorial election commission for the referendum. The United States department of defence has announced it is providing an additional $600m in military assistance to Ukraine to meet the country’s “critical security and defence needs”. In total, the Biden administration has committed about $15.8bn in security aid to Ukraine – $15.1bn since the beginning of Russia’s invasion in February. The Czech Republic, who currently hold the EU presidency, have called for a “special international tribunal” after a mass grave was discovered in Izium, a town in north-eastern Ukraine. More than 440 bodies have been discovered by Ukrainian officials, with some found with their hands tied behind their backs. Volodymyr Zelenskiy invoked the names of other Ukrainian cities where authorities said retreating Russian troops left behind mass graves of civilians, Associated Press reported. “Bucha, Mariupol, now, unfortunately, Izium,” Ukraine’s president said. “Russia leaves death everywhere. And it must be held accountable for it.” In a series of tweets on Saturday, Jan Lipavský, the Czech Republic’s minister of foreign affairs said: Russia left behind mass graves of hundreds of shot and tortured people in the Izyum area. In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent. We must not overlook it. We stand for the punishment of all war criminals. #StandwithUkraine I call for the speedy establishment of a special international tribunal that will prosecute the crime of aggression. One person was killed and two more injured today after Ukrainian shelling of a village in Russia. The alleged attack occurred in the city of Belgorod, not far from the border with Ukraine, the TASS news agency cited local authorities as saying. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports. An honour guard fired a three-gun salute toward cloudy skies as friends and comrades-in-arms gathered in Kyiv to bid farewell to a Russian woman who was killed while fighting on Ukraine’s side in the war with her native country, Associated Press reports. Olga Simonova, 34, was remembered for her courage and kindness at a funeral in the Ukrainian capital on Friday. Simonova’s coffin was draped in the blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag, with a cuddly toy lion on top. Her nom de guerre was “Simba”, the name of the main character in the Disney cartoon The Lion King. Born in the Russian city of Chelyabinsk, Simonova said she started feeling uncomfortable about her native country after reading about Russia’s war in Chechnya and its actions in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, and Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Filled with doubts that she “would ever be able to raise the flag of my country, my homeland” again, Simonova travelled to Ukraine to join the conflict in the Donbas on the Ukrainian side, first as a volunteer fighter, then as a paramedic and ultimately as an enlisted member of the armed forces. Friends and colleagues said Simonova, who was unmarried and had no children, had recently redeployed from the east to the southern Kherson region, where Ukraine has launched a counteroffensive against Russian forces. They said she died on 13 September, after her vehicle hit a landmine. The governor of Kharkiv oblast, Oleh Synyehubov, has said an 11-year-old girl was killed in a Russian rocket attack in the city of Chuhuiv, in the eastern Ukrainian region. Synyehubov said the rockets also caused damage to “critical infrastructure, the private sector, an enterprise, and a gas station”. He said on Telegram: An innocent child died from Russian terror. Unfortunately, the 11-year-old girl, who was hospitalised in Chuguyev, died from her injuries. Another woman was injured after the attacks on Chuguiev; the condition of the victim is average. The report could not be independently verified. Ukrainian forces have continued to cross the key Oskil River in the Kharkiv region as they try to press on in a counteroffensive targeting Russian-occupied territory, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. The institute said in today’s report that satellite imagery it examined suggested that Ukrainian forces have crossed over to the east bank of the Oskil in Kupiansk, placing artillery there. The river, which flows south from Russia into Ukraine, had been a natural break in the newly emerged frontlines since Ukraine launched its push about a week ago, reports Associated Press. The institute said: Russian forces are likely too weak to prevent further Ukrainian advances along the entire Oskil River if Ukrainian forces choose to resume offensive operations. President Zelenskiy’s senior adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, has responded to reports that Mexico will present a peace plan for Ukraine to the United Nations general assembly next week. Directing his tweet at Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Podolyak said: “Peacemakers” who use war as a topic for their own PR are causing only surprise. @lopezobrador_, is your plan to keep millions under occupation, increase the number of mass burials and give Russia time to renew reserves before the next offensive? Then your “plan” is a plan. Agence France-Presse reports that the proposal to be put forward by Mexico is for Pope Francis, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to form a dialogue and peace committee. Russia’s defence ministry today said that its forces have launched strikes on several parts of Ukraine. It also accused Kyiv of carrying out shelling near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Reuters reports. Russian forces conducted their strikes in the Kherson, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, according to the ministry. It said that Ukrainian forces had carried out an unsuccessful offensive near Pravdyne in Kherson. The radiation situation at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, remains normal, according to the ministry. It said two incidents of Ukrainian shelling were recorded near the plant on Saturday. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry denied that Ukrainian forces had carried out shelling near the facility. Both Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of shelling the nuclear power plant. The UN International Atomic Energy Agency passed a resolution on Thursday demanding that Russia end its occupation of the plant. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, has reported today that two civilians were killed on Friday after Russian shelling in the cities of Bakhmut and Sviatohirsk. In an update on the operational situation, Kyrylenklo added that overnight in the region “passed relatively calmly” and there was only “isolated” shelling on the front line. On the Telegram, he said: On September 16, the Russians killed 2 civilians of Donetsk region: in Sviatohirsk and Bakhmut. Another 11 people were injured. Currently, it is impossible to establish the exact number of victims in Mariupol and Volnovas. It was not possible to independently verify the report. Our report on US president, Joe Biden’s, first meeting with the family members of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan: Joe Biden, met with family members of WNBA star Brittney Griner and another American detained in Russia, Paul Whelan, on Friday, the first face-to-face encounter that the president has had with the relatives. In a statement after the meetings, which were held separately, White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said Biden stressed to the families his “continued commitment to working through all available avenues to bring Brittney and Paul home safely”. “He asked after the well-being of Elizabeth and Cherelle and their respective families during this painful time,” Jean-Pierre said. “The president appreciated the opportunity to learn more about Brittney and Paul from those who love them most, and acknowledged that every minute they are being held is a minute too long.” Read more: Joe Biden meets with families of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan It is just after 1pm in Kyiv.

You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II.” Ukraine’s foreign minister has renewed criticism of Germany for failing to send tanks to help fight Russian forces, saying the new weapons pledged by Berlin were “not what we need most”. Berlin announced on Thursday it would send Kyiv more multiple rocket launchers and “Dingo” armoured troop-carriers as Ukraine’s troops carry out a counteroffensive against Moscow’s forces. But Agence France-Presse reported the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, as saying Germany’s decisions were a “mystery” and that there was a “weapon wall” in Berlin that the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, had to tear down. Mexico will present a peace plan for Ukraine to the United Nations general assembly next week, president Andrés Manuel López Obrador says. Agence France-Presse reports that the proposal is for Pope Francis, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to form a dialogue and peace committee. United Nations member states have voted to make an exception to allow Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address next week’s general assembly by video, despite Russian opposition. Of the 193 member states, 101 voted on Friday in favour of allowing the Ukrainian president to “present a pre-recorded statement” instead of in-person as usually required. Seven members voted against the proposal, including Russia. Nineteen states abstained. Virtually all the exhumed bodies in Izium had signs of violent death, Ukraine’s regional administration chief said of the mass burial site discovered after Kyiv’s forces recaptured the east Ukrainian town. Exhumers had uncovered several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one “with a rope around his neck”, Oleg Synegubov, head of Kharkiv regional administration, said on Friday. “Among the bodies that were exhumed today, 99% showed signs of violent death,” he said on social media. The European Union was “deeply shocked” at the mass graves discovered by Ukrainian officials in Izium, said the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell. “We condemn these atrocities in the strongest possible terms.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, also condemned what he described as the “atrocities” committed in Izium, joining growing outrage in western countries over the burial site. Ukrainian armed forces have hit four areas held by Russian troops, according to the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces. The military also targeted an unloading station, it said, in turn preventing Russian forces from deploying additional reserves. Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out targeted strikes in the cities of Kherson and Luhansk against top local officials who have been collaborating with Moscow. At least five Himars missiles crashed into the central administration building in Kherson, which Russian troops have occupied since March after arriving from Crimea. Video from the scene showed smoke pouring out of the complex. In the eastern city of Luhansk, a pro-Russian prosecutor died with his deputy when their office was blown up. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s senior adviser, Mikhailo Podolyak, said Ukraine was not behind the blast. Further south, the Russian-backed separatist authority in Berdiansk also blamed Kyiv for the “double murder” of a deputy head of the military civil administration and his wife, who headed the city’s territorial election commission for the referendum. In the southern oblast of Zaporizhzhia there were also reports on Friday of a “powerful explosion” in the Russian-occupied Melitopol, said Ivan Fedorov, mayor of Melitopol. “I hope the Russian fascists have suffered losses, among their personnel and equipment,” he said. “Awaiting good news from the armed forces of Ukraine.” The United States department of defence has announced it is providing an additional $600m in military assistance to Ukraine to meet the country’s “critical security and defence needs”. In total, the Biden administration has committed about $15.8bn in security aid to Ukraine – $15.1bn since the beginning of Russia’s invasion in February. Switzerland on Friday aligned itself with the European Union in suspending a 2009 agreement easing rules for Russian citizens to enter the country. “The suspension of the agreement does not mean a general visa freeze for Russians but rather they will need to use the ordinary visa procedure to enter Switzerland,” the country’s federal council said in a statement. The EU took a similar step earlier, suspending a visa facilitation deal with Russia but stopping short of a wider visa ban in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine’s ministry of defence has given its latest update on Russia’s total combat losses since the war started in February this year. The figures show that Vladimir Putin’s military forces have lost 54,250 troops, 2,202 tanks, and 4,701 armoured combat vehicles. Ukrainian forces have also downed 251 military jets, 216 helicopters and 911 drones. The figures could not be independently verified. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus, writes for us that she lost a rigged election in Belarus – only the west can help us win freedom from Russia: Peat bogs span almost 15% of my home country of Belarus. But, in recent times, citizens have grown wary of these dense, acidic wetlands. Their decaying vegetative matter is a valuable source of fuel and, after decades of being gradually drained and stripped away, the drying marshes that remain pose a significant fire risk. Smouldering underground fires can burn for months unseen before bursting out into the open and wreaking devastation. Much like these underground peat fires that grow shielded from view, democracy in Belarus is currently burning and President Alexander Lukashenko’s corrupt, despotic regime is the decaying marshland, tinder-dry and ripe for destruction. Read more here: I lost a rigged election in Belarus – only the west can help us win freedom from Russia President Zelenskiy’s senior adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, has urged European countries to provide Ukraine with “modern and effective” missile defence systems. His tweet comes after Vladimir Putin warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces target facilities in Russia. Our colleague Dan Sabbagh writes that Ukraine depends on morale and Russia on mercenaries. It could decide the war: The Ukrainian video begins with the Dunkirk beach scene from the film Atonement, the soldiers’ stirring rendition of Dear Lord and Father of Mankind. Until it transitions to several hundred Ukrainian troops, singing the country’s national anthem in the open air, ahead of last week’s successful Kharkiv offensive. Life may be trying to imitate art, but in this case there is no clearer demonstration of Ukrainian national morale as the war heads towards the end of its seventh month. The unprovoked attack by their larger neighbour has unleashed a patriotic mobilisation that is having a transformational effect on the battlefield. Read more of Dan Sabbagh’s analysis here: Ukraine depends on morale and Russia on mercenaries. It could decide the war In case you missed it on Friday, Ukrainian authorities say they have found a mass burial site of more than 440 bodies in the eastern city of Izium that was recaptured from Russian forces. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has likened the discovery to what had happened in Bucha, saying: “Russia leaves death everywhere, and must be responsible for it.” Russia has repeatedly denied it targets civilians or has committed war crimes Joe Biden has warned Vladimir Putin not to use chemical or tactical nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine. The US president was asked in an interview with CBS News what he would say to Putin if he was considering using the weapons. Biden said: Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II. The US president refused to elaborate on what the US would do if Putin did take things that far. He added: They’ll become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been. And depending on the extent of what they do will determine what response would occur. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday he had spoken to Nike Inc and thanked the US sport manufacturer for making what he called the “right decision” to pull out of Russia. “This is an example of how business can play a significant role in protecting humanity and freedom,” Reuters reported the Ukrainian president as saying in his nightly video address. If a state chooses the path of terror, it is the duty of every self-respecting company to distance itself from such a state. Nike told Reuters in June that it was making a full exit from Russia. Ukraine’s foreign minister has renewed criticism of Germany for failing to send tanks to help fight Russian forces, saying the new weapons pledged by Berlin were “not what we need most”. Berlin announced on Thursday it would send Kyiv more multiple rocket launchers and “Dingo” armoured troop-carriers as Ukraine’s troops carry out a counteroffensive against Moscow’s forces. But Agence France-Presse reported the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, as saying Germany’s decisions were a “mystery” and that there was a “weapon wall” in Berlin that the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, had to tear down. Kuleba said in an interview with German newspaper the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, published online: We ask for Leopard tanks and Marder [armoured vehicles] and Germany supplies armoured vehicles of the Dingo type We are grateful for them. But that is not what we need most in combat ... What is the problem? Why can’t we get what we need, and what Germany has? Germany has sent a raft of different armaments to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February but has so far refused to transfer Leopards and Marders, despite repeated requests from Kyiv. Russia is likely to stubbornly defend the Luhansk oblast in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region amid Kyiv’s counteroffensive, but it is unclear if Moscow’s forces have “sufficient reserves or adequate morale” to withstand another concerted Ukrainian assault, the UK ministry of defence says. Its latest intelligence briefing says: Any substantial loss of territory in Luhansk will unambiguously undermine Russia’s strategy. The assessment comes after Ukrainian forces recently recaptured more than 6,000 sq km of territory including the city of Izium, long regarded as the gateway to the Donbas. Mexico will present a peace plan for Ukraine to the United Nations general assembly next week, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador says. Agence France-Presse reports that the proposal is for Pope Francis, the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to form a dialogue and peace committee. Lopez Obrador said in a speech marking Mexican Independence Day: It’s a matter of urgently seeking an agreement to stop the war in Ukraine. The peacemaking mission should immediately seek a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine and the start of direct talks with Ukranian president Zelensky and Russian president Putin. Lopez Obrador, whose country is a non-permanent member of the UN security council, criticised the UN for being “inactive” in the face of the conflict. He said his foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, would present the proposal to the UN general assembly in New York, which will be addressed by about 150 heads of state and government. Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine despite Kyiv’s latest counteroffensive and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces target facilities in Russia. Associated Press reported that the Russian president said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. Speaking to reporters on Friday after attending a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Putin said: We aren’t in a rush. The Russian leader added that Moscow has only deployed volunteer soldiers to fight in Ukraine. Russia pulled back its forces from large swaths of north-eastern Ukraine last week after a swift Ukrainian counteroffensive. In his first comment on the Ukrainian advance, Putin said: “Let’s see how it develops and how it ends.” He said Ukraine had tried to strike civilian infrastructure in Russia and “we so far have responded with restraint, but just yet””. If the situation develops this way, our response will be more serious. “Just recently, the Russian armed forces have delivered a couple of impactful strikes,” he said, in an apparent reference to Russian attacks earlier this week on power plants in northern Ukraine and a dam in the south. Let’s consider those as warning strikes. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. These are the latest developments as it approaches 9.30am in Kyiv. United Nations member states have voted to make an exception to allow Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address next week’s general assembly by video, despite Russian opposition.

Putin said he invaded Ukraine because the west wanted to break up Russia. He grinned when asked about Ukraine’s recent military success, saying: “Let’s see how it develops, how it ends up.” Putin said nothing had changed with the ultimate goal of Moscow’s “special military operation” in Ukraine, which was to capture the Donbas. The United States department of defence has announced it is providing an additional $600m in military assistance to Ukraine to meet the country’s “critical security and defence needs”.

At a briefing reported on Monday afternoon, Nataliya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, said an offensive in Kherson, the only regional capital Russia has been able to secure since the war began, was under way. Her comments came after video circulated that apparently showed a soldier from the Russian-run self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk saying Ukrainian forces had broken through. The Guardian’s Isobel Koshiw in Kyiv reported comments echoing Humenyuk’s last night from Oleksiy Arestovych, a senior adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy himself did not refer to the attack specifically in his nightly address. But the Ukrainian president said: “The occupiers should know: we will oust them to the border. To our border, the line of which has not changed.” Other Ukrainian officials echoed those claims. Sergiy Khlan, a local deputy and adviser to Kherson’s regional governor, said it was “the beginning of the end of the occupation of Kherson region” and “a prepared, well-balanced start of a counteroffensive”. How do they say it has gone so far? Arestovych said Ukrainian troops were attacking Russian defences along the frontline and claimed they had broken through in several places. He also said ferries on the west bank of the Dnieper River, which are being used to supply Russian forces in the territory, were being shelled. The BBC reported officials in Kyiv claiming that US-supplied Himars rocket systems had been used to destroy three bridges across the Dnieper as well as temporary bridges created by Russian forces. The BBC also said a Ukrainian operational group in the region claimed a Russian-backed regiment had left its positions and Russian paratroopers had fled. Ukrainian officials declined to give details of the attack, citing operational security. But their claims could not be independently corroborated. While witnesses reported blasts in the cities of Kherson and Nova Kakhovka, the extent and success of Ukrainian operations are yet to be confirmed. The Financial Times reported remarks from John Kirby, a US national security spokesperson, who said Ukraine’s actions had “already had an impact on Russia’s military capabilities” because Moscow had been forced to divert resources to the region from the east of the country. This at-a-glance piece gives a wider picture of the situation in Ukraine this morning, including news of a team of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors en route to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, where Kyiv claims Russian occupiers are violating nuclear safety protocols. What does Russia say? Russia’s state-owned news agency Ria cited the defence ministry in Moscow as acknowledging that Ukrainian troops attempted an offensive in the southern Mykolaiv and Kherson regions. A senior official in Nova Kakhovka told Ria that civilians had been ordered to take refuge in bomb shelters. The Russian defence ministry said Ukrainian forces had sustained significant casualties and claimed the “enemy’s offensive attempt failed miserably”. The FT reported that Sergei Aksyonov, the Moscow-appointed governor of Crimea, said on Telegram that the claimed counterattack was “the latest fake [news] from Ukrainian propaganda” and said Ukraine’s forces were “taking extremely severe losses”. Again, it is not yet possible to verify these claims, and Russia routinely inflates the scale of Ukrainian losses in its updates. Recently, western and Ukrainian intelligence have noted a buildup of Russian troops and equipment in the region, potentially suggesting Russia was preparing its own offensive. What are the prospects of success? Humenyuk told reporters that Russian forces were strong in the region – and that even though morale was low among their ranks, “it was too early to relax”. In comments on his Telegram account reported by the Guardian’s Samantha Lock on the live blog, Arestovych characterised the action as “a planned slow operation to grind the enemy” and said: “This process will not be very fast, but will end with the installation of the Ukrainian flag over all the settlements of Ukraine.” Ukraine’s ability to conduct its claimed counteroffensive has been greatly enhanced by the provision of weapons by the west, and Russian positions in the region have been under artillery barrage for weeks and cut off from their supply lines. But it is too early to say whether those successes will translate to victory on the ground. A US official quoted by the New York Times said the Pentagon “remained cautious about whether Ukraine’s current military capabilities were sufficient to make significant gains”. Why is an attack in Kherson significant? Kherson has huge symbolic and practical significance as the only regional capital to have been secured by the Russian invaders – and if Ukraine can entirely cut off enemy forces on the western bank of the Dnieper, they will have a realistic prospect of success. That would disrupt Russian attempts to proceed with a sham referendum designed to give credibility to Moscow’s claims that residents of Kherson and other parts of southern Ukraine wish to be part of Russia. For more on how that prospect is viewed by citizens in Kherson, read this piece by Shaun Walker and Pjotr Sauer from earlier this month, in which one interviewee says: “No one thought about [a referendum] before the war. Now it will be a referendum at gunpoint.” There has been a growing sense that if Kyiv is to retake the city, it must do so as a matter of urgency: changing weather – including rain that will make the countryside muddy and far harder for ground troops to traverse – in the autumn means there is a powerful incentive to launch a counteroffensive now. There are also fears European support could fade as the impact of high energy prices begins to take hold. Success in any operation to take Kherson could break a long period of deadlock – and persuade western allies that it is worth continuing to provide the arms and funding that Ukraine needs. But if an attack fails, Ukrainian morale would be undermined, and Russia’s plans to bring the south of the country under its full control would be reinforced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/dec/14/ministers-would-be-wise-to-play-for-time-before-ordering-sizewell-c","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-12-14T19:56:05Z","webTitle":"Ministers would be wise to play for time before ordering Sizewell C | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/dec/14/ministers-would-be-wise-to-play-for-time-before-ordering-sizewell-c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/dec/14/ministers-would-be-wise-to-play-for-time-before-ordering-sizewell-c","fields":{"headline":"Ministers would be wise to play for time before ordering Sizewell C","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This is the government’s problem as it reopens talks on a proposed nuclear power station at Sizewell C in Suffolk: it is contemplating ordering a replica of Hinkley Point C before the Somerset original has produced a single megawatt of electricity. That is not a small point. Developer EDF’s pre-Hinkley version of its European pressurised reactor at Flamanville in Normandy is about a decade behind schedule. What’s more, EDF wants UK taxpayers or bill payers to bear more of the construction risks at Sizewell, a less-than-compelling offer when you remember that Flamanville is also €9bn (£8.2bn) over budget. Progress with construction at Hinkley is said to be smoother, even if costs have gone up, but one would prefer to see the thing humming before committing another £20bn. Actual production of electricity won’t happen at Hinkley until 2025 at the earliest and, arguably, the government needs to get a move on with meeting its low-carbon ambitions well before then – or so, the nuclear lobby will inevitably say. Ministers, though, should resist the temptation to make a quick decision. Remember the advice of the Infrastructure Commission in its last assessment of energy needs: a renewables-based system is the best bet and only one new big nuclear plant needs to be commissioned before 2025. That would seem to create space to string out the negotiations with EDF; however hard the French state-backed firm may press for speed. A slow pace would also allow Rolls-Royce to work on its plans for small modular reactors. If these smaller-scale units can turned into a financially competitive alternative to mega-plants of the Hinkley/Sizewell variety, the nuclear outlook would change radically. The Sizewell proposal comes with other problems, including local opposition, the suitability of the site and the still-unclear status of co-financing by China (surely impossible in the current political climate). In short, Sizewell should be viewed only as a last resort. AstraZeneca boss’s record suggests Alexion takeover will pay off The market has spoken on AstraZeneca’s plan to pay $39bn (£29bn) to buy the US biotech group Alexion Pharmaceuticals and, well, it’s not clear what it thinks. A 5.7% fall in AstraZeneca’s share price obviously doesn’t signal wild enthusiasm. But nor can one say it implies a definitive thumbs-down: in a deal of this size, and with two-thirds of the purchase price being paid in shares, an initial wobble is not unusual. There is work for the chief executive, Pascal Soriot, to do to convince his shareholders, one might say. The problem doesn’t seem to be the financial aspects of the deal, where Soriot could point to Alexion’s cash-generative qualities and the likelihood of a short-term boost to AstraZeneca’s earnings, despite offering a 45% takeover premium. Rather, the challenge is explaining the strategic thinking. Alexion is big in rare diseases, which AstraZeneca’s isn’t. On that score, though, Soriot can do little more than ask investors to accept his assessment that Alexion’s pipeline of new molecules is promising and that access to new technology could be useful within AstraZeneca’s existing immunology portfolio. That’s a “trust me” argument, which is not ideal. But AstraZeneca has been transformed on Soriot’s watch by backing the right science at the right moment, sometimes striking out in new directions. The long-term perspective on the share price is a trebling since 2012. That’s a very decent record: one suspects investors will come round in the end. BDO at least did its U-turn on furlough money quickly The 260 partners of BDO seem to have grasped that, if you’re going to perform an embarrassing U-turn, do so quickly. Last Thursday, they said they’d weighed the “moral debate” and thought it fine to keep £4m-worth of furlough receipts from the government – yes, even as they paid themselves an average of £518,000 per head, a grand total of £137m. At the weekend, they capitulated, “recognising the public mood”, and said they’ll send a cheque to HM Revenue &amp; Customs pronto. At a push, one might say it is easier for the directors of Tesco et al to return money to the Treasury, since they’re handling shareholders’ money, rather than their own. But let’s not make excuses for BDO’s original stupidity. The government, when dishing out contracts for public sector work, is supposed to be trying to encourage second-tier firms such as BDO. High-profile own goals just give ministers an excuse to play safe and prefer the big four monopolists. • This article was amended on 15 December 2020.

Here’s where we stand: The US is expected to announce an additional military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn (£2.5bn), according to reports. The new package will be announced on Wednesday, the day the war in Ukraine hits the six-month mark, US officials were cited as saying. It would be the largest such assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war. Many civilians are attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack on the country’s independence day, according to an adviser to Ukraine’s president. Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” that an attack may strike the centres of decision-making in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday. The US has issued a security alert warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. The warning is the first specific security alert the US embassy in Kyiv has issued in recent months and comes after a ban by the Ukrainian government on celebrations in the capital to mark Wednesday’s anniversary of independence from Soviet rule because of fears of attack. The head of Ukraine’s security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, said he expects Russia’s security services to stage a series of terrorist attacks in Russian cities, resulting in large numbers of civilian casualties. Danilov said that the murder on Saturday of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was the first in what he expects to be a number of attacks. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed a “powerful response” in the event of a Russian attack on Kyiv on or around independence day on Wednesday. There was a daily threat of Russian attacks and Ukrainian intelligence was working with foreign intelligence, Zelenskiy said in a joint news conference with the visiting Polish president, Andrzej Duda. Ukraine’s president said the country will not agree to any proposal to freeze the current frontlines in its conflict with Russia in order to “calm” Moscow, which now controls about 22% of Ukraine including Crimea. Speaking at a news conference in Kyiv today, Zelenskiy urged the world not to show fatigue with the war, saying this would pose a big threat to the whole world. Zelenskiy also promised to bring “freedom to Ukraine and citizens in Crimea” and vowed that the Ukrainian flag will fly “where it’s supposed to be” in all occupied parts of Ukraine. The Ukrainian president said Kyiv would restore Ukrainian rule over the Russia-annexed region. “It started in Crimea and it will end in Crimea,” he told an international conference on Crimea. Boris Johnson has urged world leaders not to allow Vladimir Putin to repeat the annexation of Crimea in other parts of Ukraine. Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform summit. Hundreds of people gathered in Moscow for the funeral of Darya Dugina, the daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist ideologues. Dugina, daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was murdered on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside Moscow. Russia’s FSB security service has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of ordering her killing, which Kyiv denies. Russian tourists may be banned from entering Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland if the EU does not enact a bloc-wide ban, according to Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. Russians should not be allowed to enter the EU while their country “is undertaking genocide”, Landsbergis told reporters in Vilnius. It comes after the US rebuffed Ukraine’s demand for a blanket visa ban on Russians. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has demanded a halt to “nuclear sabre-rattling”, saying the world is at a “maximum moment of danger” and all countries with nuclear weapons must make a commitment to “no first-use”. The UN chief described the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, as critical. Shelling and fighting in the area continues. The war in Ukraine has pushed people to “a critical breaking point” with “devastating” knock-on effects that will only grow as the conflict drags on, the Red Cross has warned. Soaring inflation and shortages of essential products like fuel and food in Ukraine and neighbouring countries have left people struggling to afford basic supplies, with the situation becoming more desperate as the weather chills in the weeks ahead. Kyiv has accused Moscow of having organised illegal mass adoptions of Ukrainian children after transferring them from occupied territories to Russia. “More than 1,000 children from Mariupol,” were “illegally transferred to outsiders in Tyumen, Irkutsk, Kemerovo and Altai Krai” in Siberia, a statement by Ukraine’s foreign ministry read. The UN has said it is “very concerned” about plans by Russian-backed authorities to hold trials for captured Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol. Pro-Russian officials appear to be installing metal cages in a hall in Mariupol as part of plans to establish what they were calling an “international tribunal”, a UN rights office spokesperson said, adding that such a process could itself amount to a war crime. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thanks for reading. Here’s some more detail on the US military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn, which would be the single largest assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war. The package will use funds from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, appropriated by the US congress, to allow the Biden administration to procure weapons from industry rather than taking weapons from existing US weapons stocks, Reuters reports. The new weapons do not appear to include types of arms that had not been provided previously to the Ukrainian military, according to a US official. The amount and mix of weapons could change before the formal announcement, expected to take place tomorrow, the official added. Kyiv has accused Moscow of having organised illegal mass adoptions of Ukrainian children after transferring them from occupied territories to Russia. Since the beginning of the war, Kyiv has been accusing Moscow of “deporting” Ukrainians, saying Ukrainians from occupied territories have been forced to go to Russia rather than other regions of Ukraine. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said in a statement: The Russian Federation continues to abduct children from the territory of Ukraine and arrange their illegal adoption by Russian citizens. “More than 1,000 children from Mariupol,” a southern Ukrainian city occupied by Russian troops, “were illegally transferred to outsiders in Tyumen, Irkutsk, Kemerovo and Altai Krai” in Siberia, the statement read. Read the full story here. The US is expected to announce an additional military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn (£2.5bn), according to reports. Associated Press cites US officials as saying that the new package will be announced on Wednesday, the day the war in Ukraine hits the six-month mark. The $3bn weapons assistance package would be the largest such assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war. The money will be used to train and equip Ukrainian forces to fight for years to come, as well as fund contracts for drones, weapons and other equipment that may not see the battlefront for a year or two, the sources said. Unlike most previous aid packages, the new funding will be aimed at helping Ukraine secure its future defence needs, according to officials familiar with the matter. Earlier packages focused on Ukraine’s more immediate needs for weapons and ammunition. The new package is intended to reassure Ukrainian officials that the US is committed to maintaining its support, regardless of the day-to-day back and forth of the conflict, the officials said. The war in Ukraine has pushed people to “a critical breaking point” with “devastating” knock-on effects that will only grow as the conflict drags on, the Red Cross has warned. The organisation said that “even if the conflict were to end tomorrow, it will take years to repair the damage to cities and homes and the impact on families”, AFP reports. Soaring inflation and shortages of essential products like fuel and food in Ukraine and neighbouring countries have left people struggling to afford basic supplies, with the situation becoming more desperate as the weather chills in the weeks ahead. Maksym Dotsenko, head of the Ukrainian Red Cross, said in a virtual press briefing: It will be the hardest winter. The war, now six months old, has stretched the entire humanitarian system and could lead to lasting impacts on the ability of organisations to tackle emergencies worldwide, the Red Cross added. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine will not agree to any proposal to freeze the current frontlines in its conflict with Russia in order to “calm” Moscow, which now controls about 22% of Ukraine including Crimea. Speaking at a news conference in Kyiv today, the Ukrainian president urged the world not to show fatigue with the war, saying this would pose a big threat to the whole world. Zelenskiy told reporters: We’ll get back Crimea by any means we deem right, without consulting other countries. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said Vladimir Putin is betting the bloc’s response to his invasion of Ukraine will fracture as soaring prices hit European voters’ wallets. Russia’s president sees “the weariness of the Europeans and the reluctance of their citizens to bear the consequences of support for Ukraine”, Borrell said in an interview with AFP. “We will have to endure, spread the costs within the EU,” Borrell said. He added: We must give Ukraine support that goes beyond supplying weapons. Faced with someone who refuses to stop the war, we must be able to resist. Keeping the 27 member states united was a task to be carried out “day by day”, Borrell told the news agency. He also said: The member states are masters of their foreign policy. We must ensure that their interests reach a common point. We are always in compromise mode. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said the country expects to receive up to $16bn (£13.5bn) of financial support from its international partners by the end of this year to help it deal with Russia’s invasion. In a statement, Shmyhal said Ukraine had managed to maintain its financial stability thanks to external assistance, which had already accounted for $14bn. More than 40% of the Ukrainian government’s spending so far this year – more than $11.5bn (£9.7bn) – had been allocated to military needs, he added. Hundreds of people have lined up in Moscow to pay tributes to Darya Dugina, the murdered daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist thinkers, hailing her as a martyr whose death must be avenged with victory in the war in Ukraine. Dugina, the daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was killed on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside the capital. Moscow has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of masterminding her killing, a claim Kyiv has denied. Her father, Dugin, 60, who for decades pushed for the creation of a new Russian state that would annex the territory of countries including Ukraine, told mourners his daughter “died for the people, died for Russia”. “The huge price we have to pay can only be justified by the highest achievement, our victory,” a visibly emotional Dugin said. She lived for the sake of victory, and she died for the sake of victory. Our Russian victory, our truth, our Orthodox faith, our state. A large black and white portrait of Dugina, 30, who was reportedly close to her father and worked as a nationalist media commentator, hung on a wall behind her coffin. Read the full story by my colleague Pjotr Sauer here. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Many civilians are attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack on the country’s independence day, according to an adviser to Ukraine’s president. Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” that an attack may strike the centres of decision-making in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday. The US has issued a security alert warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. The warning is the first specific security alert the US embassy in Kyiv has issued in recent months and comes after a ban by the Ukrainian government on celebrations in the capital to mark Wednesday’s anniversary of independence from Soviet rule because of fears of attack. The mayor of Dnipro, Borys Filatov, has said Russian rockets are falling on homes in the city and urged residents to stay under cover. Dnipro is located in south-central Ukraine and has been subjected to Russian long-range missile attacks during the war. The head of Ukraine’s security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, said he expects Russia’s security services to stage a series of terrorist attacks in Russian cities, resulting in large numbers of civilian casualties. Danilov said that the murder on Saturday of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was the first in what he expects to be a number of attacks. Hundreds of people gathered in Moscow for the funeral of Darya Dugina, the daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist ideologues. Dugina, daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was murdered on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside Moscow. Russia’s FSB security service has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of ordering her killing, which Kyiv denies. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has promised to bring “freedom to Ukraine and citizens in Crimea” and vowed that the Ukrainian flag will fly “where it’s supposed to be” in all occupied parts of Ukraine. The Ukrainian president said Kyiv would restore Ukrainian rule over the Russia-annexed region. “It started in Crimea and it will end in Crimea,” he told an international conference on Crimea. The Ukrainian president also vowed a “powerful response” in the event of a Russian attack on Kyiv on or around independence day on Wednesday. There was a daily threat of Russian attacks and Ukrainian intelligence was working with foreign intelligence, Zelenskiy said in a joint news conference with the visiting Polish president, Andrzej Duda. Boris Johnson has urged world leaders not to allow Vladimir Putin to repeat the annexation of Crimea in other parts of Ukraine. Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform summit. Russian forces are likely to have started to move barges to construct a floating bridge over the Dnipro River near the Antonivsky bridge, a British intelligence update said. The bridge in Kherson has been targeted repeatedly by Ukrainian forces with missile strikes as it is a key supply route for Russia in the south of the country. If Russia completes the improvised bridge, it will almost certainly increase the capacity of the crossing point compared with the ferry, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) believes. Russian tourists may be banned from entering Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland if the EU does not enact a bloc-wide ban, according to Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. Russians should not be allowed to enter the EU while their country “is undertaking genocide”, Landsbergis told reporters in Vilnius. It comes after the US rebuffed Ukraine’s demand for a blanket visa ban on Russians. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has demanded a halt to “nuclear sabre-rattling”, saying the world is at a “maximum moment of danger” and all countries with nuclear weapons must make a commitment to “no first-use”. The UN chief described the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, as critical. Shelling and fighting in the area continues. The UN has said it is “very concerned” about plans by Russian-backed authorities to hold trials for captured Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol. Pro-Russian officials appear to be installing metal cages in a hall in Mariupol as part of plans to establish what they were calling an “international tribunal”, a UN rights office spokesperson said, adding that such a process could itself amount to a war crime. Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau has announced fresh sanctions against 62 individuals accused of backing Vladimir Putin’s regime and his invasion of Ukraine. The sanctioned individuals include high-ranking Russian government officials, their family members, and senior officials of currently sanctioned defence sector entities, a statement by the Canadian government said. A total of 33 cargo ships carrying around 719,549 tonnes of foodstuffs have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said. A further 18 vessels were loading or waiting for permission to leave Ukrainian ports, the ministry added. Three Black Sea ports were unblocked under the deal signed on 22 July by Moscow and Kyiv. Monthly payments to UK hosts of Ukrainian refugees should double to help them to provide housing for more than six months amid the cost of living crisis, the minister responsible has said. Councils have warned that homelessness could rise if refugees’ initial six-month placements with hosts end without alternative options in place. Good afternoon from London. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you with all the latest from Ukraine. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. Boris Johnson has urged world leaders not to allow Vladimir Putin to repeat the annexation of Crimea in other parts of Ukraine. Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform summit. Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau has announced fresh sanctions against 62 individuals accused of backing Vladimir Putin’s regime and his invasion of Ukraine. The sanctioned individuals include “high-ranking Russian government officials, including Russian federal governors and regional heads, their family members, and senior officials of currently sanctioned defence sector entities”, a statement by the Canadian government said. In addition, the government has imposed sanctions on the Russian defence firm Avtomatika, which makes drones and electronic voting machines. Monthly payments to UK hosts of Ukrainian refugees should double to help them to provide housing for more than six months amid the cost of living crisis, the minister responsible has said. About 25,000 offers of accommodation from hosts under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have been taken up so far, with an average of three Ukrainians living in each home, Richard Harrington said. Six months after the Russian invasion, the government is asking existing hosts to allow Ukrainians to stay for longer than the minimum period of half a year, while also appealing for new sponsors. The move comes amid soaring living costs, with energy bills expected to rise by 80% going into winter, rocketing inflation and rising interest rates. Councils have also warned that homelessness could rise if refugees’ initial six-month placements with hosts end without alternative options in place.

Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform conference. The PM called on allies to continue to support Ukraine until Russian forces withdrew from the “entirety” of its territory. Johnson said: Putin is planning to do to other parts of Ukraine - indeed all of Ukraine – what he has done to Crimea. The Russian leader was preparing “more annexations and more sham referendums”, he added. Russia’s annexation of Crimea “or any other Ukrainian territory” must never be recognised, Johnson urged. Scouts in the UK have been praised for setting adults an example on how to welcome refugees after they made hundreds of messages of support for Ukrainian families fleeing the war. “You are so brave and I hope you like it here,” wrote one scout in a decorated card. Another said: “REMEMBER YOU ARE LOVED.” Among other messages were: “Let us take you to safety” and “You should try fish and chips.” The messages from scouts aged 12-15 were made to mark six months since the start of Russia’s invasion. They will be shared with recently settled Ukrainian families in the UK in welcome packs from Save the Children. Meg Briody, the head of child and youth participation at Save the Children, said the messages showed the best side of the UK’s attitudes towards refugees. Children and young people are once again setting an example in showing that the UK can be a welcoming place for refugees. Read the full story by my colleague Matthew Weaver here. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has promised to bring “freedom to Ukraine and citizens in Crimea” and vowed that the Ukrainian flag will fly “where it’s supposed to be” in all occupied parts of Ukraine. In a speech to open an international conference on Crimea, the Ukrainian president said Kyiv would restore Ukrainian rule over the Russia-annexed region. Zelenskiy said: To overcome terror, it is necessary to gain victory in the fight against Russian aggression. It is necessary to liberate Crimea. This will be the resuscitation of world law and order. Therefore, we need to free Crimea from occupation as well. It started in Crimea and it will end in Crimea. In a separate speech today to mark Ukraine’s national flag day and on the eve of the country’s independence day, Zelenskiy pledged that the Ukrainian flag will fly “where it’s supposed to be” in all occupied parts of Ukraine. He said: The blue and yellow flag will flutter again at its home, where it’s supposed to be by right, in all temporarily occupied cities and villages of Ukraine. Ukraine’s president also spoke in a joint news conference with visiting Polish president, Andrzej Duda, where he was asked about the possibility of a Russian missile strike on Kyiv on or around independence day on Wednesday. There was a daily threat of Russian attacks and Ukrainian intelligence was working with foreign intelligence, Zelenskiy replied. The response to an attack on the Ukrainian capital would be the same for any Ukrainian city that comes under attack from Russia, he added. Zelenskiy said: If they hit us, they will receive a response, a powerful response. I want to say that each day this response will grow, it will get stronger and stronger. Germany has recorded almost a million refugees from Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February, the country’s interior ministry said. A total of 967,546 people fleeing the war have entered Germany at least temporarily, the ministry said in a statement. Of those who have left Ukraine for Germany, 36% are children. Among the adults, three in four are women and around 8% are over the age of 64. Almost 155,000 Ukrainian pupils have been enrolled at German schools, according to the conference of state education ministers in Berlin. The UN has said it is “very concerned” about plans by Russian-backed authorities to hold trials for captured Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol, saying that such a process could itself amount to a war crime. Pro-Russian officials appear to be installing metal cages in a hall in Mariupol as part of plans to establish what they were calling an “international tribunal”, according to Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the UN rights office. She said: We are very concerned about the manner in which this is being done. There are pictures in the media of cages being built in Mariupol’s philharmonic hall, really massive cages and apparently the idea is to restrain the prisoners. She added: This is not acceptable, this is humiliating. Willfully depriving a prisoner of war to the right to a fair trial amounts to a war crime by Russia, she said, adding that Ukrainian PoWs were entitled to protection under the Geneva conventions. Last week, Ukrainian military intelligence said Russian forces were allegedly planning to display captured Ukrainian soldiers in iron cages during a “show trial” in Mariupol on the country’s independence day. The captured fighters who will reportedly be displayed in the cages in Mariupol’s philharmonic hall are those who were captured while defending the formerly-besieged Azovstal steel plant. Russian tourists may be banned from entering Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland if the EU does not enact a bloc-wide ban, according to Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged the EU to introduce a travel ban on Russian tourists, arguing that the “most important sanction” was to “close the borders, because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land”. The Ukrainian president’s call has been backed by several EU leaders including the Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, and her Estonian counterpart, Kaja Kallas. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland all share a border with Russia. Russians should not be allowed to enter the EU while their country “is undertaking genocide”, Landsbergis told reporters in Vilnius today. He said: I have talked to ministers from all these countries … I don’t see many differences politically. On Monday, the US rebuffed Ukraine’s demand for a blanket visa ban on Russians, saying the Biden administration had already imposed visa restrictions for Kremlin officials but that its focus would be on identifying those involved in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and holding them accountable. A US state department spokesperson said: The US wouldn’t want to close off pathways to refuge and safety for Russia’s dissidents or others who are vulnerable to human rights abuses. An adviser to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said many civilians are attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack on the country’s independence day tomorrow. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” that an attack may strike the centres of decision-making in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday. Rodnyansky said: People are reacting to the news. They are trying to ensure they have contingency plans, they don’t want to spend too much time near the centre near the buildings of our government. He added: There is a risk Russia will try to strike exactly at that time to compensate for their inability to have any success on the battlefield, to have any success in subduing Ukraine and basically all the failures they have run up over the last six months. Rodnyansky’s comments came after the US warned Russia may “step up” efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. Ukraine’s defence ministry has advised Ukrainians to be especially careful on independence day, citing the threat of missile attacks and “provocations” from Russia. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The head of Ukraine’s security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, said he expects Russia’s security services to stage a series of terrorist attacks in Russian cities, resulting in large numbers of civilian casualties. Danilov said that the murder on Saturday of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was the first in what he expects to be a number of attacks. He also said support for the war in Russia is falling and the Kremlin needs to introduce general mobilisation. The time is just after 1pm in Ukraine.

Three Black Sea ports were unblocked under the deal signed on 22 July by Moscow and Kyiv. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk reported that 825 people have been evacuated from the Kharkiv region in north-east Ukraine. In a message on her Telegram channel, she said: A successful humanitarian operation: 825 people were evacuated from the uncontrolled part of Kharkiv region today, 238 of them were children. Poland’s president Andrzej Duda has arrived in Kyiv for talks with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The duo will engage in talks on the current wartime situation in Ukraine, economic and humanitarian support and bilateral cooperation, according to Duda’s official Twitter channel. The US state department has issued a security alert warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. A security alert issued by the US embassy in Kyiv on Tuesday reads: “The department of state has information that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days.” Ukrainian sources are reporting Russian forces struck a boiler plant in Ukraine’s southern city of Mariupol. Adviser to the city’s mayor, Petro Andryushchenko, reported that Russian forces struck the city’s boiler facility in a Telegram post early this morning. Monthly payments to British sponsors of Ukrainian refugees should double to help them carry on hosting for longer than six months while the cost of living spirals, the minister responsible has said. The price of achieving fire parity and destroying Russian army logistics is “less than a Russian oligarch’s yacht”, a senior adviser to the Ukrainian president has said. Russia has accused Ukraine’s intelligence services of carrying out the murder of Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue. Russia’s FSB security service published information and a video it said showed a Ukrainian woman from the country’s Azov regiment was responsible for the murder. The Guardian reports the claim lacks credibility. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has demanded a halt to “nuclear sabre-rattling”, saying the world is at a “maximum moment of danger” and all countries with nuclear weapons must make a commitment to “no first-use”. The UN chief described the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, as critical. Shelling and fighting in the area continues. Moscow has requested a UN security council meeting be held on Tuesday to discuss the Zaporizhzhia plant, Russian state-owned news agency RIA reported, citing deputy ambassador to the UN Dmitry Polyanskiy. Ukrainian soldiers who were taken prisoner after the battle for Mariupol have accused Russian forces of torture during their captivity. The soldiers, who were from the Azov regiment and released as part of a prisoner exchange, told reporters they saw soldiers that were beaten until their bones were broken. “Some had needles inserted into their wounds, some were tortured with water,” said Vladyslav Zhaivoronok, who lost a leg. “They undressed us, forced to squat while we are naked. If any of the boys raised their heads, they began to beat them immediately,” added Denys Chepurko. Hundreds of people gathered in Moscow for the funeral of Darya Dugina, the slain daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist ideologues. Dugina, daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was murdered on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside Moscow. Russia’s FSB security service has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of ordering her killing, something Kyiv denies. Senior politicians, fellow nationalists and friends filed past Dugina’s dark wooden casket in a hall at Moscow’s TV centre on Tuesday morning to say goodbye, lay flowers, and convey their condolences to her parents who were sitting nearby. A large black and white photograph of Dugina, 30, who worked as a journalist and nationalist media commentator, hung on a black wall behind her casket as sombre music played, Reuters reports. Her father, Dugin, 60, who has for years advocated the creation of a new Russian empire that would absorb the territory of countries such as Ukraine, told mourners his daughter had died for Russia. A visibly distressed Dugin said: If her tragic death has touched someone, she would have asked them to defend sacred (Russian) Orthodoxy, the people and the Fatherland. She died for Russia, in the motherland and on the frontline which is not in Ukraine but here. Dnipro mayor Borys Filatov has said that rockets are falling on homes and urged Ukrainians in the city to stay under cover. In a post on his Facebook page he said: Pls stay under cover. There are already facts of rockets falling on private houses. Details to come later. We are waiting for official information from the Military Administration. Dnipro is located in south-central Ukraine and has been subjected to Russian long-range missile attacks during the war. Porsches, Bentleys and other luxury cars with Russian licence plates are filling up the parking garage at Helsinki’s airport as Finland becomes an important transit country for Russian tourists flying to Europe, reports AFP. The European Union shut its airspace to Russian planes after Moscow invaded Ukraine, forcing anyone who wants to travel to Europe to drive across the border or take a circuitous route using non-Western airlines. A quick stroll through the carpark at the Helsinki airport revealed dozens if not hundreds of high-end cars with Russian plates, including a new Mercedes-Benz S-class sedan and Porsche 911 Turbo S. Finnish foreign minister Pekka Haavisto told AFP that the Nordic nation has become a “transit country” for Russian tourists. Finland said last week it would limit Russian tourist visas to 10% of current volumes as of 1 September due to rising discontent over Russian tourism amid the war in Ukraine. But Russians continue to enter Finland with visas issued by other EU countries in the Schengen borderless travel area for their journeys. Schengen rules do not allow Finland to close the border to specific nationalities, Haavisto said. Such sanctions can only be decided jointly by the EU. The European Commission acknowledged last week that discussions were under way to see if a “coordinated approach” on Russian visas could be reached. EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has paid tribute to Ukrainians for “giving their lives to protect the values” on which the European bloc is built. To commemorate the Europe-wide Day of Remembrance for the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes today, she said in a statement: On 23 August, we honour the memory of the victims of totalitarian and authoritarian regimes, in Europe and beyond. Today, on the 83rd anniversary of the signature of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, this date carries a special significance. This year, Putin brought the horrors of war back to Europe, along with the reminder that peace cannot be taken for granted. The painful memory of the past is not just a distant recollection, but has found an echo in Russia’s illegal and unjustified war against Ukraine. We are inspired by the courage of those who then stood up to injustice, and we express our respect and support for the many men and women who are forced to do it again today. Ukrainian people are giving their lives to protect the values on which our Union is built. Today more than ever, we stand united against the Russian state-controlled propaganda that distorts history, spreads conspiracy and punishes those who oppose it. We will continue with determination our work to counter disinformation. And we will ensure that those who stood against totalitarianism will not be forgotten. Russian forces are likely to have started to move barges to construct a floating bridge over the Dnipro River near the Antonivsky bridge, a British intelligence update said. The bridge in Kherson has been targeted repeatedly by Ukrainian forces with missile strikes as it is a key supply route for Russia in the south of the country. For several weeks, Russian forces and local civilians have relied on a ferry crossing of the waterway, the update said. If Russia completes the improvised bridge, it will almost certainly increase the capacity of the crossing point compared with the ferry, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) believes. The update added that the floating bridge would likely still be vulnerable to Ukrainian assaults. A total of 33 cargo ships carrying around 719,549 tonnes of foodstuffs have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said. The Joint Coordination Centre in Turkey, which monitors implementation of the agreement, put the total amount of grain and foodstuffs exported from three Ukrainian Black Sea ports since the deal was reached at 721,449 tonnes. Ukraine‘s grain exports slumped after Russia invaded the country on 24 February and blockaded its Black Sea ports, driving up global food prices and prompting fears of shortages in Africa and the Middle East, reports Reuters. Three Black Sea ports were unblocked under the deal signed on 22 July by Moscow and Kyiv. In addition to the vessels that have already left Ukraine, the agriculture ministry said a further 18 were loading or waiting for permission to leave Ukrainian ports. The ministry said Ukrainian grain exports could reach 4m tonnes in August, compared with 3m tonnes in July. Isobel Koshiw reports: The US state department has issued a security alert warning that Russia is “stepping up” efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. The warning, issued on Tuesday, is the first specific security alert issued by the US embassy in Kyiv in recent months. It does not say what places it believes Russia plans to target, but advised US citizens to leave Ukraine if safe to do so. The alert comes a day before Ukraine marks 31 years as an independent state. On 24 August 1991, Ukraine’s parliament voted to separate from the Soviet Union. The day will also mark six months since Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Some restaurants in Kyiv have been closing early this week because of the perceived increased threat.

In a message on her Telegram channel, she said: A successful humanitarian operation: 825 people were evacuated from the uncontrolled part of Kharkiv region today, 238 of them were children. We thank the head of Kharkiv OVA Oleg Sinegubov for organizing the process, as well as volunteer organizations for their dedication and help. Poland’s president Andrzej Duda has arrived in Kyiv for talks with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The duo will engage in talks on the current wartime situation in Ukraine, economic and humanitarian support and bilateral cooperation, according to Duda’s official Twitter channel. Pawel Szrot told reporters: The visit will include a meeting with President (Volodymyr) Zelenskiy and talks on military support and defence of Ukraine in the economic, humanitarian and political sense,” Pawel Szrot told reporters. The presidents will discuss the political support Poland could offer to convince other countries to keep helping Ukraine. Duda has met Zelenskiy five times this year, including on three visits he has made to Ukraine since the start of the invasion in February this year. Exports of key Ukrainian agricultural commodities have fallen by almost half since the start of the Russian invasion earlier this year compared with the same period in 2021, data from the agriculture ministry showed late on Monday. Ukrainian seaports have been blocked since the Russian invasion started in late February, leaving a vast amount of crops either unharvested or destroyed, reports Reuters. Agricultural exports between 24 February and 15 August this year fell to 10m tonnes from around 19.5m in the same period last year, the ministry data showed. The 2022 grain harvest in Ukraine is forecast to fall to around 50m tonnes from a record 86m tonnes in 2021. At the end of July, three Ukrainian Black Sea ports were unblocked under a deal between Moscow and Kyiv, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. But even with the ports opened, Ukraine‘s agricultural exports are significantly lower than before the conflict, when Ukraine exported up to 6m tonnes of grain a month. It is 9am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: The US state department has issued a security alert warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days.

Adviser to the city’s mayor, Petro Andryushchenko, reported that Russian forces struck the city’s boiler facility in a Telegram post early this morning. Monthly payments to British sponsors of Ukrainian refugees should double to help them carry on hosting for longer than six months while the cost of living spirals, the minister responsible has said. The price of achieving fire parity and destroying Russian army logistics is “less than a Russian oligarch’s yacht”, a senior adviser to the Ukrainian president has said. Russia has accused Ukraine’s intelligence services of carrying out the murder of Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue. Russia’s FSB security service published information and a video it said showed a Ukrainian woman from the country’s Azov regiment was responsible for the murder. The Guardian reports the claim lacks credibility. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has demanded a halt to “nuclear sabre-rattling”, saying the world is at a “maximum moment of danger” and all countries with nuclear weapons must make a commitment to “no first-use”. The UN chief described the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, as critical. Shelling and fighting in the area continues. Moscow has requested a UN security council meeting be held on Tuesday to discuss the Zaporizhzhia plant, Russian state-owned news agency RIA reported, citing deputy ambassador to the UN Dmitry Polyanskiy. Ukrainian soldiers who were taken prisoner after the battle for Mariupol have accused Russian forces of torture during their captivity. The soldiers, who were from the Azov regiment and released as part of a prisoner exchange, told reporters they saw soldiers that were beaten until their bones were broken. “Some had needles inserted into their wounds, some were tortured with water,” said Vladyslav Zhaivoronok, who lost a leg. “They undressed us, forced to squat while we are naked. If any of the boys raised their heads, they began to beat them immediately,” added Denys Chepurko. The sole bridge across the strategic Dnieper River in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson was reportedly hit by US-supplied high-precision Himars rockets injuring 15 people, a source told Russia’s Interfax news agency. The bridge is a key crossing for Russian military transport in the region. Three villages in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region were battered by Russian artillery and multiple rocket launchers on Monday. Soledar, Zaytseve and Bilohorivka near the city of Bakhmut were struck, killing at least two civilians, Ukrainian authorities said. Nearly 9,000 Ukrainian military personnel have been killed in the war with Russia, the head of Ukraine’s armed forces, general Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said on Monday. The office of the UN high commissioner for human rights said on Monday 5,587 civilians had been killed and 7,890 wounded between 24 February and 21 August, mainly from artillery, rocket and missile attacks. The price of achieving fire parity and destroying Russian army logistics is “less than a Russian oligarch’s yacht”, a senior advisor to the Ukrainian president has said. Mykhailo Podolyak suggested that 50 US-supplied Himars long-range weapons systems, at the cost of about $200m, would be needed to “completely change the course of this war”. Moscow has requested a UN security council meeting be held later today to discuss the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Russian state-owned news agency RIA reported, citing deputy ambassador to the UN Dmitry Polyanskiy. The nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, has been taken over by Russian troops and has come under repeated shelling in recent weeks, raising fears of a nuclear disaster. It is unclear whether the meeting will be going ahead. Monthly payments to British sponsors of Ukrainian refugees should double to help them carry on hosting for longer than six months while the cost of living spirals, the minister responsible has said. Around 25,000 offers of accommodation from hosts under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have been taken up so far, with an average of three Ukrainians living in each home, PA Media cited Lord Richard Harrington as saying. Lord Harrington said he has been lobbying the Treasury “very hard” to double the £350-a-month “thank you” payment for sponsors who house refugees for longer than half a year – the minimum period expected of hosts. He told PA Media: The costs … they’re paying maybe a big chunk of rent themselves, the mortgage payments have gone up and everything, and I think it’s perfectly reasonable, in my view, to increase the amount that we’re paying them.” More than 115,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK under its visa schemes, according to the latest government figures, including around 81,700 refugees under the sponsorship scheme. Around 4,000-5,000 people are arriving each week, Lord Harrington added. Ukrainian sources are reporting Russian forces struck a boiler plant in Ukraine’s southern city of Mariupol. Adviser to the city’s mayor, Petro Andryushchenko, reported that Russian forces struck the city’s boiler facility in a Telegram post early this morning. “The Russians made an explosion again. Loud that the whole city could hear. Just blowing up the boiler room. Instead of preparing the city for winter and building boiler houses, the occupiers destroy even the remains …” Unconfirmed video footage purportedly showing the moment the facility was struck has circulated online. The UN’s secretary-general, António Guterres, has demanded a halt to “nuclear sabre-rattling”, saying the world is at a “maximum moment of danger” and all countries with nuclear weapons must make a commitment to “no first-use”. The UN chief described the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, as critical. Shelling and fighting in the area continues. In a statement released after ambassadors met at the UN security council on Monday, Guterres stressed: Nuclear saber-rattling must stop … come to the negotiating table to ease tensions and end the nuclear arms race, once and for all.” At this moment of “maximum danger for our world”, the secretary-general emphasised that “humanity’s future is in our hands”, insisting that division be replaced with dialogue and diplomacy, to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”. He argued that negotiation, compromise, and accountability are required for the future, attesting that as it represents the nations of the world, the UN is “humanity’s best hope to build a better, more peaceful tomorrow”. The US state department has issued a security alert warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. A security alert issued by the US embassy in Kyiv on Tuesday reads: The department of state has information that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days.” The US intelligence community on Monday declassified a finding that determined that Russia would increasingly target Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, according to a US official familiar with the intelligence. The official was not authorised to comment publicly about the finding and spoke on the condition of anonymity, the Associated Press reported. The alert also urged US citizens still in Ukraine to depart the country immediately. “If you hear a loud explosion or if sirens are activated, immediately seek cover,” the state department said. “If in a home or a building, go to the lowest level of the structure with the fewest exterior walls, windows, and openings; close any doors and sit near an interior wall, away from any windows or openings.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

The US has rejected Ukraine’s call for a blanket ban on visas for Russians, saying Washington would not want to close off pathways to refuge for Russia’s dissidents and others who are vulnerable to human rights abuses. The EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, also said he opposes a complete ban on visas for Russians. The German chancellor says he is working fast to find alternatives to Russian gas. Olaf Scholz said he aims to extricate Germany from its dependence on Russian gas and pursue new energy supplies. Scholz met Canada’s prime minster, Justin Trudeau, in Montreal on Monday. The two leaders are set to sign a deal for Canada to supply clean hydrogen to Germany. Ukraine has restored a rail link to neighbouring Moldova which could carry 10m tonnes of freight a year, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. The 22km (12 mile) line runs from western Ukraine to Moldova. Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksander Kubrakov, said the link would provide an alternative route from the Black Sea port of Odesa. Ukraine’s agricultural exports are likely to rise to about 4m tonnes in August, from 3m tonnes in July, a deputy chair of the Ukrainian agrarian council said. The uptick is due to a UN-brokered deal that unblocked Ukrainian seaports. Europe faces fresh disruption to energy supplies due to damage to a pipeline system bringing oil from Kazakhstan through Russia that was reported by the pipeline operator on Monday. Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) said exports from two of its three mooring points at a Black Sea terminal had been suspended. A senior Russian diplomat has ruled out a diplomatic solution to ending the war in Ukraine. Gennady Gatilov, Russia’s permanent representative to the UN in Geneva, told the Financial Times that there would be no direct talks between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, adding that Moscow expects a prolonged conflict."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/dec/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-north-korea-denies-supplying-russias-wagner-group-with-weapons-air-raid-sirens-sound-in-mykolaiv","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-23T18:45:17Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Russia accused of demolishing Mariupol theatre ‘to hide war crimes’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-north-korea-denies-supplying-russias-wagner-group-with-weapons-air-raid-sirens-sound-in-mykolaiv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/dec/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-north-korea-denies-supplying-russias-wagner-group-with-weapons-air-raid-sirens-sound-in-mykolaiv","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Russia accused of demolishing Mariupol theatre ‘to hide war crimes’ – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s nearly 9pm in Kyiv. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Here’s where things stand: President Vladimir Putin has ordered his country’s defence industry chiefs to ensure the Russian army gets all the weapons, equipment and military hardware it needs “in the shortest possible timeframes” to fight in Ukraine. Putin’s remarks came just days after he pledged to give his army anything it asks for in a meeting with Russia’s top military officials. Russian forces have started demolishing a theatre in occupied Mariupol in southern Ukraine that was the site of a deadly airstrike believed to have killed hundreds of civilians, according to an aide to the city’s exiled Ukrainian mayor. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, said the move was an “attempt to hide forever the evidence of the deliberate killing of Ukrainians by Russians”. Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, warned the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high” and compared US-Russia relations to an “ice age” in comments reported by the Russian state-owned Tass news agency. The Kremlin on Thursday accused the US of fighting a proxy war against Russia, after Washington boosted military support for Ukraine and hosted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the White House and Congress. Russian forces shelled the recently liberated Kherson region more than 60 times on Thursday, according to the head of the region’s military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych. Two civilians were killed by Russian shelling on the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine Friday morning, according to the regional prosecutor’s office. Two people were injured after a car bomb exploded in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol in south-eastern Ukraine, according to a local pro-Moscow official. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia province, described the incident as a “terrorist attack” carried out by “militants of the Kyiv regime” to the Russian state media. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, wrote on Telegram that eyewitnesses reported a car was “blown up”. The Kremlin has claimed that Russia has made significant progress towards “demilitarising” Ukraine – one of the initial goals of Russia’s invasion 10 months ago. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, was asked during a briefing about comments by President Vladimir Putin that Ukraine’s military-industrial complex “if not completely reset to zero, is getting there fast”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted a video on Friday saying he was back at work in Kyiv after his landmark visit to Washington this week. “I am in my office. We are working toward victory,” he said in the video posted to his Telegram channel. Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to the White House confirmed that Ukraine and the US are “strategic partners” for the first time in history, the Ukrainian leader’s most senior adviser has said. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainan president’s office, told the Guardian that the trip on Wednesday had cemented Zelenskiy’s bond with the US president, Joe Biden – and with senior US Republicans. North Korea’s foreign ministry denied a media report it had supplied munitions to Russia, calling it “groundless,” and denounced the US for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, North Korea’s official KCNA news agency reported. The White House yesterday said the Wagner Group took delivery of an arms shipment from North Korea to help bolster Russian forces in Ukraine, a sign of the group’s expanding role in the war. The Canadian government said Pyongyang’s transaction with the Wagner Group “clearly violates international law and UN security council resolutions”. The top Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said on Friday that shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, had “almost stopped”. Speaking on Russian state television, governor Yevgeny Balitsky said Russian troops would not leave the nuclear plant, and that it would never return to Ukrainian control. A Russian opposition politician has filed a legal challenge over President Vladimir Putin’s use of the word “war” to describe the conflict in Ukraine. Putin on Thursday publicly acknowledged the situation as a “war” for the first time since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February, after 10 months of calling his campaign a “special military operation”. Ukraine plans to open new embassies in 10 African countries, its president has announced, with the aim of increasing Kyiv’s presence in Africa and strengthening trade ties. There are also plans to develop a “Ukraine-Africa trade house” with offices in the capitals of “the most promising countries” on the African continent, Zelenskiy added. Here’s more from Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who was speaking earlier at a conference of Ukrainian ambassadors in Kyiv. Zelenskiy described his visit to the US as “a very important benchmark, as a set bar” at the meeting, adding: I do not have the opportunity to make foreign visits – I simply do not have it, because there’s no time. President Vladimir Putin has ordered his country’s defence industry chiefs to ensure the Russian army gets all the weapons, equipment and military hardware it needs “in the shortest possible timeframes” to fight in Ukraine. The Russian leader was speaking at the start of the meeting with defence industry officials gathered from across the country in the city of Tula, a centre for Russian arms manufacturing. Putin said: The most important key task of our military-industrial complex is to provide our units and frontline forces with everything they need: weapons, equipment, ammunition, and gear in the necessary quantities and of the right quality in the shortest possible timeframes. It’s also important to perfect and significantly improve the technical characteristics of weapons and equipment for our fighters based on the combat experience we have gained. He added that he was looking forward to their “proposals on addressing the problems that are inevitable in this large piece of work and how we will move forward and make sure there are fewer of them”. Putin’s remarks came just days after he pledged to give his army anything it asks for in a meeting with Russia’s top military officials. Speaking in Moscow at the closing session of the expanded board of the ministry of defence on Wednesday, he said there were no “funding restrictions” for the military. He added: The country, the government will give everything that the army asks for. Everything. Russia is expected to dramatically increase its spending on the military in the next two years, as Putin signals that he is preparing for a prolonged and costly war with Ukraine. Earlier this month, he said the conflict could turn into a “long-term process”, and the Kremlin shows no intention of climbing down from its maximalist goals of regime change in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to the White House confirmed that Ukraine and the US are “strategic partners” for the first time in history, the Ukrainian leader’s most senior adviser has said in an interview on his return home. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainan president’s office, told the Guardian that the trip on Wednesday had cemented Zelenskiy’s bond with the US president, Joe Biden – and with senior US Republicans, despite “dirty” comments made by the Fox News host Tucker Carlson. The summit and press conference between the two leaders this week demonstrated “how deeply in personal attitude President Biden feels everything which is connected to Ukraine”, Yermak said, and that the US was “a real leader of the free world and democracy”. Yermak’s emphasis on the personal links forged by the surprise visit, the first time Zelenskiy had been outside Ukraine since the start of the war, comes despite a failure to immediately obtain the US Abrams tanks, F-16 fighter jets and long-range army tactical missile system ATACMS that Ukraine has said it needs to defeat Russia. But it demonstrates a belief in Kyiv that Ukraine must emphasise the moral dimension of its fight against the invading Russian army and its faith in its relationship with the US to unlock more and more of the military aid it badly needs as the war heads towards its first anniversary in February. Yermak, who was by Zelenskiy’s side during the trip, said: It’s [the] first time in history that Ukraine and [the] United States are close as strategic partners. There is a very warm, very friendly relationship, [a] personal relationship between [the] two presidents. As well as the meeting with Biden, Yermak highlighted meetings Zelenskiy had with US congressional leaders, including those with senior Republicans Mitch McConnell, the senate minority leader, and Kevin McCarthy, the leading candidate to become House speaker next month. Read the full story here: Ukraine plans to open new embassies in 10 African countries, its president has announced, with the aim of increasing Kyiv’s presence in Africa and strengthening trade ties. Speaking at a conference of Ukrainian ambassadors, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: We are already rebooting relations with dozens of African countries. Next year, we have to strengthen them. Ten countries have already been designated in Africa where new embassies of Ukraine will be opened. There are also plans to develop a “Ukraine-Africa trade house” with offices in the capitals of “the most promising countries” on the African continent, he added. Zelenskiy continued: In addition to the existing representation of Ukraine in 10 African countries, together with new embassies and trading houses, we should achieve representation in 30 countries of the African continent. Like many Ukrainian refugees, Yuliia Kashperenko will spend Christmas away from home this year. She feels upset at the thought of being away from her family and friends in Ukraine, but comforted to know she will spend the holiday with her host and their children in south London. Kashperenko, 25, arrived the UK in October, leaving her parents behind in the Kyiv region. “With this family, I feel like I’m with my family,” she says. I realise it’s better to stay here. I’m in a safe place with good people. The Ukrainian government advised refugees not to go home over Christmas, because of fears the country’s energy infrastructure would not be able to deal with the demand, meaning many will spend the holiday apart from loved ones. Ukrainians traditionally celebrate Christmas on 7 January, according to the Julian calendar, but after Russia’s invasion the country’s Orthodox church is allowing its congregations to observe the 25 December date instead, in a move toward the west. Kashperenko, who worked in the media and as a copywriter in Ukraine, arrived in London after applying to the Homes for Ukraine scheme. She fled because she was worried about attacks on the capital and being forced to survive the winter without power. “I understood that Russia was going to destroy cities and energy systems,” she says. Read the full story here: Ukraine’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has called for Iran, North Korea and Belarus to be held accountable for their alleged involvement in Russia’s war in Ukraine. Podolyak’s tweet came a day after the White House accused North Korea of supplying arms to the private Russian mercenary firm the Wagner Group to help bolster Moscow’s troops in Ukraine. Kyiv has accused Tehran of supplying thousands of its drones to Moscow, which used them in deadly attacks on cities such as Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia. After initially denying the presence of Iranian drones in Ukraine, the Tehran government has admitted that it had supplied a “small number” of the unmanned aircraft to Russia months before Vladimir Putin launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine in February. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has previously allowed the Kremlin to use his country as a platform to send tens of thousands of Russian troops into Ukraine, while Russian war jets have taken off from Belarusian bases. But Lukashenko has not joined the war directly or sent his own troops into the fight. Russian forces have started demolishing a theatre in occupied Mariupol in southern Ukraine that was the site of a deadly airstrike believed to have killed hundreds of civilians, according to an aide to the city’s exiled Ukrainian mayor. Petro Andryushchenko accused the occupying authorities of attempting to cover up the Russian bombing of the theatre, which was being used as an air raid shelter when it was hit on 16 March. An investigation by Amnesty International into the Mariupol theatre strike concluded that Russian forces committed a war crime by deliberately targeting the building despite knowing hundreds of civilians were sheltering there. Video posted on social media appears to show diggers demolishing the last remaining walls of the theatre. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, said the move was an “attempt to hide forever the evidence of the deliberate killing of Ukrainians by Russians”. The Russian occupying authorities were planning to leave the front of the theatre intact and destroy the rest of the structure, to build a new theatre “on the bones of Mariupol’s people”, Andryushchenko said. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, warned the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high” and compared US-Russia relations to an “ice age” in comments reported by the Russian state-owned Tass news agency.

Putin on Thursday publicly acknowledged the situation as a “war” for the first time since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February, after 10 months of calling his campaign a “special military operation”. The Canadian government has condemned reports that North Korea has supplied battlefield missiles and rockets to the Wagner Group, a private Russian mercenary company, for use in Ukraine. The White House yesterday said the Wagner Group took delivery of an arms shipment from North Korea to help bolster Russian forces in Ukraine, a sign of the group’s expanding role in the war. Pyongyang’s transaction with the Wagner Group “clearly violates international law and UN security council resolutions”, Canada’s foreign ministry said. Mélanie Joly, Canada’s foreign minister, said in a statement: We will continue to work with international partners to address these developments and respond to further arms deliveries should they take place. The Wagner group’s owner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, denied the White House’s accusation as “gossip and speculation”. North Korea’s foreign ministry also denied it had supplied munitions to Russia but did not make any mention of Wagner. If one battle more than any other has defined the brutality of Russia’s war in Ukraine, it is the three-month siege of Mariupol’s steelworks this spring, and the harrowing experience of its last defenders. Holed up in Azovstal, one of Europe’s largest metal-producing plants, hundreds of outnumbered, outgunned, wounded and emaciated Ukrainian soldiers, and more than 1,000 civilians, resisted one of Moscow’s fiercest military attacks for more than 80 days. “No one came out of there unchanged,” says Oksana, an Azovstal employee who asked not to give her full name. They were one person when they went in, and another person when they came out. Soon after the Russian invasion in late February, Mariupol was one of the first major cities to be encircled. Viewed as a key Kremlin objective, the city was the scene of a siege that the Red Cross has defined as “apocalyptic”. The outskirts of the city became the site of a mass grave, and the bodies of many more men, women and children were either dumped in the streets or remain buried beneath the rubble. Ukrainian authorities estimate that 22,000 people died during the fighting. Some survivors took refuge in the Azovstal steelworks, an industrial site covering an area of about four square miles, including a network of underground tunnels. With the civilians were about 3,000 soldiers, many of whom were members of the notorious Azov brigade, which, at its inception in 2014, included far-right volunteers, some with neo-Nazi affiliations. In recent years the brigade has been fully integrated into the Ukrainian military, but for President Vladimir Putin it was the perfect propaganda opportunity to convince the public that his narrative about the “nazification” of Ukraine was true, and that his army would hunt them down like rats. Never would Putin have imagined that the last defenders of Mariupol would defy his plan for so long. Cut off from the world and low on food, the defenders of Azovstal were holed up in the tunnels of the steelworks for over two months while the Russians launched rockets and incendiary bombs at the site.

Canada condemned what it said were North Korean arms deliveries to Russia, saying Pyongyang’s transaction with the private military company the Wagner Group “clearly violates international law and UN security council resolutions”. “We will continue to work with international partners to address these developments and respond to further arms deliveries should they take place,” the Canadian foreign affairs minister, Mélanie Joly, said in a statement. North Korea’s foreign ministry, in a statement, has denied that it has supplied munitions to Russia but did not make any mention of Wagner, Reuters reported. Two civilians have been killed by Russian shelling on the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine this morning, according to the regional prosecutor’s office. In a post on Telegram, it said: According to the investigation, in the morning of December 23, two local residents of the city of Kherson were killed in another shelling by Russian military personnel. Residential buildings and critical infrastructure were damaged. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, said Russian shelling of the Korabelnyi district in Kherson killed one person. The victim, a male, “sustained fatal mine blast injuries”, Tymoshenko wrote on Telegram. A Russian opposition politician has filed a legal challenge over President Vladimir Putin’s use of the word “war” to describe the conflict in Ukraine. Putin yesterday publicly acknowledged the situation as a “war” for the first time since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February, after 10 months of calling his campaign a “special military operation”. In March, Putin formally signed a law that would impose harsh jail terms for people who intentionally spread “fake” information about Russia’s armed forces, including calling the war by its name. But the Russian leader said at a news conference on Thursday: Our goal is not to spin this flywheel of a military conflict, but, on the contrary, to end this war. This is what we are striving for. Nikita Yuferev, an opposition councillor in St Petersburg, has asked prosecutors to investigate Putin for using the word “war”, and accused the president of breaking his own law. In an open letter, he asked the prosecutor general and interior minister to “hold (Putin) responsible under the law for spreading fake news about the actions of the Russian army”. He told Reuters that he knew his legal challenge would go nowhere, but he had filed it to expose the “mendacity” of the system. Yuferev said: It’s important for me to do this to draw attention to the contradiction and the injustice of these laws that he (Putin) adopts and signs but which he himself doesn’t observe. I think the more we talk about this, the more people will doubt his honesty, his infallibility, and the less support he will have. Two people were injured after a car bomb exploded in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol in south-eastern Ukraine, according to a local pro-Moscow official. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia province, told the state-owned Tass news agency: The blast occurred in front of the entrance to Gorky Park. A car exploded. The causes and circumstances are being investigated. He described the incident as a “terrorist attack” carried out by “militants of the Kyiv regime” to the Russian state-owned news agency Ria Novosti. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, wrote on Telegram that eyewitnesses reported a car was “blown up”. It has not been possible to independently verify these claims. Russian forces shelled the recently liberated Kherson region more than 60 times on Thursday, killing one person and injuring two others, according to the head of the region’s military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych. Moscow’s troops “shelled the territory of Kherson region 61 times. The invaders attacked peaceful settlements of the region with artillery, MLRS, mortars and tanks”, Yanushevych wrote in an update on Facebook. About half the strikes hit Kherson city, striking residential blocks, educational institutions and private houses, he said. A kindergarten was also impacted, he added. The Kremlin has claimed that Russia has made significant progress towards “demilitarising” Ukraine – one of the initial goals of Russia’s invasion 10 months ago. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, was asked during a briefing about comments by President Vladimir Putin that Ukraine’s military-industrial complex “if not completely reset to zero, is getting there fast”. Peskov told reporters: It can be stated that there is significant progress towards demilitarisation. The Russian president said yesterday that “all armed conflicts end through negotiations” – implying that Ukraine would ultimately be forced to cede territory in exchange for peace. He also dismissed US supplies of Patriot missiles to Ukraine as old and said Russia’s missile systems would be able to shoot it down. Putin said: The Patriot air defence is outdated. An antidote will always be found … Russia will knock down the Patriot system. The Netherlands will provide Ukraine with up to €2.5bn (£2.2bn) in aid in 2023, the Dutch government has announced. The money is earmarked for military assistance, work to recover critical infrastructure and to help investigations into possible war crimes, it said. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, vowed that his country would provide assistance “as long as Russia continues its war against Ukraine”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, confirmed he had spoken with Rutte and thanked him for the €2.5bn aid. Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, has been quoted by the state-owned Tass news agency as saying that the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high”. Antonov was quoted comparing the state of US-Russia relations to an “ice age” and that it was hard to say when talks between the two sides could resume. Washington needed time “to realise the futility of its policy towards Moscow”, Antonov told the Russian state-run news agency. He said: Strictly speaking, today it is difficult to say when this dialogue - a dialogue on strategic stability - can be resumed. We did not freeze it, we did not declare a proxy war against the US, we did not throw the entire NATO military-industrial machinery into Ukrainian territory to fight the Russian Federation. The Kremlin yesterday accused the US of fighting a proxy war against Russia after Washington boosted military support for Ukraine and hosted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the White house and Congress. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday that the latest US support package – which includes the highly-sought after Patriot missile defence system – was “not conducive to a speedy settlement”. As part of the US support package, Ukrainian troops will learn how to use the Patriot surface-to-air missile battery systems in Germany, and it will be several months before they can deploy it on the battlefield. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest news from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. The time in Kyiv is nearly 1pm. Here is a round-up of the main news stories of the day so far: North Korea’s foreign ministry denied a media report it supplied munitions to Russia, calling it “groundless,” and denounced the United States for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, North Korea’s official KCNA news agency reported on Friday. Japan’s Tokyo Shimbun reported earlier that North Korea had shipped munitions, including artillery shells, to Russia via train through their border last month and that additional shipments were expected in the coming weeks. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, posted a video on Friday saying he was back at work in Kyiv after his landmark visit to Washington this week. “I am in my office. We are working toward victory,” he said in the video posted to his Telegram channel. A senior Russian diplomat has said talks on security guarantees for Russia cannot take place while Nato instructors and “mercenaries” remain in Ukraine, and while western arms supplies to the country continue. In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency TASS, Alexander Darchiev, head of the Russian foreign ministry’s North America department, said talks would be premature “until the flood of weapons and financing for the [Ukrainian president Volodymyr] Zelenskiy regime stops, American and Nato servicemen/mercenaries/instructors are withdrawn”. Russia’s ambassador to the United States said on Friday that the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high”, Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported. TASS cited Anatoly Antonov as saying that it was hard to say when talks on strategic dialogue between the two sides could resume, but that talks on prisoner swaps had been “effective” and would continue. The top Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said on Friday that shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, had “almost stopped”. Speaking on Russian state television, governor Yevgeny Balitsky said Russian troops would not leave the nuclear plant, and that it would never return to Ukrainian control. Australia’s financial intelligence agency has warned Russian paramilitary groups are soliciting cryptocurrency donations to buy weapons and that Australians have donated to terrorist organisations overseas. Senior executives at Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) also said cryptocurrency has become a “standard part of the money-laundering tool kit” for organised crime groups in Australia. Air raid sirens were sounding shortly before 7am in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, the regional governor Vitalli Kim indicated on Telegram, in a series of posts saying, “Air alarm”. Kherson governor Yaroslav Yanushevych also posted an air raid alarm, but shortly afterwards said that the alert was over. The White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. The US is imposing fresh sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities over Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. Six of the entities targeted in the latest sanctions were designated for operating or having operated in both the defence and related material sector and the marine sector of the Russian economy, the US state department said on Thursday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the Patriot air defence the US was supplying to Ukraine was an old weapons system that Russia would be able to “knock down”. “The Patriot air defence is an outdated system,” Putin told reporters in Moscow, adding that Russia’s S-300 system outperformed it. A Russian-installed official in a part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region controlled by Russian forces was killed on Thursday in a car bomb attack, according to the pro-Moscow local administration. Andrei Shtepa, the pro-Russian head of the village of Lyubimovka in the Kherson region, reportedly died after a car blew up, it said, blaming “Ukrainian terrorists”. The report has not been able to be independently verified. German authorities said they arrested an employee of the country’s foreign intelligence service on suspicion of treason for allegedly passing information to Russia. The suspect, a German citizen identified only as Carsten L, was arrested in Berlin on Wednesday, federal prosecutors said in a statement. It comes just days after Austria said it had identified a 39-year-old Greek citizen it suspected of spying for Russia. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for the time being. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, posted a video on Friday saying he was back at work in Kyiv after his landmark visit to Washington this week. “I am in my office. We are working toward victory,” he said in the video posted to his Telegram channel. In early 2022, the Ukrainian photojournalist Evgeny Maloletka was covering violence in Kazakhstan when his attention turned back home: there were several reports signalling that Russia was preparing an invasion. He didn’t have to think twice: he knew he had to be back in his home country. By mid-January, he was already working on assignment for the Associated Press in the city of Kharkiv and the Donbas region, in eastern Ukraine, where there was a growing tension among Russian proxies. Maloletka was based in Kharkiv, 25 miles from some of the tens of thousands of Russian troops massed at the border, as diplomatic efforts to find a solution continued. When Maloletka and the AP team estimated that the invasion was imminent, they moved to the city of Mariupol, in south-east Ukraine. They thought that if war broke out, Mariupol would be key because it was a strategic seaport. They were not wrong. South Korea’s foreign ministry said on Friday it condemns North Korea’s arms shipment to a private Russian military company, the Wagner Group, adding it supports the United States’ push to raise the issue at the UN security council. The White House said on Thursday North Korea has completed an initial arms delivery to the Wagner Group to help bolster Russian forces in Ukraine. A senior Russian diplomat has said that talks on security guarantees for Russia cannot take place while Nato instructors and “mercenaries” remain in Ukraine, and while western arms supplies to the country continue. In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency Tass, Alexander Darchiev, head of the Russian foreign ministry’s North America department, said talks would be premature “until the flood of weapons and financing for the [Ukrainian president Volodymyr] Zelenskiy regime stops, American and Nato servicemen/mercenaries/instructors are withdrawn”. Russia typically refers to foreign volunteers fighting with the Ukrainian army as “mercenaries”, and has convicted captured foreign fighters of acting as such, Reuters reports. Australia’s financial intelligence agency has warned Russian paramilitary groups are soliciting cryptocurrency donations to buy weapons and that Australians have donated to terrorist organisations overseas. Senior executives at Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) also said cryptocurrency has become a “standard part of the money-laundering tool kit” for organised crime groups in Australia. The agency’s deputy chief executive and head of intelligence, John Moss, said crypto was no longer considered a “niche option” for criminal activity and had become more mainstream. “We are now seeing more traditional money laundering being displaced into cryptocurrency, particularly to send money offshore,” he said. Moss said Russian groups have been soliciting digital currency donations on social media to buy weapons, drones and armour for the conflict in Ukraine: Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s surprise visit to Washington – the Ukrainian president’s first overseas trip since the Russian invasion 300 days ago – started with a secretive train ride to Poland late on Tuesday. The next morning he arrived in the southern Polish city of Przemysl, where he was spotted at the train station, according to footage from private broadcaster TVN, along with the US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, who accompanied him. Zelenskiy’s visit had been planned for days and organised in secret because of concerns about his safety, but details were tweeted on Tuesday by a reporter from US-based newsletter Punchbowl News. In Poland, Zelenskiy boarded a US government plane which landed at about noon EST on Wednesday at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland near Washington. He traveled by motorcade to Blair House, the presidential guest house along Pennsylvania Avenue, and after freshening up from his trip went to the nearby White House, where he was greeted by President Joe Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden. The air raid warning for Mykolaiv has ended, local governor Vitalii Kim has said on Telegram. Back to North Korea: According to the White House, Wagner took delivery of infantry rockets and missiles from North Korea, though Wagner owner Yevgeny Prigozhin denied the assertion as “gossip and speculation”, Reuters reports. “The DPRK remains unchanged in its principled stand on the issue of ‘arms transaction’ between the DPRK and Russia which has never happened,” the North Korean spokesperson said, adding it is the US that’s “bringing bloodshed and destruction to Ukraine by providing it with various kinds of lethal weapons”. DPRK are the initials of the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Air raid sirens were sounding shortly before 7am in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, the regional governor Vitalli Kim indicated on Telegram, in a series of posts saying, “Air alarm”. Kherson governor Yaroslav Yanushevych also posted an air raid alarm, but shortly afterwards said that the alert was over. North Korea’s foreign ministry denied a media report it supplied munitions to Russia, calling it “groundless,” and denounced the United States for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, the North’s official KCNA news agency reported on Friday. Japan’s Tokyo Shimbun reported earlier that North Korea had shipped munitions, including artillery shells, to Russia via train through their border last month and that additional shipments were expected in the coming weeks. “The Japanese media’s false report that the DPRK offered munitions to Russia is the most absurd red herring, which is not worth any comment or interpretation,” a ministry spokesperson said in a statement carried by the KCNA. The White House said on Thursday the North has completed an initial arms delivery to a private Russian military company, the Wagner Group, to help bolster Russian forces in Ukraine. The North Korean foreign ministry statement did not make any mention of Wagner, Reuters reports. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments for the next few hours. It is 7.30 in Kyiv. Our top stories this morning: North Korea’s foreign ministry denied a media report it supplied munitions to Russia, calling it “groundless,” and denounced the United States for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, the North’s official KCNA news agency reported on Friday. And in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, air raid sirens sounded early this morning, according to the region’s mayor, Vitalii Kim on Telegram. More on these stories shortly. Here are the other key recent developments: The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he was returning to Ukraine “with good results” after his visit to Washington. In his first video message after meeting with Joe Biden and addressing the US Congress, Zelenskiy thanked the president “for his help, his international leadership and his determination to win”. Zelenskiy gave a defiant address to the joint session of Congress on Wednesday, saying Washington’s continued support was key to ultimate victory. His trip to the US – his first since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – came amid concern that the incoming Republican leadership of the House of Representatives might oppose proposals for an additional $45bn in weapons and other assistance next year. The White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. The US is imposing fresh sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities over Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. Six of the entities targeted in the latest sanctions were designated for operating or having operated in both the defence and related material sector and the marine sector of the Russian economy, the US state department said on Thursday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the Patriot air defence the US was supplying to Ukraine was an old weapons system that Russia would be able to “knock down”. “The Patriot air defence is an outdated system,” Putin told reporters in Moscow, adding that Russia’s S-300 system outperformed it. Answering a question on the possibility to end the war with Ukraine through diplomatic means, Putin said that “all armed conflicts end through negotiations”. The Kremlin said the US supply of Patriot missile systems to Kyiv would not contribute to settling the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and would not prevent Moscow from achieving its goals. A Russian-installed official in a part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region controlled by Russian forces was killed on Thursday in a car bomb attack, according to the pro-Moscow local administration. Andrei Shtepa, the pro-Russian head of the village of Lyubimovka in the Kherson region, reportedly died after a car blew up, it said, blaming “Ukrainian terrorists”.

It comes just days after Austria said it had identified a 39-year-old Greek citizen it suspected of spying for Russia. Vladimir Putin called Israel’s prime minister-designate, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Thursday to congratulate him on forming a government and to discuss the situation in Ukraine, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. Netanyahu told Putin “he hopes a way will be found quickly to end the war [with Ukraine] and the suffering caused by it”, it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/nov/12/autumn-statement-which-tax-rises-and-spending-cuts-are-most-likely","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-12T06:00:33Z","webTitle":"Autumn statement: which tax rises and spending cuts are most likely?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/12/autumn-statement-which-tax-rises-and-spending-cuts-are-most-likely","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/nov/12/autumn-statement-which-tax-rises-and-spending-cuts-are-most-likely","fields":{"headline":"Autumn statement: which tax rises and spending cuts are most likely?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"When he was chancellor, Rishi Sunak’s Treasury would routinely leak many elements of his budgets in advance, and there has been a similar wealth of informed speculation about how, as prime minister, he can fill the estimated £60bn gap in the UK’s public finances in next week’s autumn statement. With much fiscal misery expected, there is a benefit for Sunak and his chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, in floating possible options to gauge the reaction – and it is likely that some ideas mentioned in newspapers never make the cut. But here are some of the ideas on the table, in terms of tax rises and spending cuts, and the likelihood of them being implemented. Stealth tax increases Perhaps the easiest tax rise a government can make: fail to upgrade tax band thresholds in line with inflation, or at all, and the extra receipts could run into the billions. The most likely are income tax thresholds, which will bring the greatest extra income. Among the levies forecast to be subject to “fiscal drag”, as it is also known, are inheritance tax, capital gains tax and dividend tax relief. Political impact: Would not be popular with low-tax Tories, but after the implosion of Liz Truss’s fiscal plan there is more tolerance than normal for such ideas. Fiscal impact: There is big money at stake. While a freeze in the inheritance tax “nil-rate band” from 2025-26 to 2027-28, would raise an additional £500m, the Treasury would gain £30bn from high inflation should Hunt extend a freeze on income tax bands. Likelihood: 4/5 Cuts to capital spending One of the temptations in cancelling or trimming big projects is that you can write billions off the government balance sheet with a few taps of the keyboard. Furthermore, you are getting rid of something that does not yet exist, and so could be easily forgotten by voters. Projects reportedly in the Treasury’s crosshairs include the Sizewell C nuclear power station and elements of HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail. Political impact: Potentially toxic, especially among MPs whose areas are affected, who will argue that long-term growth and productivity will be hurt by such cuts. Fiscal impact: Tempting though it may be when tens of billions of pounds can be saved, delaying or cancelling big infrastructure projects, especially if they reduce the UK’s reliance on fossil fuels, will be a big blow to the future productivity and competitiveness of the British economy. Likelihood of some cuts: 4/5. Of scrapping a major project: 2/5 Real-terms cuts to benefits or pensions With working-age benefits in Great Britain costing nearly £88bn a year, and spending on pensions and pension-age benefits being north of £110bn, the savings are obvious if either or both are uprated by, say, 5% rather than the current inflation level of nearer 10%. While broadly similar in approach to a stealth tax rise, it would be much more noticeable and controversial. Political impact: Tricky, which is why there has been much speculation that Hunt will increase both by inflation. But the savings cannot be ignored. Fiscal impact: For pensions, limiting the annual increase to the rise in earnings would save £6bn in each of the next two financial years, while working-age benefits would be £7bn lower than if they were linked to rises in inflation. Likelihood: 2/5 Some sort of increase to the top rate of tax Weeks after Kwasi Kwarteng announced the abolition of the 45p top rate of income tax in Truss’s ill-starred mini-budget, there is talk that the rate could now rise – though a much more likely outcome is a lowering of the current £150,000 point at which people start to pay the top rate, potentially by a significant sum. Political impact: Kwarteng and Truss hailed the abolition of the 45p rate as removing a tax on aspiration, and some Tory MPs will deeply dislike such a move by Hunt. But as Truss found out, cutting taxes for the rich is not vastly popular elsewhere. Fiscal impact: There are only modest gains for the Treasury from dragging more people into the 45p rate of tax. When the annual receipts from all taxpayers above £150,000 is about £2bn a year, shifting the threshold will raise only hundreds of millions of pounds. Likelihood of a lower threshold: 3/5 Expanded windfall tax Between campaigning to become prime minister and beginning her brief time in No 10, Truss changed her mind on Sunak’s windfall tax for energy firms, which she had initially condemned as a disincentive to invest. The version implemented under Sunak had significant opt-outs for new investments in fossil fuels, meaning Shell paid nothing despite £26bn in profits. Alok Sharma, the Cop26 president, is among those who have called for a revised version. Political impact: Sunak has, like Truss, warned against a Labour-style windfall tax as a drag on enterprise. Much like Truss, if he does make a U-turn then it is likely to be quite popular, beyond some Tory MPs. But it doesn’t feel very Sunak-like. Fiscal impact: There is no evidence that energy firms will cut investment if they are forced to give up some of their windfall gains. A broader tax on the industry with fewer opt-outs could see receipts increase from £5bn to £10bn. Likelihood: 2/5 Delaying the cap in social care This was, however imperfect in outcome, one of the flagship policies of Boris Johnson, and was due to come into force in October 2023. Some reports say Sunak wants to delay this for two years, and possibly permanently, saving up to £2bn a year. This would, however, mark yet another failure to get to grips with one of the UK’s most pressing chronic policy problems. Political impact: Likely to cause a storm among Tory voters and thus MPs, given that the cap’s ambition of preventing older people from needing to sell their homes to pay for care disproportionately helps people in better-off areas. Fiscal impact: Proposals for a now scrapped rise of 1.25 percentage points in national insurance contributions were to pay for increased health spending and more cash for social care, with a cap on care costs. NHS funding is secure, but social care looks like losing out again, even though older and disabled people will find themselves in hospital for longer than they need, increasing NHS bills. Likelihood: 3/5 Changes to non-domiciled tax status While entirely abolishing the ability of people with overseas tax jurisdiction to avoid paying UK taxes on their income – something enjoyed by Sunak’s wife for a period – seems unlikely, there is speculation about fairly significant changes, such as cutting the permitted duration from 15 to five years, potentially raising £1.6bn a year. Political impact: Not likely to worry voters, but it could alarm plenty of non-dom Tory donors, which is a demographic the party very much does not want to fall out with. Fiscal impact: Some workers brought in from abroad claim non-dom status. They fill vacant, low-paid posts but deny the exchequer tax receipts. The difficulties separating the good non-dom from the bad has usually scuppered changes. Likelihood: 2/5 Increases to council tax Not directly a Treasury tax rise, as this would be done by local authorities. But with grants to councils set to be frozen, one idea being considered is allowing council tax to go up by 3% or more without a referendum, as is needed currently. Political impact: This would be unpopular, but as with much of George Osborne’s 2010-era austerity, outsourcing the pain to councils is tempting for the Treasury. Fiscal impact: With councils claiming they face a £15bn shortfall going into the budget from Osborne’s austerity measures, being told again they can only recoup their losses from higher council tax bills would cripple many services. Likelihood: 3/5 • This article was amended on 17 November 2022 to remove an unsubstantiated reference to “many of the nurses brought in from abroad” claiming non-dom status."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/06/putin-rubbing-hands-with-glee-after-eu-votes-to-class-gas-and-nuclear-as-green","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-06T12:31:49Z","webTitle":"‘Putin rubbing hands with glee’ after EU votes to class gas and nuclear as green","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/06/putin-rubbing-hands-with-glee-after-eu-votes-to-class-gas-and-nuclear-as-green","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/06/putin-rubbing-hands-with-glee-after-eu-votes-to-class-gas-and-nuclear-as-green","fields":{"headline":"‘Putin rubbing hands with glee’ after EU votes to class gas and nuclear as green","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The European parliament has backed plans to label gas and nuclear energy as “green”, rejecting appeals from prominent Ukrainians and climate activists that the proposals are a gift to Vladimir Putin. One senior MEP said the vote was a “dark day for the climate”, while experts said the EU had set a dangerous precedent for countries to follow. The row began late last year with the leak of long-awaited details on the EU’s green investment guidebook, intended to help investors channel billions to the clean power transition. The European Commission decided some gas and nuclear projects could be included in the EU taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic activities, subject to certain conditions. Under the plans, gas can be classed as a sustainable investment if “the same energy capacity cannot be generated with renewable sources” and plans are in place to switch to renewables or “low-carbon gases”. Nuclear power can be called green if a project promises to deal with radioactive waste. The plan could only be stopped by a majority of EU member states or members of the European parliament. With most EU governments in favour, attention turned to the European parliament, but on Wednesday MEPs failed to muster a blocking majority. Only 282 MEPs voted in favour of an amendment against the inclusion of gas and nuclear, falling short of the 353 votes needed to overturn the decision. Bas Eickhout, the vice-president of the European parliament’s environment committee, said it was “dark day for the climate and energy transition”. The veteran Dutch MEP, who led the parliament in intra-EU negotiations on the taxonomy regulation, said the EU was “sending a disastrous signal to investors and the rest of the world” that it recognised fossil gas and nuclear as sustainable investments. “By clearing the way for this delegated act, the EU will have unreliable and greenwashed conditions for green investments in the energy sector,” he said. Svitlana Krakovska, a Ukrainian climate scientist and member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said: “I am in shock. Russia’s war against Ukraine is a war paid for by climate-heating fossil fuels and the European parliament just voted to boost billions of funding to fossil gas from Russia. How in the world is that in line with Europe’s stance to protect our planet and stand with Ukraine?” Johanne Schroeten, a policy adviser at the E3G climate thinktank, said: “Vested interests seem to have gotten the upper hand. The EU has now set a dangerous precedent of low ambition for other countries and jurisdictions to follow.” The deal came after the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, promised Emmanuel Macron that France could have the green seal of approval for nuclear projects, which prompted gas-consuming countries to demand a similar concession. Campaigners are now vowing legal action. WWF said that with its fellow NGO Client Earth it would “explore all potential avenues for further action to stop this greenwashing and protect the credibility of the whole EU taxonomy”. Two anti-nuclear states, Austria and Luxembourg, have already announced they will take the commission to the European court of justice. But the proposals have powerful backers. Romania’s president, Klaus Iohannis, tweeted that he welcomed the “positive results”, adding: “I am glad that Romania’s constant efforts on considering gas and nuclear as part of progressive decarbonisation were reflected in the EP’s final decision.” The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through so-called delegated acts – secondary legislation intended for technical issues. Critics are now asking how such highly controversial plans could be passed through a form of lawmaking with few hurdles and less scrutiny. Activist fears were fuelled when Russia’s energy minister, Nikolai Shulginov, said the EU’s green taxonomy offered “a range of opportunities”. Speaking to the Energy Intelligence website before his country’s invasion of Ukraine, he said the inclusion of natural gas in the green taxonomy was evidence that the EU had realised it had made “a slight mistake” on the green transition. Since the invasion, the EU executive has set out plans to phase out Russian gas, but member states have not fixed a deadline to stop gas imports, unlike Russian oil and coal. The Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun tweeted: “Putin is rubbing his hands with glee today,” adding that the MEPs who had voted for or abstained on the inclusion of gas and nuclear in thegreen taxonomy had handed the Russian president “huge gifts”. She said: “I thank the brave 278 MEPs who objected. It wasn’t enough, but we won’t stop fighting.” • This article was amended on 6 July 2022 to clarify that while some prominent Ukrainian politicians came out against the EU vote on the green taxonomy, this was not the position of the state of Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/28/putin-is-trapped-and-desperate-will-his-friends-in-the-west-rescue-him-russia-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-28T09:00:24Z","webTitle":"Putin is trapped and desperate.

Will his friends in the west rescue him?","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"‘The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.” So wrote American author Henry David Thoreau in 1854. It’s a fate that is rapidly overtaking Vladimir Putin as he struggles to escape the disastrous trap he set for himself in Ukraine. Russia’s president keeps understandably schtum about his “special military operation”. But indefinite stalemate is not what he expected. He didn’t expect car bombs in Moscow and humiliating attacks on fortress Crimea, either. Least of all did Putin anticipate 80,000 Russian soldiers dead or wounded. Dying with them is his Peter the Great pipe dream of a “greater Russia”. Extinct already is his reputation as anything other than a killer and a crook. An endless military quagmire is not a scenario Putin can afford as slow-burn western sanctions corrode his economy and his military’s manpower and materiel are steadily depleted. So what are his options? He could declare a specious victory, claim the Nato “threat” is neutralised and propose a settlement recognising Russia’s annexation of occupied areas. But he surely knows Kyiv will never willingly accept such terms. He could gamble on a huge battlefield escalation, for example, using Belarus to open a second front north of Kyiv – the region he failed to overrun in February. But it’s uncertain his generals have the capability or the stomach. He certainly dare not retreat. So as pressure on him grows to produce a breakthrough, Putin may well decide his best option is to raise the cost of the war to Ukraine’s backers – and undermine Kyiv’s resistance that way. In fact, he has already begun. It’s telling that British, French and German leaders all proclaimed long-term support for Ukraine last week. They know Putin is betting they will buckle. The context is rising anxiety over Europe’s energy and cost of living crises, largely caused by the invasion and Kremlin cuts to gas supplies. The winter fallout from this coldest of cold wars could prove paralysing. Yet Putin may just be getting started. He has many means by which to undermine western unity and staying power. Europe is littered with easily exploited potential flashpoints and geopolitical faultlines bequeathed from Soviet times. Likewise, Russia has surprising numbers of allies and sympathisers scattered across a politically fractured European landscape. So will Putin’s friends in the west help rescue the beast from the east? Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko is already in Putin’s pocket. Moscow ensured the dictator survived after his theft of the 2020 presidential election provoked nationwide protests. Lukashenko will do as he’s told. Inside the EU, Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, is seen as Putin’s Trojan horse. Like many on Europe’s far right, Orbán admires his intolerant nationalist ideology and shares his racist, homophobic outlook. He has repeatedly obstructed EU sanctions. Last month he cut a unilateral gas deal with the Kremlin. Orbán plainly cannot be trusted. The collapse in June of Bulgaria’s reformist government and subsequent talk of repairing relations with Moscow fuels concern that Putin is gaining leverage to divide the EU. Italy has plenty of Putin fans, too. Leaders of two far-right parties that are expected to join a ruling coalition after next month’s elections have enjoyed close ties with Moscow over the years. Matteo Salvini’s League formed an alliance with Putin’s United Russia in 2017. Silvio Berlusconi of Forza Italia is a personal friend. Italy’s ousted prime minister Mario Draghi took a tough line on Ukraine. That may change. Other European far-right (and far-left) insurgent and populist parties identify to varying degrees with Putinist ideology and conservative social values. They echo his hostility to the EU. A definitive European Council on Foreign Relations study in 2016 listed Germany’s Alternative for Germany, France’s Front National (now National Rally), Austria’s Freedom party and Belgium’s Vlaams Belang as “pro-Russian”. Ukip made the cut, too. “The parties … help legitimise the Kremlin’s policies and amplify Russian disinformation. At times they can shift Europe’s domestic debates in Russia’s favour,” the study said. In Putinworld, such channels of influence are potent weapons. Putin can also rely on mainstream non-EU politicians such as Aleksandar Vučić, Serbia’s president, for a sympathetic hearing. Vučić has been dubbed “little Putin” by opponents. Serbia has profound historical, Slavic and religious ties to Russia, plus a shared distrust of Nato. The alliance’s 1999 bombing of Belgrade is not forgotten. The EU and UK fear the volatile western Balkans are a critical pressure point Putin could use to stir up old conflicts and distract attention from Ukraine. Kosovo, where ethnic Serb agitation is building again, is a case in point. Vučić last week threatened international peacekeepers with intervention. “We will save our people from persecution and pogroms if Nato doesn’t want to do it,” he said. Bosnian Serb leaders tied to Moscow also threaten new ruptures in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bosnia has echoed Serbia’s rejection of “hysterical” western sanctions. In March, pro-Putin Bosnian Serb “Night Wolves” bikers cheered the invasion. Partitioned Moldova and Georgia, with divided populations and Russian troops on their soil, are also potential flashpoints. Another is Kaliningrad, where Putin deployed hypersonic missiles this month to intimidate the Nato neighbours. Estonia, in particular, with its ethnic Russian minority, appears a target. Putin’s efforts to spread fear and instability, disruption and economic pain – making countries think twice about opposing Russia – extend beyond Europe. His vetoes have left the UN security council frozen in time. Now he and China’s Xi Jinping look set to turn November’s important post-pandemic G20 summit in Bali into a crude west-versus-the-rest showdown over Ukraine. No matter that Russia’s whole argument is based on a lie. Putin’s reckless brinkmanship at Ukraine’s occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant suggests he’ll risk almost anything to win. Quietly desperate, he grows more dangerous by the day. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The bill – the Inflation Reduction Act – was virtually dead in the water before a last-minute turnaround by the conservative West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin saw it suddenly revived. It then endured another round of political horse-trading as it navigated the choppy waters of a 50-50 split Senate. But, being carried by a tie-breaking vote from Biden’s vice-president, Kamala Harris, it emerged mostly intact. And, after a vote in the House later this week, it is set to land on Biden’s Oval Office desk. Here is what’s in it and what it means: Overview The estimated $740bn package is full of Democratic priorities. Those include capping prescription drug costs at $2,000 out of pocket for seniors, helping Americans pay for private health insurance, and what Democrats are calling the most substantial investment in history to fight the climate crisis: $375bn over the decade. Almost half the money raised, $300bn, will go toward paying down federal deficits. It’s paid for largely with new corporate taxes, including a 15% minimum tax on big corporations to ensure they don’t skip paying any taxes at all, as well as projected federal savings from lower Medicare drug costs. It’s not at all clear the 755-page bill will substantially ease inflationary pressures, though millions of Americans are expected to see some relief in healthcare and other costs. What does it mean for Biden? For Biden, the bill’s passage delivers a much-needed domestic win at a time when his popularity has sunk and key midterm elections loom in November. Though the bill has been stripped of much of his original ambitious program, it remains a major achievement. Biden can now go to the polls and portray himself as a president able to get things done even in the difficult political circumstances of a deeply divided country. Climate crisis The bill would invest nearly $375bn over the decade in climate-fighting strategies, including investments in renewable energy production and tax rebates for consumers to buy new or used electric vehicles. It’s broken down to include $60bn for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and $30bn for a production tax credit for wind and solar, seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country’s dependence on fossil fuels. The bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as ExxonMobil have invested millions of dollars to advance. The bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters. A late addition pushed by Senator Kyrsten Sinema and other Democrats in Arizona, Nevada and Colorado would designate $4bn to combat a mega-drought in the west, including conservation efforts in the Colorado river basin, on which nearly 40 million Americans rely for drinking water. For consumers, there are tax breaks as incentives to go green. One is a 10-year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar. There are tax breaks for buying electric vehicles, including a $4,000 tax credit for purchase of used electric vehicles and $7,500 for new ones. In all, Democrats believe the strategy could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030, and “would represent the single biggest climate investment in US history, by far”. Prescription drug costs Launching a long-sought goal, the bill would allow the Medicare program to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, saving the federal government $288bn over the 10-year budget window. Those new revenues would be put back into lower costs for seniors on medications, including a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies. Seniors would also have insulin prices capped at $35 a dose. A provision to extend that price cap on insulin to Americans with private health insurances was out of line with Senate budget rules and Republicans stripped it from the final bill. Health insurance The bill would extend the subsidies provided during the pandemic to help some Americans who buy health insurance on their own. Under earlier pandemic relief, the extra help was set to expire this year. But the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years, lowering insurance premiums for people who are buying their own healthcare policies. How is it paid for? The biggest revenue-raiser in the bill is a new 15% minimum tax on corporations that earn more than $1bn in annual profits. The new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than $258bn over the decade. The revenue would have been higher, but Sinema insisted on one change to the 15% corporate minimum, allowing a depreciation deduction used by manufacturing industries. That shaves about $55bn off the total revenue. To win over Sinema, Democrats dropped plans to close a tax loophole long enjoyed by wealthier Americans – so-called carried interest, which under current law taxes wealthy hedge fund managers and others at a 20% rate. Money is also raised by boosting the IRS to go after tax cheats. The bill proposes an $80bn investment in taxpayer services, enforcement and modernization, which is projected to raise $203bn in new revenue – a net gain of $124bn over the decade.

He repeated warnings that Russia was preparing for strikes in the Donbas region and Kharkiv. In a video address late on Friday, he said Russian troops in the north of the country were slowly pulling back. Zelenskiy also said that Russia was trying to conscript troops from Crimea, but said that being drafted to fight in Ukraine was “guaranteed death for many young guys”. He warned their families: “We don’t need more dead people here. Save your children so they do not become villains. Don’t send them.” Ukraine exchanged 86 members of their armed forces with Russia today, according to senior Ukrainian officials. Russia says Ukrainian helicopters attacked an oil storage facility in Belgorod, Russia, about 16 miles from the border and close to Kharkiv, destroying fuel tanks. Ukrainian officials have denied their forces were involved. The UK Ministry of Defence says the destruction of oil tanks at a depot in the Russian city of Belgorod means probable loss of fuel and ammunition supplies to invading forces. It will likely add more strain to Russia’s already stretched logistic chains. Supplies to Russian forces encircling Kharkhiv may be particularly affected. The US department of defense will provide an additional $300 million in security assistance to Ukraine, to include laser-guided rocket systems, drones, and commercial satellite imagery services. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, earlier spoke with Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kulebo today and discussed “ways the US allies and partners are helping Ukraine defend against Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified war”, Blinken said. The US State Department said Washington will continue to provide support to Ukraine and won’t push the country to make concessions in negotiations with Russia following a report that said Britain was concerned the US, France and Germany will push Ukraine to “settle” in a peace deal. The US military has cancelled plans to test an intercontinental ballistic missile in an effort to reduce tensions with Russia. Zelenskiy also said more than 3,000 people had been led to safety from the besieged city of Mariupol. More than 6,000 in total had been rescued from Mariupol, Donetsk, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had been unable to reach the city but will try again to evacuate civilians on Saturday. The Hollywood actor Sean Penn has called for a billionaire to come forward and buy two squadrons of F-15 or F-16 aircraft for Ukraine in an unlikely attempt to tip the scales against the Russian invaders in the five-week-old war. European governments have more time to figure out how they are going to act on Russia’s demand to pay for Russia gas in rubles after the Kremlin said today that it would not immediately halt gas supplies Around 200 Ukrainian national guard members have likely been taken prisoner by the Russian troops as they withdrew from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the mayor of Slavutych, Yuri Fomichev, said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/apr/01/post-your-questions-for-devo","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-01T16:08:47Z","webTitle":"Post your questions for Devo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/01/post-your-questions-for-devo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/apr/01/post-your-questions-for-devo","fields":{"headline":"Post your questions for Devo","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In their boiler suits and stepped hats, looking like employees of a particularly whimsical nuclear power facility, Devo have one of the most distinctive looks in pop – and some of the most distinctive songs. Nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year, they will be joining us to answer your questions. Formed in Ohio in the early 1970s around two sets of brothers – Mark and Bob Mothersbaugh, and Gerald and Bob Casale – the group had been galvanised into action by the horror of the 1970 Kent State massacre of student protesters: “We were pissed off, and we wanted to take the energy that comes from that anger and channel it,” said early member Bob Lewis. What emerged was a band whose absurdist humour and theatricality poked fun at a conformist America that was, per their name, devolving rather than improving. Playing confrontational gigs and making odd, ambitious music videos, they were a cult curiosity until the patronage of David Bowie and Iggy Pop helped them get signed to Warner Bros, with Brian Eno producing their 1978 debut album Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! Their twitchy, tautly funky cover of the Rolling Stones’ (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction was even more pent-up than the original, and a performance of it on Saturday Night Live sent them nationwide. Songs such as Jocko Homo and their cover of Johnny Rivers’ Secret Agent Man further grew their popularity, but they truly went overground – without sacrificing any of their surreality – with 1980 single Whip It, a blend of synth-pop and surf-rock which reached the US Top 20. It was the Devo project in glorious miniature: satirising America’s violence, emotional repression and brutal cult of productivity via joyous pop music. The accompanying album Freedom of Choice went platinum and the follow-up New Traditionalists – for which the band all adopted JFK’s hairdo – was a hit. They also appeared in Neil Young’s film oddity Human Highway, though some flop albums and waning popularity later in the decade led them to split in 1991. Frontman Mark Mothersbaugh’s sparky sense of humour helped him segue into music for children’s shows such as Rugrats, then film scores for Wes Anderson (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou), and even dipped into the Marvel universe with his score for Thor: Ragnarok (featuring such orchestral works as Devil’s Anus). Devo re-formed for concerts in 1996 and have frequently toured in the years since, and released one further album, 2010’s Something for Everybody. In May, the band are hoping it’s third time lucky after two previous nominations for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Mark Mothersbaugh and founding bassist Gerald Casale – who have strongly condemned Putin’s actions in Ukraine and are donating next month’s Devo royalties to humanitarian charities working in the country – are joining us to answer your questions about their madcap career. Post them in the comments below, and we’ll publish their answers in the 15 April edition of our Film &amp; Music section, plus online."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jun/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-kyiv-claims-advances-near-bakhmut-rouble-falls-to-15-month-low-after-wagner-rebellion","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-26T21:40:42Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Putin says Wagner uprising was ‘doomed to fail’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-kyiv-claims-advances-near-bakhmut-rouble-falls-to-15-month-low-after-wagner-rebellion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-kyiv-claims-advances-near-bakhmut-rouble-falls-to-15-month-low-after-wagner-rebellion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Putin says Wagner uprising was ‘doomed to fail’ – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We are closing our blog now, thanks for following today’s developments with us. You can read our report on Putin’s and Prigozhin’s statements here: Russian president Vladimir Putin is holding a meeting with the country’s top security officials on Monday evening, Interfax reports. Defence minister Sergei Shoigu, prosecutor general Igor Krasnov, interior minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev and the director of the FSB security service Alexander Bortnikov are reportedly among the attendees. Russian president Vladimir Putin and the Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin have both reappeared in public for the first time since the Russian warlord abandoned his armed mutiny on Saturday evening, with the Russian president thanking mercenary fighters and commanders who had stood down to avoid bloodshed. In a late night televised address to on Monday evening, Putin said: “Any blackmail or way to bring confusion to Russia is doomed to failure… I made steps to avoid large bloodshed.” He added: “The organisers of the rebellion, having betrayed their country, their people, betrayed those who were drawn into the crime, pushed them, pushed them to death, under fire, to shoot at their own”. The Russian president appeared to suggest that the Wagner group would still be shut down, saying that Wagner fighters had the choice to sign a contract with the ministry of defence or relocate to Belarus if they wanted as part of a settlement negotiated with the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko. “The majority of Wagner commanders and fighters are patriots. They were used covertly against their brothers-in-arms,” he said. Putin’s unscheduled appearance came just hours after Prigozhin issued a defiant 11-minute statement in which he defended the Wagner uprising and denied that he had sought to topple the Russian president. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko is no longer due to make a statement tonight, his press office has said on Telegram. Vladimir Putin also appeared to suggest in his address that the Wagner group would be shut down, saying that fighters from the mercenary group had the choice to sign a contract with the ministry of defence. Putin added he would honour his promise to allow Wagner fighters to relocate to Belarus if they wanted. “The majority of Wagner commanders and fighters are patriots. They were used covertly against their brothers-in-arms,” he said. Russian president Vladimir Putin has said the attempted Wagner rebellion “would have been suppressed anyway” and that “any blackmail or way to bring confusion to Russia is doomed to failure.” The White House’s national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that the US does not know the details of the deal reached between Russian president Vladimir Putin and Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin that put a stop to the uprising. Kirby added that he did not know Prigozhin’s whereabouts. Belarusian president and Kremlin ally Alexander Lukashenko may also be making a statement tonight. The president’s press office sent a cryptic message on Telegram: “A lot of questions, stuffing, versions and assumptions... The first one will TELL everything, ANSWER everything. Very soon! Follow the agenda!“ The Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin not been seen or heard from since he left Rostov with his troops on Saturday evening with an apparent deal offering him amnesty and exile in Belarus, however, Russian state-owned media reports that a criminal investigation into his actions has not ended. On Sunday, Belarus’ Belta news agency said Putin and Lukashenko spoke on Sunday, after at least two calls on Saturday. Good evening, I’m Sammy Gecsoyler and I’ll be covering the latest developments. Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, is due to make a number of “important” statements shortly, Russian media reported, citing the Kremlin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. The purported address comes after Russian warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin reappeared for the first time since abandoning his armed mutiny on Saturday evening, issuing a defiant 11-minute statement in which he defended the Wagner uprising and said that “society demanded it”. In the statement, Prigozhin denied that Wagner sought to topple Putin and said that the uprising had shown that there were “serious problems with security on the whole territory of our country”. “It was not our goal to overthrow the regime,” Prigozhin said in the voice memo, which was uploaded to his Concord Group’s Telegram page. The time in Kyiv is almost 9pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines: The Russian warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin has reappeared for the first time since abandoning his armed mutiny on Saturday evening, issuing a defiant 11-minute statement in which he defended the Wagner uprising and said that “society demanded it”. In the statement, Prigozhin denied that Wagner sought to topple Putin and said that the uprising had shown that there were “serious problems with security on the whole territory of our country”. “It was not our goal to overthrow the regime,” Prigozhin said in the voice memo, which was uploaded to his Concord Group’s Telegram page. The US was not involved in the weekend mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, against Vladimir Putin. “We made clear that we were not involved. We had nothing to do with it,” Joe Biden said at a White House event on high-speed internet. “This was part of a struggle within the Russian system. “We’re going to keep assessing the fallout of this weekend’s events and the implications for Russia and Ukraine. But it’s still too early to reach a definitive conclusion about where this is going.” Two Russian Su-27 fighter jets intercepted three British military aircraft heading over the Black Sea towards the Russian border on Monday, the Russian defence ministry said. According to the ministry, the intercepted planes were an RC-135 reconnaissance and electronic warfare plane and two Typhoon fighter jets, Reuters reported. The US plans to announce as soon as Tuesday a new military aid package for Ukraine worth up to $500m (£390m), showing that the US resolve to help Ukraine fight Russia was undeterred by the attempted mutiny over the weekend among Russian fighters. The military aid package will include ground vehicles as Ukraine presses its counteroffensive, two US officials said. Expected to be included are 30 Bradley fighting vehicles and 25 Stryker armoured personnel carriers, one of the officials said. Senior Ukrainian officials in Kyiv have argued that the attempted coup in Russia shows that Vladimir Putin does not guarantee stability – and instead makes it more likely the Russian state will collapse. In a tweet, Mikhail Podolyak, a senior adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, pushed back against the idea that any successor to Putin might turn out to be worse. “Sometimes one can hear an opinion from our western allies: whatever Putin may be, today he is the key guarantor of stability in the Russian powder keg. The events of recent days prove us otherwise.” James Cleverly, the UK foreign secretary, said the aborted mutiny by Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, represented an unprecedented challenge to Vladimir Putin. “Prigozhin’s rebellion is an unprecedented challenge to president Putin’s authority and it is clear cracks are emerging in Russian support for the war,” he told parliament. The EU’s high representative on foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, has said the EU’s view of the future of Russia had changed over the past 48 hours, with political instability and internal fragility in a nuclear power adding to the military danger already posed by Moscow. “It is clear now that our vision of Russia is quite different. It is not just a threat because it has military capability of provoking war, which it has shown already, but also internal political stability.” Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs has called on the US to speed up the training of fighter pilots give it the air force it needs in its defence and counter-offensive efforts against Russia. Dmytro Kuleba also called for a global ban on dual use technologies that can be sold to Russia for drones but used for military operations. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, has moved to reassure allies in Africa that thousands of Wagner group fighters deployed to the continent will not be withdrawn after the mutiny led by their commander, Yevgeny Prigozhin, over the weekend. In an interview with Russia Today, Lavrov pledged that “instructors” and “private military contractors” would remain in Central African Republic (CAR) and Mali, the two countries in sub-Saharan Africa where Wagner has the biggest presence. Ukrainian forces have liberated the south-eastern village of Rivnopil from Russian control, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said on Monday. Rivnopil lies west of a cluster of settlements that Ukraine said it recaptured from Russian forces earlier this month after launching a counteroffensive. “Defence forces have brought Rivnopil back under our control. We are moving ahead,” Maliar wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Moldova’s prime minister said the aborted mutiny in Russia has exposed Moscow’s weakness and that what he described as the Kremlin’s interference in his own country was getting less effective over time. The former Soviet republic wedged between Ukraine and Romania has repeatedly accused Russia of meddling in its affairs, particularly over the breakaway region of Transnistria – accusations Russia denies. Serhiy Lysak, the governor of Dnipropetrovsk oblast, reports that two people have been killed and another wounded in an attack on Nikopol. He posted to Telegram: “In the afternoon, the Rashists hit Nikopol with heavy artillery. A private enterprise was struck. Two employees were killed – a 51-year-old woman and a 50-year-old man.” Ukraine expects to receive a clear invitation for simplified accession to Nato when the military alliance holds a summit next month in Lithuania, a senior official said on Monday. Andriy Yermak, head of the presidential staff, reiterated Ukraine’s position on Nato accession in comments published after Russia thwarted a march by mercenaries heading towards Moscow at the weekend, Reuters reported. Russia’s defence minister has appeared on state TV and emergency counter-terrorism measures have been cancelled in Moscow and surrounding regions as the Kremlin seeks to restore calm following Yevgeny Prigozhin’s failed mutiny. The defence ministry released footage on Monday that it claimed showed Sergei Shoigu “visiting the forward command post of one of the formations of the ‘western’ group of troops”. In the video, Shoigu is shown riding in a vehicle and arriving at a command post, where he listens to reports from officers and pores over a battlefield map. The video was released without sound and it was unclear when and where it was filmed, nonetheless, the footage showed tacit government support for Shoigu, whom Prigozhin had sought to oust with his uprising. The weekend’s events have “exposed the weakness of Putin’s regime”, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said, saying he had discussed the turmoil in Russia in a phone call with the US president, Joe Biden. In a statement, Zelenskiy called for global pressure to be exerted on Russia and said that he and Biden had also discussed expanding defence cooperation with an emphasis on long-range weapons. The Russian rouble opened at a near 15-month low against the dollar in early morning trade on Monday, responding for the first time to the Wagner mutiny. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that Russia attacked Ukraine overnight from the south with three Kalibr cruise missiles and eight Shahed drones – two missiles and seven drones were shot down. Also, it claimed, four drones of an unknown type were launched from the north, and all of them were shot down. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. Thanks for following along. Two Russian Su-27 fighter jets intercepted three British military aircraft heading over the Black Sea towards the Russian border on Monday, the Russian defence ministry said. According to the ministry, the intercepted planes were an RC-135 reconnaissance and electronic warfare plane and two Typhoon fighter jets, Reuters reported. “When approached by Russian fighters, the foreign military aircraft turned back from the state border of the Russian Federation,” the ministry said. Moldova’s prime minister said the aborted mutiny in Russia has exposed Moscow’s weakness and that what he described as the Kremlin’s interference in his own country was getting less effective over time. The former Soviet republic wedged between Ukraine and Romania has repeatedly accused Russia of meddling in its affairs, particularly over the breakaway region of Transnistria – accusations Russia denies. “What we have seen in recent days is a clear indication of the weakness of the Russian leadership and the Russian management of the army,” Dorin Recean told Reuters in an interview. “Russia is much weaker than people perceived it to be,” he added, speaking in Zurich before a meeting of the European Free Trade Association in neighbouring Liechtenstein where he is due to sign a free trade agreement. Russian mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin surprised the world by leading Saturday’s armed revolt, only to abruptly call it off as his fighters approached Moscow having shot down several aircraft but meeting no resistance on the ground. The events could prove a military and morale boost to Ukraine as it fought off Russia’s invasion, Recean said. “It is important to have even more commitment from the west to supply Ukraine with what it needs in order to defend the country and to push Russian troops out.” Moldova, which hopes to join the European Union by 2030, has accused Russia of mounting a series of attempts to undermine its security, including a coup attempt, bomb hoaxes, internet hacks and fake conscription call-ups. The Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has said that he was not aiming to oust the Russian leadership by marching towards Moscow, but that he was acting to protect his Wagner group from being disbanded. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, has moved to reassure allies in Africa that thousands of Wagner group fighters deployed to the continent will not be withdrawn after the mutiny led by their commander, Yevgeny Prigozhin, over the weekend. In an interview with Russia Today, Lavrov pledged that “instructors” and “private military contractors” would remain in Central African Republic (CAR) and Mali, the two countries in sub-Saharan Africa where Wagner has the biggest presence. Both are considered strategic prizes by the Kremlin, which sees them as a springboard to greater influence on the continent and a source of lucrative natural resources. “At their request, several hundred servicemen are working in the CAR as instructors – this work, of course, will continue … Both the CAR and Mali appealed to the Wagner PMCs with a request to ensure the safety of their leadership,” Lavrov said. “Regarding the reports about who is panicking and about what, I did not see any panic. I did not see any changes in the relations of the relevant African countries with the Russian Federation.” The US was not involved in the weekend mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, against Vladimir Putin. “We made clear that we were not involved. We had nothing to do with it,” Joe Biden said at a White House event on high-speed internet. “This was part of a struggle within the Russian system. “We’re going to keep assessing the fallout of this weekend’s events and the implications for Russia and Ukraine.

As a part of the aid package, Ukraine will receive munitions for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (Himars), anti-tank weapons including Javelins and munitions for Patriot and Stinger anti-aircraft systems, according to the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The EU’s high representative on foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, has said the EU’s view of the future of Russia had changed over the past 48 hours, with political instability and internal fragility in a nuclear power adding to the military danger already posed by Moscow. “It is clear now that our vision of Russia is quite different. It is not just a threat because it has military capability of provoking war, which it has shown already, but also internal political stability.” Earlier he had described the Warner mercenary leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, as a “monster” attacking its creator. The situation “remain complex and unpredictable”. Borrell said: “But the conclusion of our debate it is clear and they [EU foreign ministers] want to stress it: continue supporting Ukraine more than ever, continue and increasing support all kinds of support and in particular the military one because war raging more than ever.” He did not elaborate on new strategies. “It takes time to develop a strategy in view of such a state of affairs. We are working on it. I think we can say that everyone is already analysing the possible scenarios that could develop but we don’t have a ready-made strategy.” Borrell said the EU was also concerned about a change in the role of Wagner mercenaries, previously supported by Vladimir Putin, in parts of Africa, especially Mali and Central African Republic. In the UK, James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, is making a statement about the events in Russia over the weekend. One of the first MPs to ask a question was Liz Truss, the former prime minister. Truss said there should be no letup in support for Ukraine, and she said its admission to Nato should be fast-tracked. She also said there should be no talk of deals with Russia, or of sanctions being lifted, until the “war criminals” had been held to account. In reply, Cleverly said Truss was making “incredibly important” points. He said Ukraine’s record in the war showed why it should ultimately be a member of Nato. The war had truncated the period it should have to wait, he said. He said other allies thought the same. Senior Ukrainian officials in Kyiv have argued that the attempted coup in Russia shows that Vladimir Putin does not guarantee stability – and instead makes it more likely the Russian state will collapse. In a tweet, Mikhail Podolyak, a senior adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, pushed back against the idea that any successor to Putin might turn out to be worse. “Sometimes one can hear an opinion from our western allies: whatever Putin may be, today he is the key guarantor of stability in the Russian powder keg. The events of recent days prove us otherwise. “Putin’s state vertical is incurably sick, weak, fearful and ready for any concessions in order to preserve physical life and material assets. Any organised military group will be able to seize control without encountering resistance … This means the longer Putin remains a nominal president and the longer he drags out this absolutely catastrophic war for Russia, the greater the resulting risk of collapse, internal bloody wars with possible looting, including of weapons of mass destruction.” This analysis amounts to a critique of a view expressed by some in the Biden administration that Moscow could respond with nuclear weapons, if Ukraine’s counteroffensive this year results in “catastrophic success”. Podolyak argues that the reverse is true. He wants the US and its allies to give Ukraine everything it needs so it can “deal a final blow” to the Putin regime. They believe a successor chosen by Russia’s elite will increase stability and lead to the country’s gradual post-Putin transformation. James Cleverly, the UK foreign secretary, said the aborted mutiny by Russia’s Wagner mercenary group, led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, represented an unprecedented challenge to Vladimir Putin. “Prigozhin’s rebellion is an unprecedented challenge to president Putin’s authority and it is clear cracks are emerging in Russian support for the war,” he told parliament. The Russian warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin has reappeared for the first time since abandoning his armed mutiny on Saturday evening, issuing a defiant 11-minute statement in which he defended the Wagner uprising and said that “society demanded it”. In the statement, Prigozhin denied that Wagner sought to topple Putin and said that the uprising had shown that there were “serious problems with security on the whole territory of our country”. “It was not our goal to overthrow the regime,” Prigozhin said in the voice memo, which was uploaded to his Concord Group’s Telegram page. “We stopped at that moment, when it became clear that much blood would be spilled,” he continued, describing the progress of a military convoy that reached striking distance of Moscow. “That’s why we believe that the demonstration of what we were planning to do was enough. Our decision to turn back had two factors: we didn’t want to spill Russian blood. Secondly, we marched as a demonstration of our protest.” He once again accused the Russian defence ministry of targeting his troops with artillery fire, calling it the “trigger for us to move out immediately”. “The goal of the march was to not allow the destruction of the Wagner private military company and hold to account the officials who through their unprofessional actions have committed a massive number of errors. Society demanded it.” Prigozhin acknowledged that his troops had killed Russian airmen during their uprising, saying they “regretted that they were required to carry out strikes against aircraft but they were hitting our forces with bombs and rocket strikes”. He also claimed that the troops movement into Russia was a “masterclass” in how Russia should have carried out its 24 February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which failed to achieve its goal of taking Kyiv. Wagner group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has made his first comments since Saturday. He said the “march” was to avoid the destruction of the private military group and that Wagner was bound to cease existence on 1 July, Reuters reports. Mercenary leader Prigozhin said that it had been intended to register a protest at the ineffectual conduct of the war in Ukraine, not to overthrow the government in Moscow. Prigozhin spoke in an 11-minute audio message released on the Telegram messaging app. Today, Justin Trudeau said the aborted mutiny in Russia was an internal issue for Moscow to work through. “Everyone has a lot of questions about what this actually means, but we don’t yet have a lot of answers and too much speculation right now, I think, could probably be extremely counterproductive,” the Canadian prime minister told reporters in Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland, after meeting leaders of Nordic countries. Senior Russian officials rallied around President Vladimir Putin earlier, after the aborted mutiny by mercenaries that appeared to pose the greatest threat to his 23-year rule. Our video team has put together this series of clips that illustrate international reaction to the events in Russia at the weekend when Yevgeney Prigozhin’s Wagner mercenary group staged a mutiny. The Guardian’s Berlin correspondent reports from Germany: Germany’s defence minister has announced that the country is planning to send several thousand troops to be stationed permanently in Lithuania as part of the international response to the threat that Russia poses for the country and the Baltic region. Boris Pistorius said in a meeting in Vilnius before a Nato gathering there in two weeks, that Germany would contribute a “robust brigade”, of several thousand soldiers, who would be able to take their families with them. Pistorius said he had agreed with his Lithuanian counterpart, Arvydas Anušauskas, that the brigade would be built up slowly in conjunction with the arrival of appropriate infrastructure. More details as to the timeframe, and the costs involved, are expected to follow. Earlier on Monday, Der Spiegel reported that the government in Berlin was planning to provide Kyiv with a long-term supply of ammunition. A framework agreement regarding the manufacture of the ammunition was drawn up at the end of last week between the company Rheinmetall and the defence ministry, according to the report. According to the contract, seen by Der Spiegel, the company is to produce and deliver 330,000 rounds of 155mm bullets, as well as thousands of Howitzer rounds, with the aim of providing a long-term supply to the Ukrainian armed forces. The €60m (£51.5m/$65.5m) cost for an initial 20,000 rounds, is to be shouldered by the German government. Parallel to the deal, Germany’s own military will be provided with a similarly large amount of ammunition. Earlier this year the defence ministry admitted that Germany’s military was woefully under-equipped, with inadequate supplies of artillery and ammunition, and had yet to live up to specifications set for Nato members. Serhiy Lysak, the governor of Dnipropetrovsk oblast, reports that two people have been killed and another wounded in an attack on Nikopol. He posted to Telegram: In the afternoon, the Rashists hit Nikopol with heavy artillery. A private enterprise was struck. Two employees were killed – a 51-year-old woman and a 50-year-old man. Another 49-year-old man was injured. He has a mine-explosive injury and a shrapnel wound. He was hospitalised in moderate condition. There is destruction. The consequences of the attack are being clarified. The claims have not been independently verified. Lysak’s post was accompanied by pictures of an industrial-looking building with shattered windows A Russian court said on Monday it had sentenced a scientist, Valery Golubkin, to 12 years in jail for treason after convicting him of handing over state secrets to “representatives of foreign organisations”. Reuters reports Golubkin was detained in late 2020 on suspicion of handing over secrets to an unnamed Nato country. His lawyer said at the time that Golubkin denied the charges against him. Golubkin had worked in the department of theoretical and applied aerohydromechanics at the Moscow institute of physics and technology. The court provided no further details on the case. A number of Russian scientists have been arrested and charged with treason in recent years on suspicion of passing sensitive material to foreigners. A criminal case was opened earlier this month against one of three Russian hypersonic missile scientists arrested on suspicion of treason. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Monday that the US ambassador to Moscow “gave signals” that the US was not involved in the Wagner armed mutiny and hoped for the safety of Russia’s nuclear arsenal, state news agency Tass reported. Lavrov also quoted the US envoy as saying Saturday’s mutiny by the Wagner mercenaries was Russia’s internal affair, Tass reported. Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs has called on the US to speed up the training of fighter pilots give it the air force it needs in its defence and counter-offensive efforts against Russia. Dmytro Kuleba also called for a global ban on dual use technologies that can be sold to Russia for drones but used for military operations. Speaking to a summit of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg said the latest sanctions combined with the £3bn increases in EU contribution to its military operations and the arrival of fighter jets would “together … allow the liberation of all Ukrainian territories”. Ukraine expects to receive a clear invitation for simplified accession to Nato when the military alliance holds a summit next month in Lithuania, a senior official said on Monday. Andriy Yermak, head of the presidential staff, reiterated Ukraine’s position on Nato accession in comments published after Russia thwarted a march by mercenaries heading towards Moscow at the weekend, Reuters reported. “Ukraine’s position: the expected result is to receive an invitation for simplified accession at the summit in July. But, importantly, we would like to receive an absolutely clear signal that would establish Ukraine’s path to Nato membership,” he told a briefing for German media. Russia has summoned Moldova’s ambassador in Moscow, Russian state news agency TASS reported, citing the Russian foreign ministry. It gave no immediate reason for the move, which comes amid strained ties between Moscow and Chişinău over Russia’s military actions in Ukraine, which borders Moldova. Ukrainian forces have liberated the south-eastern village of Rivnopil from Russian control, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said on Monday. Rivnopil lies west of a cluster of settlements that Ukraine said it recaptured from Russian forces earlier this month after launching a counteroffensive. “Defence forces have brought Rivnopil back under our control. We are moving ahead,” Maliar wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Maliar said in an earlier statement that Ukrainian forces had liberated about 130 sq km (50 sq miles) in the south since Ukraine since the counterattack began. Britain is prepared for a range of scenarios in Russia, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Monday, noting the potentially destabilising impact of the tensions between the Wagner group and President Vladimir Putin. Putin faced an unprecedented challenge to his authority over the weekend from an abortive mutiny by heavily armed mercenary fighters from the Wagner group, Reuters reported. The extraordinary events left governments, both friendly and hostile to Russia, groping for answers to what could happen next in the country with the world’s largest nuclear arsenal. Sunak said Britain was monitoring events carefully. “It’s too early to predict with certainty what the consequences of this might be, but of course we are prepared as we always would be for a range of scenarios,” Sunak told reporters. “It’s a situation that we’ve been analysing and monitoring for some time because we’re aware of the potentially destabilising impact of Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine and indeed, the tensions between the Wagner group and the Putin regime.” Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, has characterised Yevgeny Prigozhin’s rebellion against the Russian president as an anticipated outcome resulting from the empowerment of the mercenary figurehead. Yevgeny Prigozhin’s aborted mutiny in Russia was “the monster acting against his creator”, the EU’s foreign policy chief has said. “The political system is showing fragilities, and the military power is cracking,” Josep Borrell told reporters in Luxembourg as he arrived for a meeting with ministers from across the 27-member bloc. Wagner group mercenary forces under Prigozhin seized control of military headquarters in southern Russia and began to move towards Moscow on Saturday before suddenly heading back to eastern Ukraine after a deal with the Kremlin. “The most important conclusion is the war against Ukraine launched by Putin and the monster that Putin created with Wagner, the monster is fighting, the monster is acting against his creator,” Borrell said. Russia’s defence minister has appeared on state TV and emergency counter-terrorism measures have been cancelled in Moscow and surrounding regions as the Kremlin seeks to restore calm following Yevgeny Prigozhin’s failed mutiny. The defence ministry released footage on Monday that it claimed showed Sergei Shoigu “visiting the forward command post of one of the formations of the ‘Western’ group of troops”. In the video, Shoigu is shown riding in a vehicle and arriving at a command post, where he listens to reports from officers and pores over a battlefield map. The video was released without sound and it was unclear when and where it was filmed, nonetheless, the footage showed tacit government support for Shoigu, whom Prigozhin had sought to oust with his uprising. The Wagner chief has not been seen or heard from since he left Rostov with his troops on Saturday evening with an apparent deal offering him amnesty and exile in Belarus, however, Russian state-owned media reports that a criminal investigation into his actions has not ended. The rebellion by the Wagner mercenary group in Russia demonstrates that Moscow has committed a strategic mistake by waging war on Ukraine, Nato secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Monday. “The events over the weekend are an internal Russian matter, and yet another demonstration of the big strategic mistake that President Vladimir Putin made with his illegal annexation of Crimea and the war against Ukraine,” he told reporters on a visit to Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius. Events over the weekend show that Russia’s military power is “cracking” and the “monster Putin has created is turning against him”, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, has said. But he warned that the instability in Russia was dangerous for Europe and must be taken into account in the coming days and weeks. The weekend’s events have “exposed the weakness of Putin’s regime”, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said, saying he had discussed the turmoil in Russia in a phone call with the US president, Joe Biden. In a statement, Zelenskiy called for global pressure to be exerted on Russia and said that he and Biden had also discussed expanding defence cooperation with an emphasis on long-range weapons. The Russian rouble opened at a near 15-month low against the dollar in early morning trade on Monday, responding for the first time to the Wagner mutiny. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that Russia attacked Ukraine overnight from the south with three Kalibr cruise missiles and eight Shahed drones – two missiles and seven drones were shot down. Also, it claimed, four drones of an unknown type were launched from the north, and all of them were shot down. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba urged the EU on Monday to “accelerate Russia’s defeat” by stepping up support for Ukraine. Reuters reports Kuleba, who was attending a meeting with EU foreign ministers, said on Twitter the fact that tanks had moved towards Moscow during a thwarted coup showed that “Ukraine will win”. RIA Novosti, the Russian state-owned news agency, is reporting that the criminal case against Yevgeny Prigozhin over the mutiny has not been dropped. It was reported at the weekend that investigation into him would be closed as part of the deal that brought the march on Moscow to an end. RIA posted to Telegram to say: The criminal case against Prigozhin has not been terminated, a source in the prosecutor general’s office told RIA Novosti. The aborted mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group in Russia demonstrates that Moscow committed a strategic mistake by waging war on Ukraine, Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday. “The events over the weekend are an internal Russian matter, and yet another demonstration of the big strategic mistake that President [Vladimir] Putin made with his illegal annexation of Crimea and the war against Ukraine,” he told reporters on a visit to Lithuania’s capital Vilnius. Reuters reports he added: “As Russia continues its assault, it is even more important to continue our support to Ukraine.” A couple of prominent Russian military bloggers on Telegram have suggested that defence minister Sergei Shoigu was known to be visiting the Belgorod region on the border with Ukraine on Friday, and that the images and video released today by the Russian defence ministry may date from that trip, which would have occurred before the Wagner mutiny. Nevertheless, at the FT’s Moscow bureau chief Max Seddon notes, the fact the video has been released is clearly intended to send a signal about the status of Shoigu. Here are some of the images released officially by Russia which they claim show defence minister Sergei Shoigu visiting occupied Ukraine. The location and date the video was taken are unverified. Events over the weekend show that Russia’s military power is “cracking” and the “monster Putin has created is turning against him”, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell has said. But he warned that the instability in Russia was dangerous and must be taken into account in the coming days and weeks. “What is happening in Russia, it is important to understand that this is cracking the Russian military power and affecting its political system. And certainly it is not it’s not a good thing to see that a nuclear power like Russia is going into a phase of political instability,” he said on arrival at a summit of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. “The most important conclusion is the war against Ukraine launched by Putin and the monster that Putin created with Wagner, the monster is fighting, the monster is acting against his creator. The political system it’s showing its fragilities and the military power is cracking,” he added. The cancelled mutiny in Russia will be top of the agenda at the Luxembourg summit of ministers who are expected to rapprove a pledge to give more funds to Ukraine’s military option. They are also expected to approve the 11th round of sanctions against Russia, aimed at stopping Putin circumventing previous sanctions by using third countries to shop crude oil and other products around the world. Citing Russia’s state-owned RIA news agency, Reuters reports that Russian security forces claim to have detained a Russian citizen on charges of sending money to Ukraine to buy drones and military equipment. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, offers this round-up of overnight news from Ukraine: At night, Russia attacked Ukraine from the south with three Kalibr cruise missiles and eight Shahed drones – two missiles and seven drones were shot down. Also, four drones of an unknown type were launched from the north, all of them were shot down. Air defence forces were working in Odesa, one missile and a drone hit “certain objects” in the region the spokesperson for the air force command of the armed forces of Ukraine, said. There were no reports of injuries. At dawn, Russian troops dropped prohibited incendiary shells on Kherson and Antonivka, fires broke out. Olhivka was also hit at night, one person was injured. The claims have not been independently verified. Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said he was cancelling the counter-terrorism regime imposed in the Russian capital during what the authorities on Saturday called an armed mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group. Sobyanin made the announcement in a statement posted on the Telegram messaging application on Monday, in which he thanked residents for their “calmness and understanding.” Reuters reports that separately, Russia’s national anti-terrorism committee said the situation in the country was “stable”.

More than 17,000 Ukrainian recruits have been trained by Britain and other allies over the last year to help fight Russia’s invasion, the UK Ministry of Defence said on Monday, according to AFP. The recruits, from many different walks of life, all went through a “gruelling” five-week programme which the ministry said had transformed them “from civilians to soldiers”. Britain and nine partner nations – Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Lithuania and the Netherlands – opened the initiative for new volunteer recruits to the armed forces of Ukraine in June last year. The UK-led training programme, dubbed Operation Interflex, taught the recruits, who had little to no previous military experience, various skills including weapons handling, battlefield first aid and patrol tactics. “The determination and resilience of the Ukrainian recruits that arrive on British soil, from all walks of life, to train to fight alongside our British and international forces, is humbling to witness,” the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said. “The UK and our international partners will continue to provide this vital support, helping Ukraine defend against Russian aggression, for as long as it takes.” Britain initially offered to train up to 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers in battlefield skills, based on the UK’s basic soldier training. The programme has now been extended and is on track to train about 30,000 recruits by 2024, according to the British defence ministry. It said intelligence had shown that the training made “a significant difference to the combat effectiveness of Ukraine”. “The UK armed forces maintains close communication with Ukraine to improve and evolve the course based on the skills most needed on the battlefield,” the ministry added. Chinese officials have described the abandoned Wagner rebellion as Moscow’s “internal affairs”, while one state media mouthpiece dismissed the divisions in Russia as an “illusion” being exploited by the west. Russia’s deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko held previously unannounced talks in Beijing on Sunday. It was not clear if they had been planned in advance or came as a result of the Wagner mutiny. China’s foreign ministry said it supported Russia in maintaining its national stability, without explicitly referring to Putin’s leadership. “As a friendly neighbour and comprehensive strategic partner in the new era, China supports Russia in maintaining national stability and achieving development and prosperity,” it said. It’s still unclear exactly what the terms of the deal to end the rebellion mean for Wagner, but the ISW suggests that the fact that Wagner troops are returning to base with their equipment means that the Kremlin intends to maintain at least elements of the group, rather than immediately demobilising them. It noted that the head of the Duma defence committee, Andrei Kartapolov, on Sunday announced it was working on a law to regulate private military companies but emphasised it was not necessary to ban the Wagner Group as it is “the most combat-ready unit in Russia.” He also said that Wagner forces in Rostov were “following orders of their command” and “did nothing reprehensible.” Kartapolov’s efforts to absolve Wagner personnel of responsibility for taking part in an armed rebellion and separate them from Prigozhin may indicate the Russian government’s desire to continue to use Wagner personnel in some capacity, and as ISW assessed on June 24, the Russian leadership could redeploy Wagner to Ukraine or instead commit them to international missions Ukraine has reclaimed some 130 square kilometres (50 square miles) from Russian forces along the southern front line since the start of the counteroffensive, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar has said according to Reuters. “The situation in the south has not undergone significant changes over the past week,” Maliar told the national broadcaster. She added that along the eastern part of the front line, which includes the Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Maryinka directions, about 250 combat clashes had taken place over the past week. A bit more context on Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defence minister who in many ways was at the centre of the Wagner rebellion. As the Guardian’s Pjotr Sauer explained in this report on Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin’s accusations against the leadership of the Russian military, the pair have been at loggerheads for months. Prigozhin has repeatedly accused the defence ministry of denying him the ammunition his men needed in Ukraine and of sacrificing Russian soldiers in missions doomed to fail. But in a series of audio messages beginning on Thursday and continuing on Friday, Prigozhin also accused the ministry of lying to the public about its justifications for invading Ukraine. The invasion had nothing to do with denazifying Ukraine nor was it launched because Ukraine was about to attack Russia – rather it was due to Shoigu’s desire for a second “hero of Russia” medal, he said. “What was the war for? The war needed for Shoigu to receive a hero star … The oligarchic clan that rules Russia needed the war,” Prigozhin said. “The mentally ill scumbags decided: ‘It’s OK, we’ll throw in a few thousand more Russian men as cannon fodder. They’ll die under artillery fire, but we’ll get what we want,’” Prigozhin continued. The Kremlin “likely risks Prigozhin’s armed rebellion expanding the window of acceptable anti-Kremlin criticism,” the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest analysis, particularly if the Kremlin does not retaliate further against the Wagner leader. The US thinktank used the example of a pre-planned meeting by the ultranationalist Angry Patriots Club in Moscow on Sunday, at which former Russian officer Igor Girkin reiterated that Putin needs to legally transfer certain presidential authorities to other parties if he is unwilling to assume control over the war in Ukraine as the supreme commander-in-chief. Officials were likely aware of the event as the club had been promoting it for weeks, the ISW noted, adding: If the Kremlin intends to use Prigozhin’s rebellion as pretext to start immediately suppressing antagonistic ultranationalists, then this event would have likely been a prime candidate to start that effort ... The Kremlin’s continued careful response to the armed rebellion will likely prompt other Russian nationalists to test Russian official reactions to more explicitly critical rhetoric. The Australian government has pledged a new $110m military assistance package in the next round of support for Ukraine, including vehicles, ammunition and humanitarian funding. “This package responds to Ukraine’s requests for vehicles and ammunition, and will make a tangible difference on the battlefield,” the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said in a statement. Canberra has committed 70 military vehicles, including 28 M113 armoured vehicles, 14 special operations vehicles, 28 MAN 40M medium trucks and 14 trailers; a new supply of 105mm artillery ammunition; and $10m to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs – for the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund – to assist in the provision of shelter, health services, water and sanitation. “We support international efforts to ensure [Russian president Vladimir] Putin’s aggression fails and that Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity prevails,” Albanese said. The government said the latest commitment took Australia’s total contribution to Ukraine to $790m, including $610m in military assistance. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has visited troops in Ukraine, Russian news agency Ria has reported, his first public appearance since the Wagner mutiny at the weekend. Shoigu has not commented on the rebellion, during which Wagner head Yevgeny Prigozhin demanded that the defence minister meet him in Rostov before calling off the mutiny. In a post on Telegram, Ria reported that Shoigu met Colonel-General Nikiforov, commander of the ‘western’ grouping: The minister also paid special attention to the organization of support for the troops involved in the special military operation and the creation of conditions for the safe deployment of personnel. In a video released by the Russian defence ministry, Shoigu is described as being in the western sector of the “special military operation” – Russia’s preferred term for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. There is nothing in the video which gives an indication of where or when it was filmed. The Russian rouble has opened at a near 15-month low against the dollar in early morning trade on Monday, responding for the first time to the Wagner mutiny, according to Reuters. By 0415 GMT, the rouble was 2.1% weaker against the dollar at 86.50, after earlier hitting 87.2300, its weakest point since late March 2022. It had lost 2.2% to trade at 94.37 versus the euro and shed 2.1% against the yuan to 11.95. More from Reuters: With the rouble not trading over the weekend, Russian banks were offering exchange rates well above official rate beyond 90 to the dollar. Monday’s full trading session begins at 0700 GMT. Investors globally were watching for ripple effects from the aborted mutiny, with some expecting a move into safe havens such as US government bonds and the dollar. Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia’s main export, was up 0.2% at $74.03 a barrel. Ukraine’s military says it has advanced between 600 metres and 1,000 metres on the southern and northern flanks around Bakhmut, the city which was taken by Wagner forces in May. The military also reported advances in the area on Saturday, as Wagner forces were marching on Moscow. It was not possible to verify the reports. AFP reported fierce clashes in the area on Sunday, with Ukrainian soldiers telling the news agency that the Wagner mutiny had not noticeably affected fighting in the area. “As it attacked yesterday, Russia continued to attack today,” one soldier said, adding. “Most people, most military, understand very well that the circus from Russia is still here.” Another said that for Ukraine, the fighting was going “according to plan”. Kyiv has said that the unrest in Russia offered a “window of opportunity” for its long-awaited counter-offensive. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine and the crisis in Russia. Ukraine’s military says it has advanced between 600 metres and 1,000 metres on the southern and northern flanks around Bakhmut, the city which was taken by Wagner forces in May. The military also reported advances in the area on Saturday, as Wagner forces were marching on Moscow. It was not possible to verify the reports. AFP reported fierce clashes in the area on Sunday, with Ukrainian soldiers telling the news agency that the Wagner mutiny had not noticeably affected fighting in the area. “As it attacked yesterday, Russia continued to attack today,” one soldier said, while another said that for Ukraine, the fighting was going “according to plan”. The Russian rouble has opened at a near 15-month low against the dollar in early morning trading on Monday, responding for the first time to the rebellion. At 0402 GMT, the rouble was 2.1% weaker against the dollar at 86.37, hitting 86.8800 on market opening, its weakest point since late March 2022, Reuters reported. In other key developments: US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said the Wagner uprising showed “real cracks” in Vladimir Putin’s government and may offer Ukraine a crucial advantage as it conducts a counteroffensive that could influence the outcome of the war. “This is an unfolding story and I think we’re in the midst of a moving picture,” Blinken told the CBS News programme Face the Nation. “We haven’t seen the last act.” There has been no word from Putin or Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin since the rebellion ended and their whereabouts are unclear. Putin appeared on Russian state TV on Sunday but the comments appeared to have been recorded before the mutiny. In an interview broadcast on state television he made no reference to the rebellion but renewed his commitment to the war in Ukraine, calling the “special military operation” his top priority. Lithuanian president Gitanas Nausėda warned that Nato would need to strengthen its eastern flank if Prigozhin is exiled to Belarus as agreed with Moscow. Following a state security council meeting on the mercenary group’s attempt to revolt against Russian military leadership, Nausėda said: “If Prigozhin or part of the Wagner group ends up in Belarus with unclear plans and unclear intentions, it will only mean that we need to further strengthen the security of our eastern borders.” State television also said Putin would attend a meeting of Russia’s Security Council this week, without elaborating. Belarus’ Belta news agency said Putin and President Alexander Lukashenko, who negotiated with Prigozhin to end the mutiny, spoke again on Sunday, after at least two calls on Saturday. The weekend’s events have “exposed the weakness of Putin’s regime”, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said, saying he had discussed the turmoil in Russia in a phone call with the US president, Joe Biden. In a statement, Zelenskiy called for global pressure to be exerted on Russia and said that he and Biden had also discussed expanding defence cooperation with an emphasis on long-range weapons. The Ukrainian president said he had also held “positive conversations” with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Polish president Andrzej Duda. They discussed “hostilities on the frontline” and the “further strengthening of Ukrainian troops”. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said that the revolt highlighted divisions within the Russian government. Speaking to the Provence newspaper on Sunday, Macron said that Wagner’s march to Moscow “shows the divisions that exist within the Russian camp, and the fragility of both its military and its auxiliary forces.” Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said he spoke to US defence secretary Lloyd Austin on Sunday, and described the Russian authorities as “weak”. Reznikov wrote on Twitter: “We talked about recent events in Russia. We agree that the Russian authorities are weak and that withdrawing Russian troops from Ukraine is the best choice for the Kremlin. Russia would be better served to address its own issues.” Russian officials said that houses and roads had been damaged because of the rebellion by the Wagner mercenaries. Nineteen houses had been damaged in the village of Yelizavetovka as a result of a firefight involving Wagner forces while about 10,000 square metres of roads in Rostov had been damaged by tank tracks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/07/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-287-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-07T00:08:31Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 287 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-287-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/07/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-287-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 287 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"President Vladimir Putin has said Russia will “defend ourselves with all the means at our disposal” and warned that the threat of nuclear war is “on the rise”. In an address to his human rights council, Russia’s leader said his army’s “special military operation” in Ukraine could be a “long process”, but he saw no need to mobilise additional soldiers at this point. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Russia is attempting to “freeze” the fighting in Ukraine over the winter to prepare its forces for a renewed assault early next year. Stoltenberg urged Nato allies to continue sending weapons to Kyiv over the winter, adding that the conditions for a peaceful settlement to the war are “not there now”. Oleksandr Starukh, the Zaporizhzhia regional governor, said on Telegram that Russia launched drone and missile strikes on two villages overnight, injuring a 15-year-old girl and two other people. The Guardian has not been able to verify the reports independently. A road accident in the temporarily occupied eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk has left 16 people dead and several injured, according to a Russian-backed official and state media. The accident involved a minibus and a truck, whose passengers included soldiers, and took place between Torez and Shakhtarsk, emergency services told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Shelling by Ukrainian forces killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk on Tuesday, according to the Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin. The head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council, Maria Pirogova. Dmytro Zhyvytsky, the governor of Sumy region on the Russian border, said several people were wounded when Russian forces fired 226 shells on seven communities during the day. A drone attack set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. The drone attack came a day after Ukraine appeared to launch attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. For Kyiv the strike represented an unprecedented operation to disrupt the Kremlin strategy of trying to cripple the Ukrainian electrical grid to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe in a country on the verge of winter. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said 31 “suspicious packages” had been sent to Ukrainian missions in 15 countries. In the past week, Ukraine says its embassies and consultants across Europe have received “bloody” packages, some containing animal eyes, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, has called on the country’s western allies to boycott Russian culture. Writing in the Guardian, Tkachenko argues that a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war would be “pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion”. The Kremlin said Vladimir Putin met senior officials on Tuesday to discuss “domestic security”, and Russia was taking “necessary” measures to fend off more Ukrainian attacks. One of the attacks struck the key Engels airfield in the Saratov region, where Russia keeps some of its strategic nuclear bombers. The Kremlin has said a US military aid spending bill providing $800m to Ukraine approved by lawmakers on Tuesday was “provocation towards our country”. The Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500m over President Joe Biden’s request earlier this year. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said it had not “enabled” Ukraine to carry out strikes inside Russia, after a spate of drone attacks on military-linked facilities deep within Russian territory. Kyiv did not directly claim responsibility but neither did it criticise the action, which killed three people and damaged long-range bombers and a fuel depot, according to reports from Russia. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by Blinken about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”. Britain has ordered “several thousand” NLAW anti-tank weapons to replace the 7,000 donated to Ukraine in the past year. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said the NLAWs played “a decisive role” in pushing back the Russian invasion, but Labour has complained that the deal took nearly 10 months to sign and the replacements will take three years to make. Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. Mykhailo Podolyak also told the Guardian that Russian forces had run short of their first batch of Iranian drones – and only had enough of their own cruise missiles in their stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukraine. Belarus plans to move military equipment and security forces on Wednesday and Thursday in what it says are checks on its response to possible acts of terrorism, the state Belta news agency reported. “During this period, it is planned to move military equipment and personnel of the national security forces,” the news agency cited the country’s security council as saying. Poland is preparing to deploy the German Patriot air defence system on its territory, after Berlin refused to place the system in Ukraine, Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, said on Twitter. Germany last month offered Poland the Patriot system to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed and killed two people in Poland. Europe is likely to scrape through this winter without cutting off gas customers despite reduced Russian supplies, but even adjusting to colder homes and paying more may not be enough in coming years, analysts have told AFP. Russia’s progressive reduction of gas supplies to Europe via pipeline triggered a bidding war for liquefied natural gas (LNG), sending prices sharply higher. At least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks of the war in Ukraine, according to a report by the UN’s human rights office. Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visited troops close to frontlines in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday. Addressing service personnel later in the presidential palace in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said he had spent the day with troops in Donbas, theatre of the heaviest battles, and in Kharkiv region, where Ukrainians have retaken swaths of territory from Russian forces. Russian and Ukrainian authorities confirmed the exchange of 120 people in a prisoner swap. According to the Russian defence ministry, 60 servicemen were returned from “Kyiv-controlled territory”. Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, Andrii Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, said. Ukraine’s health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts. In a statement, the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, told the Guardian he had been unable to leave Donetsk after spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine because he did not have any identity papers. Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds. Earlier Viktor Orbán’s government was accused of “holding hostage” funds for Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungary confirmed on Tuesday that it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage in separate disputes over Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2022/sep/07/ukraine-launches-surprise-counterattack-kharkiv-region-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-08T00:47:10Z","webTitle":"Ukraine launches surprise counterattack in Kharkiv region","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/07/ukraine-launches-surprise-counterattack-kharkiv-region-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2022/sep/07/ukraine-launches-surprise-counterattack-kharkiv-region-russia","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine launches surprise counterattack in Kharkiv region","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ukraine has launched a surprise counterattack in the north-east Kharkiv region, stretching Russian forces who are also facing Ukrainian attacks in the south. An official representing the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces “encircled” Balakliia, an eastern town of 27,000 people situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. “Today, the Ukrainian armed forces, after prolonged artillery preparation … began an attack on Balakliia,” Daniil Bezsonov said on Telegram. “At this time, Balakliia is in operative encirclement and within the firing range of Ukrainian artillery. All approaches are cut off by fire,” he said, adding that a successful Ukrainian offensive would threaten Russian forces in Izium, a strategically important town that Russia has been using for its own offensive in eastern Ukraine. Unverified footage circulating on social media on Wednesday showed what looked like a Ukrainian soldier posing in front of an entrance sign for Balakliia. Analysts have said that the initial target of the offensive could be the city of Kupyansk, a key road hub for Russian supplies heading south from the border into eastern Ukraine. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has remained guarded about the military counter-offensive in the east while Ukraine’s army has yet to comment on the alleged new battle plan. Without giving details, Zelenskiy reported “good news” from the Kharkiv region east of Kyiv, implying some settlements had been recaptured from Russian forces but adding that “now is not the right time to name those settlements where the Ukrainian flag has returned”. In a Wednesday evening address, Zelenskiy cited “the extremely successful hits in areas where the occupiers are concentrated”, and thanked Ukrainian artillery troops for what he said were successful strikes against Moscow’s forces in the south. One of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s advisers, Oleksiy Arestovych, said on Tuesday night that “lightning-fast changes are taking place” in the Kharkiv region, in parallel to the southern offensive in the Kherson region announced by Ukraine’s military last week. In Washington, a senior Pentagon official said that Ukrainian forces are making “slow but meaningful progress” on the battlefield. “We’ll see how things pan out,” said under secretary of defense for policy Colin Kahl. “But I certainly think things are going better on the Ukrainian side right now in the south than is true on the Russian side.” The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based thinktank, reported on Wednesday that Ukrainian forces probably captured Verbivka (less than 2 miles north-west of Balakliia) on Tuesday, citing geo-locatable images posted by Ukrainian soldiers. Without specifying any locations, the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, told Ukrainian television on Wednesday that a “counterattack is under way and … our forces are enjoying some success. Let’s leave it at that”. Ukraine’s military did give some confirmation of the alleged offensive on Wednesday, claiming Ukraine’s army shot down a Russian military Sukhoi Su-25 aircraft near Volokhiv Yar, a town about 12 miles from Balakliia. Ukraine for a long time spoke openly of its intent to launch a large-scale southern offensive in the Kherson region, forcing Russia to transfer some of its most elite units from the east to Kherson. According to the ISW, this has opened up opportunities for Ukraine to launch attacks near Kharkiv. “Russia’s deployment of forces from Kharkiv and eastern Ukraine to Ukraine’s south is likely enabling Ukrainian counterattacks of opportunity,” the thinktank wrote late on Tuesday. Rob Lee, a military analyst at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said the Ukrainian attack indicated that Russian forces near Kharkiv were stretched. “Russia doesn’t have strong reserves in this area that could be sent quickly to plug gaps and reinforce key towns. Ukraine may have a numerical and armour superiority here.” The Russian government and its defence ministry have not commented on Ukraine’s alleged offensives. Speaking at an economic forum in the far-eastern Russian city of Vladivostok on Wednesday, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said Russia had not lost anything as a result of its military campaign in Ukraine. A number of prominent pro-Kremlin bloggers volleyed criticism at the Russian authorities after Ukraine’s latest offensive. Igor Girkin, a Russian ultra-nationalist and former military leader for the Russian-backed republics in eastern Ukraine, said the outskirts of Balakliia were defended by poorly equipped mobilised forces from the Donbas region who “didn’t know how to use available heavy weapons”. He added that Ukraine also took control of the settlement of Volokhiv Yar overnight. Aleksandr Kots, a pro-Kremlin war blogger, on Wednesday denounced the Russian authorities for hiding “bad news”. “We need to start doing something about the system where our leadership doesn’t like to talk about bad news and their subordinates don’t want to upset their bosses,” he said. Ukraine’s offensive in Kharkiv came as Andrei Turchak, head of Russia’s ruling party, proposed to hold referendums on joining Russia in occupied territories on 4 November, when Russia celebrates its National Unity day. “It would be right and symbolic to hold referendums on this very day,” Turchak wrote on his Telegram channel, the most concrete sign yet that Russia is planning to go ahead with annexing Ukrainian territories. Also on Wednesday, a new report by the London-based Centre for Information Resilience’s Eyes on Russia said it was highly likely that Russian forces shelled the Russian-occupied Enerhodar, the satellite town of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The centre’s investigators also verified previously published footage of a rocket firing from next to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – controlled by Russia – as well as images of Russian equipment at the plant. After Russian forces took control of Enerhodar and the nuclear plant in March, the two sides have traded blame over the shelling in both areas. Ukraine has said Russia is carrying out false-flag operations to blame Ukrainian forces, while Russia has said the attacks are carried out by Ukraine. The centre’s investigators geo-located footage showing the impact of shelling in front of a building in Enerhodar. The footage showed a larger quantity of dirt on the left side of the crater, indicating that the shell came from the right side of the camera, stated the report. The investigators then traced the potential trajectory of the rocket and concluded that it was launched from the southern side of the Dnieper river in Zaporizhzhia region, an area under Russian control since February."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/08/bank-of-england-to-lend-uk-energy-companies-as-much-as-40bn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-08T17:41:50Z","webTitle":"Bank of England to lend UK energy companies as much as £40bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/08/bank-of-england-to-lend-uk-energy-companies-as-much-as-40bn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/08/bank-of-england-to-lend-uk-energy-companies-as-much-as-40bn","fields":{"headline":"Bank of England to lend UK energy companies as much as £40bn","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Bank of England will lend UK energy companies as much as £40bn to deal with soaring market prices amid fears of another wave of energy company collapses. Prime minister Liz Truss, on her third day in office, said she wanted to make sure energy companies have the cash they need to buy energy if prices jump. Reports this week said British Gas owner Centrica was in talks with banks to secure extra cash as Vladimir Putin continues to choke off Europe’s supply of gas. The bailout fund for energy companies was announced alongside a suspension of the energy price cap, which Truss replaced with an “energy price guarantee” to freeze household energy bills for two years. The government will also offer “equivalent support” for six months for businesses – most of whom have not received any financial aid to address the energy crisis prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Companies who use the Bank of England’s energy markets financing scheme will have to sign up to a “wider set of conditions”, the Treasury said. During the coronavirus pandemic support schemes some companies were banned from paying dividends after receiving loans. Amid warnings energy markets were facing a “Lehman” moment, when a liquidity crunch precipitated the global banking crisis, the government said the scheme would provide “last resort” financing. The money will essentially guarantee that energy suppliers can pay for any power they commit to buying in the wholesale markets, as well as letting them insure themselves to protect against price rises. Surging prices have prompted ballooning calls for collateral for energy trades, forcing even the largest suppliers to turn to their banks to increase their overdrafts. The governments of Sweden and Finland stepped in with similar measures at the weekend, with the Finnish economy minister saying: “This has had the ingredients for a kind of a Lehman Brothers of energy industry.” Since the start of the energy crisis more than 30 suppliers have collapsed. That has left energy customers concentrated with bigger firms, whose collapse would probably cost the taxpayer billions of pounds. Some analysts believe that the largest collapse so far, of Bulb, could cost more than £4bn. Officials are scrambling to draw up details of the scheme, but the government on Thursday said it may only be able to reveal a start date by the end of October. It is understood that further details of the scheme will be published next week. Tim Speed, an energy specialist at law firm, Shakespeare Martineau said: “A £40bn liquidity fund provides some comfort for energy suppliers, but the support needs to start with immediate effect to stabilise the market. Further supplier casualties will end up costing consumers more.” In an indication of the hurried design of Truss’s plan, the government said it would also not be able to provide details until next week of how financial support will be delivered to households or businesses. Nevertheless, business leaders welcomed the scale of the ambition displayed in a package estimated to cost as much as £100bn for the first year alone. Rain Newtown-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, the UK’s largest business lobby group, welcomed “bold and decisive action” that will “limit some of the damaging hardship faced by families this winter and for the wider economy”. “Big spending now needs big plans to recapture sustainable economic growth,” she added. As well as support measures over the next few months, Truss also promised to rewrite the rules governing how customers buy electricity and gas – throwing the future of regulator Ofgem into doubt. Those policies included: A review of the UK’s energy regulation that promises to deliver “fundamental reforms to the structure and regulation” An energy supply taskforce, led by Madelaine McTernan, who currently heads the government’s vaccines taskforce, that will seek to agree long-term contracts for energy supply at steady prices A review of the UK’s 2050 net zero target to ensure it is “not placing undue burdens on businesses or consumers” McTernan, a banker who held senior roles at Credit Suisse and Lehman Brothers before entering government in 2017, will also look to strike better deals with solar, wind and nuclear power generators, who have seen their incomes rise because the price of electricity is pegged to the price of gas. Truss announced the government would be adopting an industry proposal to replace current contracts for renewable energy with a contracts for difference regime, which caps returns and should deliver a lower fixed price, over a longer term. Economists said the package was likely to soften the impact of the long recession forecast for the UK as the energy crisis caused inflation to soar. The plan is expected to match – and in many cases exceed – the actions of other countries facing similar predicaments. It was reported on Thursday that Germany plans to give discounts to households and businesses on a certain amount of power in its €65bn plan. Martin McTague, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the promise of bills support for the first time during the crisis was “a huge relief for millions of small businesses”. However, he said Truss offered “not enough information, yet, for them to plan”. McTague also cautioned against a “cliff-edge after six months” if, as planned, the government withdraws support for companies. The government should have a “broad, realistic and fair” definition of which sectors are “vulnerable”, he said. The business support is expected to focus on subsidies for wholesale gas prices. The government has promised to keep prices lower for all businesses for six months, and will consider how to cut back support to certain sectors in a review in three months’ time. Households will see costs frozen at an average of £2,500 a year, a measure that is expected to support consumer spending. The government said it would also help reduce inflation, curbing the headline rate – which reached 10.1% in July – by four or five percentage points. Chris O’Shea, chief executive of Centrica, the largest UK domestic energy supplier, said it was a “bold customer support package” that “will bring immediate relief to hard pressed households”. Paul Dales of Capital Economics, a consultancy, said the package would “reduce inflation and limit the size of the recession”, but that it would also lead to higher interest rates and higher government debt. Energy companies called for the government to reduce the use of fossil fuels. Michael Lewis, chief executive of supplier E.ON UK, said the UK needed to make more “cheap, clean electricity” and “reduce our fossil fuel use”. However, he said he was “disappointed not to see a greater commitment to energy efficiency as a long-term solution to the current crisis, and as the foundation stone of that cleaner, greener future.” Keith Anderson, chief executive of ScottishPower, called for “a three-pronged attack to tackle the issue at source by weaning the country off fossil fuels, doubling down on cheap, clean renewables and, importantly, decoupling electricity prices from gas.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/04/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-162-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T01:38:41Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 162 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/04/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-162-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/04/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-162-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 162 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Eight people have been killed and four have been wounded in Russian artillery shelling in the eastern Ukrainian town of Toretsk in Donetsk region on Thursday, the regional governor said. The shelling hit a public transport stop where people had gathered, the governor for the area, Pavlo Kyrylenko, wrote on Telegram. Three children were among the wounded, he said. The UN is conducting a fact-finding mission in response to requests from both Russia and Ukraine after 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed in an explosion at a barracks in separatist-controlled Olenivka. The warring nations have accused each other of carrying out the attack. Ukraine claims it was a special operation plotted in advance by the Kremlin, and carried out by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group. Russia’s defence ministry, however, claims the Ukrainian military used US-supplied rockets to strike the prison. A US official accused Moscow of preparing to plant fake evidence to make it look like the recent mass killing of Ukrainian prisoners in an attack on a Russian-controlled prison was caused by Ukraine. Kyiv and Moscow have traded blame over the strikes on the prison in Kremlin-controlled Olenivka, in eastern Ukraine, which Russia said took place overnight on 29 July. Amnesty International has said the Ukrainian army is endangering the life of civilians by basing themselves in residential areas, in a report rejected by Ukrainian government representatives as placing blame on it for Russia’s invasion. The human rights group’s researchers found that Ukrainian forces were using some schools and hospitals as bases, firing near houses and sometimes living in residential flats. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, accused Amnesty of “distorting the real picture”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wants to talk directly to China’s leader, Xi Jinping, in the hope China can use its influence with Russia to bring the war to an end. According to a report in the South China Morning Post Zelenskiy said: “It’s a very powerful state. It’s a powerful economy. So (it) can politically, economically influence Russia. And China is [also a] permanent member of the UN security council.” So far, China has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion and its president, Xi Jinping, told Putin it would support Russia’s “sovereignty and security”. A Moscow court has convicted the US basketball player Brittney Griner on drug charges, sentencing her to nine years in prison and a 1m rouble fine in a politically charged verdict that could lead to a prisoner swap with the United States. Griner, a basketball talent who played in Russia during off-seasons from the Phoenix Mercury, was arrested for cannabis possession in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport in February. The US Senate has ratified Finland and Sweden’s accession to Nato, voting 95-1 in support. The US is the 23rd member state to ratify what would be the most significant expansion of the 30-member alliance since the 1990s as it responds to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “This historic vote sends an important signal of the sustained, bipartisan US commitment to Nato, and to ensuring our alliance is prepared to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow,” the president, Joe Biden, said in a statement. All 30 Nato members must ratify the accession before Finland and Sweden can become members. Ukraine is pulling out its 40 peacekeepers from the Nato-led mission in Kosovo, which totals 3,800 members, according to Ukraine news. In March, Zelenskiy issued a decree for all missions to return to Ukraine to support the war. A Russian official in Ukraine has claimed Ukrainian forces are using western arms to attack the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Europe’s largest nuclear plant is now controlled by Russian forces and being used as a military base, according to Reuters. However, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Ukrainian forces are not firing against Russian forces “lest there be a terrible accident involving the nuclear plant”. Reuters was unable to verify battlefield accounts from either side of the war. The first shipment of grain to leave Ukraine under a deal to ease Russia’s naval blockade has reached Turkey. The Sierra Leone-registered ship Razoni set sail from Odesa port for Lebanon on Monday under an accord brokered by Turkey and the UN. The ship has been inspected by members of the joint coordination centre, and is now expected to move through the Bosphorus Strait “shortly”. The Ukrainian president has dismissed the importance of the first grain export shipment from his country since Russia invaded, saying it was carrying a fraction of the crop Kyiv must sell to help salvage its shattered economy. In downbeat comments, Zelenskiy, via video to students in Australia on Wednesday, said more time was needed to see whether other grain shipments would follow. The Kremlin said on Thursday that the Turkish-brokered deal to unblock Ukraine’s grain exports from the Black Sea was not a “one-off mechanism”, and that it hoped it would continue to work effectively. The deal, which allows for Ukrainian grain to be shipped to world markets via Turkey, must be renewed every 120 days by agreement of the parties. The first shipment of Ukrainian grain to the UK since the war began is expected to arrive in 10 days, western officials said. Millions of tonnes of grain have been stuck in Ukraine since Russia invaded just over six months ago. Nato members are working closely with defence companies to ensure Ukraine gets more supplies of weapons and equipment to be prepared for the long haul in its war with Russia, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Thursday. Stoltenberg told Reuters in an interview: “We are providing a lot of support but we need to do even more and be prepared for the long haul.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/20/eu-urges-member-states-to-slash-gas-use-by-15","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-20T13:24:53Z","webTitle":"EU urges member states to slash gas use by 15% to counter ‘Russian blackmail’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/20/eu-urges-member-states-to-slash-gas-use-by-15","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jul/20/eu-urges-member-states-to-slash-gas-use-by-15","fields":{"headline":"EU urges member states to slash gas use by 15% to counter ‘Russian blackmail’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The European Union’s executive body has urged member states to slash their gas consumption by 15%, as it warned that a complete shutdown of Russian supplies was “likely”. The EU has been scrambling to wean itself off Russian gas since the invasion of Ukraine, but is alarmed about a potential energy crisis this winter. In response to EU support for Kyiv, the Kremlin has already stopped or reduced gas supplies to a dozen EU member states and is expected to send lower volumes of gas to Germany when the Nord Stream 1 pipeline reopens on Thursday after scheduled maintenance works. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the Kremlin had kept gas storage as low as possible before the invasion and gone on to cut supplies. “Russia is blackmailing us, Russia is using energy as a weapon,” she told reporters. “It is a likely scenario that there is a full cut-off of Russian gas and that would hit the whole European Union. A gas crisis in the single market, our economic powerhouse, will affect every single member state.” Presenting the commission’s winter plan on Wednesday, she proposed that between 1 August to 31 March 2023 there should be a voluntary reduction in gas use to 15% below the average for that period over the past five years. Under the proposals, if there is a drastic reduction or complete shutdown of Russian gas, Brussels could declare an EU-wide emergency and introduce legally binding reduction targets. While emergency measures would fall on industry, EU governments are being asked to step up campaigns encouraging consumers to save energy, by turning down thermostats, shortening showers and not leaving appliances on standby. Frans Timmermans, the EU’s top official in charge of the European Green Deal, said consumers would remain protected, but could also do their bit. “Do we have to have air conditioning set at 20 degrees?” he asked. “[The temperature] could be higher, couldn’t it? Of course it might reduce a bit of our comfort, but it might also reduce a lot of our consumption.” The targets have to be agreed by EU member states, which are responsible for choosing their own energy mix. The call for mandatory gas savings could trigger a backlash from countries less exposed to Russian gas, which may blame other member states for building up a dangerous dependency. One senior EU diplomat suggested that Germany, which imported 50% of its gas from Russia before the war, could face some tough questions from countries that recall Berlin’s strictures on debt during the eurozone crisis. “So we have to pay for your past mistakes. Now remind me what you said about debt in the past,” the diplomat said, describing how the debate might play out, rather than expressing their country’s stance. EU energy ministers are to discuss the plan next Tuesday, but the Netherlands and Denmark have already signalled they might not be ready to agree the targets, because their parliaments need time to scrutinise the law. Before the invasion of Ukraine, Russia supplied 40% of EU gas, but flows are sharply down. Russia has halted supply to the Baltic states, Poland, Bulgaria and Finland, and reduced flows to Germany, Italy, Austria, Denmark, Slovakia and the Netherlands. Since mid-June 2022, during a period of scheduled maintenance, flows through Nord Stream 1 have fallen by 60%. Vladimir Putin suggested on Wednesday that the pipeline’s capacity could be reduced. The Russian president claimed there was a problem with pumping units. Sources in Moscow told Reuters on Tuesday that Nord Stream 1 was expected to resume operations on time, although at less than its capacity of about 160m cubic metres a day. Under a worst-case scenario of a sharp cut in Russian supplies during a cold winter, the EU economy could shrink by 1.5%, the commission estimates. It argues that early action to save energy combined with a milder winter could limit the economic hit to a 0.4% average reduction in GDP across the 27-country bloc. The International Monetary Fund, however, has made a bleaker forecast, suggesting the hardest-hit countries could see a GDP fall of 6%. Under the latest plan, member states are encouraged to look at switching to alternative fuels, even delaying the decision to phase out coal or nuclear power, although clean energy is prioritised. Social Democrat MEPs urged the EU to introduce a windfall tax on energy companies. “It would be extremely unfair if we make the most vulnerable among us, including low-income households and elderly persons, tighten their belts while energy companies with skyrocketing profits pay little or no share of the burden,” said Mohammed Chahim, a Dutch MEP. The EU has already pledged to end dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 2027 at the latest, with a ban on 90% of Russian oil imports due to be complete by the end of the year. Since the invasion, the EU has ramped up supplies of liquified natural gas and pipeline gas from countries such as Norway, the US and the UK. It has also been criticised by human rights groups for an agreement signed this week with Azerbaijan to boost gas supplies via the southern gas corridor, a 2,200-mile (3,500km) pipeline connecting the EU via Turkey, Georgia and the resource-rich Caspian Sea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/07/nuclear-apocalypse-was-postponed-in-1968-now-its-back-on-the-agenda-hiroshima-npt","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-07T06:00:37Z","webTitle":"Nuclear apocalypse was postponed in 1968.

Now it’s back on the agenda","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A crucial event for the future of international peace and security – and global sanity – got under way at UN headquarters in New York last week, though, given the lack of political and media attention, you might be forgiven for not noticing. The review conference of the landmark 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty (NPT) involves 191 state party signatories. Few international agreements enjoy such near universal support. Nuclear-armed Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea are shameful hold-outs. Simply put, the NPT is about preventing nuclear war by encouraging disarmament, halting proliferation and promoting peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology. Up to now, at least, it’s helped stop another nuclear catastrophe. “Another” is the operative word. The 77th anniversary of the first such catastrophe was commemorated on 6 August at Hiroshima, where an estimated 140,000 civilians died, or were condemned to an agonising death, on one day in 1945. To put that in perspective, roughly 10,000 civilians have died in Ukraine in just under six months. Western public opinion, lulled by the end of the cold war, seems to have lost sight of the immeasurable horror of atomic warfare. There are no Greenham Commons nowadays, even though new missile deployments proliferate. If recent events puncture that complacency, it won’t be wholly bad. UN secretary-general António Guterres raised the alarm last week when opening the NPT conference. “Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,” he warned. “We have been extraordinarily lucky so far. But luck is not a strategy. Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict.” Russia illustrates Guterres’s point in terrifying fashion. Having previously seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, in southern Ukraine, it is using it as a fortress from which to fire artillery with impunity. The UN nuclear watchdog says a disaster is in the making. Launching his invasion, Vladimir Putin placed Russia’s nuclear forces on alert and issued a crude threat. Any western attempt to interfere, he said, “will lead to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history”. Whether bluffing or not, Putin’s nuclear blackmail has undoubtedly deterred direct US and Nato intervention in Ukraine and so prolonged the war. Now there’s concern that China may adopt similar tactics over Taiwan. Anti-nuclear campaigners say NPT pledges must be honoured and strengthened, and most countries agree. But the treaty is in trouble all the same. In practice, all five recognised nuclear weapons states – the US, Russia, China, France and Britain – are breaking their Article VI treaty commitment to pursue disarmament “in good faith”, thereby setting an execrable example. Instead, a multilateral nuclear arms race is gathering pace, unrestrained in the case of the US and Russia by bilateral cold war arms control treaties discarded by Putin and Donald Trump, and propelled in the case of China by neo-imperial ambition. “All of the nuclear-armed states are increasing or upgrading their arsenals and most are sharpening nuclear rhetoric and the role nuclear weapons play in their military strategies,” the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said in its authoritative annual report. The US and Russia, while claiming to support further nuclear arms reduction, still maintain 3,708 and 4,477 nukes respectively. China has 350, France 290 and Britain 225. Beijing’s arsenal is predicted to more than double in the next decade. And it’s not only about Armageddon. Growing stockpiles of so-called tactical or battlefield weapons and new hypersonic missiles are making “limited” nuclear warfare more likely. Hypocrisy and double-talk are not confined to the big players. Like Israel, India and Pakistan, Britain and France are modernising their arsenals. President Emmanuel Macron, in true Napoleonic style, wants to extend France’s nuclear shield to cover all of Europe. In a joint statement last week, Britain, France and the US described the NPT as “irreplaceable” and “vital”. They said they were making “enduring efforts” to fulfil their Article VI obligations. Last year, however, Boris Johnson’s government relaxed Britain’s no-first-use doctrine to allow a UK nuclear response to a non-nuclear attack. Ministers also raised the cap on the Trident warhead stockpile and reduced publicly available information. “Both decisions have led many to question the government’s commitment to disarmament,” a House of Commons research paper noted wryly. Even as it extolled the virtues of collaboration, the joint statement castigated Russia for its “irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and reckless attacks endangering nuclear reactors”. It went on: “We condemn those who would use or threaten to use nuclear weapons for military coercion, intimidation, and blackmail.” Quite right. But such criticism sits uneasily alongside strictures by Stephen Lovegrove, UK national security adviser, who has warned that a “rapid escalation to strategic conflict”, meaning nuclear war, could too easily result from the current shouting match between the west and Russia and China. To make matters worse, North Korea’s rogue regime is expected to conduct a geopolitically (and physically) destabilising underground nuclear test soon. But there are glimmers of hope, too. Last-ditch negotiations to curb Iran’s nuclear programme have resumed. Plus 86 countries have now signed the symbolic, nonetheless important, 2021 Nuclear Weapon Ban treaty. Why, as appears the case, is the world teetering ever more precariously on the brink of renewed nuclear catastrophe? There are many factors. Increased insecurity, rising nationalism, weak and stupid leaders, vested commercial interests. Yet as much as anything, the reawakened spectre of nuclear annihilation is the product of a defining 21st-century phenomenon: the increasingly anarchic refusal of states to uphold international law and the UN-underwritten, post-1945 global order. They just won’t stick to the rules, even as they stick it to each other."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-286-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-06T00:14:12Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 286 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-286-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-286-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 286 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russia and Ukraine said they had exchanged 60 prisoners of war on each side in the latest of a series of such swaps. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the returned soldiers included dozens who had held out in the besieged Azovstal steelworks in city of Mariupol. Russia’s defence ministry said the freed Russian soldiers would be flown to Moscow to receive medical care and psychological support. A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. Shelling by Ukrainian forces killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city on Tuesday, according to the Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexei Kulemzin. The head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling had killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council, Maria Pirogova. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. At least four people were killed on Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, amid Russian strikes during which 60 of 70 missiles were shot down. The strikes targeted Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, the air force said. Energy workers had already begun work on restoring power, said Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. Officials said airstrikes destroyed homes in the south, knocked out power in the north and killed at least two people. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukrainian drones attacked two airbases at Ryazan and Saratov in south-central Russia, killing three servicemen and wounding four, with two aircraft damaged. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for what would represent the deepest strikes inside the Russian heartland since Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Russian and Ukrainian authorities confirmed the exchange of 120 people in a prisoner swap on Tuesday. According to the Russian defence ministry, 60 servicemen were returned from “Kyiv-controlled territory”. Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, said Andrii Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, said. The Kremlins spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”. A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said that Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, as a result of diplomatic pressure and Iran’s own internal political turmoil. Mikhailo Podolyak told the Guardian that Russian forces currently had enough of its own cruise missiles in its stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure like the salvo fired on Monday. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, told the Guardian he had been unable to leave Donetsk after spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine because he did not have any identity papers. Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds. Earlier Viktor Orbán’s government was accused of “holding hostage” funds for Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungary confirmed on Tuesday that it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage in separate disputes over Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds. Ukrainian embassies have received more “bloody packages”, according to its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had been targeted with packages soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. The Russian state-owned bank VTB said it was hit by an “unprecedented cyber-attack from abroad”, which it said was the largest cyber-attack in its history. In a statement, it said it was repelling the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, and that an analysis indicated it was a “planned and large-scale” attack. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. Canadian-made parts were found in “kamikaze” Iranian drones used by Russia to attack Ukraine, according to an investigative project from the NGO Statewatch. It said components from 30 European and American companies, including antenna parts from Tallysman Wireless, a Canadian manufacturer, were used in Shahed 136 drones. The White House has said the latest Russian strikes against Ukraine are a reminder of Vladimir Putin’s brutality. John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, also told reporters that an oil price cap would not have any long-term impact on global oil prices, Reuters reported. Moldovan police on Monday found fragments of a missile in a northern region near the border with Ukraine, state information portal Prima Sursa quoted the police as saying after Russia carried out missile strikes. Russia’s recent mobilisation increased its military threat in Ukraine, with better-trained soldiers arriving at the frontline, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces said. But Russia was using a lot of old equipment because it had no other way of replenishing supplies, and the Russians had made only slow progress around Bakhmut, one of the main battle zones in eastern Ukraine, Reuters reported. Vladimir Putin has driven across the Kerch Bridge linking Russia and the Crimean peninsula that was damaged by a truck bomb in October. The Russian president spoke to workers and a senior government official, Reuters reported. India gave a list of its products to Moscow for access to Russian markets, foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said, as his country seeks to narrow a growing trade deficit with Russia at a time when Moscow faces acute shortages of some crucial materials after western sanctions. The Kremlin has warned the new western price cap on Russian oil will destabilise global energy markets, but claimed it would not affect its invasion of Ukraine. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was preparing its response to the move by the G7 and allies. The Chinese foreign ministry has said it will continue energy cooperation with Russia after the G7, EU and Australia imposed the price cap. China, which said it would continue on the basis of respect and mutual benefit, has increased its purchases of Russia’s Urals oil blends this year. Olaf Scholz has warned the west to avoid creating a new cold war by dividing the world into blocs. Writing in an opinion piece for Foreign Affairs magazine, the German chancellor called for every effort to be made to build new partnerships."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
