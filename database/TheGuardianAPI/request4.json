Catch up with the must-read news and analysis","bodyText":"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. The battle for Bakhmut rages as death toll rises Ukrainian authorities insisted they would continue to try to hold the eastern city of Bakhmut, in what has become one of the longest and bloodiest battles since the war began. Despite continuing rumours that a Ukrainian retreat is imminent, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy instructed the army to bolster the defence of the city, even as the death toll rises. Isobel Koshiw and Pjotr Sauer reported that Ukraine was suffering an estimated 100-200 casualties a day. Andriy, a deputy commander in the Donetsk region whose battalion is fighting in the Bakhmut area, told them that “positions are ready [for them] to retreat to. The reason they are still there is more of a political thing.” On the other side, a Moscow-based analyst with links to Russia’s ministry of defence estimated that 6,000-8,000 Russian troops had been killed, predominantly recently recruited convicts. However, the analyst noted it was very difficult to be precise because the “brunt” of the fighting was being carried out by Wagner mercenary forces. “Wagner doesn’t always retrieve the bodies of its fighters, while many of the former convicts fighting are not properly registered,” he said, on condition of anonymity. Despite the brutal conflict, many civilians remain in Bakhmut. Peter Beaumont met a police major who was attempting to persuade those caring for children to let them be evacuated. It is a search that has led to rumours that police are taking children from parents who refuse to leave, which has prompted some families to hide their sons and daughters, inexplicable as that might seem. “But it’s not correct,” the officer said. “The law says we can only take children with permission of the parents. If the children don’t have parents but have a guardian, we can get permission from social services to take them out.” Ukraine said on Tuesday that about 4,000 civilians had been killed in Bakhmut during Russia’s assault. Russia launches largest missile barrage in weeks At least nine people were reported killed on Thursday after Russia unleashed its largest missile bombardment against Ukraine in three weeks. Critical infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions across the country were hit. At least six of the dead were killed in a strike on a residential area in the western Lviv region, 700km from the frontline, Ukrainian emergency services said. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Six hypersonic missiles, able to evade air defences, were among those launched. Lorenzo Tondo in Kyiv reported that the attacks also briefly disconnected the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe’s biggest – from the grid. The UN’s nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the plant’s safety and security. Pro-Ukraine group may have sabotaged Nord Stream European and US intelligence officials obtained tentative intelligence to suggest a pro-Ukrainian saboteur group may have been behind the bombing of the Nord Stream gas pipelines last year, according to reports in the New York Times and German newspaper Die Zeit. German investigators believe the attack on the pipelines was carried out by a team of six people, using a yacht that had been hired by a company registered in Poland and owned by two Ukrainian citizens, according to Die Zeit. Dan Sabbagh, Philip Oltermann and Lorenzo Tondo reported that the information was shared between European intelligence agencies in an effort to establish more information about those who carried out the undersea bombings in September, an attack that had left western governments perplexed. Details about the intelligence remains sketchy and it is unclear what confidence the US intelligence community places in the theory, as well as who may have organised, funded and directed such a daring attack on the gas pipelines running between Russia and Germany. But it is suggested that the government of Kyiv did not direct the underwater strike. An unarmed PoW was allegedly shot dead by Russians Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed to “find the murderers” of an unarmed Ukrainian prisoner of war apparently shot dead by Russian troops in footage that spread rapidly across social media on Monday. In the graphic 12-second clip that first circulated on Telegram and was widely shared on Twitter, a detained combatant, named by the Ukrainian military as Tymofiy Mykolayovych Shadura, is seen standing in a shallow trench smoking a cigarette. The soldier, in uniform with a Ukrainian flag insignia on his arm, says “Glory to Ukraine” and is then apparently shot with automatic weapons. Lorenzo Tondo and Pjotr Sauer reported this story. Ukraine urged the international criminal court to investigate the footage. ‘Foreign agent’ law stirs anti-Russian sentiment in Georgia After two nights of widespread, violent protests, Georgia’s ruling party withdrew a draft law that had drawn comparisons with a 2012 law in Russia that has since been used to crack down on dissent and suppress western-funded NGOs and media. Pjotr Sauer reported that the proposed “foreign agent” bill faced criticism that it would limit press freedom and undercut the country’s efforts to become a candidate for European Union membership. Across two nights hundreds of police, many carrying riot shields, used water cannon and teargas in clashes in Georgia’s capital. More than 100 protesters were arrested during this week’s protests. Thousands had marched in the streets to rally against the proposed law that would require any organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from overseas to register as “foreign agents” or face substantial fines. Speaking on Wednesday evening as the protests were continuing, Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for “democratic success” in Georgia and voiced gratitude for Georgian support for Ukraine. “There is no Ukrainian who would not wish success to our friendly Georgia. Democratic success. European success,” he said. Rightwing Republicans rail against US aid for Ukraine Marjorie Taylor Greene, an influential far-right Republican in the US Congress, called for the US to stop aid to Ukraine, David Smith wrote, giving added voice to a grassroots revolt in the party that threatens bipartisan support for the war against Russia. The Georgia congresswoman is a notorious provocateur who has made racist, antisemitic and Islamophobic statements and promoted bizarre conspiracy theories. Yet she has emerged as a prominent voice in the House of Representatives after forging a bond with the speaker, Kevin McCarthy, who vowed that Republicans will not write a “blank cheque” for Ukraine. Pentagon accused of blocking effort to hand Russia war crimes evidence to ICC The Pentagon was accused of blocking the sharing of US intelligence with the international criminal court (ICC) about Russian war crimes in Ukraine, Julian Borger reported. The Biden White House and the state department have been a proponent of cooperation with the Hague-based ICC as a means of holding Russian forces accountable for widespread war crimes, but the defence department is firmly opposed on the grounds that the precedent could eventually be turned against US soldiers. Meanwhile, the top US intelligence official said Washington did not believe the Russian military could recover from its losses in Ukraine to make territorial gains there this year, but she warned that Vladimir Putin still believed time was on his side. The assessment, presented by the director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, at a Senate hearing on Wednesday morning, was noncommittal on whether Ukraine could take back significant amounts of occupied land in its planned counter-offensive this spring. War prompts Ukrainians to embrace their language Until last year Kyiv was largely a Russian-speaking city. A survey in January revealed that since Putin’s invasion a year ago, 33% of Kyivans have adopted the Ukrainian language. About 46% said they had been speaking Ukrainian for a long time. Another 13% remain Russian speakers, Luke Harding reported. Ukrainians are bilingual. Ukrainian has traditionally been spoken in the west of the country, with Russian more prevalent in the south and east. The most prominent switcher is Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who grew up in the central Russophone metallurgical city of Kryvyi Rih. As president, Zelenskiy addresses his citizens and foreign parliaments in Ukrainian or English. He speaks Russian only when urging Russian soldiers to surrender, or when pointing out Putin’s actions to Russian citizens, whose understanding of the war shaped by state TV bears little resemblance to reality. Kremlin critic Ilya Yashin speaks out from Russian prison Writing from a cell in a Russian jail known as the Bear, Ilya Yashin remained as defiant as ever, Andrew Roth reported from Moscow. In neat, blue-ink lettering, the opposition politician was able to express himself candidly despite his incarceration. Removing Vladimir Putin from power, he wrote, was a prerequisite to “avoiding the risks of a new world war”. “As long as Putin retains power, war, or at least the threat of war, will be permanent,” Yashin said in written answers to questions from the Guardian, delivered by his lawyers this week. “This man has gone mad from unlimited power and impunity, he has become a slave to his maniacal ambitions.” Yashin was sentenced last year to eight-and-a-half years in prison for a broadcast on his popular YouTube channel in which he accused the Russian army of a massacre of civilians in Bucha."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-joe-biden-urges-vladimir-putin-not-to-use-tactical-nuclear-weapons-after-setbacks-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-18T21:02:11Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: medics killed by Russian strike during evacuation of hospital, says Kharkiv governor – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-joe-biden-urges-vladimir-putin-not-to-use-tactical-nuclear-weapons-after-setbacks-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/18/russia-ukraine-war-latest-joe-biden-urges-vladimir-putin-not-to-use-tactical-nuclear-weapons-after-setbacks-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: medics killed by Russian strike during evacuation of hospital, says Kharkiv governor – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 11pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. “They’re not willing to scrap it,” one soldier said, recalling artillery with shrapnel damage and sometimes completely worn out from firing round after round against Russian troops, Reuters reports. The Ukrainian military said that Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. According to a Ukrainian military official who spoke to the New York Times, remnants of the Shahed-136 attack drones have been discovered on the ground during the counteroffensive that Ukraine launched in the northeastern regions of the country this month. The Ukrainian military has carried out 20 airstrikes in the last 24 hours against Russian strongholds, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Kyiv Independent reported on Sunday that Ukraine’s Air Force has successfully targeted 15 Russian strongholds and four sites, as well as seven control points. Georgian president Salome Zourabichvili levied heavy criticism against Russia on Sunday after the discovery of mass graves in Izium earlier this week. Zourabichvili condemned “in the strongest terms the atrocities committed by Russia in Izium,” adding that “these war crimes must be answered by justice,” the Kyiv Independent reports. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Sunday that the mass graves discovered in Ukraine was evidence of Russia’s war crimes in the country. “Obviously the UK and Canada have been two of the strongest countries in standing up in support of Ukraine and pushing back against Russia’s illegal actions,” Trudeau told reporters in London where he will be attending the funeral of Queen Elizabeth. Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. Reuters reports: Some members of a roughly 50-member repair team showed reporters images of damaged U.S.-provided arms, including M777 howitzers, that in the West would have long been considered beyond the scope of repair. Not in Ukraine. “They’re not willing to scrap it,” one soldier said, recalling artillery with shrapnel damage and sometimes completely worn out from firing round after round against Russian troops. But Ukrainians are managing to bring these weapons back into battle, thanks to guidance from U.S. forces and manufacturing prowess by Kyiv allowing it to reverse-engineer spare parts. Since the program began in June, more than a dozen teleconference channels have been set up with over 100 Ukrainian contacts. But priority support is being given to the M777s and to the high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), which have been central to Ukraine’s counter-offensive nearly seven months since Russian forces invaded. “Combat power for Ukraine is staying at the level it is because of America’s investment in the sustainment,” the soldier said. The Ukrainian military said that Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. According to a Ukrainian military official who spoke to the New York Times, remnants of the Shahed-136 attack drones have been discovered on the ground during the counteroffensive that Ukraine launched in the northeastern regions of the country this month. The weapon is a “kamikaze drone carrying a warhead of about 80 pounds” that can be launched from the back of a flatbed truck, the New York Times explained. According to Colonel Rodion Kulagin, the commander of artillery operations in the Kharkiv operations, the drone drops out from the sky without any warning. “It blew the triple-seven in half,” he told the Times, referring to the drone destroying an M777 howitzer supplied by the US to the Ukrainian military. “Instead of firing 100 artillery shells, it’s easier to release one of these drones” to search for a target, he added. The New York Times also reported Kulagin explaining that the drone is accurate enough to target a self-propelled howitzer in an area close to the turret where gunpowder stored. This in turn creates secondary explosions. “It’s a very serious problem,” he said, adding that without any countermeasures, the drones “will destroy all our military.” The Ukrainian military has carried out 20 airstrikes in the last 24 hours against Russian strongholds, according to the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Kyiv Independent reported on Sunday that Ukraine’s Air Force has successfully targeted 15 Russian strongholds and four sites, as well as seven control points. Georgian president Salome Zourabichvili levied heavy criticism against Russia on Sunday after the discovery of mass graves in Izium earlier this week. Zourabichvili condemned “in the strongest terms the atrocities committed by Russia in Izium,” adding that “these war crimes must be answered by justice,” the Kyiv Independent reports. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Sunday that the mass graves discovered in Ukraine was evidence of Russia’s war crimes in the country. “Obviously the UK and Canada have been two of the strongest countries in standing up in support of Ukraine and pushing back against Russia’s illegal actions,” Trudeau told reporters in London where he will be attending the funeral of Queen Elizabeth. “Those actions “increasingly, clearly include war crimes, include absolutely unacceptable crimes, whether we think of what we found in Bucha or the discovery of mass graves in the reclaimed territories by Ukraine,” he added. “There needs to be a proper investigation and transparency and Vladimir Putin, his supporters and the Russian military need to be held to account for the atrocities they have and are continuing to commit in Ukraine.” The first lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, paid her respects to the Queen lying in state at Westminster Hall on Sunday, before a reception with the Princess of Wales at Buckingham Palace. The top US general has cautioned that it is still unclear how Russia might react to the latest battlefield setbacks in Ukraine, calling for vigilance among US troops during a visit to a military base in Poland aiding Ukraine’s war effort. “The war is not going too well for Russia right now. So it’s incumbent upon all of us to maintain high states of readiness, alert,” US army general Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Warsaw following a visit to a base hosting US troops. Reuters was asked not to publish the name of the base or describe its location. Milley said he was not suggesting US troops in Europe were at any increased threat, but said they had to be ready. “In the conduct of war, you just don’t know with a high degree of certainty what will happen next.” Policy research organisation the Institute for the Study of War has published data suggesting Ukrainian forces are expanding positions east of the Oskil River and north of the Siverskyi Donets River that could allow them to envelop Russian troops holding the city of Lyman. They say: “The Russian defenders in Lyman still appear to consist in large part of Bars (Russian Combat Army Reserve) reservists and the remnants of units badly damaged in the Kharkiv oblast counteroffensive, and the Russians do not appear to be directing reinforcements to this area.” Jack Watling, a senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute, has written an analysis piece for the Guardian on Russia’s underperforming military capability, and why it could lead to its downfall. “Russia’s military was designed to fight short, high-intensity wars. Without full national mobilisation, it is too small, its units lack the logistical enablement and its equipment is ill-suited to a protracted war. When the Russian military issued orders to its troops in the autumn of 2021, it estimated a need for them to be deployed for nine months. They are now reaching that limit. The Ukrainians, by contrast, have been organising their military since 2014 for precisely this kind of war.” Our reporters Shaun Walker and Pjotr Sauer have spoken to Ukrainian teachers resisting occupation, who say there is “no way” they could work for the Russians. “We have neither a moral nor legal right to demand heroism from people living under occupation. Their main goals should be to save lives and not voluntarily collaborate,” said Ukraine’s education ombudsman. Others want to see all who collaborated punished. It is 6pm in Kyiv. Here is everything you might have missed: Four medics have been killed and two patients injured after Russian forces fired at a psychiatric hospital in the village of Strelechya, the governor of the Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, has said. The facility was in the process of being evacuated and medical staff were removing patients from the hospital while under heavy fire, Syniehubov said. He added on Telegram: “During the evacuation, the Russians started a massive shelling. According to preliminary data, unfortunately, 4 medical workers died, 2 patients were injured.” Vladimir Putin is “failing on all of his military strategic objectives”, the chief of the defence staff has said. Adm Sir Tony Radakin said the conflict was likely to “grind on for a long time”, despite recent successes by Ukrainian military forces. Asked about the situation in Ukraine, he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: “At the very outset, we said that this was a strategic error by President Putin and strategic errors lead to strategic consequences. And in this instance, it’s strategic failure. Putin is failing on all of his military strategic objectives. He wanted to subjugate Ukraine, that’s not going to happen.” Russia has reacted to its military setbacks in the past week by increasing its missile attacks on civilian infrastructure even if they do not have any military impact, according to the latest intelligence report from the British Ministry of Defence. It says in a post on Twitter that the move is intended to destroy the morale of the Ukrainian people. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of provoking fighting in Kherson after a video showed clashes in the centre of the occupied Ukrainian city on Saturday evening. The Ukrainian army is leading a counter-offensive to retake the southern city, which was seized by the Russian army in the first weeks of the invasion. Russian official media Vesti-Crimea broadcast a video on Saturday evening showing an exchange of fire around two armoured vehicles near Kherson train station. Prosecutors in an area of Ukraine where Russian forces recently retreated in the face of a Ukrainian counter-offensive are accusing Russia of torturing civilians in one freed village. Prosecutors in the Kharkiv region said, in an online statement, that they had found a basement where Russian forces allegedly tortured prisoners in the village of Kozacha Lopan, near the border with Russia, Associated Press reports. They released images showing a Russian military TA-57 telephone with additional wires and alligator clips attached to it. Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of using the Soviet-era radio telephones as a power source to electrocute prisoners during interrogation. Beloved Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has posted a message on her Instagram account asking the country’s justice ministry to list her as a foreign agent alongside her husband, Maxim Galkin. The post called for an end to “the deaths of our boys for illusory aims that make our country a pariah and weigh down the lives of its citizens”. Pugacheva’s message comes a day after Galkin – a comedian who has repeatedly spoken out against the war with Ukraine – was designated a foreign agent by Russia for political activities. Russia’s ministry of justice says that his source of foreign funding is from Ukraine. The US president, Joe Biden, urged his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, not to use tactical nuclear or chemical weapons in the wake of setbacks in Ukraine. Asked by CBS what he would say to Putin if he was considering using such weapons, Biden said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. It would change the face of war unlike anything since world war two.” Biden said the US response would be “consequential”, but declined to give detail. A total of 165 ships with 3.7 m tonnes of agricultural products onboard have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian infrastructure ministry has said. The ministry said 10 ships with 169,300 tonnes of agricultural products were due to leave Ukrainian Black Sea ports, reports Reuters. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a global food crisis aggravated by the war will be the focus of world leaders when they convene at the United Nations in New York this week. “It would be naive to think that we are close to the possibility of a peace deal,” said the UN secretary general, António Guterres, before the high-level meeting of the 193-member UN general assembly, which starts on Tuesday. “The chances of a peace deal are minimal, at the present moment.” The Czech Republic, which currently holds the EU presidency, has called for a “special international tribunal” after a mass grave was discovered in Izium, a town in north-eastern Ukraine. “In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent,” said Jan Lipavský, the foreign minister of the Czech Republic. Ukrainian officials have discovered more than 440 bodies, some found with their hands tied behind their backs. Satellite imagery has emerged of the recently discovered mass grave site near Izium. The images, taken from March to August this year and released by Maxar Technologies, show the entrance to the “forest cemetery” where many bodies have been discovered. One of the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant’s four main power lines has been repaired and is supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid two weeks after it went down, the UN nuclear watchdog has said. Even though the six reactors at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, have been shut down, the plant needs electricity to keep them cool. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, told Putin on Saturday that “today’s time is not a time for war” when the pair met during a regional Asia summit in Uzbekistan. Putin told Modi he knew of India’s “concerns” about the conflict, echoing language he had used with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, the day before. “We will do our best to end this as soon as possible,” Putin said, while accusing Kyiv of rejecting negotiations. Speaking to reporters later, Putin vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces targeted facilities in Russia. Putin said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. “We aren’t in a rush,” he said, after the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting in Samarkand. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told leaders at the summit that efforts were being made “to finalise the conflict in Ukraine through diplomacy as soon as possible”. Putin told Erdoğan, who has been a key broker in limited deals between Russia and Ukraine, that Moscow was keen to build closer ties with Turkey and was ready to “significantly increase” all exports to the country. The security service of Ukraine said Russia’s federal security service (FSU) officers tortured residents in Kupiansk, a city in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. The Kyiv Independent reports that when FSU officers were in then occupied Kupiansk, they tortured residents and threatened to send them to minefields and kill their families. Critical Threats and the Institute for the Study of War have created an interactive map that shows the progress Ukrainian military forces have made in taking back Russian-occupied territory. Peter Pomerantsev is an author and senior visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and writes for us today to argue that Despite his defeats, Putin still shapes our perceptions. Let’s fight him at his own game: The Ukrainians have (again) done what nobody believed they could. They have (again) defeated the supposedly mighty Russia on the battlefield, shown up the underlying incompetence and moral rot of the Putin system. It took them just six days to take back whole swaths of territory in north-eastern Ukraine that it took Russia six months to conquer. The Russian military, political and propaganda elites are all blaming each other: rifts that usually rumble under the surface are now visible to all. Putin looks shaken. Now it’s time for us to act as well. Not just by increasing help to Ukraine on the battlefield (which is paramount), but also by advancing along the other fronts in this conflict: energy, information, finance and diplomacy. Read more: Despite his defeats, Putin still shapes our perceptions. Let’s fight him at his own game Our colleague Luke Harding reports from Izium: Standing in the gloom, Maksim Maksimov pointed to the spot where he was tortured with electric shocks. Russian soldiers took him from his cell in the basement of Izium’s police station. They sat him on an office chair and attached a zig-zag crocodile clip to his finger. It was connected by cable to an old-fashioned Soviet military field telephone. And then it began. A soldier cranked the handle, turning it faster and faster. This sent an excruciating pulse through Maksimov’s body. “I collapsed. They pulled me upright. There was a hood on my head. I couldn’t see anything. My legs went numb. I was unable to hear in my left ear,” he recalled. “Then they did it again. I passed out. I came round 40 minutes later back in my cell.” Read more here: Izium: after Russian retreat, horrors of Russian occupation are revealed Beloved Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has posted a message on her Instagram account asking the country’s justice ministry to list her as a foreign agent alongside her husband, Maxim Galkin.

Our colleague Josh Butler reports: Australia won’t ban Russian tourists from entering the country as requested by Ukraine’s ambassador but is “assessing” whether to reopen the Australian embassy in Kyiv. The acting prime minister, Richard Marles, also said on Sunday that Australia was considering sending further military aid to Ukraine to bolster existing commitments. “We do need to be preparing ourselves for protracted conflict and on that basis, we get that we are going to need to provide support for Ukraine over the long term,” Marles told the ABC’s Insiders program. Read more here: Australia won’t ban Russian tourists but is considering reopening embassy in Kyiv These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. The BBC’s James Waterhouse has shared a video on Twitter of the final ovation, at the Kyiv Opera House, for ballet dancer Oleksandr Shapoval. He had performed for 28 seasons before volunteering to fight in the east. Waterhouse points out: “While Ukraine enjoys successes on the battlefield, his death is a reminder of the enduring, awful cost of this war.” Associated Press is reporting that Russian shelling hit cities and towns across a wide stretch of Ukraine during the night. The British Ministry of Defence has warned that Russia is likely to increase its attacks on civilian targets as it suffers battlefield defeats. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of provoking fighting in Kherson after a video showed clashes in the centre of the occupied Ukrainian city on Saturday evening. The Ukrainian army is leading a counter-offensive to retake the southern city, which was seized by the Russian army in the first weeks of the invasion. Russian official media Vesti-Crimea broadcast a video on Saturday evening showing an exchange of fire around two armoured vehicles near Kherson train station. The Russian-installed administration of Kherson said later in the day it had “destroyed” a group of attackers. “There was a clash in the centre of Kherson between sections of the Russian armed forces patrolling the streets of the city and an unidentified group of people,” the administration said on Telegram. On Sunday morning, the Ukrainian southern army command spokeswoman Natalia Gumeniuk said: “Yesterday’s shootings and explosions in Kherson are provocations by the occupiers.” The Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak blamed the shootings on “growing tensions” between different pro-Moscow factions preparing to flee amid news of the Ukrainian army’s advances. Kirill Stremousov, a pro-Moscow official in Kherson, said the city was “calm” on Sunday morning. Kyiv was “trying to attack but without any results”, he said. “We won’t say that everything is smooth and there is no problem in the Kherson region ... [but] everything will be fine.” There have been a series of targeted attacks against pro-Russian officials in Kherson and in other occupied areas in recent weeks. In Diary of an Invasion, the Ukrainian novelist Andrey Kurkov has documented Russia’s attack on his homeland. This morning, the Observer published extracts in which Kurkov recounts the first weeks of the conflict. “You have to get used psychologically to the idea that war has begun. Because from that moment on, war determines your way of life, your way of thinking, your way of making decisions.” Jack Watling, a senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute, writes for us that Russia’s underperforming military capability may be key to its downfall: Viewed purely in terms of the size of their formations and equipment, Russian ground forces in Ukraine still pose a serious threat on a number of axes. In practice, however, it is highly unlikely the Russian military can recover from its increasingly terminal trajectory on the battlefield, though its defeat will take time and bitter fighting. To understand why, it is necessary to examine the force beyond its equipment and personnel. The US assesses military capability through the abbreviation DOTMLPF. That senior US officers regularly try to roll this off the tongue as an acronym may exemplify military absurdity, but the abbreviation is somewhat redeemed by being fairly comprehensive. It stands for: doctrine, organisation, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities. Looking at the Russian military across these categories reveals why it is underperforming its potential and struggling to regenerate. Read more analysis from Jack Watling: Russia’s underperforming military capability may be key to its downfall Four medics have been killed and two patients injured after Russian forces fired at a psychiatric hospital in the village of Strelechya, the governor of the Kharkiv region, Oleh Syniehubov, has said.

He added on Telegram: During the evacuation, the Russians started a massive shelling. According to preliminary data, unfortunately, 4 medical workers died, 2 patients were injured. The report could not be independently verified. In case you missed it, Ukrainian authorities said on Friday they have found a mass burial site of more than 440 bodies in the eastern city of Izium that was recaptured from Russian forces. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has likened the discovery to what had happened in Bucha, saying: “Russia leaves death everywhere, and must be responsible for it.” Russia has repeatedly denied it targets civilians or has committed war crimes It is 1pm in Kyiv. Here is what you might have missed: Vladimir Putin is “failing on all of his military strategic objectives”, the chief of the defence staff has said. Adm Sir Tony Radakin said the conflict was likely to “grind on for a long time”, despite recent successes by Ukrainian military forces.

It would change the face of war unlike anything since world war two.” Biden said the US response would be “consequential”, but declined to give detail. A total of 165 ships with 3.7 m tonnes of agricultural products onboard have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian infrastructure ministry has said. The ministry said 10 ships with 169,300 tonnes of agricultural products were due to leave Ukrainian Black Sea ports, reports Reuters. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a global food crisis aggravated by the war will be the focus of world leaders when they convene at the United Nations in New York this week. “It would be naive to think that we are close to the possibility of a peace deal,” said the UN secretary general, António Guterres, before the high-level meeting of the 193-member UN general assembly, which starts on Tuesday. “The chances of a peace deal are minimal, at the present moment.” The Czech Republic, which currently holds the EU presidency, has called for a “special international tribunal” after a mass grave was discovered in Izium, a town in north-eastern Ukraine. “In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent,” said Jan Lipavský, the foreign minister of the Czech Republic. Ukrainian officials have discovered more than 440 bodies, some found with their hands tied behind their backs. Satellite imagery has emerged of the recently discovered mass grave site near Izium. The images, taken from March to August this year and released by Maxar Technologies, show the entrance to the “forest cemetery” where many bodies have been discovered. One of the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant’s four main power lines has been repaired and is supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid two weeks after it went down, the UN nuclear watchdog has said. Even though the six reactors at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, have been shut down, the plant needs electricity to keep them cool. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, told Putin on Saturday that “today’s time is not a time for war” when the pair met during a regional Asia summit in Uzbekistan. Putin told Modi he knew of India’s “concerns” about the conflict, echoing language he had used with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, the day before. “We will do our best to end this as soon as possible,” Putin said, while accusing Kyiv of rejecting negotiations. Speaking to reporters later, Putin vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces targeted facilities in Russia. Putin said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. “We aren’t in a rush,” he said, after the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting in Samarkand. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told leaders at the summit that efforts were being made “to finalise the conflict in Ukraine through diplomacy as soon as possible”. Putin told Erdoğan, who has been a key broker in limited deals between Russia and Ukraine, that Moscow was keen to build closer ties with Turkey and was ready to “significantly increase” all exports to the country. The security service of Ukraine said Russia’s federal security service (FSU) officers tortured residents in Kupiansk, a city in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. The Kyiv Independent reports that when FSU officers were in then occupied Kupiansk, they tortured residents and threatened to send them to minefields and kill their families. Vladimir Putin is “failing on all of his military strategic objectives”, the chief of the defence staff has said. Adm Sir Tony Radakin said the conflict is likely to “grind on for a long time”, despite recent successes by Ukrainian military forces. Asked about the situation in Ukraine, he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme: At the very outset, we said that this was a strategic error by President Putin and strategic errors lead to strategic consequences. And in this instance, it’s strategic failure. Putin is failing on all of his military strategic objectives. He wanted to subjugate Ukraine, that’s not going to happen. He wanted to take control of the capital, we saw that that was defeated earlier on. We saw that he wanted to weaken Nato. Nato is now much stronger, and we have Finland and Sweden joining. He wants to break the international resolve. Well, actually that strengthened over this period, and he’s under pressure, his problems are mounting. He added: He’s always had a problem in terms of crewing the equipment that he’s got. He hasn’t got sufficient manpower. His forces are thin on the ground. And we’re also seeing a magnificent Ukrainian armed forces who have been courageous, they’re fighting for their country, and they’ve embraced the international support that all of us are providing. A total of 165 ships with 3.7m tonnes of agricultural products onboard have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian infrastructure ministry said today. The ministry said 10 ships with 169,300 tonnes of agricultural products are due to leave Ukrainian Black Sea ports, reports Reuters. The ministry said in a statement: At 10am, eight ships left the ports of Great Odesa, and two more are waiting for their turn and favourable conditions. Ukraine’s grain exports slumped after Russia invaded the country and blockaded its Black Sea ports, driving up global food prices and prompting fears of shortages in Africa and the Middle East. Ukraine, a major global grain producer and exporter, shipped up to 6m tonnes of grain a month before the war. Three Black Sea ports were reopened under an agreement signed on 22 July by Moscow and Kyiv and the ministry has said these ports are able to load and send abroad 100-150 cargo ships a month. Reuters reports that Russian Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev will hold security consultations and meetings during a two-day visit to China starting Sunday, China’s foreign ministry said. Patrushev will attend the 17th round of China’s Russia strategic security consultations and the 7th meeting of the China-Russia law enforcement security cooperation during his visit, the foreign ministry said in a statement released on its website on Sunday. The meetings come after Chinese president Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held face-to-face talks in Uzbekistan on Thursday, their first since the outbreak of the Ukraine war. Our colleague Andrew Roth reports from Belgorod: The war has become impossible to ignore in Belgorod, southern Russia, just miles from the border with Ukraine. Russian soldiers retreating from the Ukrainian counterattack now roam the streets. Air defences boom out overhead several times a day. The city is once again filled with refugees. And, at the border, Russian and Ukrainian soldiers stand within sight of each other. Three Russian soldiers from Ossetia are wandering the unfamiliar streets past the grand Transfiguration Cathedral late one evening. They seem unsteady on their feet, perhaps drunk or tired. And they’re looking for a place to eat. Since February, they say, they have fought in Ukraine as part of the invasion force. They were stationed in the village of Velyki Prokhody, just north of Kharkiv, when the urgent signal came to flee back to Russia last week. Read more: ‘They won’t invade, will they?’ Fears rise in Russian city that Ukraine war could cross border Australia will not ban Russian tourists from entering the country as part of sanctions on Russia over the war in Ukraine, defence minister Richard Marles said today. Since the start of the conflict, Australia has sanctioned hundreds of Russian individuals and entities, Reuters reports. It has also supplied defence equipment and humanitarian supplies to Ukraine, while outlawing exports of alumina and aluminium ores, including bauxite, to Russia. Asked if Australia would also ban Russian tourists, Marles said sanctions were aimed at Russia’s government, “not the Russian people themselves.” He told ABC television: This is not something we are considering at the moment. Marles refused to be drawn on whether Australia would provide more Bushmasters and other protected vehicles to Ukraine after a recent request from the Ukrainian ambassador to Australia. Australia in July pledged 60 Bushmasters and 28 M113AS4 Armoured Vehicles to Ukraine. US president Joe Biden urged Russian president Vladimir Putin not to use tactical nuclear or chemical weapons in the wake of setbacks in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Asked by CBS what he would say to Putin if he was considering using such weapons, Biden said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. It would change the face of war unlike anything since world war two.” Biden said the US response would be “consequential,” but declined to give detail. Russia “would become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been,” Biden said. “Depending on the extent of what they do will determine what response would occur.” Russian government officials have dismissed Western suggestions that Moscow would use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, but it remains a worry for some in the west. And if you want to read more about this issue, our columnist Simon Tisdall has been thinking about it too: Russia has reacted to its military setbacks in the past week by increasing its missile attacks on civilian infrastructure even if it does not have any military impact, according to the latest intelligence report from the British Ministry of Defence. It says in a post on Twitter that the move is intended to destroy the morale of the Ukrainian people. Russia has launched several thousand long-range missiles against Ukraine since 24 February 2022. However, in the last seven days, Russia has increased its targeting of civilian infrastructure even where it probably perceives no immediate military effect. This category of mission has included strikes against the electricity grid, and a dam on the Inhulets River at Kryvyi Rih. As it faces setbacks on the front lines, Russia has likely extended the locations it is prepared to strike in an attempt to directly undermine the morale of the Ukrainian people and government. Welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be with you for the next hour or so. The main developments you need to know about are here: US president Joe Biden urged Russian president Vladimir Putin to not use tactical nuclear or chemical weapons in the wake of setbacks in Ukraine.

A clean power alliance would enable countries to cooperate to source components more cheaply, boost the expansion of wind, solar and other forms of low-carbon power, and potentially to share or export electricity across connected grids. Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Costa Rica and Kenya are potential partners, and Miliband will be drumming up further support at the Cop27 UN climate summit, which he is visiting for several days. Labour is committed to 100% low-carbon electricity by 2030. “This potential clean power alliance is like an anti-Opec,” said Miliband, referring to the group of oil-producing countries. “I say anti-Opec because Opec is a cartel, a group of countries that works together to keep prices high. This would be a way in which countries join together to be the vanguard and say, ‘We’re going to deliver on clean power and it will help to cut prices, not just for us but for others’.” He said the plunge in the price of renewable energy over the last decade was “the biggest source of optimism we should all have” about the climate crisis. “It is now cheaper to save the planet than to destroy it,” Miliband said in an interview with the Guardian at Cop27. “That is a message we should be shouting from the rooftops, because the implications of that message are profound.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has vowed to lift the current ban on onshore windfarms, which offer the cheapest form of renewable energy. Changes to the planning system under David Cameron have in effect prevented any new onshore windfarms being built in England since 2015. Labour would also stop granting new oil and gas licences in the North Sea. The Conservative government is planning to grant more than 100 such development and exploration licences. Miliband stopped short of pledging to revoke any licences granted, but pointed out that companies with exploration licences need further licences to develop fields, which Labour would not grant. He also wants three new nuclear power stations, in line with advice from the Committee on Climate Change. Generating power from biomass – burning trees – would have to be “carefully looked at”, he promised, to ensure that it was environmentally sustainable, and economically viable. Miliband, who attended Cops as secretary of state for energy and climate change from 2008 to 2010, accused the government of behaving as “climate chameleons”. He pointed out that, since hosting th lauded Cop26 climate summit, where nations agreed to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the government had returned – briefly – to fracking, mooted a new coalmine, granted new oil and gas licences, given tax breaks to fossil fuels, kept the ban on onshore wind, slashed aid to poor countries, failed on insulation and then snubbed Cop27, until Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, U-turned and came for a day. Alok Sharma, the cabinet minister who presided over Cop26, had done “an important and creditable job”, Miliband said. “I’m an admirer of Sharma, but he’s been undermined by a government that has been saying to people, ‘do as we say not as we do’. And that’s a big problem.” The UK had lost standing on the international stage as a result, he added. “The problem is, the government has made promises and then broken its promises, and that isn’t a good basis of trust.” Sunak’s original decision to snub the Cop27 summit, and to prevent King Charles from attending, had been “extraordinary” and “embarrassing”, said Miliband. “You don’t need to be a climate nerd to work out that Cop26 was a big deal and we hosted Cop26, and therefore Cop27, where we were handing over the presidency, is also a big deal,” he said. “And if [more than] 90 world leaders are going, you know you should probably be there.” He said Sunak “just doesn’t get this agenda. He doesn’t get that it’s the future, that this is the future of our economy … He’s at the margins. He sent a message internationally – regrettably – and domestically, with that original decision, which is ‘This isn’t my thing’.” Starmer had shown that Labour would lead on the climate and green jobs, as the central plank of the party’s vision of the future, he added. As well as targeting 100% renewables by 2030, the party would set up a national publicly owned energy company, GB Energy, and a wealth fund to invest in green technology and green jobs. “It’s at the centre of our agenda, because it’s the future of jobs, the future of the economy, lower bills, energy security and it’s the biggest issue we face as a country and a world,” Miliband said. Voices within the Tory party have raised doubts over net zero, he noted. “That means you’re saying, we want to carry on with more, dirty, expensive fossil fuels for our energy system, not greener cheaper renewable power,” he said. “That’s not a winning position. Anti-net zero is a very defeatable position.” For “the vast majority of people”, the climate was a “significant issue”, he said. “What they want to know is can this be done in a way that makes economic sense for us, particularly when people are facing a cost of living crisis, and the overwhelming answer is yes,” he said. Labour’s plan for clean power by 2030 would cut bills by £93bn, according to the party’s analysis, through measures including energy efficiency and home insulation programmes, boosting renewable power include more onshore windfarms, and a windfall tax on the excess profits of oil and gas producers. Miliband said pushing for clean energy would also improve people’s health and quality of life. “We’re a country that is racked by terrible fuel poverty, and by the killer of air pollution, and by a deep desire for big economic change,” he said. “As [US president Joe] Biden has shown, being a leader on climate is an answer to all those things.” • This article was amended on 16 November 2022.

At least 150,000 Ukrainians had been living under Russian occupation in these areas for almost the entirety of the invasion. Maliar said that these were only the confirmed figures and that the real number of reoccupied territories in the Kharkiv region “is almost twice as much”. While Ukraine celebrates the tremendous gains its military has made in its dramatic counter-offensive, officials remain stoic about the challenges ahead in the newly reoccupied territory. Lesia Vasylenko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, spoke of discovering the beheaded bodies of Ukrainian military, human faeces everywhere, widespread looting and terrorised teenagers who were still too scared to leave their basements. “Liberation uncovers many crimes. It’s as if we are on the verge of hundreds, if not thousands Buchas, just of a smaller scale,” Vasylenko said, referencing the civilian mass graves and evidence of torture uncovered in Bucha when Ukrainian forces recaptured the Kyiv region. “But whatever the scale there will be tribunals, retribution and justice.” Ukrainian officials said there was a torture chamber set up by the Russian military in now liberated Balakliia. Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the Kharkiv Region National Police Investigation Department, said that 40 people had been detained during the occupation. Speaking of looting, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces warned that Russian forces were continuing to loot as they withdrew from occupied territories. On a stretch of highway heading into Russian territory, Ukrainian officials spotted civilian vehicles with license plates from the Kharkiv region, driven by Russian military and weighed down with looted belongings. In the south, there were reports of Russian occupants breaking the gates of private garages and taking cars, as well as removing furniture. Russian forces continued to hit a number of civilian and civilian infrastructure facilities today throughout the eastern and southern portions of Ukraine, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said. Via air attacks and missile strikes and high mobility artillery rocket systems, Russian force attacked settlements in the Luhansk oblast and the Donetsk oblast in the east, and the Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv and Cherkasy oblasts in the south. Russia covertly spent more than $300m since 2014 to try to influence politicians and other officials in more than two dozen countries, according to declassified cables released by the US. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has said he is concerned Russia could try to “stir the pot” in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in order to distract from Ukraine. He added that Russia could also use its influence in the region to help “calm the waters”. – Vivian Ho, Guardian staff From the AP: Russia has covertly spent more than $300m since 2014 to try to influence politicians and other officials in more than two dozen countries, according to a newly declassified state department cable. The cable, signed by the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and released on Tuesday, cites a new intelligence assessment of Russia’s global covert efforts to support policies and parties sympathetic to Moscow. The cable does not name specific Russian targets but says the US is providing classified information to select individual countries. It is the latest effort by the Biden administration to declassify intelligence about Moscow’s military and political aims, dating back to ultimately correct assessments that Russia would launch a new war against Ukraine. Many of Joe Biden’s top national security officials have extensive experience countering Moscow and served in government when Vladimir Putin launched wide-ranging campaigns to influence the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. A senior administration official declined to say how much money Russia is believed to have spent in Ukraine, where President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his top deputies have long accused Putin of meddling in domestic politics. The official noted allegations of Russian influence in recent elections in Albania, Bosnia and Montenegro. Unlike declared efforts by foreign governments to lobby for preferred initiatives, Russia’s covert influence involved using front organizations to funnel money to preferred causes or politicians, the cable alleges. That includes thinktanks in Europe and state-owned enterprises in Central America, Asia, the Middle East and north Africa. The US has historically also covertly funded political groups and been responsible for efforts to topple or undermine foreign governments. The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity under rules set by the administration, rejected comparisons between Russia’s activities and current US financing of media and political initiatives. Russians left a ghost town behind in Bohorodychne. The AFP has this heartbreaking dispatch from the village, where just two people remained: Nina Gonchar and her son Mykola, standing in front of their shattered house, appear to be the last two residents still left in the village. Some of their family members were murdered, they told AFP. “The Russians came, they killed my brother and my sister-in-law,” says 58-year-old Mykola. Russian soldiers wanted to use his brother’s home as a base, but after he refused, they gunned the house down, killing the couple at the same time. Mykola says he wrapped the bodies in blankets and buried them himself. He and his frail 92-year-old mother “barely survived” the occupation thanks to food jars, a few poultry and some vegetables in the garden. “How can I describe it with words? It was difficult, I was afraid,” Mykola says. His mother, traumatised by the fighting, still goes back into hiding in the shelter her son dug in their garden, even though the area is back in the hands of Ukraine again. “I cry every day. They killed my son,” Nina says, wiping tears from her eyes with a veil. Luke Harding in Lviv and Dan Sabbagh report: Ukraine consolidated its control of the Kharkiv region on Tuesday, raising flags on towns and villages occupied by Russian troops for six months, and reclaiming areas seized by Moscow on the first day of Vladimir Putin’s invasion. The state border service in Kyiv said it had liberated the city of Vovchansk, a couple of kilometres from the international border. Russian soldiers left on Sunday, it added, after the stunning Ukrainian counter-offensive. In the space of a few days Ukraine has pushed the Russians out from more than 6,000 sq km of territory, including zones in the south of the country where a separate counter-offensive is ongoing to recapture the city of Kherson. Russian units have fled in disarray. Serhiy Hadai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said local partisans had raised the Ukrainian flag over the key town of Kreminna, which was “completely empty”. Its Russian occupiers had either left the area or were too scared to take it down, he suggested. Russian battalions have fallen back to new positions east of the Oskil River, about 10 miles from the freshly liberated city of Izium. The city was almost entirely destroyed and more than 1,000 residents killed during five months of occupation and in recent fighting, Kyiv says. Video confirmed the scale of the damage. It showed pulverised high-rise apartment blocs, trashed schools, blown up bridges, and burnt-out Russian military vehicles marked with the letter Z. The Kremlin used Izium as a garrison and arms depot in its operation to seize the Donbas. Ukrainian officials said there was a torture chamber set up by the Russian military in now liberated Balakliia. Serhiy Bolvinov, head of the Kharkiv Region National Police Investigation Department, said that 40 people had been detained during the occupation. The BBC has reported some graphic accounts of torture from local residents: Artem, who lives in the city of Balakliya in the Kharkiv province told the BBC he was held by Russians for more than 40 days, and was tortured with electrocution. The epicentre of the brutality was the city’s police station, which Russian forces used as their headquarters. Artem said he could hear screams of pain and terror coming from other cells. The occupiers made sure the cries could be heard, he said, by turning off the building’s noisy ventilation system. “They turned it off so everyone could hear how people scream when they are shocked with electricity,” he told us. “They did this to some of the prisoners every other day... They even did this to the women”. And they did it to Artem, though in his case only once. “They made me hold two wires,” he said. “There was an electric generator. The faster it went, the higher the voltage. They said, ‘if you let it go, you are finished’. Then they started asking questions. They said I was lying, and they started spinning it even more and the voltage increased.” Artem told us he was detained because the Russians found a picture of his brother, a soldier, in uniform. Another man from Balakliya was held for 25 days because he had the Ukrainian flag, Artem said. A school principal called Tatiana told us she was held in the police station for three days and also heard screams from other cells. We visited the police station, and saw the Lord’s Prayer scratched on the wall of one of the cramped cells, alongside markings to indicate how many days had passed. Ukrainian police officers say as many as eight men were held in cells intended for two people. They say locals were scared to even pass the station when the Russians were in charge, in case they were grabbed by Russian soldiers. Isobel Koshiw and Lorenzo Tondo in Balakliia report: The roads leading to Balakliia, a former frontline town in Kharkiv province recently recaptured by Ukraine, were littered with the detritus of war; carcasses of Russian tanks, crates of abandoned ammunition and destroyed vehicles were scattered along the sides. Three of the bridges into the town had been blown up. One had been replaced with a pontoon bridge, but that too was out of action after a truck turned on its side while crossing. Several houses on the outskirts were destroyed, as well as factories and farms Russian and Ukrainian forceshad used as bases. Locals said they heard explosions every day from late February onwards and spent most of the last seven months at home and in their basements. Around the beginning of last week, they said, they heard an increase in shelling and shortly after, the Russian forces just fled, some even on foot. Those on Balakliia’s streets on Tuesday, just a small part of the 6,000 square km Volodomyr Zelenskiy says Ukraine has recaptured during its counteroffensive, were mostly older middle-aged or elderly, wheeling bicycles. They said younger people who had children had mainly left for Europe. What the people of Balakliia experienced appears to have differed to the residents of towns in Kyiv region and other northern parts of Ukraine that came under Russian occupation at the beginning of the invasion, suffering well-documented atrocities in commuter towns such as Bucha. The first lady of Ukraine will be a guest of honor at the EU State of the Union on Wednesday, Reuters reports: Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska will be the guest of honor at Wednesday’s EU State of the Union, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Tuesday on Twitter. “The courage of Ukrainian people has touched and inspired the world. Europe will stand with you every step of the way,” she said. Von der Leyen is expected to unveil a package of measures to pull down soaring energy prices in the EU during her speech on Wednesday. Ukraine president Volodomyr Zelenskiy announced today that the country is in full control of more than 4,000 square km (1,500 square miles) of territory that was once held by Russia. Zelenskiy also said during an address on Tuesday that an additional 4,000 sq km was being stabilized, reported Reuters. Yesterday, he said Ukraine had retaken 6,000 sq km during its recent counter-offensive against Russia, but other Ukrainian officials have said that it is impossible to distinguish between recapturing a territory and ensuring it is totally safe. Two main power lines that power the city of Kharkiv were also restored, reports Reuters: Ukrainian repair crews have restored the two main power lines supplying the eastern city of Kharkiv and the surrounding region, power firm Ukrenergo said on Tuesday after Russian shelling caused blackouts. In a statement, Ukrenergo said repair work on other lines would continue, but gave no details. The director general of the UN nuclear watchdog announced that all three of the backup power lines are back up at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia power plant, reports Reuters. The power lines had gone down on Saturday, but have all since been restored. “One of them, a 750/330 kilovolt (kV) line, is now providing the ZNPP with the external electricity it needs for cooling and other essential safety functions. The 330 kV and the 150 kV lines are being held in reserve,” said the IAEA in a statement today. The International Atomic Energy Agency also announced that power had been restored to residents in Enerhodar, which suffered a complete blackout last week. The White House said today that it will likely announce an additional military aid package in the “coming days”, reported Reuters. “I do think you’ll see another one here in coming days,” said White House national security spokesperson John Kirby to reporters. So far, the US has given $15.2bn to Ukraine, announced the state department last week. There has been no additional information on how much more will be given in the most recent aid package. Since 6 September, Ukrainian forces have recaptured more than 300 settlements in the Kharkiv region, taking back more than 3,800 sq km (1,467 miles) of Russian occupied territory, said Hanna Maliar, Ukrainian deputy minister of defence. At least 150,000 Ukrainians had been living under Russian occupation in these areas for almost the entirety of the invasion. Maliar said that these were only the confirmed figures and that the real number of reoccupied territories in the Kharkiv region “is almost twice as much”. While Ukraine celebrates the tremendous gains its military has made in its dramatic counter-offensive, officials remain stoic about the challenges ahead in the newly reoccupied territory. Lesia Vasylenko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, spoke of discovering the beheaded bodies of Ukrainian military, human faeces everywhere, widespread looting and terrorised teenagers who were still too scared to leave their basements. “Liberation uncovers many crimes. It’s as if we are on the verge of hundreds, if not thousands Buchas, just of a smaller scale,” Vasylenko said, referencing the civilian mass graves and evidence of torture uncovered in Bucha when Ukrainian forces recaptured the Kyiv region. “But whatever the scale there will be tribunals, retribution and justice.” Speaking of looting, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces warned that Russian forces were continuing to loot as they withdrew from occupied territories. On a stretch of highway heading into Russian territory, Ukrainian officials spotted civilian vehicles with license plates from the Kharkiv region, driven by Russian military and weighed down with looted belongings. In the south, there were reports of Russian occupants breaking the gates of private garages and taking cars, as well as removing furniture. Russian forces continued to hit a number of civilian and civilian infrastructure facilities today throughout the eastern and southern portions of Ukraine, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said. Via air attacks and missile strikes and high mobility artillery rocket systems, Russian force attacked settlements in the Luhansk oblast and the Donetsk oblast in the east, and the Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv and Cherkasy oblasts in the south. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has said he is concerned Russia could try to “stir the pot” in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in order to distract from Ukraine. He added that Russia could also use its influence in the region to help “calm the waters”. A western official said it was “too early to say” if Ukraine’s success in regaining 6,000 sq km of territory in the Kharkiv region represented “a turning point” in the more than six-month-long war, playing down the significance of Kyiv’s recapture of Izium and Kupiansk. Nevertheless it was, the official acknowledged, “a moment that has power” and they confirmed that the amount of territory gained by Ukraine in the past week amounted to “half the size of Wales”. The official was speaking on condition of anonymity. Ukraine had succeeded in surprising Russia with its attack on the lightly defended Kharkiv region, partly by first attacking in the Kherson territory in the south of the country, diverting Moscow’s forces and attention. “In marked contrast to Russia, Ukraine has demonstrated impressive operational art and an adherence to the core principles of war. From late July, it (Ukraine) has presented multiple threats which led to Russia repositioning forces thereby creating areas of weakness. Ukraine then concentrated forces against that weakness,” the official said. The military development was “in strict military terms a withdrawal ordered and sanctioned by (Russia’s) general staff, the official added, but the professionalism displayed by retreating units varied considerably from orderly withdrawal to “apparent panic” abandoning “a significant quantity of operational vehicles, weapons and ammunition”. Russia was attempting to create a new frontline in the Oskil river, and the result of last week’s battle was painted partly as an attempt by Moscow to rationalise its long frontlines to protect its territory in the Donbas and the land bridge to Crimea. But there was praise for Ukraine’s “innovative and experimental” military strategy as compared to Russia, whose commanders were at times referring decisions to the Kremlin. “Moscow is operating with a long screwdriver,” the official added. Beheaded bodies of Ukrainian military, human faeces, terrorised teenagers too scared to leave their basement: this is just some of what Russian forces left behind when Ukrainian troops recaptured large swathes of the Kharkiv region, according to Lesia Vasylenko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament. At least 150,000 Ukrainians were living under Russian occupation for almost the entirety of the invasion. Since 6 September, Ukrainian forces have recaptured more than 300 settlements in the Kharkiv region, taking back more than 3,800 sq km (1,467 miles) of Russian occupied territory. “Liberation uncovers many crimes. It’s as if we are on the verge of hundreds, if not thousands Buchas, just of a smaller scale,” Vasylenko said, referencing the civilian mass graves and evidence of torture uncovered in Bucha when Ukrainian forces recaptured the Kyiv region. “But whatever the scale there will be tribunals, retribution and justice.” Information is trickling out now from the towns and villages that Ukrainian forces have recaptured – many of these areas have been under Russian occupation for almost the entirety of the invasion. Residents in these areas are now describing the horror of what life was like during those long months. One woman told a reporter: “It was just cruel when the Russians came. Neighbours betrayed each other. Many probably thought that the Russian soldiers would stay forever.” “Now it’s like seven months ago, only the other way around: neighbours tell each other who was particularly friendly to the Russians,” she said. “I just want peace again.” Russian forces have continued looting as Ukrainian troops push them further east, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in today’s daily briefing. Officials said that on a section of the highway running north and south between Starobilsk and Luhansk, they spotted about 300 civilian vehicles, mostly with the state license plates of the Kharkiv region, heading in the direction of Luhansk. Most of these vehicles had “trailers loaded with looted property” and were being driven by Russian military. In Polohy, a city in the Zaporizhzhia region in the south of the country, “Russian occupants break the gates of private garages, take private cars from locals,” the general staff said. Meanwhile in the Kherson region, the general staff said similar behaviour was noted in the removal of “furniture and household appliances from temporarily abandoned homes”. Russian forces hit a number of civilian infrastructure facilities today throughout the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said. Using air attacks and missile strikes and high mobility artillery rocket systems, Russian force attacked settlements in the Luhansk oblast and the Donetsk oblast in the east, and the Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv and Cherkasy oblasts in the south. “More than 25 settlements suffered artillery shelling,” the general staff said in its daily briefing. “In addition, the enemy intensified air reconnaissance.” Since 6 September, Ukrainian forces have recaptured more than 300 settlements in the Kharkiv region, taking back more than 3,800 square kilometres (1,467 miles) of Russian occupied territory, said Hanna Maliar, Ukrainian deputy minister of defence. Maliar said that these were only the confirmed figures and that the real number of reoccupied territories in the Kharkiv region “is almost twice as much”. Balakliya was one of the more than 20 towns and villages recaptured by the Ukrainian forces in the Kharkiv oblast over the past few days. Here is a look at some of the devastation left behind after the Russian troops withdrew: Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs is estimating that at least 53,000 Russian soldiers have been killed since the Russian forces invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has said he is concerned Russia could try to “stir the pot” in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in order to distract from Ukraine. Blinken has called for “an end to any military hostilities immediately” after fighting broke out near the two countries’ border in the worst escalation of hostilities since the 2020 war. “Whether Russia tries in some fashion to stir the pot, to create a distraction from Ukraine, is something we’re always concerned about,” Blinken told Reuters at an event in Indiana. He added that Russia could also use its influence in the region to help “calm the waters”. Izium was one of the cities in the Kharkiv oblast that had been under Russian occupation for almost the entirety of the invasion. After Ukrainian troops recaptured much of the region in a dramatic counteroffensive, the outside world is getting a clear look at what happened to these cities while they were under Russian control. As Ukraine calls for more weapons, pressure mounts on Germany to fulfil its commitment: To recap: When Russian forces first invaded Ukraine, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, shocked the world by announcing a historic 180-degree policy turn on defence spending and exporting lethal weapons. He committed Germany to sending missiles and anti-tank weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. Six months later, many of those weapons have yet to arrive. “Disappointing signals from Germany while Ukraine needs Leopards and Marders now – to liberate people and save them from genocide,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, tweeted. “Not a single rational argument on why these weapons can not be supplied, only abstract fears and excuses. What is Berlin afraid of that Kyiv is not?” Russian forces shelled Lozova, a city in the Kharkiv oblast, early this morning after letting up on their barrage of the region following two days of targeted attacks on its infrastructure that knocked out the power and water supply. Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv oblast, said on Telegram that authorities were still confirming the number of casualties from this morning’s strike. In yesterday’s shelling, one person was killed and six injured in Kharkiv city, according to the Centre for Emergency Medical Assistance. One person was injured in the Izium district. Two people were wounded in the Kharkiv district – one by a landmine in the village of Ruski Tyshky. Two civilians were killed in the Kupiansk district. Synehubov warned that even in recaptured territories landmine danger remains high and that civilians should remain vigilant. An ammonia gas deal that the United Nations is pushing Russia and Ukraine to agree could ultimately stabilise a landmark grain deal, a western diplomat briefed on the matter told Reuters. Under the proposed ammonia deal, ammonia gas owned by Russian fertiliser producer Uralchem would be brought via pipeline to the Russia-Ukraine border. There it would be purchased by US-headquartered commodities trader Trammo, the diplomat said. Trammo would then own the ammonia as it travels across Ukraine, paying Ukraine pumping fees and transit fees, and sell it onto world markets from Ukraine’s Black Sea, according to the proposal. “The actual financial flows are not insignificant,” the diplomat told Reuters. “By having a key Russian company export through the same Black Sea corridors that the Ukrainian grain is going through stabilises the arrangement and could lead to a longer term extension of the agreement,” the diplomat said. Earlier today, Turkey’s ministry of defence said seven more ships had left Ukraine under the Turkey-UN-Russia-Ukraine deal to facilitate grain exports. Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us from Ukraine on the newswires. Volodomyr Zelenskiy has just posted a response on his Telegram channel to the publication of that report co-authored by former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andrey Yermak. Ukraine’s president posted: The first yet crucially important step towards future security guarantees for Ukraine has been taken. During our meeting, Andrey Yermak and former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen presented the elaborated recommendations, which should become the basis of the Kyiv Security Compact. I am thankful to the Yermak-Rasmussen International Working Group for drafting this package of proposals. It is necessary that the Group continues its work and completes the project. Ukraine’s allies should commit to legally binding large-scale weapons transfers and multi-decade investment in the country’s defences, according to a report that looked at alternatives to Kyiv’s long-term aspirations to join the Nato alliance. The report was commissioned by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and co-authored by the former Nato secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andrey Yermak. The purpose of the report was to provide a security structure for Ukraine that guarantees Russia does not seek to invade again, and is separate from calls by Zelenskiy for the west to step up arms supplies to drive home the sudden advance by Ukrainian troops. Ukraine’s possible future membership in Nato was one of the issues that Russia claimed as justification for its February invasion. The report, the subject of wide diplomatic consultations, does not propose that Nato countries collectively should be required to offer their troops in defence of Ukraine’s sovereignty, but says there should be no restriction on the military diplomatic and economic help provided by Nato member countries through bilateral agreements. The level of support could be scalable according to the level of threat and should apply to all of Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders. The report argues the “strongest security guarantee for Ukraine lies in its capacity to defend itself against an aggressor … To do so, Ukraine needs the resources to maintain a significant defensive force capable of withstanding the Russian Federation’s armed forces and paramilitaries.” Read more of the report from diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour: Long-term military investment proposed as alternative to Ukraine joining Nato In the Russian-occupied regions of the Crimea and southern Ukraine, Russian proxies, intelligence officers and military commanders have begun to evacuate and “urgently resettle their families” back into Russian territory, the defence intelligence of Ukraine’s military of defence said. Ukraine is calling for more air defence and an overall increase in weapons deliveries, following two days of targeted attacks on Kharkiv’s electrical grid and repeated Russian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The call for more air defence comes as Ukrainian intelligence believes that Russia is preparing to renew its attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as part of the Kremlin’s efforts to target Ukraine’s infrastructure, specifically the country’s energy system. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, criticised Germany and its reluctance to move faster in sending over battle tanks and heavy weaponry. When Russian forces first invaded Ukraine, German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, surprised the world with his historic 180-degree policy turn on defence spending and exporting lethal weapons in committing to send missiles and anti-tank weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. But six months later, many of those weapons have yet to arrive. Tomorrow, Annalena Berbock, Germany’s foreign minister, will visit Ukraine, and “the issue of increasing military and military-technical assistance to Ukraine” will definitely be discussed. One day after municipal deputies from 18 districts of Moscow and St Petersburg signed a public statement demanding that Vladimir Putin resign, the Kremlin is coming out with a vaguely veiled threat. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the line between legally criticising Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine and falling foul of wartime censorship laws that carry penalties of up to 15 years in prison “is very, very thin”. Annalena Berbock, Germany’s foreign minister, will visit Ukraine tomorrow, hot on the heels of Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, rebuking Germany and its reluctance to move faster in sending over battle tanks and heavy weaponry. “The success of the Ukrainian defence forces in conducting a counteroffensive operation unites European political forces. Especially in Germany,” the main directorate intelligence of Ukraine’s ministry of defence said in a statement. The statement said “the issue of increasing military and military-technical assistance to Ukraine will be raised” during Berbock’s visit. “After all, this will help to continue the successful counteroffensive of the Ukrainian defence forces and liberate the territories captured by the Russian Federation.” Earlier, Kuleba had harsh words for Germany and chancellor Olaf Scholz, who surprised the world and Germany’s allies when he announced a historic 180-degree policy turn on defence spending and exporting lethal weapons in committing to send missiles and anti-tank weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. That was early in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Now, six months later, many of those weapons have yet to arrive. “Disappointing signals from Germany while Ukraine needs Leopards and Marders now – to liberate people and save them from genocide,” Kuleba tweeted. “Not a single rational argument on why these weapons can not be supplied, only abstract fears and excuses. What is Berlin afraid of that Kyiv is not?” In the Russian-occupied regions of the Crimea and southern Ukraine, Russian proxies, intelligence officers and military commanders have begun to evacuate and “urgently resettle their families” back into Russian territory, the defence intelligence of Ukraine’s military of defence said. Defence intelligence officials noted that Russian nationals were “secretly trying to sell their homes and to urgently evacuate their relatives from the peninsula”. In recently recaptured areas of the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian authorities are finding bodies of civilians displaying signs of torture, an echo of the war crimes uncovered after Ukrainian troops retook Bucha and other areas around Kyiv. Although the Ukrainian prosecutor general is still investigating, the implication is that Russian soldiers have once again committed war crimes – torturing and killing civilians – while the region was under Russian occupation. The Kremlin countered today by accusing the Ukrainian army of abusing civilians in the territories it had recaptured, The Kremlin, meanwhile, accused Kyiv’s army of abusing civilians in territory it had recaptured, Agence France-Presse is reporting. Dmitry Peskov, a spokesperson for the Kremlin, said that report have emerged out of Kharkiv of “outrageous” treatment of civilians. “There are a lot of punitive measures … people are being tortured, people are being mistreated and so on,” Peskov told journalists. The Russian military said on Tuesday that it responded to Kyiv’s dramatic counter-offensive with “massive strikes” on all frontlines in Ukraine, but it appears that at least some of whatever recent shelling took place was directed at civilian targets. “Air, rocket and artillery forces are carrying out massive strikes on units of the Ukrainian armed forces in all operational directions,” the Russian defence ministry said in its daily briefing on the conflict, according to Agence France-Presse. The defence ministry said in a statement it had launched “high-precision” strikes on Ukrainian positions around Slovyansk and Kostiantynivka in the eastern Donetsk region. In an attempt to convince even more Russian soldiers to give up, Ukrainian forces are launching shells filled with flyers ahead of their advance, said Hanna Maliar, Ukrainian deputy minister of defence. “Russians use you as cannon fodder. Your life doesn’t mean anything for them. You don’t need this war. Surrender to Armed Forces of Ukraine,” the flyers read. Ukraine is calling for more air defence and an overall increase in weapons deliveries, following two days of targeted attacks on Kharkiv’s electrical grid and repeated Russian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, had strong words for Germany and its reluctance to move faster in sending over battle tanks and heavy weaponry. When Russian forces first invaded Ukraine, German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, announced a historic 180-degree policy turn on defence spending and exporting lethal weapons in committing to send missiles and anti-tank weapons to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. But six months later, many of those weapons have yet to arrive. “Disappointing signals from Germany while Ukraine needs Leopards and Marders now — to liberate people and save them from genocide,” Kuleba tweeted. “Not a single rational argument on why these weapons can not be supplied, only abstract fears and excuses. What is Berlin afraid of that Kyiv is not?” One day after municipal deputies from 18 districts of Moscow and St Petersburg signed a public statement demanding that Vladimir Putin resign, the Kremlin is coming out with a vaguely veiled threat: Yesterday, deputies from 18 Moscow and St Petersburg regions put forth issued a statement saying that Putin should resign because they believed his actions “harm the future of Russia and its citizens”. “Deputies are not yet forbidden to have an opinion. And it is also not forbidden to speak for the resignation of the president. He is not a monarch, but a hired worker, receives a salary from our taxes,” Ksenia Torstrem, the municipal deputy of the Semenovsky district of St Petersburg, told the Insider. “Our function is to represent the interests of the people, and we see that the people are not satisfied.” Ukrainian intelligence believes that Russia is preparing to renew its attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as part of the Kremlin’s efforts to target Ukraine’s infrastructure, specifically the country’s energy system. This comes after two days of Russian shelling knocked out power to much of Kharkiv. Any kind of attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest nuclear reactor, could have catastrophic results for the region. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country’s forces had taken back 6,000 sq km (2,400 sq miles) of Russian-held territory in the country’s south and east. Ukraine’s forces have continued to press their counterattack in Kharkiv, seeking to take control of almost all of the province. Ukraine’s troops headed north, reportedly recapturing towns all the way to the Russian border. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said fighting is still raging in Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv region. Hanna Malyar said: “The aim is to liberate the Kharkiv region and beyond – all the territories occupied by the Russian Federation. Fighting is continuing. It is still early to say full control has been established over Kharkiv region. Our strength stems from the fact that we are very motivated and that we plan operations thoroughly.” The Ukrainian military says it had freed more than 20 settlements in 24 hours. In recent days, Kyiv’s forces have captured territory at least twice the size of greater London, according to the British Ministry of Defence. Ukraine’s military says the Antonivsky Bridge across the Dnieper River near occupied Kherson in the south is now unusable by Russian military. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said Ukrainian forces had made important progress in their counteroffensive against Russian troops, although it was too early to predict the outcome. “Clearly we’ve seen significant progress by the Ukrainians, particularly in the north-east, and that is a product of the support we’ve provided, but first and foremost it’s a product of the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukrainian people,” Blinken told reporters in Mexico City. Ukraine’s state border service has issued a video that purports to show soldiers tearing down Russian banners and burning the Russian flag in Vovchansk, in the north of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region and very close to the border with Russia. Russia’s military commanders have stopped sending new units into Ukraine after the counteroffensive, the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said on its Facebook page on Monday. “The current situation in the theatre of operations and distrust of the higher command forced a large number of volunteers to categorically refuse the prospect of service in combat conditions.” Russian troops have left behind stockpiles of ammunition and other supplies following Ukraine’s counteroffensive in Kharkiv oblast, the Kyiv Independent reports. One analyst estimated that more than 300 vehicles, including tanks, self-propelled mortars and supply trucks, had been lost between 7 and 11 September. Russia responded to the counteroffensive by launching missile strikes that cut electricity and water supplies in Kharkiv city for a second time in less than 24 hours, knocking out both on Monday morning just hours after the city authorities had restored 80% of the utilities that had been cut overnight. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, appeared on state TV on Monday evening, chairing a meeting on the economy at which he made no reference to the military situation and said Russia was holding up in the face of western sanctions. “The economic blitzkrieg tactics, the onslaught they were counting on, did not work”. Germany is well-positioned to get through the winter despite reduced gas flows from Russia thanks to measures including extending two nuclear power plants’ lifespans, German chancellor Olaf Scholz will say on Tuesday. Russia detained a top manager of an aviation factory on suspicion of passing secret military information to Ukraine, Russian news agencies reported on Tuesday, citing the FSB federal security agency. Clashes have erupted between Azerbaijani and Armenian troops, according to Russian news agencies, in a resumption of decades-old hostilities linked to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian government said it would invoke a cooperation agreement with Russia and appeal to a Russia-led security bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, as well as the UN security council. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later today. Vivian Ho will be here shortly to guide you through the next few hours. Ukraine’s state border service has issued a video that shows soldiers ripping down Russian signs and burning the Russian flag in Vovchansk, which is in the north of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region close to the border with Russia. Volodomyr Zelenskiy has posted on social media to say that he has spoken to Italian prime minister Mario Draghi. Ukraine’s president said: Had a conversation with Prime Minister Mario Draghi. Informed him about the developments at the front. Noted the importance of defence cooperation with Italy. We should enhance it. Discussed the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The guarantee of its security is demilitarisation and return under Ukrainian control. Here is a video clip from Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s address last night when he declared that Ukraine has recaptured 2,300 sq miles (6,000 sq km) of territory. He urged allies to provide equipment to enhance his country’s ability to defend itself. Reuters is now carrying some additional quotes from its interview with Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar. It quotes her saying: Our strength stems from the fact that we are very motivated and that we plan operations thoroughly. Speaking on the road to Balakliia, a crucial military supply hub recaptured by Ukrainian forces late last week, she said Ukraine had taken the decision to press on with its operation in the Kharkiv region due to the successes notched up so far. Fighting is still raging in Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv region but Ukraine’s forces are making good progress because its forces are highly motivated and its operation is well planned, deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar told Reuters on Tuesday. “The aim is to liberate the Kharkiv region and beyond – all the territories occupied by the Russian Federation. Fighting is continuing. It is still early to say full control has been established over Kharkiv region,” Malyar said in an interview. Serhai Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has posted an update to Telegram on the situation on the ground in Donetsk. He claims that: The Russians have completely left Kreminna, but the armed forces have not yet entered the city. We are monitoring the situation in Lyman – the liberation of which is key for our region, fighting is still going on around the city. The large-scale de-occupation of Luhansk Oblast will begin from Kreminna and Svatove, the Russians have already begun to pull equipment closer to these cities. The main impact will be there. Today, Kreminna is completely empty – the Russian army has left the city. The Ukrainian flag raised by the partisans flies there. The situation in Starobilsk is somewhat similar. But in Svatove, the Rashists fled at first, but returned after some time. There is a shortage of fuel in the occupied territories due to the large-scale escape of the occupiers and collaborators. The claims have not been independently verified. Germany is well-positioned to get through the winter despite reduced gas flows from Russia thanks to measures including extending two nuclear power plants’ lifespans, German chancellor Olaf Scholz will say on Tuesday, according to reports from Reuters. Germany’s gas storage levels are higher than this time last year and will continue to be filled before winter, Scholz will say according to a copy of his speech for delivery at the German Employers’ Day. If you need a reminder, here is a map showing how rapidly the Ukrainian counteroffensive has been able to push back the Russian line of control in Kharkiv in the north-east of Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent is reporting that Kharkiv is again without electricity following Russian strikes on 11 September. Russia detained a top manager of an aviation factory on suspicion of passing secret military information to Ukraine, Russian news agencies reported on Tuesday, citing the FSB federal security agency. The FSB said a man was suspected of taking photographs of equipment from Russia’s fighter planes and sending them to a Ukrainian citizen who worked at a Ukrainian aviation plant, according to the reports. Reuters reports the FSB said it had opened a treason case against the suspect. Pavlo Kyrylenko, who is Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, has given a morning update on Telegram. He states that: In Slovyansk, at least one person was killed and one person was injured by shelling. The town of Hostre in the Kurakhivska community came under fire — fortunately, no one was injured. Avdiivka has been subjected to massive shelling at dawn for several days in a row. Today there were no casualties, we are clarifying the extent of the damage. Three people were injured as a result of the night shelling of Toretsk, and at least four houses were damaged. He also reported that several buildings were damaged during the attacks. The claims have not been independently verified. We reported earlier that there have been clashes between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The conflict over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region has been going on for decades. [See 5.36am] It appears the latest flare-up ended swiftly. Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan had called on Russian president Vladimir Putin, French president Emmanuel Macron and US secretary of state Antony Blinken to discuss the situation, but Reuters has a snap saying that there are local media reports that a ceasefire has been agreed. Azerbaijan borders Russia to the south. This is Martin Belam on the live blog now for the next few hours. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com With Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, set to meet Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Uzbekistan this week, a senior Chinese diplomat has said Beijing was willing to shape the international order together with Russia in a “more just and rational direction”. Agence France-Presse reports: China and Russia have drawn closer in recent years as part of what they call a “no limits” relationship acting as a counterweight to the global dominance of the United States. On Monday, the Communist party’s foreign affairs chief, Yang Jiechi, told Russia’s ambassador to China, Andrey Denisov, that China was “willing to work with Russia to continuously implement the spirit of high-level strategic cooperation between the two countries, safeguard the common interests of both sides, and promote the development of the international order in a more just and rational direction”. Russia has sought to bolster ties with Asian countries, particularly China, since being hit with unprecedented western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. Heightening tensions between China and the west, Beijing has not condemned Moscow’s interventions in Ukraine. Ukraine’s military says the Antonivsky Bridge across the Dnieper River near occupied Kherson is now unusable by Russian military, the Kyiv Independent reports. Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command also reported that Ukraine’s forces destroyed one tank, five 152 mm gun-howitzers, including one Msta-B and one Msta-S howitzer, and 12 units of armoured vehicles, among other Russian military equipment. As a result, 59 Russian troops were killed, the command said. A group of Ukrainian civil society leaders says sweeping electricity cuts are part of Russia’s strategy, urging the US to ramp up support to maximise recent gains before winter, Agence France-Presse reports. Much of eastern Ukraine was plunged into a blackout on Sunday, with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, blaming deliberate attacks by Moscow as Kyiv made startling gains on the battlefield. “Their approach is to have more cold before the winter season starts by destroying all critical infrastructure,” said Hanna Hopko, who heads the International Center for Ukrainian Victory, an umbrella group of civil society organizations. Hopko, addressing reporters at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said: “Putin really thinks that neither Ukraine nor Europe will survive this winter. That’s what he really hopes and that is actually the central pillar around which he now is developing his threats.” US leaders are being careful not to declare a premature victory after a Ukrainian offensive forced Russian troops into a messy retreat in the north, the Associated Press reports. Although there was widespread celebration of Ukraine’s gains over the weekend, US officials know Russian President Vladimir Putin still has troops and resources to tap, and his forces still control large swaths of the east and south. “I agree there should be no spiking of the ball because Russia still has cards it can play,” said Philip Breedlove, a retired US air force general who was Nato’s top commander from 2013 to 2016. “Ukraine is now clearly making durable changes in its east and north and I believe that if the west properly equips Ukraine, they’ll be able to hold on to their gains.” The UK’s Ministry of Defence says Russia could take years to rebuild one of its most prestigious tank units after the retreat from Kharkiv oblast. In its latest intelligence briefing on Twitter, the MoD said the 1st Guards Tank Army had been severely degraded, leaving Russia’s conventional forces “severely weakened”. As Russia’s forces retreat from the Kharkiv region, they are leaving behind hundreds of military vehicles, including tanks and trucks. Our picture editors assembled this series of striking images of abandoned equipment. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will speak with International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the plan told Reuters, as Ukraine continues to press the global lender for a full-fledged financing program. Ukrainian officials have said they are seeking an IMF program worth as much as $15bn to $20bn, although such a large amount is seen as unlikey to win IMF approval. The IMF Executive Board, at an informal session on Monday, discussed a plan that could offer Ukraine $1.4bn in emergency aid. Clashes have erupted between Azerbaijani and Armenian troops, according to Russian news agencies, in a resumption of decades-old hostilities linked to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan, which re-established full control over the territory in a six-week conflict in 2020, acknowledged casualties among its forces. Armenia made no mention of losses, but said clashes persisted overnight. The Armenian government said it would invoke a cooperation agreement with Russia and appeal to a Russia-led security bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, as well as the UN security council, Interfax reported. You can read the full story here: The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, says Ukrainian forces have made important progress in their counteroffensive against Russian troops, although it was too early to predict the outcome. “Clearly we’ve seen significant progress by the Ukrainians, particularly in the northeast, and that is a product of the support we’ve provided, but first and foremost it’s a product of the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukrainian people,” Blinken told reporters in Mexico City. “It’s too early to tell exactly where this is going. The Russians maintain very significant forces in Ukraine as well as equipment and arms and munitions. They continue to use it indiscriminately against not just the Ukrainian armed forces but civilians and civilian infrastructure as we’ve seen.” Good morning and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. It’s now 7.30am in Kyiv. Here are the latest developments. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said Ukrainian forces had made important progress in their counteroffensive against Russian troops, although it was too early to predict the outcome. “Clearly we’ve seen significant progress by the Ukrainians, particularly in the north-east, and that is a product of the support we’ve provided, but first and foremost it’s a product of the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukrainian people,” Blinken told reporters in Mexico City. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country’s forces had taken back 6,000 sq km (2,400 square miles) of Russian-held territory in the country’s south and east. Ukraine’s forces have continued to press their counterattack in Kharkiv, seeking to take control of almost all of the province. Ukraine’s troops headed north, reportedly recapturing towns all the way to the Russian border. The Ukrainian military says it had freed more than 20 settlements in 24 hours. In recent days, Kyiv’s forces have captured territory at least twice the size of greater London, according to the British Defense Ministry. Russia’s military commanders have stopped sending new units into Ukraine after the counteroffensive, the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said on its Facebook page on Monday. “The current situation in the theatre of operations and distrust of the higher command forced a large number of volunteers to categorically refuse the prospect of service in combat conditions.” Russian troops have left behind stockpiles of ammunition and other supplies following Ukraine’s counteroffensive in Kharkiv oblast, the Kyiv Independent reports. One analyst estimated that more than 300 vehicles, including tanks, self-propelled mortars and supply trucks, had been lost between 7 and 11 September. Russia responded to the counteroffensive by launching missile strikes that cut electricity and water supplies in Kharkiv city for a second time in less than 24 hours, knocking out both on Monday morning just hours after the city authorities had restored 80% of the utilities that had been cut overnight. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, appeared on state TV on Monday evening, chairing a meeting on the economy at which he made no reference to the military situation and said Russia was holding up in the face of western sanctions. “The economic blitzkrieg tactics, the onslaught they were counting on, did not work”. The US-based Institute for the Study of War thinktank said that “Ukraine has turned the tide in its favour, but the current counteroffensive will not end the war”. Ukrainian authorities have said they are capturing so many Russian prisoners of war the country is running out of space to put them, the Associated Press reports. Municipal deputies from 18 districts of Moscow and St Petersburg have signed a public statement demanding that Vladimir Putin resign. “We, the municipal deputies of Russia, believe that the actions of President Vladimir Putin harm the future of Russia and its citizens,” read the statement published by Ksenia Torstrem, the municipal deputy of the Semenovsky district of St Petersburg."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/nov/13/poland-russia-defeat-ukraine-western-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-13T15:00:14Z","webTitle":"Why Poland may have most to gain from a Russian defeat in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/13/poland-russia-defeat-ukraine-western-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/13/poland-russia-defeat-ukraine-western-europe","fields":{"headline":"Why Poland may have most to gain from a Russian defeat in Ukraine","bodyText":"If the outcome of the war could be determined by the toss of a coin, the camps would be clear: democracies would want Ukraine to win, autocracies would want it to lose. But real-world political outcomes are not so binary. They typically fall on a spectrum between annihilation and total victory. This leaves the democracies divided into at least three camps: the English-speaking, the western European and the eastern European minus Hungary. What Putin calls the “collective west” all want Ukraine to win. But not necessarily to the same extent. For Poland and the Baltic countries the matter is simple. They want Ukraine’s victory to be unequivocal. The advantages would be both material and psychological. Ukraine’s victory would soothe a centuries-old angst. For Poland, Russia has augured conquest, partitions, genocide, colonialism and communism. The obsession is mutual. In his 2021 essay arguing that Ukraine and Russia were historically one people, Putin included more than 30 references to Poland – some hinting that Ukrainian national identity was plotted by Poland’s elites. Over the past 600 years, Russia and Poland have waged more than a dozen wars. There is little love lost between them. Ukraine’s success would also entail a historic chance for the region to exit the status of the periphery and become a counterbalance to the EU’s big western member states. Victory in Ukraine would probably spill over into regime change in Belarus – the second missing piece in the historic project of the Intermarium, or a buffer of allied countries stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea to counterbalance Russia’s power. For Poland, such a scenario would be a double jackpot. For the first time since at least the 17th century, we would get over the problem of “the neighbourhood” – a comfort that most western Europeans have taken for granted since the end of the second world war. A united region across eastern Europe, with the human and economic capacity of more than 100 million citizens, could offset the dominance of the old Rhineland in the EU. This possibility is why the Kremlin systemically underplays the region’s potential. Its rhetoric treats Ukraine as nothing more than a repository of Slavic peasant folklore, a superpower only in handicrafts. In reality, Ukraine, birthplace of Sergei Prokofiev and Sergei Korolev, the father of Soviet space exploration, hosts swathes of unexploited natural resources, a potential for emissions-free electricity, some of the continent’s most fertile soils, a space and aviation industry that has built the world’s largest aeroplane, and political leaders who command respect across Europe. Tapping into that potential requires economies of scale, transparent institutions and capital investments. Some of this scale could come from regional integration with its allies. Curbing corruption and the power of the oligarchs was already very much on the agenda of the Zelenskiy administration. With victory, investment money would flow. Poland and Ukraine are much poorer today than France and Germany. How could they realistically become a countervailing force in the future EU? Like many postwar economic miracles – such as those of South Korea, Japan and West Germany – this one is also likely to be co-sponsored by a superpower with much to gain from the reconfigured political order. The US is already pumping money, technologies and thinktanks in to eastern Europe. In return, it expects influence and a clear stance on China. This is a price that seems too high to Europe’s west but not to its east. Lithuania was ready to risk trade relations with China to please the US, while Ukraine and the Czech Republic have pivoted to sourcing nuclear fuel from the US. Poland recently contracted with an American company to build its first nuclear power plant. Western Europeans might not be ready for the geopolitical centre of gravity to shift eastward – let alone at the price of increased US influence across the continent. After the cold war, western Europe became a reluctant ally of the US and the main beneficiary of a post-Berlin Wall triangulation: Russian energy, Chinese markets and American security. Now the first pillar is gone and the second may be the price to pay for the third. France and Germany currently endorse a policy of “strategic autonomy” for Europe, a defence and security idea that could one day lead to an EU army. Putin’s Russia has pushed the goal of a Eurasian union stretching “from Vladivostok to Lisbon”. What both strategies have in common is an aversion to “Anglo-Saxon” dominance in Europe. American and eastern European interests today seem aligned. There are two looming reasons why they may diverge. First, the US is way more afraid of a repeat of the chaos of the 1991 Soviet Union implosion, and the attendant risks to nuclear security. These security risks are not taken lightly in eastern Europe. But if you already live in an at-risk neighbourhood and there’s the possibility of major improvement, your perspective can be different. Second, there seems to be a residual hope in the US that, as long as Russia stands on its feet, it can eventually be pivoted towards the west and used against China – in a reverse Kissinger manoeuvre. In eastern Europe, this idea is greeted with horror. It has been tested many times with Putin (too many – if you ask eastern Europeans). The region fears that it could be tried again with Putin’s successor – especially if Russia, in lieu of major reforms, pulls out of a hat someone such as Alexei Navalny, aesthetically acceptable for the west but still wedded to Russia’s role as a great power. But these are opportunities and risks, not givens. Poland’s Law and Justice party – bogged down in a dignity-driven conflict with the EU over the rule of law – has forfeited the chance to effectively take Britain’s place in the EU post-Brexit. But it’s not missing the opportunity to be Ukraine’s reliable ally, nor is it losing sight of the geopolitical positives that may ultimately flow from this. Whether the ruling party is able to hold on to power past the 2023 elections or not, the country’s geopolitical course is steady. In March the Polish parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of granting Ukrainians special rights to Poland’s education, health and labour market. More than 80% of Ukrainians have a good or very good opinion of Poles. Three-quarters say their view has improved since Russia’s invasion. Despite troubled relations up to 1945, Ukrainians perceive Poles as the single most friendly society today. All major Polish parties support Ukraine but they also hope that, while the arc of the history is long, it will eventually bend towards a new geopolitical order. They want to see Ukraine emerge from this war as a star in the making, Europe’s centuries-old western orientation overturned – and Poland the undeclared winner.

A total of 185,000 of its upmarket A-Class, B-Class and all-electric EQA cars were assembled here last year in the factory, close to the French border. They are then taken by road, rail and ship to their new owners, perhaps to zip through European capitals, Chinese cities, or along California’s coastal roads. Mercedes-Benz Group (MBG) produces hundreds of thousands such vehicles a year from eight German factories: Rastatt is one of three in the state of Baden-Württemberg, near the company’s physical and spiritual home in Stuttgart. The carmaker lends its name to a whole area of this affluent city – the Benzviertel, where its headquarters and museum are located – and to its Bundesliga football club’s stadium. But Mercedes and the country’s wider economy now stand at a crossroads. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted a race to find new energy supplies amid sanctions and Russia’s throttling of gas pipelines – a crisis that has already forced Germany to extend the life of its three remaining nuclear power plants. The failure of diplomatic policy towards Moscow has also prompted much soul-searching in Germany over its choice of business partners, with questions now being raised over the wisdom of its reliance on China. As winter closes in and demand for energy increases, Mercedes and its rivals have had to adapt to ensure they can keep production facilities such as Rastatt running. Somewhat fortuitously, Mercedes says its decision last year to make its production carbon-neutral from this year left it well placed to respond. “We had a big advantage, because we finalised a large green energy contract for all of our factories last year,” says Jörg Burzer, the MBG board member responsible for production and supply chains. “This is a contract which focuses on wind, solar and hydroelectric power.” Germany’s businesses and households had grown accustomed to plentiful Russian gas and oil for many years. Russia accounted for more than half of the country’s natural gas supply in 2020. Mercedes is less dependent on these supplies than some of Germany’s energy-intensive industries, notably steelmakers, pharmaceutical companies and chemicals producers such as BASF, which said in October it would permanently “downsize” its European operations. However, the carmaker still relies on gas for certain production processes, particularly in its foundries. Burzer says MBG was able to effectively halve its gas usage by turning off the gas power plants at its sites and by ramping up renewables. “We are very strongly focused on green energy,” he adds, “but even without the mild start to the winter we would have been well placed to get through.” On a visit to the company’s enormous site at Sindelfingen, about 40 miles east of Rastatt, Burzer gestures out of the boardroom window at the sprawling plant where some 35,000 people are employed. “You can’t see it from here, but behind the chimney is the multistorey car park, the first one here where the roof has been completely covered with solar panels.” This is part of the company’s “thousand roofs” programme, launched this year, which will see solar panels on factory roofs across Germany and beyond. It recently announced plans to build a 100-megawatt windfarm on its test track at Papenburg, in northern Germany, which will cover more than 15% of the company’s annual electricity needs in Germany. Details of a large planned offshore wind development will soon be unveiled, Burzer adds. The energy shock to Europe’s industrial powerhouse has not been as extreme as initially feared: although smaller German firms have borne the brunt of soaring costs, gas storage facilities have been successfully filled before the onset of winter. The shift in the country’s diplomatic approach has been perhaps more seismic. Putin’s war has prompted the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to effectively break with the decades-long approach of Wandel durch Handel: the belief that social and political change in other countries can be brought about by trade. His predecessor, Angela Merkel, has come under fire for Germany’s diplomatic failures, but refuses to criticise the decision to facilitate even greater Russian gas supplies through the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, halted by Scholz just before the Kremlin’s troops poured into Ukraine. There has also been outcry over the role of former Social Democrat party (SDP) chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who led the country from 1998 to 2005 before monetising his friendship with Putin through lucrative roles on the boards of Nord Stream 2 and Russian state oil company Rosneft. Now another of the pillars of its economy is up for reassessment: its relationship with China. Germany is in the middle of a “structural shift” following the shocks of the war, the energy crisis and pandemic disruption to global trade, according to analysts, even if the business community has only belatedly started to adapt. Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at the research arm of bank ING, believes corporate Germany has been slow to adapt by restructuring its supply chains and production processes. “There are two major shifts, one is energy,” he says. “Then there are global headwinds.” Germany’s largest manufacturers, including Mercedes and the other carmakers, have enjoyed booming sales in China, while the country’s Mittelstand of small and medium-sized engineering companies have powered Chinese production. China is by far Mercedes’s biggest market: it sold nearly 223,000 vehicles there in the third quarter of this year, representing 42% of its total sales in the period. Now Germany is working out how to recalibrate relations with Beijing. The three-way agreement between the members of the country’s ruling coalition – Scholz’s SPD, the Greens and the Free Democrats – has labelled the relationship with China a “systematic rivalry”. It also refers to human rights issues and Taiwan, as well as the need for economic diversification. Last month, accompanied by a high-powered economic delegation, Scholz was the first western leader to be granted a state visit to China since the outbreak of Covid and Xi Jinping’s moves to strengthen his power. Back home, Scholz has come in for criticism – including from coalition partners – for pushing through a deal allowing Chinese state-owned shipping company Cosco to buy a near-25% stake in three terminals at Germany’s largest port, Hamburg, the city where he was once mayor. “Germany needs to reinvent itself,” says Noah Barkin, an expert in Europe-China relations at US analysts Rhodium Group. “There is a realisation that Germany is too dependent on China, that its biggest companies are too reliant on the Chinese market. If you go back 10 years, that was seen as a strength, and now increasingly it’s seen as a vulnerability.” Mercedes has full faith in its recent strategic decisions, says Burzer. “We are very closely connected to China on the product and market side, and of course we are a promoter of global trade.” These decisions include its push towards more electric vehicles and “preparing products for the future and according to market conditions in China and the US, and our ‘luxury’ strategy”, Burzer says. “These are the correct decisions, which will also make us successful in the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/24/ukraine-war-heading-for-uncontrolled-escalation-says-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-24T15:35:05Z","webTitle":"Ukraine war heading for ‘uncontrolled escalation’, says Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/24/ukraine-war-heading-for-uncontrolled-escalation-says-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/24/ukraine-war-heading-for-uncontrolled-escalation-says-russia","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine war heading for ‘uncontrolled escalation’, says Russia","bodyText":"Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has told western counterparts that the war in Ukraine is heading for an “uncontrolled escalation” amid evidence that the Kremlin is weighing how to respond to yet another anticipated battlefield defeat around the key southern city of Kherson. With Russian troops setting up new defences for a fresh Ukrainian offensive in Luhansk in the country’s east as well, Moscow appears to be preparing the ground for yet further escalation, with discredited claims that Kyiv may be preparing to use a dirty bomb as a “false-flag operation” to blame Russia. Refuting the Russian allegation, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in an interview on Monday: “The allegation that Ukraine is preparing to use dirty bombs in Ukraine is absurd.” Russian officials – including Vladimir Putin – have repeatedly hinted that the Kremlin may be prepared to use a nuclear weapon as part of its so-far failed brinkmanship to discourage Kyiv and its western allies, which have been supplying Ukraine with modern weapons, intelligence and training. However, the Kremlin continued to push the claim of a Ukrainian dirty bomb on Monday, with Igor Kirilov, head of the Armed Forces radioactive weapons unit, saying that troops had been mobilised to work in a radioactively contaminated environment. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the threat was real. “Their distrust of the information that has been provided by the Russian side doesn’t mean that the threat of using such a dirty bomb doesn’t exist,” he told reporters. Shoigu discussed the “rapidly deteriorating situation” in phone calls with his British, French and Turkish counterparts and also spoke by phone with the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, for the second time in three days. The Pentagon said Austin told Shoigu he “rejected any pretext for Russian escalation”. Without providing evidence, Shoigu said Ukraine could escalate by using a “dirty bomb” – conventional explosives laced with radioactive material. Analysts have noted that a “dirty bomb” would have little utility for Ukraine on the battlefield, not least when its forces are currently retaking large swathes of territory by conventional means, instead interpreting Russia’s claim as a pretext for its own planned escalation. In an overnight address, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the Russian accusation was a sign that Moscow was planning such an attack itself and would blame Ukraine. “If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this,” Zelenskiy said. “So when today the Russian minister of defence organises a phone carousel and calls foreign ministers with stories about the so-called ‘dirty’ nuclear bomb, everyone understands everything well. Understands who is the source of everything dirty that can be imagined in this war.” Shoigu’s comments fit a worrying pattern of escalatory actions by Moscow as the tide of the war has turned against it, most recently with its targeting of civilian infrastructure with missiles and “kamikaze” drones after Kyiv’s attack on the Kerch strait bridge in Crimea earlier this month. In a joint statement after the talks, Britain, France and the US said they were committed to supporting Ukraine “for as long as it takes” and rejected Russia’s warning about a “dirty bomb”. “Our countries made clear that we all reject Russia’s transparently false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory,” they said. “The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation.” Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia and the International Institute for Strategic Affairs, commented on Twitter: “It’s Russia that is escalating: attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, apparent attacks on western connectivity infrastructure, and mining of Novaya Kakhovka dam. And playing with nuclear fire in Zaporizhzhiya [nuclear power plant] for months. “So [it’s] hard to see these calls as anything other than Shoigu either doubling down on Putin’s bluffs, or preparing way for Russian nuclear use. Yes, nuclear (ie fission [rather than a dirty bomb]). A dirty bomb would breach nuclear taboo but not achieve significant effects.” He added: “I worry there is too much motivated reasoning in dismissing possible Russian nuclear use. We don’t want it to happen, and/or we don’t see the point, therefore it won’t. But Russia faces logic of dwindling choices as it loses. Escalation of all kinds more likely.” The latest threats from Moscow come as Russian forces appear to be preparing to withdraw from the east bank of the Dnieper River near Kherson, ordering a fresh evacuation of civilians, and laying the ground for the potential loss of the city of Kherson itself. About 25,000 people have been transported from the area since Tuesday, the Interfax news agency said. However, Russia-installed authorities in Kherson reported insufficient vessels to ferry people across the river at one point on Sunday, blaming a “sharp increase in the number of people wishing to leave”. The Russian education minister, Sergei Kravtsov, said in a video message: “The situation today is difficult. It’s vital to save your lives. It won’t be for long. You will definitely return.” Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine’s military spy chief, warned that the reported transportation of civilians from Kherson was part of a Russian information campaign. While Russia is moving financial structures, equipment, vulnerable residents and wounded people from Kherson, he said, it is also reinforcing defences. “They are creating the illusion that all is lost. Yet at the same time they are moving new military units in and preparing to defend the streets of Kherson,” he told the Ukrainska Pravda online media outlet. On Monday, the region’s Russian-installed administration announced the formation of a local militia, saying that all men remaining in the city could join. Russia accused western countries of having “essentially stolen” its gold and foreign exchange reserves via sanctions. Asked by reporters about an EU proposal to transfer frozen Russian assets to Ukraine, Peskov said: “In general, a part large of our assets have been essentially stolen by specific western countries.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/06/iran-nuclear-talks-rocked-by-russian-demand-for-sanctions-exemption","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-06T17:22:07Z","webTitle":"Iran nuclear talks rocked by Russian demand for sanctions exemption","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/06/iran-nuclear-talks-rocked-by-russian-demand-for-sanctions-exemption","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/06/iran-nuclear-talks-rocked-by-russian-demand-for-sanctions-exemption","fields":{"headline":"Iran nuclear talks rocked by Russian demand for sanctions exemption","bodyText":"Russia has been accused of trying to take the Iran nuclear deal hostage as part of its wider battle with the west over Ukraine, after it threw a last-minute spanner into plans for an agreement to lift a swathe of US economic sanctions on Tehran. After months of negotiations in Vienna, a revised deal was expected to be reached within days under which US sanctions would be lifted in return for Tehran returning to full compliance with the 2015 nuclear nonproliferation deal. But diplomatic efforts have been sent into a tailspin by Russia’s unexpected demand for written guarantees that its economic trade with Iran will be exempted from US sanctions imposed on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, at the weekend cited the “avalanche of aggressive sanctions [on Russia] that the west has started spewing out”, and said: “This meant Moscow had to ask the US for guarantees first, requiring a clear answer that the new sanctions will not affect its rights under the nuclear deal. “We requested that our US colleagues … give us written guarantees at the minimum level of the secretary of state that the current [sanctions] process launched by the US will not in any way harm our right to free, fully fledged trade and economic and investment cooperation and military-technical cooperation with Iran.” In a sign of how the imposition of sanctions will bite, Aeroflot flights from Moscow to Iran were cancelled on Sunday. If Lavrov’s demand is to require the US to exempt Russian-Iranian trade from sanctions, the west is almost certain to reject the demand since it would open a huge loophole in the sanctions regime. It would then be up to Moscow whether to veto the nuclear deal altogether. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, dismissed Russia’s demands as “irrelevant”, saying that sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine “have nothing to do with the Iran nuclear deal”. They “just are not in any way linked together, so I think that’s irrelevant,” Blinken told CBS News. The Vienna talks have for months been an oasis of diplomatic cooperation between Russia and the west as they painstakingly crafted a compromise acceptable to both Iran and the US. Russia’s chief negotiator at the Vienna talks, Mikhail Ulyanov, has been an indefatigable intermediary but now risks seeing his work being undone by Moscow’s confrontation with the west over Ukraine. Iranian officials criticised Russia’s intervention, saying “the Russians put this demand on the table at the Vienna talks two days ago. There is an understanding that by changing its position in [the] Vienna talks, Russia wants to secure its interests in other places. This move is not constructive for [the] Vienna nuclear talks.” Russia also has a short-term strategic interest in scuppering or postponing the deal. Iran produces more than 2m barrels of oil a day, and if these supplies were able to reach the markets, the upward surge in prices would be slowed. Russia, a large-scale oil producer, wants to drive the oil price up to turn the screw on western economies but also to boost its own revenues. Israel, a fierce opponent of a revived nuclear deal, will be the only major country privately welcoming Russia’s actions. The parties to the deal are Iran, the E3 (France, Germany and the UK), Russia and China. The US is present in Vienna, but Iran will not directly negotiate with the US delegation. Separately, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, was in Tehran this weekend trying to secure a deal on the future inspection regime. Grossi was hoping to resolve disagreements over the IAEA’s demand for access to four sites where suspicious nuclear activities were alleged to have taken place. Iran wants the IAEA to close down these investigations, claiming they are based on false Israeli intelligence. Mohammad Eslami, the head of the Iranian atomic energy association, has also sought assurances that what Iran regards as Israeli intelligence would not form the basis of future IAEA investigations into Iran. The two sides agreed to exchange documents by June, the likely date for the Iran deal to come back into force, but seemed to have left issues about the inspection regime unresolved. Meanwhile, the IAEA will continue with an inspection regime in which its surveillance cameras remain in place, and the memory cards of the cameras kept under joint seal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/feb/24/dining-across-the-divide-trident-hunting-eating-meat-cats","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-24T12:30:57Z","webTitle":"Dining across the divide: ‘Don’t scream at people outside supermarkets, take them for a veggie meal!’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/24/dining-across-the-divide-trident-hunting-eating-meat-cats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/24/dining-across-the-divide-trident-hunting-eating-meat-cats","fields":{"headline":"Dining across the divide: ‘Don’t scream at people outside supermarkets, take them for a veggie meal!’","bodyText":"Bill, 62, Edinburgh Profession IT consultant Voting record Bill has predominantly voted Conservative, but describes himself as a “liberal Conservative” rather than “a hang-’em-high, shoot-’em Conservative”.

Authorities said seven rockets hit the city early on Thursday morning. Other residents are trapped under rubble, the regional governor and emergency services said. Rescue workers at the scene said they saved one three-year-old girl. More explosions were reported in the city at mid-morning Kyiv time, but there were no further casualties. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to admit severe losses in Ukraine, conceding the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals and insisting Russia would “stabilise” the situation in four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. “We are working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise,” Putin told Russian teachers during a televised video call on Wednesday. The UN nuclear agency chief is en route to Kyiv to discuss creating a security zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after Putin ordered his government to take it over. “On our way to Kyiv for important meetings,” International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi wrote on Twitter, saying the need for a protection zone around the site was “more urgent than ever”. Grossi is also expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant. The IAEA said it had learned of plans to restart one reactor at the plant, where all six reactors have been shut down for weeks. Ukraine’s forces are pushing their advance in the east and south, forcing Russian troops to retreat under pressure on both fronts. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s military had made major, rapid advances against Russian forces in the past week, taking back dozens of towns in regions in the south and east that Russia has declared annexed. Military experts say Russia is at its weakest point, partly because of its decision not to mobilise earlier and partly because of massive losses of troops and equipment. Ukraine has extended its area of control in the Kherson region by six to 12 miles, according to its military’s southern command. Zelenskiy confirmed the recapture of the villages of Novovoskresenske, Novohryhorivka and Petropavlivka, saying the settlements were “liberated from the sham referendum and stabilised,” in an address on Wednesday. Kherson region’s Moscow-appointed governor, Kirill Stremousov, said the withdrawal was a tactical “regrouping” to “deliver a retaliatory blow”. The extent of Russia’s retreat remains unclear. Moscow’s forces have left behind smashed towns once under occupation and, in places, mass burial sites and evidence of torture chambers. In Lyman, which was retaken by Ukrainian forces on Sunday, more than 50 graves have been found, some marked with names, others with numbers, the Kyiv-based outlet Hromadske reported on Wednesday. Leaders of 44 European countries on Thursday in Prague will send a clear signal of Russia’s isolation and try to create a new order without Moscow, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said this morning. “The meeting is looking for a new order without Russia,” he told reporters. Russia has submitted preliminary objections to a genocide case against Moscow brought by Ukraine. The International Court of Justice, which is the UN’s highest court for disputes between states, has tweeted that it had received the objections on 3 October, but these have not been made public. The filing signifies a change in Moscow’s attitude to the ICJ case. Russia is now engaging with the court, whereas it has previously skipped hearings and not filed documents directly. The UN has warned Russia’s claimed annexation of Ukraine territory will only exacerbate human rights violations. Christian Salazar Volkmann, said UN experts had documented “a range of violations of the rights to life, liberty and security” and warned the situation would only worsen as Russia pushes forward with the annexation of some Ukrainian regions. Attempts to play down retreats in Ukraine are no longer washing inside Russia with the latest military failures spilling on to local television screens. “Why do we advance metre by metre when they advance village by village?” Olga Skabeyeva, the country’s top state-TV host, asked a Russia-appointed official in Luhansk in a recent broadcast. Pro-war military bloggers and journalists are also criticising the Kremlin and painting a bleak picture of deteriorating Russian morale. Roman Saponkov, a prominent war correspondent, described his despair over the pullback in Kherson on his Telegram channel: “I really don’t know what to say to you. The retreat … is catastrophic.” Poland says it has asked to have US nuclear weapons based on its territory, amid growing fears that Putin could resort to using nuclear arms in Ukraine. The request from the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, is widely seen as symbolic and appears to be the latest example of nuclear signalling to deter Putin. The White House, however, said it had not received such a request. The car bombing that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of prominent Russian political figure Alexander Dugin, was allegedly authorised by elements within the Ukrainian government, according to US intelligence sources who spoke with the New York Times and CNN. The United States took no part in the attack, either by providing intelligence or other assistance, the officials said. A SpaceX rocket carrying Russian cosmonaut, Anna Kikina, the only female cosmonaut in service, soared into orbit from Florida on Wednesday. The International Space Station crew comprising Kikina, two Americans and a Japanese astronaut flew together in a demonstration of US-Russian teamwork in space despite Ukraine war tensions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/29/green-tory-back-johnson-call-successor-invest-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-29T15:47:21Z","webTitle":"Green Tories back Johnson’s call for successor to invest in renewables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/29/green-tory-back-johnson-call-successor-invest-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/29/green-tory-back-johnson-call-successor-invest-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Green Tories back Johnson’s call for successor to invest in renewables","bodyText":"Leading green Conservatives have backed Boris Johnson’s call for his successor to invest in renewable energy, amid concern that the Tory leadership frontrunner Liz Truss could rely more on fossil fuels to combat soaring prices. In one of his final speeches as prime minister, Johnson is set to warn against focusing on short-term solutions and neglecting both renewables and a wider shift towards net zero. While officials say details of the speech are still to be worked out, they say Johnson will stress that growth in sources such as wind power, as well as new nuclear power stations, would protect the UK from future energy crises. Truss and her rival in the Conservative leadership race, Rishi Sunak, have both called for more nuclear energy. However, they have been notably sceptical at times in their comments and planned policies on renewable sources. Sunak has pledged to make it even harder to get permission for onshore windfarms, while Truss spoke out vehemently against solar panels being installed on agricultural land. The foreign secretary will reportedly issue dozens of oil and gas drilling licences if she is elected prime minister next week. She will invite applications for licences to explore new fields and up to 130 are set to be issued, sources told the Times. The most recent figures from Offshore Energies UK estimate that there are 15bn barrels of oil and gas still under the North Sea. Truss has faced criticism for delaying her announcement on addressing soaring energy prices until after the leadership election concludes on Monday. Chris Skidmore, a Conservative former minister who set up the Net Zero Support Group within the parliamentary party and has become a leading Tory voice on green issues, said he was keen for Truss and Sunak to understand the need to invest in renewables. “The reason why I wanted to ensure every candidate in the leadership contest committed to net zero was not just to ensure that the UK maintained its international leadership on climate change – it was precisely because net zero isn’t just about reducing emissions but determining our future energy security and economic growth,” the MP for Kingswood told the Guardian. “The private sector and international markets already understand that investing in the energy transition is the way forward for future growth. “Net zero is now our way out of this cost of gas crisis. We have reached a tipping point where renewables are now far cheaper than fossil fuels and I genuinely believe that 2022 will be viewed by historians as the year that we recognised from this crisis that the world woke up to the need to deliver energy sovereignty through renewable and clean power.” Sam Hall, the director of the Conservative Environment Network, which has the support of 133 Tory MPs, half the parliamentary party backbench, said a commitment to net zero was “essential if we’re to tackle our dependency on dubious regimes for energy”. He said: “Boris Johnson is right that delivering net zero goes hand-in-hand with tackling the root causes of the energy crisis. Putin is weaponising Europe’s reliance on international gas markets for his illegal invasion of Ukraine, hoping that sky-high energy bills will weaken our resolve. “By rolling out more clean energy such as offshore wind and insulating Britain’s draughty housing stock, we will become less dependent on expensive gas which is putting up people’s energy bills. “Boris Johnson deserves a lot of credit for turbocharging the UK’s clean energy sector during his time in office. Because of these policies we’re buying less expensive gas than we would have been otherwise. “The next prime minister must make good on their pledges to expand cheap renewables and boost energy efficiency, as well as providing direct support to households and businesses to help them get through this winter. Doubling down on net zero is essential if we’re to tackle our dependency on dubious regimes for energy.” While Truss and Sunak are seeking to appeal to Conservative members, who will select Johnson’s successor, Tory voters appear less dogmatic on energy measures. Almost half of them now support the nationalisation of UK energy firms, according to a YouGov poll for the Times. Truss has pledged to suspend green levies, which fund energy efficiency schemes, placed on energy bills, and has said she backs fracking for shale gas if it has local support. She is also resistant to new onshore wind projects, and during one leadership hustings event said that seeing solar farms on what was farmland was “one of the most depressing sights” of the modern UK. A source in Truss’s campaign said she was “absolutely committed to green energy”, and had been vocal about the need to increase the supply from sources including wind and tidal power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/may/10/donald-trump-china-hurricanes","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-10T21:40:38Z","webTitle":"Trump inquired if China could make hurricanes to harm US, ex-officials say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/10/donald-trump-china-hurricanes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/may/10/donald-trump-china-hurricanes","fields":{"headline":"Trump inquired if China could make hurricanes to harm US, ex-officials say","bodyText":"As president, Donald Trump repeatedly asked aides if China could be manufacturing hurricanes and sending them to damage the United States, three unnamed former senior officials told Rolling Stone on Tuesday. Trump also reportedly wanted to know if using such a “hurricane gun” would constitute an act of war, and if so, whether the US could retaliate militarily. China is a major nuclear power. “It was almost too stupid for words,” one source told the magazine, which said the speaker was “intimately familiar with the then sitting president’s inquiry”. “I did not get the sense he was joking at all,” the source added. The news comes on the tail of former defense secretary Mark Esper’s claim, in a new book, that Trump wanted to hit “drug labs” in Mexico with missiles and then deny responsibility, and other hair-raising accounts of near foreign policy disaster. Rolling Stone quoted a second former official as saying: “I was present [once] when he asked if China ‘made’ hurricanes to send to us. [Trump] wanted to know if the technology existed. One guy in the room responded, ‘Not to the best of my knowledge, sir.’ “I kept it together until I got back to my office … I do not know where the [then-]president would have heard about that … He was asking about it around the time, maybe a little before, he asked people about nuking hurricanes.” In August 2019, the website Axios reported that in a briefing on hurricanes, Trump told top officials: “I got it. I got it. Why don’t we nuke them?” Trump was reportedly told that aides would “look into” the notion of destroying large storms with nuclear weapons, which in 2016 National Geographic called “a really bad idea” with “a surprising history”. Trump called the Axios story “ridiculous”. But his interest in hurricanes reared its head again the following week, in what would come to be known as “Sharpiegate”. At an Oval Office briefing on Hurricane Dorian, Trump held up a National Hurricane Center map that appeared to have been altered with a Sharpie pen, to show the storm hitting Alabama – a baseless claim previously made by Trump. Trump did not comment to Rolling Stone about its “hurricane gun” story. Stephanie Grisham, his press secretary at the time of Sharpiegate and his reported remark about “nuking” hurricanes, told the magazine she did not hear conversation about China making hurricanes, but it would not have surprised her if she had. “Stuff like that was not unusual for him,” Grisham said. “He would blurt out crazy things all the time, and tell aides to look into it or do something about it.” “His staff would say they’d look into, knowing that more often than not, he’d forget about it quickly – much like a toddler.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/01/energy-industry-backs-plan-to-save-businesses-and-homes-up-to-18bn-a-year","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T16:41:01Z","webTitle":"Energy industry backs plan to save businesses and homes up to £18bn a year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/01/energy-industry-backs-plan-to-save-businesses-and-homes-up-to-18bn-a-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/01/energy-industry-backs-plan-to-save-businesses-and-homes-up-to-18bn-a-year","fields":{"headline":"Energy industry backs plan to save businesses and homes up to £18bn a year","bodyText":"The energy industry has thrown its weight behind a plan it says could save homes and businesses up to £18bn a year, by reducing the prices charged for electricity generated from sources other than gas. Energy UK, the trade body for the sector, said its proposals could cut £18bn a year from energy bills, including £11bn for businesses. This could deliver a saving for households of between £150 and £250 a year. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is understood to have met members of Energy UK to discuss the proposal and is said to be considering it seriously as an option to present to the next prime minister. The Conservative party will announce the result of a vote for its new leader on Monday, with Liz Truss widely expected to win the mandate. The voluntary scheme would work by separating the cost of electricity from sources such as nuclear, solar and windfarms from the sky-high prices being paid for electricity generated by burning gas in power stations. Gas prices have more than tripled since Russia began reducing the volumes pumped into Europe in the months before its invasion of Ukraine. At the moment, the way electricity auctions are designed means the price of all electricity is closely pegged to the price of gas. Under the proposals – first suggested by the UK Energy Research Centre – nuclear power stations and renewable electricity generators would be encouraged to sign up to a new type of contract. These contracts for difference (CfDs) would mean selling their electricity at a lower price, but one that was fixed and guaranteed over a number of years. Many older nuclear, solar and wind generators are on renewable obligation (RO) contracts, under which they sell at the current wholesale rate. The market structure has led to those on RO contracts benefiting from higher prices, potentially making windfall profits. Energy UK is urging ministers to make it possible for RO contracts to be exchanged for CfDs. Adam Berman, Energy UK’s deputy director, said: “The current energy market doesn’t allow customers to fully benefit from the cheapest form of electricity – domestically produced low-carbon generation. “This scheme would be a significant first step to decoupling gas from retail electricity prices. “Removing the link between gas and retail electricity prices will be complex and take time, but this solution provides a quick fix for up to 40% of our generation capacity.” The energy industry regulator, Ofgem, is also looking to reform the market in the long term to delink the price of electricity from gas. Several European countries are considering a similar move. The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, said on Thursday the Treasury was examining several options to help consumers this winter. This could also include the Bank of England providing support to energy suppliers for hedging costs, which could allow consumer bills to be reduced. The energy supplier Ovo has put forward an alternative solution which would involve reducing the price of energy for domestic users, but only for a limited amount of units per household. Energy consumption beyond that level would be charged at a higher price. Why is the price of electricity pegged to gas? Typically, electricity prices reflect gas prices. This is because the types of energy needed to produce electricity for the UK are ranked, with renewables and nuclear prioritised ahead of coal and gas. The price of electricity is set every half hour by the margin cost of the last generating unit to be switched off to meet demand, typically gas. This pushes up electricity prices when wholesale gas prices rise. What is an energy contract for difference? Under these contracts, electricity plants are paid a flat rate for what they produce over 15 years. That rate is the difference between the “strike price” – an agreed price which reflects the investment in green technology – and the “reference price”, which is a reflection of the wholesale market price for electricity in the UK. If the market price is higher than the strike price, the Low Carbon Contracts Company, which is wholly owned by the government, ensures these savings are passed on to consumer bills. If the market price is lower, the LCCC makes up the shortfall. The government uses this system, introduced in 2017, to support the development of low-carbon electricity generation projects with high upfront costs and long lifetimes to protect developers from volatile wholesale prices. However, only about 15% of the total fleet of renewable power projects have a CfD; most are remunerated through the older Renewables Obligation Certificate payments. What are renewables obligation certificates? Under the renewables obligation model, designed for wind and solar, power generators receive the value of their electricity on the wholesale market, as well as an additional subsidy. Therefore, generators on these contracts have benefited from the soaring gas prices so far this year. • This article was amended on 1 September 2022.

Here’s where we stand: A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. The drone attack came a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. For Kyiv the strike represented an unprecedented operation to disrupt the Kremlin strategy of trying to cripple the Ukrainian electrical grid to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe in a country on the verge of winter. Shelling by Ukrainian forces killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city on Tuesday, according to the Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin. The head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling had killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council, Maria Pirogova. Russian and Ukrainian authorities confirmed the exchange of 120 people in a prisoner swap. According to the Russian defence ministry, 60 servicemen were returned from “Kyiv-controlled territory”. Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, said Andrii Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, said. Ukraine’s health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts. In a statement, the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. The Kremlins spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”. A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said that Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, as a result of diplomatic pressure and Iran’s own internal political turmoil. Mikhailo Podolyak told the Guardian that Russian forces currently had enough of its own cruise missiles in its stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure like the salvo fired on Monday. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, told the Guardian he had been unable to leave Donetsk after spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine because he did not have any identity papers. Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds. Earlier Viktor Orbán’s government was accused of “holding hostage” funds for Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungary confirmed on Tuesday that it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage in separate disputes over Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds. Ukrainian embassies have received more “bloody packages”, according to its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had been targeted with packages soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. Latvia has revoked a broadcast licence for TV Rain, the independent Russian TV station broadcasting from exile, following a scandal over its coverage of the war in Ukraine. The channel had been charged with failing to provide Latvian subtitles in its coverage and for having displayed a map that showed Crimea, the peninsula occupied by Russian forces in 2014, as part of Russia. The European Commission is reportedly considering a ban on new investments in Russia’s mining sector as part of a fresh package of sanctions against Moscow, aimed at further eroding the Kremlin’s ability to fund its war against Ukraine. Sources have told the Financial Times that the mining investment ban is part of a ninth EU sanctions package, which officials aim to discuss with member states and have agreed by the end of next week. If approved, the ban, which the paper writes will exempt some specific products, would mark the first time Brussels has directly targeted Russia’s metals sector. The FT said the new sanctions package could also include export controls on civilian technologies that Brussels believes Russia is using to support its arms factories, a ban on transactions with three more Russian banks, and targeted sanctions against another 180 individuals. Ukraine’s health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts as a result of Russian missile strikes targeting the country’s critical infrastructure. In a statement, the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where people have been marking the country’s Army Day today. Earlier we reported that the chair of Latvia’s broadcasting regulator, Ivars Abolins, said it had cancelled the licence of the exiled Russian independent television station, TV Rain, “in connection with the threat to the national security and public order”. TV Rain, or Dozhd in Russian, moved to broadcasting from Latvia in July, when it was forced to shut its Moscow studio after accusations by Russia’s communications watchdog that it was spreading “deliberately false information about the actions of Russian military personnel” in Ukraine. The station was earlier this month fined €10,000 by the Latvian regulator for displaying a map of Russia which included the occupied Crimea peninsula. It was also forced to apologise to viewers and fired a presenter, Alexei Korostelyov, on Friday for comments he made on air, after he said he hoped that the station’s efforts would help provide Russian soldiers with basic equipment and amenities. The network, which was founded in 2010 as the main opposition channel in Russia, has also been accused of failing to ensure Latvian language translation, local media reported. Abolins told reporters today that Latvia’s counterintelligence and internal security service had informed his office that the station represented a threat to the country’s security. TV Rain dismissed the accusations as “unfair and absurd” and said its programmes could still be seen on YouTube, which is where most of its audience watches its content. Its founder, Natalya Sindeeva, posted a video this afternoon describing Korostelyov’s firing as “the worst thing we could have done in that situation”. The move comes as Latvia faces a growing rift between the country’s Latvian majority and its Russian-speaking minority. A quarter of the population of two million in Latvia are Russian speakers. The charity Reporters without Borders called the move a “serious blow to freedom of information”. Several other Russian newsrooms have also found refuge in the Latvian capital, including Novaya Gazeta Europe and Deutsche Welle’s Moscow branch. The city has also hosted independent news website Meduza since 2014. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the move showed foreign states were no freer than Russia. He told reporters today: Some always think that elsewhere is better than home. And some always think that freedom is elsewhere and there is no freedom at home. This is one of the clearest examples that demonstrate the fallacy of such illusions. Moldova’s prime minister, Natalia Gavrilița, has pledged to boost cooperation between her country and Ukraine during a visit to the towns of Bucha and Irpin. In a series of tweets, Gavrilița said justice would be carried out for “the innocent victims that died, were tortured and hurt during this cruel and unjust war unleashed by Russia”. She added: Ukraine is fighting for us all – for the freedom of the entire European continent. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, tweeted about his meeting with his Moldovan counterpart, saying that the pair had agreed to cooperate in air defence, energy and customer control. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said.

The power deficit caused by the latest wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine will be significantly reduced by Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in televised comments. Missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday destroyed homes and knocked out power in some areas. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday.

Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds. Earlier Viktor Orbán’s government was accused of “holding hostage” funds for Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungary confirmed on Tuesday that it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage in separate disputes over Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds. Ukrainian embassies have received more “bloody packages”, according to its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had been targeted with packages soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. The Russian state-owned bank VTB said it was hit by an “unprecedented cyber-attack from abroad”, which it said was the largest cyber-attack in its history. In a statement, it said it was repelling the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, and that an analysis indicated it was a “planned and large-scale” attack. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, was detained on 10 June by Russian occupying forces in the Ukrainian city of Kherson, where he had been living for more than three years. After spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine, he told the Guardian on Monday that he had been released by the Moscow-backed Donetsk separatists on 28 October. Murekezi said he had been unable to leave Donetsk because he did not have any identity papers. In a phone interview from the city of Donetsk, the capital of the Russian-annexed Donetsk region, Murekezi said: I am very happy to be free. But I don’t know what to do next. The Russians never gave me back my passport, and I feel trapped here. Murekezi spent most of his time in two different jails with a group of international foreign fighters, including the British nationals Aiden Aslin, John Harding, Andrew Hill and Dylan Healy, who returned to the UK after a prisoner swap in September. But unlike the foreign fighters, Murekezi and his close friends and relatives said he did not participate in any fighting in Ukraine, to where he moved about four years ago, eventually settling in Kherson. “It became clear early on to the Russian authorities that I had nothing to do with the fighting, but they just kept me in jail anyway,” he said. Read the full story here: The Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin, said shelling by Kyiv’s forces had killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city today. Kulemzin wrote on social media: Preliminary data shows that today six civilians were killed as a result of shelling in Donetsk, the number of wounded is being specified. Separately, the head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling had killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council. Maria Pirogova, who Pushilin said had been involved in the separatist movement since 2014, was “the epitome of kindness” whose life was ended “in its prime”, according to a tribute he wrote on his Telegram account. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. A $60 (£50) a barrel ceiling on purchases of Russian oil came into force on Monday. Companies in the EU, the UK, US, Canada and Japan as well as Australia are banned from providing services enabling maritime transport, such as insurance, in cases where the price cap has been breached. The G7 nations – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and US – provide insurance services for 90% of the world’s cargo while Greece, an EU member state, is a major player in the shipping industry. The cap is aimed at maintaining the flow of oil to countries such as China, India, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, which have not banned Russian oil imports, while maintaining economic pressure on the Kremlin. A traffic jam of oil tankers built up in Turkish waters on Monday as Turkey’s government demanded proof of insurance cover. Read the full story here: Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds. The European Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters that the EU must keep its promises to Ukraine. He said: Ukraine is a country at war. It desperately needs our support and we just cannot allow one member state to derail or delay this financial support. Earlier Viktor Orbán’s government was accused of “holding hostage” funds for Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungary confirmed on Tuesday that it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The EU has promised to underwrite €18bn in cheap loans to Kyiv to keep Ukraine’s government afloat in 2023. The EU’s 26 other member states will now study how to move ahead without Hungary, although hope Budapest can be persuaded to change its mind. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage in separate disputes over Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds. Hungary, which has angered other member states with its sharp criticism of EU sanctions against Russia, may now find it harder to unlock EU funds. The Czech finance minister, Zbyněk Stanjura, who chaired the meeting, said Budapest’s decision on €18bn for Ukraine would be considered alongside EU member state approval of Hungary’s coronavirus recovery plan. He added: The money will go to Ukraine: either it will be 27 or 26 member states that take part. We have to be able to send the money to Ukraine. The Green MEP Daniel Freund, a persistent critic of Hungary’s government, accused Orbán of abusing the veto like no one ever before. He said: He even takes funds for Ukrainian hospitals hostage for this … The EU will find ways to support Ukraine even without Hungary. But that means: more time, more effort, more costs. Viktor Orbán could not have given Putin a nicer present today. The centre-right Romanian MEP Siegfried Mureşan said the Hungarian veto was disappointing, adding: It is hard to regard this as anything other than cynical obstructionism. An American national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in July has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, was detained on 10 June by Russian occupying forces in the Ukrainian city of Kherson, where he had been living for more than three years. After spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine, he told the Guardian on Monday that he had been released by the Moscow-backed Donetsk separatists on 28 October. Murekezi said he had been unable to leave Donetsk because he does not have any identity papers. A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said that Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, as a result of diplomatic pressure and Iran’s own internal political turmoil. Mikhailo Podolyak told the Guardian that Russian forces currently had enough of its own cruise missiles in its stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure like the salvo fired on Monday. Russia has sought to replenish its arsenal with an offer to buy Iranian missiles. The secretary of the security council, Nikolai Patrushev, visited Tehran in November and was reported to have had missiles on his shopping list. But Podolyak said the deal had not gone through yet. “Iran has come under huge diplomatic pressure and the protests have also raised pressure on the government,” he told the Guardian in his Kyiv office. “The government is starting to lose its grip on Iranian society and their inner domestic problems are growing. That’s why they just don’t have time for dealing with Russia. It’s not their priority.” Podolyak said he believed talks were still under way between Moscow and Tehran on missiles, and that as part of its bargaining position the Russian government had offered its own “cut-throats”, referring to experts in crushing dissent, to suppress the nationwide anti-government protests. “So the negotiations are ongoing, but as of today, no missiles have been transferred to Russia,” he said. Podolyak said Ukrainian forces had become adept at defending against Russian missile attacks, claiming to have shot down an estimated 60 of 70 missiles fired on Monday. He said the country, with foreign help, was also working towards making its power grid more resilient, redesigning it to make it easier for one region with access to power to help another that had been cut off. Podolyak, a close aide to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was also fiercely critical of remarks from Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, in which the French president suggested the west should offer Vladimir Putin security guarantees if he agreed to peace negotiations. “It’s quite weird when you’re not trying to help the victim – and it’s very clear who’s the victim here – but you’re thinking of how to satisfy the murderer,” he said. Russia ran out of Iranian-made drones between two and three weeks ago and is now “anticipating a resupply”, according to western officials. My colleague Dan Sabbagh quotes officials as saying that there are still no signs that Iran has been supplying missiles to Russia. Iran has acknowledged that it had given Russia drones, but said they were sent before the war in Ukraine broke out. The Guardian has seen evidence that at least some of the Iranian-made drones used by Russia in its war were probably supplied after Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February. Hungary has vetoed an €18bn aid package for Ukraine, forcing the European Commission and EU countries to seek an alternative way to ensure aid can keep flowing to Kyiv in the new year. The move by the Hungarian government has widely been seen as a way for its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to use his approval for Ukraine aid as leverage to secure his country’s share of EU recovery funds. The EU has sought to hold back some funds destined for Budapest because of rule-of-law breaches. The commission will now look at how to “provide the necessary solution to Ukraine already as of January”, the EU’s budget commissioner, Johannes Hahn, said during a public session of the bloc’s finance ministers. Today’s Hungarian veto means decisions on other files on the finance ministers’ agenda – including a minimum corporate tax rate (which Budapest is also blocking), the Hungarian recovery plan and connected €5.8bn in grants, and the decision to freeze €7.5bn of EU funds for Hungary over corruption issues – were also postponed. The Czech finance minister, Zbyněk Stanjura, said: We were not able to adopt the package as a whole but we will not be discouraged. Our ambition remains that we will start disbursements to Ukraine in January. He asked the council to work on “a solution supported by 26 member states”, which would get around Hungary’s veto. The EU’s 27 nations have until 19 December to make a decision. Ukrainian embassies have received more “bloody packages”, according to its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had been targeted with packages soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. Kuleba said Ukraine’s embassies in Romania and Denmark received such packages today. As of Friday, Ukraine said 17 embassies had been targeted, indicating that another was delivered on Saturday. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said the packages had been delivered to its embassies in Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Croatia and Italy, to general consulates in Naples and Kraków, and the consulate in Brno in the Czech Republic. On Monday, Spanish police said they had intercepted three more envelopes containing animal eyes addressed to Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid and its consulates in Barcelona and Málaga. A Ukrainian embassy employee in Madrid was injured on Wednesday by a letter bomb, which was addressed to Ukraine’s ambassador to Spain. A further four letter bombs were sent on Wednesday to addresses in Spain, including to a Spanish arms manufacturer that has produced rockets donated to Ukraine, as well as Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the US embassy in Madrid. In an interview with CNN on Friday, Kuleba described what followed the Madrid attack as “more weird” and “even sick”. Asked who he thought was behind the packages, Kuleba said he “feels tempted to name Russia” as it benefits from sowing fear among Ukrainian diplomats. But he added that it could also be someone who sympathises with Russia, so he would await the findings of ongoing investigations. A drone attack set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, western Russia, 175 miles from the Ukrainian border. The governor of the region, Roman Starovoyt, said there had been no casualties and that the fire was “localised”. On Monday, Ukraine appeared to launch drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. Kyiv has not directly taken responsibility for the attacks, but a senior Ukrainian official told the New York Times the drones involved on Monday were launched from Ukrainian territory. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has confirmed that Moscow and Kyiv exchanged 60 prisoners of war in the latest series of swaps. Among those who were returned to Ukraine included dozens who had defended the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the port city of Mariupol, he said. The Russian state-owned bank VTB said it was hit by an “unprecedented cyber-attack from abroad”, which it said was the largest cyber-attack in its history. In a statement, it said it was repelling the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, and warned of temporary difficulties in accessing its mobile app and website. The statement reads: The bank’s technological infrastructure is under an unprecedented cyber attack from abroad. The largest not only this year, but in the whole time the bank has operated. It added: An analysis of the DDoS attack indicates that it was planned and large-scale, and its purpose has been to interfere with the operations of banking services, VTB indicates. The majority of requests for bank services during the attack have generated from foreign segments of the internet, though there has also been malicious traffic from Russian IP addresses. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been visiting troops close to the frontline in the eastern Donbas region. Zelenskiy was pictured meeting soldiers and handing out awards to mark Ukraine’s armed forces day. In a Telegram post, the president thanked troops for their “resilience and strength”, describing them as “an outpost of Ukraine’s independence”. He added: I believe that next time we will meet in our Ukrainian Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia and Ukraine are set to exchange 60 soldiers each in a prisoner swap today, according to Russian officials. Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), wrote on Telegram: Another 60-60 exchange with Kyiv is taking place today. Shamsail Saraliev, deputy of the Russian state duma, wrote on his Telegram account: The Russian Ministry of Defence is conducting another exchange of prisoners of war today. Sixty Russian servicemen are returning home. The Russian defence ministry said it had returned 60 soldiers “who were in mortal danger”. My colleague Isobel Koshiw shares a video originally posted by the mayor of Bakhmut, Oleksii Reva, showing the extent of destruction in the key eastern Ukraine town. Russian opposition politicians are appealing to President Vladimir Putin to issue a decree to end the “partial mobilisation” that has seen hundreds of thousands of men called up to fight in Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry announced in October the end to the military mobilisation order that Putin declared the previous month, but legal activists and media noted that only the Russian leader had the authority to end the mobilisation. The Kremlin said Putin would not sign any order, in effect allowing for future waves of mobilisation. The absence of a formal decree to cancel the mobilisation meant those already drafted could not leave the armed forces, according to Emilia Slabunova, an opposition councillor in Karelia in northern Russia. Military lawyers told Reuters that there were at least two cases where commanders refused to discharge servicemen. Slabunova said appeals against these refusals led nowhere, with courts siding with the commanders. She said: We, as councillors, represent our constituents and these appeals from us are the result of numerous appeals from citizens. Similar appeals were seen from opposition deputies in the Moscow, St Petersburg, Pskov and Veliky Novgorod regions, Reuters reports. All are members of the liberal opposition Yabloko party. The appeals said the lack of a decree “creates legal uncertainty” and “allows military commanders to deny citizens their discharge from service”. Speaking to reporters during his regular briefing, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal yesterday, Blinken said President Vladimir Putin “started this war; he could end it tomorrow” and that there was “always an off-ramp” to end the war in Ukraine. He said: President Zelenskiy has said, we’ve said, others have said, that at some point this will end and it will end almost certainly with diplomacy, with a negotiation. But what I think we have to see is a just and durable peace, not a phony peace. And by that, I mean this: if Russia doesn’t succeed in its current gambit of trying to, in effect, get the Ukrainian people to throw up their hands – and again, they won’t succeed. In response to Blinken’s comments, Peskov said: That the outcome should be a just and durable peace – one can agree with this. But as for the prospects for some sort of negotiations, we do not see any at the moment. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”. Peskov was also asked about reports that Russia is set to launch a new wave of mobilisation of men to fight in Ukraine. As the BBC’s Will Vernon notes, the Kremlin spokesperson did not deny the reports. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here, taking over the live blog from Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest from Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s news so far: A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor has said, a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, said on the Telegram messaging app there were no casualties from the attack and the fire was “localised”. The power deficit caused by the latest wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine will be significantly reduced by Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in televised comments. Missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday destroyed homes and knocked out power in some areas. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv, Reuters reported. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. The oil price rebounded on Tuesday after plunging by more than 3% in the previous session, as the implementation of sanctions on Russian seaborne crude oil eased concerns about oversupply, Reuters reports. The Group of Seven set a top price of $60 a barrel on Russian crude, aiming to limit Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine, but Russia has said it will not abide by the measure even if it has to cut production. At least four people were killed on Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, amid Russian strikes during which 60 of 70 missiles were shot down. The strikes targeted Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, the air force said. Energy workers had already begun work on restoring power, said Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. Officials said airstrikes destroyed homes in the south, knocked out power in the north and killed at least two people. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukrainian drones attacked two airbases at Ryazan and Saratov in south-central Russia, killing three servicemen and wounding four, with two aircraft damaged. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for what would represent the deepest strikes inside the Russian heartland since Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Spanish police intercepted three more envelopes containing animal eyes addressed to Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid and its consulates in Barcelona and Málaga, police sources close to the investigation said. Last week, Ukraine said a series of “bloody packages” were sent to its missions across Europe, soon after a letter bomb detonated at Ukraine’s embassy in Spain and police defused others sent to, among others, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. Canadian-made parts were found in “kamikaze” Iranian drones used by Russia to attack Ukraine, according to an investigative project from the NGO Statewatch. It said components from 30 European and American companies, including antenna parts from Tallysman Wireless, a Canadian manufacturer, were used in Shahed 136 drones. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for the time being. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv, Reuters reported. Ukraine denies shelling the facility, which has been under the control of Russian forces since the first days of the war, and has accused Russia of firing on it. “Our units are taking all measures to ensure the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,” Shoigu told his military chiefs in a conference call, an abridged transcript of which was published by the defence ministry. “In turn, the Kyiv regime seeks to create the appearance of a threat of a nuclear catastrophe by continuing to deliberately shell the site,” he added. Shoigu said Ukraine had fired 33 large-caliber shells at the plant in the last two weeks. Most had been intercepted by Russian air defences, he said, though “some still hit objects that affect the safe operation of the nuclear power plant”. “We classify these attacks by Ukrainian troops as nuclear terrorism,” he added. Reuters was unable to independently verify the claims. Both Moscow and Kyiv blame each other for attacks on the facility. Kyiv has also accused Moscow of using the plant as a de facto weapons depot. A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor has said, a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, said on the Telegram messaging app there were no casualties from the attack and the fire was “localised”. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. At daybreak a large column of black smoke was still visible above the site. The power deficit caused by the latest wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine will be significantly reduced by Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in televised comments. Missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday destroyed homes and knocked out power in some areas. Ever since Russia launched its brutal war in Ukraine the Kremlin has banked on American conservative political and media allies to weaken US support for Ukraine and deployed disinformation operations to falsify the horrors of the war for both US and Russian audiences, say disinformation experts. Some of the Kremlin’s most blatant falsehoods about the war aimed at undercutting US aid for Ukraine have been promoted by major figures on the American right, from Holocaust denier and white supremacist Nick Fuentes to ex-Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Fox News star Tucker Carlson, whose audience of millions is deemed especially helpful to Russian objectives. On a more political track, House Republican Freedom Caucus members such as Paul Gosar, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Scott Perry – who in May voted with 54 other Republican members against a $40bn aid package for Ukraine, and have raised other concerns about the war – have proved useful, though perhaps unwitting, Kremlin allies at times. Pro-Moscow video materials from the network RT (formerly Russia Today), which early this year shuttered its US operations, have been featured on Rumble, a video sharing platform popular with conservatives that last year received major financing from a venture capital firm co-founded by recently elected Republican Ohio senator JD Vance and backed by billionaire Peter Thiel. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. Israeli satellite imaging company ImageSat International shared images it said showed burn marks and objects near a Tu-22M aircraft at the Dyagilevo airbase in Russia. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. The Russian Bastion systems, which have missiles with a flight range of up to 310 miles, were deployed on the island of Paramushir, the Russian defence ministry said on Monday. “Coastal servicemen of the Pacific fleet will keep a round-the-clock watch to control the adjacent water area and strait zones,” it said. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, told a Tuesday news conference that the government will closely monitor the Russian military activity, adding it has been intensifying in the far east regions in tandem with Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls the invasion a “special operation”. Ukraine is working to restore power after Russia’s latest wave of missile strikes on Monday caused power disruptions across the country, as winter frost builds and temperatures plunge, AFP reports. Out of the 70 missiles launched by Moscow, most were shot down, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, but the barrage still hit Ukraine’s already battered infrastructure. Fresh power cuts were announced in all regions “due to the consequences of shelling”, national electricity provider Ukrenergo said on Telegram. The head of Ukrenergo said he had “no doubt that Russian military consulted with Russian power engineers during this attack”, judging by where the missiles landed. “The time that Russians chose for this attack was connected with their desire to inflict as much damage as possible,” Volodymyr Kudrytskyi told a Ukrainian news programme, explaining the attacks were launched as the country enters a “peak frost” period. “Our repairmen will be working on the energy system restoration.” The oil price rebounded on Tuesday after plunging by more than 3% in the previous session, as the implementation of sanctions on Russian seaborne crude oil eased concerns about oversupply, Reuters reports. The Group of Seven set a top price of $60 a barrel on Russian crude, aiming to limit Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine, but Russia has said it will not abide by the measure even if it has to cut production. The price cap, to be enforced by the G7 nations, the European Union and Australia, comes on top of the EU’s embargo on imports of Russian crude by sea and similar pledges by the United States, Canada, Japan and Britain. While the market weighs the impact of sanctions on Russian supply, it was also watching a traffic jam of oil tankers off the coast of Turkey on Monday, with Ankara insisting on new proof of insurance for all vessels. A researcher at the investigative news outlet Bellingcat has posted video showing smoke rising from Kursk, Russia, where Ukraine launched strikes damaging an oil storage tank, according to the local governor on Telegram. The Guardian could not independently verify the footage or report of an attack. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday, 6 December. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Below are the photographs originally posted by Starukh: Starovoyt did not specify where the drone originated. On Monday, Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine “attempted to strike” the Dyagilevo airfield in the Ryazan region and the Engels airfield in the Saratov region with “Soviet-made drones”. The drones were intercepted but debris fell and exploded on the airfields, the ministry added. It said that three soldiers had been killed and four others injured. The Guardian has not independently verified the report. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest news as it happens for the next few hours. A drone attack on an airfield in Russia’s Kursk region set fire to an oil storage tank, a local governor said on Tuesday. “There were no casualties. The fire is localized. All emergency services working at the site,” Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the region, said on the Telegram messaging app. Yesterday, Russia’s defence ministry said Ukrainian drones attacked two airbases at Ryazan and Saratov in south-central Russia, killing three servicemen and wounding four, with two aircraft damaged. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for what would represent the deepest strikes inside the Russian heartland since Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Meanwhile Russia launched strikes on Zaporizhzhia region overnight, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of the local military administration.

It said components from 30 European and American companies, including antenna parts from Tallysman Wireless, a Canadian manufacturer, were used in Shahed 136 drones. The White House has said the latest Russian strikes against Ukraine are a reminder of Vladimir Putin’s brutality. John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, also told reporters that an oil price cap would not have any long-term impact on global oil prices, Reuters reported. Moldovan police on Monday found fragments of a missile in a northern region near the border with Ukraine, state information portal Prima Sursa quoted the police as saying after Russia carried out missile strikes. Russia’s recent mobilisation increased its military threat in Ukraine, with better-trained soldiers arriving at the frontline, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces said. But Russia was using a lot of old equipment because it had no other way of replenishing supplies, and the Russians had made only slow progress around Bakhmut, one of the main battle zones in eastern Ukraine, Reuters reported. Vladimir Putin has driven across the Kerch Bridge linking Russia and the Crimean peninsula that was damaged by a truck bomb in October. The Russian president spoke to workers and a senior government official, Reuters reported. India gave a list of its products to Moscow for access to Russian markets, foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said, as his country seeks to narrow a growing trade deficit with Russia at a time when Moscow faces acute shortages of some crucial materials after western sanctions. The Kremlin has warned the new western price cap on Russian oil will destabilise global energy markets, but claimed it would not affect its invasion of Ukraine. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was preparing its response to the move by the G7 and allies. The Chinese foreign ministry has said it will continue energy cooperation with Russia after the G7, EU and Australia imposed the price cap.

Ovo, which had taken on his supply after acquiring SSE’s retail arm, was proposing to increase his monthly direct debit from £102 to £168. Wilson* had built up £500 in credit, and had even reduced his direct debits previously as his regular payments were overshooting consumption. “This is the most outrageous and terrifyingly abusive email,” he wrote to Ovo. “How can I need to get back on track when I am not off track, never have been, and am not likely to leave the rails? This is bullying.” Wilson was not the only one to receive a nasty shock this winter, as some companies sought to increase customer direct debit payments – even for those who had built up healthy credit balances. It emerged last week that while Britons were sat indoors in woolly hats with the heating off to save on bills, suppliers had hoarded an estimated £9bn of customer cash by November last year, more than four times previous calculations. In Wilson’s case, Ovo later said readings passed on by SSE were wrong, apologised, and offered to reduce his direct debit payments. Typically energy customers on direct debits will build up credit during summer, when usage is low, and suppliers will run that down over the pricey winter months. However, the surge in wholesale gas prices, which began in 2021, has tested existing norms and exposed some of the cascade of suppliers that went bust while using customer money to fund their business. An industry row over whether customer deposits should be ringfenced ensued. Ofgem accused suppliers of using customers “like an interest-free company credit card” but later stopped short of ordering full ringfencing. Now – with energy suppliers already in the crosshairs over their treatment of often-vulnerable prepayment customers – there are fears this situation could be repeated as energy rationing and high prices play havoc with billing. The Guardian asked Britain’s biggest energy suppliers how they were treating customer credit balances. Centrica (British Gas) Total residential customers: 7.3 million Direct debit customers: About 3.75 million Centrica, which has been most vociferous in calling for ringfencing, said it has about £400m in customer deposits held in a separate account, holding about £130 per customer. The company’s division supplying household energy is expected to make a loss in the second half of its financial year, but a surge in wholesale gas prices has led the group to upgrade profit expectations three times as its finances are boosted by soaring wholesale gas prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “The real question is whether customers can be repaid [their credit balances] on demand. We can, as this money is not being used for working capital. It is only used to buy energy,” a spokesperson said. Chief executive Chris O’Shea has also expressed concerns that suppliers are being paid government money upfront to cut bills, risking going bust while holding taxpayer cash. O’Shea was under pressure this week after it was alleged that agents working on behalf of British Gas had broken into homes to fit prepayment meters when there were signs that young children and people with disabilities lived in the properties. Eon Total customers: 5.6 million Direct debit customers: About 2 million Eon expressed dismay at Ofgem’s decision not to ringfence customer credit balances after the failure of about 30 energy suppliers, which ultimately cost customers billions. The supplier, which took overNpower’s retail arm in 2019, has called for a social tariff to prevent vulnerable customers from paying high energy bills. Eon declined to give an average customer credit balance or say how much in customer credit it held. Chief executive Michael Lewis told the Guardian: “Ofgem’s own report says companies were allowed to enter this market on a ‘free bet’, with the cost ultimately getting picked up by customers around the country. “Our view is that this ‘free bet’ has to end. It can’t be acceptable that new suppliers are allowed to gamble with customers’ money, which is why we’re disappointed Ofgem has changed its mind on ringfencing credit balances.” Ovo Energy Total customers: Nearly 5 million Direct debit customers: Undisclosed At the start of the pandemic, Ovo received an £8.9m fine from Ofgem for communications and billing issues. The regulator found inaccurate annual statements were sent to more than 500,000 customers over a period of three years and Ovo underestimated consumption over one winter, meaning customers were under or overcharged. More recently, customers have reported issues with their Ovo bills, including one who was told she owed £44,800 for two months’ supply to her one-bedroom flat. The supplier is understood to have argued against ringfencing customer money. Ovo declined to give an average customer credit balance, say how much in customer credit it held or comment for this article. EDF Total customers: 5.2 million Direct debit customers: About 2 million The energy supplier, which is owned by the French state and runs Britain’s nuclear power stations, said all of its customers are in credit and debit to it at different points in the year, depending on usage. It is understood EDF held typically held about £300m of residential customer credit during 2021, but was owed more than £1bn by customers through the year on average. EDF said it is “supportive” of Ofgem’s efforts to improve the financial resilience of energy suppliers. A spokesperson said: “We don’t use credit balances to fund our business growth. We support targeted, risk-based measures that ensure suppliers are financially responsible and protect customers.” EDF said it reviews each account twice a year to assess the risk of getting into debt or building up too much credit based on their usage and prices in the market. EDF declined to give an average customer credit balance. Octopus Energy Total customers: 3.4 million (“almost all” direct debit customers) Octopus vehemently opposed the proposition to ringfence customer deposits. It has argued it instead favours an insurance policy for credit balances, comparable with the kind provided by holidaymakers through the ATOL scheme, as this would provide the same level of protection but cost five to 10 times less than ringfencing credit balances. The supplier stated that it “does not use customer credit balances to fund its business operations” and said that, for nine months of the year, customers owe the firm more money than is owed to them. Octopus said “whilst our customer credit balances were £660m at the end of November, at the same time our customers owed us £510m for energy they had used and not yet paid for” – meaning it held £150m in the month at which credit balances are their highest, at the start of winter. On average, it held £44 per customer. The company, which also owns Bulb, said it has used the £1bn of funding it has raised from investors, including Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management to invest and grow. ScottishPower Total customers: Nearly 5 million Direct debit customers: About 3 million The Glasgow-based supplier, which is owned by Spain’s Iberdrola, reviews customer accounts every three months. It said its customers “see the benefit of spreading the cost of their energy over the year” to protect against high winter bills. The company’s chief executive, Keith Anderson, has been vocal during the energy crisis, with concerns over the number of Britons falling into fuel poverty. “As the UK’s only integrated electricity company, investing £10bn in the UK by 2025, ScottishPower does not rely on credit balances for working capital,” a spokesperson said. ScottishPower declined to give an average customer credit balance or say how much in customer credit it held. Christine Farnish, a former Ofgem board member, has said that “firms are collecting more than they absolutely need”. Darren Jones, chairman of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee which studied ringfencing, says: “On first look, it makes sense to ringfence customer balances because it’s customers’ money and a few companies that went bust last year had such bad practice relying on spending other people’s money that they didn’t run their business well enough, and walked away with millions of customers money. “But, in reality, if you do ringfence it gives an advantage to larger listed players over privately owned and smaller companies because they can draw down capital more cheaply, which would result in higher prices for customers with smaller companies.” Ofgem suggests consumers who believe suppliers have amassed too much of their money contact the firm to ask for their money back. Last July, Ofgem accused five suppliers of “moderate or severe” weaknesses in the way they charge customers direct debits. It ordered suppliers that had increased direct debits by more than 100% to review them, affecting more than 500,000 customers. With consumers rationing their energy use, predicting and calculating bills has become difficult for suppliers. With bills expected to remain much higher than historical averages for some time, that situation is unlikely to let up. *Name has been changed"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/06/us-conservatives-pushing-russian-spin-ukraine-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-06T09:00:06Z","webTitle":"Top US conservatives pushing Russia’s spin on Ukraine war, experts say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/us-conservatives-pushing-russian-spin-ukraine-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/06/us-conservatives-pushing-russian-spin-ukraine-war","fields":{"headline":"Top US conservatives pushing Russia’s spin on Ukraine war, experts say","bodyText":"Ever since Russia launched its brutal war in Ukraine the Kremlin has banked on American conservative political and media allies to weaken US support for Ukraine and deployed disinformation operations to falsify the horrors of the war for both US and Russian audiences, say disinformation experts. Some of the Kremlin’s most blatant falsehoods about the war aimed at undercutting US aid for Ukraine have been promoted by major figures on the American right, from Holocaust denier and white supremacist Nick Fuentes to ex-Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Fox News star Tucker Carlson, whose audience of millions is deemed especially helpful to Russian objectives. On a more political track, House Republican Freedom Caucus members such as Paul Gosar, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Scott Perry – who in May voted with 54 other Republican members against a $40bn aid package for Ukraine, and have raised other concerns about the war – have proved useful, though perhaps unwitting, Kremlin allies at times. Pro-Moscow video materials from the network RT (formerly Russia Today), which early this year shuttered its US operations, have been featured on Rumble, a video sharing platform popular with conservatives that last year received major financing from a venture capital firm co-founded by recently elected Republican Ohio senator JD Vance and backed by billionaire Peter Thiel. As Republicans will control the House in 2023, the influence of these Ukraine aid critics in Congress and Moscow-friendly media on the right led by Carlson is expected to increase. But analysts say they’re unlikely to block a Biden administration request to Congress in mid-November for over $37bn in emergency aid for Ukraine, although they may try to pare it back. Republican House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, who looks poised to become speaker in January, threatened pre-election that if the GOP won the majority, it wouldn’t back a “blank check” for Ukraine. There are signs that the conservative wing of the Republican party and its media allies are already ratcheting up their criticism of US backing for Ukraine. For instance, Perry, the chair of the rightwing Freedom Caucus, in October floated the idea of Republicans using their anticipated control of the House to investigate the Biden administration’s efforts and policies involving Ukraine-Russia peace talks. Moscow’s political friends on the far right have also become more vocal in pushing falsehoods and have hosted some Freedom Caucus members to showcase their influence. Fuentes infamously dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last month despite his long record of cozying up to Russian president Vladimir Putin and his antisemitic and white supremacist remarks. Back in March, Fuentes said on his podcast: “We continue to support czar Putin in the war effort.” Fuentes also falsely claimed the Russian war in Ukraine was “not aggression” and its goals were “not unreasonable”, repeating the Kremlin line that Moscow is trying to denazify Ukraine. In a similar, albeit somewhat less inflammatory vein, Carlson’s pro-Moscow spin and distortions about the war have been palpable since the start and seem to have increased in recent months. Russian media often rebroadcasts the Fox News host’s comments and praises Carlson. “We’ve entered a new phase, one in which the United States is directly at war with the largest nuclear power in the world,” Carlson with considerable hyperbolic license warned his audience in late September. Disinformation experts note that in the run-up to the US midterm elections, conservative media stars such as Carlson, as well as Greene and other far-right members of Congress, became more vocal about blocking Ukraine assistance, and calling for audits of American assistance. “Marjorie Taylor Green’s introduction of a resolution to audit aid to Ukraine is entirely unsurprising given the pervasively negative messaging about Ukraine coming from the right flank of the GOP over the past three months,” Bret Schafer, a senior fellow with the Alliance for Securing Democracy, said. Prior to the 8 November elections, he noted that “of the 100 most retweeted tweets about Ukraine posted by GOP candidates for the House since August, roughly 90% opposed continued support for Ukraine. Though much of that messaging plays to simple pocketbook concerns – essentially saying, ‘Why are we supporting Ukraine when Americans are struggling to pay their bills?’ – there is also a strain of anti-Ukrainian disinformation that colors some of their commentary.” Schafer added that “although most members of Congress support Ukraine, the loudest members do not, and their voices are dominating online spaces”. John Sipher, who served in the CIA’s national clandestine services for 28 years with a stint leading its Russia operations, said that Putin is using a playbook that he honed during his long career with the KGB to influence policy and Russian opinion. “I think Putin’s weakness is that he is not a strategic thinker but reverts to what he knows – using covert means to influence and undermine others,” Sipher said. “He cannot win on the battlefield so he uses threats and intimidations to influence and scare western leaders into backing down or pushing Ukraine to the negotiating table.” Sipher noted that historically Putin “has weaponized energy, information, refugees, food and nuclear threats to get his way. I think his nuclear threats are just a means to sow unease and dissension among supporters of Ukraine, and suspect that the discussion of a ‘dirty bomb’ is meant to signal to his domestic audience that Ukraine is a real threat, and the population should support Putin’s tough measures.” In the US the audiences receiving pro-Putin messages have been boosted by Rumble, the video sharing platform, which has featured RT content including an interview with two Americans captured in Ukraine who were badly beaten by Russians and later released, as the New York Times last month reported. One of the two American men in the video clip told his interviewer while he was in custody that he had been deceived to fight in Ukraine by “propaganda from the west” that reported that Russians soldiers were “indiscriminately killing civilians”. Megan Squire, a deputy director for data analytics with the Southern Poverty Law Center, noted that Rumble has also been busy recycling pro-Putin and anti-Ukraine material from multiple figures on the right. “Alt-tech platforms such as Rumble are actively peddling the anti-Ukraine talking points of their heavy users, many of whom have been deplatformed elsewhere,” Squire said. “A simple search for ‘Ukraine’ in Rumble today shows that the top search results are for a Steve Bannon video where he promotes Marjorie Taylor Greene’s demands for an audit of Ukrainian relief funds, and junk news site Post Millennial, which is using Rumble to promote clips from a similar story from Tucker Carlson.” But for overall influence with American audiences, veteran Russia experts say Carlson’s big Fox megaphone still dwarfs other propaganda tools favorable to Moscow. “The audience for Fox News commentators like Tucker Carlson, who frequently spreads pro-Russian narratives, is obviously orders of magnitude bigger than that of new niche players like Rumble that often carry Russian disinformation,” said Andrew Weiss, a vice-president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Such platforms are far more impactful than the more sneaky techniques that the Russian propaganda apparatus employs these days.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/04/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-254-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T10:47:52Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 254 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/04/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-254-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/04/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-254-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 254 of the invasion","bodyText":"G7 foreign ministers have agreed on the need for a coordination mechanism to help Ukraine repair, restore and defend its critical energy and water infrastructure, a senior US state department official has said. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on Friday that he had agreed with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that grain sent under the Black Sea export deal should go to poor African countries for free. “In my phone call with Vladimir Putin, he said ‘Let’s send this grain to countries such as Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan for free’ – and we agreed,” Erdogan said in a speech to businesspeople in Istanbul. German chancellor Olaf Scholz is visiting China, and while there has urged Putin to extend the Black Sea grain deal when it expires on 19 November. Dmitry Medvedev, long-term ally of Vladimir Putin, current deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, and previously both president and prime minister of Russia, has issued a broadside this morning claiming that Russia’s war has “a sacred purpose” and that “The goal is to stop the supreme ruler of hell, no matter what name he uses – Satan, Lucifer or Iblis.” The mayor of Kyiv, Vitaliy Klitschko, has said 450,000 residents in the Ukrainian capital are without electricity on Friday morning. “This is one and a half times more than in previous days,” he said, adding the power system is overloaded. The UN nuclear watchdog said Thursday it had found no sign of undeclared nuclear activity at three sites in Ukraine that it inspected at Kyiv’s request, in response to Russian allegations that work was being done on a “dirty bomb”. “Our technical and scientific evaluation of the results we have so far did not show any sign of undeclared nuclear activities and materials at these three locations,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement, adding that environmental samples taken would be analysed. In southern Ukraine, a Russian-installed occupation official said Wedensday Moscow was likely to pull its troops from the west bank of the Dnipro River, signalling a huge retreat that, if confirmed, could be a major turning point in the war. “Most likely our units, our soldiers, will leave for the left [eastern] bank,” said Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-installed deputy civilian administrator of the Kherson region, in an interview with Solovyov Live, a pro-Kremlin online media outlet. Ukraine said it was wary that Moscow could be setting a trap by feigning a pull-out from the Kherson region and maintained its forces were still fighting in the area. Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command, said it could be a Russian trap. “This could be a manifestation of a particular provocation, in order to create the impression that the settlements are abandoned, that it is safe to enter them, while they are preparing for street battles,” she said in televised comments. “We continue fighting, also in the Kherson direction, despite the fact that the enemy is trying to convince us that they are leaving the settlements and creating the effect of a total evacuation.” US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, said Thursday he believes that Ukrainian forces are able to retake Kherson, calling their work “methodical” and “effective”. Ukraine has described the forced relocation of its citizens in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as “deportations” and “war crimes”. Russian authorities in Kherson have been relocating civilians, claiming it is for their safety as Ukrainian forces move closer. One week after Russian authorities relocated 70,000 civilians from the right bank of the Dnipro River to the left bank, Russian authorities said they were moving 70,000 civilians from the left bank to be “temporarily resettled deep into the Kherson region, as well as to other regions of the Russian Federation,” citing “possible damage to the dam of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station”. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine has again been disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged the remaining high voltage lines, leaving it with just diesel generators, Ukraine nuclear firm Energoatom said Thursday. The plant, in Russian hands but operated by Ukrainian workers, has 15 days’ worth of fuel to run the generators, Energoatom said. Due to low morale and reluctance to fight, Russian forces have probably started deploying units threatening to shoot their own retreating soldiers, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. An intelligence report released early this morning described these Russian units as “barrier troops” or “blocking units” used to compel offensives. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has said that yesterday in Izium a 69-year-old man was blown up by a mine and hospitalised with moderate injuries. In a message on Telegram, he said that in the last day Ukrainian forces had neutralised “471 explosive objects” in the region. The Russian ambassador to the UK has claimed UK special forces were involved in a Ukrainian drone attack on Moscow’s Black Sea fleet. Andrei Kelin told Sky News: “We perfectly know about [the] participation of British specialists in [the] training, preparation and execution of violence against the Russian infrastructure and the Russian fleet in the Black Sea. We know that it has been done.” Kelin added: “This is a warning actually that Britain is too deep in this conflict. It means the situation is becoming more and more dangerous.” Another 107 Ukrainian service personnel were freed from Russian captivity in a prisoner of war swap, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed. “Many of them were wounded, and very seriously,” he said in his latest national address. Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered a one-time payment of 195,000 roubles (£2,800) for contract soldiers and those who have been mobilised to fight in Ukraine, the Kremlin said on Thursday. Last week Moscow said the “partial mobilisation” of 300,000 reservists was over but conceded there had been problems Volodymyr Zelenskiy has confirmed that he will not attend the G20 summit taking place in two weeks in Bali if Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation will be participating in the conference. US embassy officials in Russia visited jailed basketball star Brittney Griner on Thursday. The White House said officials were continuing to work toward a prisoner swap offer with Russia for the release of Griner – but elaborated no further on what that meant, or how soon that could take place."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jun/08/state-and-federal-energy-ministers-to-discuss-supply-issues-amid-soaring-power-costs","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-08T09:35:57Z","webTitle":"Bowen says ‘no silver bullet’ to lower prices as energy market operator given power to buy and store gas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/08/state-and-federal-energy-ministers-to-discuss-supply-issues-amid-soaring-power-costs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jun/08/state-and-federal-energy-ministers-to-discuss-supply-issues-amid-soaring-power-costs","fields":{"headline":"Bowen says ‘no silver bullet’ to lower prices as energy market operator given power to buy and store gas","bodyText":"Australian governments have agreed to set up a new gas storage reserve, proceed with plans to build up spare electricity capacity, and develop a national transition plan to reduce greenhouse gases. The changes were among 11 agreements reached during the first meeting of energy ministers since the election of the Albanese federal government. The gathering of state, territory and commonwealth ministers on Wednesday came about a week after a gas shortage in several states prompted the market operator to cap prices. A deep cold snap also helped send wholesale electricity prices soaring in the National Electricity Market. The video-linked meeting was described by participants as “very collegiate”, and “very different” from previous meetings held during the Morrison government. Among the priorities was an agreement to order the Australian Energy Market Operator to be begin work on buying and storing gas “for situations exactly like the ones we faced last week”, federal climate and energy minister Chris Bowen said. “Australians might be surprised to learn that that power did not exist, that [Aemo] could not procure some gas and keep it in reserve to be released for urgent and crisis situations,” Bowen said, adding it was technically possible with storage facilities “around the country”. No timetable was given, but Aemo had the power to act “expeditiously”. It won’t be immediate “but it will give us the capacity and the tools necessary to manage this crisis going forward, and to avoid crises like this into the future”, Bowen said. The Energy Security Board along with the Australian Energy Markets Commission were also asked to develop a brief “at pace” on plans for a so-called capacity market for the electricity supply in the eastern states. Western Australia has operated a similar back-up reserve of power generation capacity since 2006. “From opposition, I said that we supported the principle of a capacity mechanism provided it was consistent with net zero and encouraged new technology,” Bowen said, adding ministers had “endorsed effectively” that approach, a draft of which should be produced by regulators “within coming days”. In a nod to the new government’s emphasis of climate change, the ministers also agreed to work on a National Transition Plan on how the economy would be weaned off fossil fuels. They would prepare more work on this scheme in time for their next meeting planned for July. The new agreement “could reframe and reset existing priorities, frameworks and governance to ensure the sector can chart the course out of the current challenges, and set the sector up for a stable transformation towards decarbonisation,” the meeting’s communique said. Another agreement involved enhancing the powers of the regulators to ensure they have full transparency, particularly in the gas market, and to ensure that all behaviour is in the best interest of the market and consumers, Bowen said. There were, however, “no silver bullet, no magic answers” to lowering energy prices, he said, adding a lack of planning in the past had led to the crisis facing the sector. “We need more transmission, we need more renewables, we need more storage,” Bowen said. Coal-fired power plant reliability was also an issue discussed at the meeting, with ministers agreeing to work with rail authorities to secure black coal supplies “and with power station operators to get generation back online as quickly as possible”. Prior to the meeting, senior energy policy adviser for the Ai Group, Tennant Reed, said Australia was facing an “acute crisis”. Last week, market regulators had to intervene to put a limit on gas prices in Victoria and the Sydney market at $40 a gigajoule, or about four times the standard price. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered a jump in global energy prices, and the exit of a gas retailer, Weston Energy, in late May sent companies scrambling for supplies, propelling local prices higher. With electricity prices partly set by the cost of gas, wholesale power markets have also risen several times the $87/megawatt-hour average during the March quarter in the eastern states. The lengthy cold weather snap has also elevated demand. A report by energy expert Hugh Saddler and published by the ANU Institute for Climate, Energy &amp; Disaster Solutions on Wednesday showed average wholesale power prices had been steady until March 2021 but had taken off since. “[O]ver the 12 months from May 2021 to May 2022, monthly median spot wholesale prices increased by over five times in Victoria and South Australia, six times in Tasmania and New South Wales, and seven times in Queensland,” the report said. Ahead of the meeting, scheduled for 4pm AEST, Victoria’s energy and environment minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, highlighted the need for changes to federal settings on gas, saying not enough was being reserved for Australian use. Western Australia sets aside 15% of production for domestic use but there are no formal limits for the eastern states. Discussions of gas reserves, however, were a national responsibility, Bowen said, indicating the subject was not subject to energy ministers’ approval. “Energy ministers agreed governments must be ready to act to implement further measures should they be deemed consistent with both our domestic and international commitments,” according to the communique from the meeting. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Ai Group’s Reed said the change of federal government should usher in closer coordination across states, territories and the commonwealth. “The early signs are that there’s a good new set of relationships,” he said. “And that is promising.” The coordination will also extend to senior officers working together and reporting back to ministers “on the potential for the aggregation of renewable energy and storage projects across the nation”. “ This would help identify significant supply chain and onshoring opportunities for manufacturing, minerals processing, and to manage global equipment supply and cost issues,” the communique said. The ESB had already begun work on post-2025 energy market design, including the proposed development of a capacity mechanism. According to the communique, advancing work on a capacity mechanism was “a priority to bring on renewables and storage to support stability for the national energy market”, with no mention of coal or gas. In a nod to energy retailers who are struggling to stay in business as they are caught between rising gas and electricity costs and fixed contracts with consumers, the Australian Energy Market Commission was asked to prepare an urgent review by July of the Retailer of Last Resort scheme. The aim is “to improve resilience in the system and better manage retailer failures”. Reed said “you could make a case for a capacity mechanism” but it was important that the design not lock in high cost and potentially high emission sources of energy. It would also not provide any near-term benefit to the market and would have to be designed to minimise disruption and avoid scaring off investors. Bowen’s comments on Wednesday echo those he made at a conference last October, where he said an Albanese government would set several tests for any proposal to lock in extra capacity and improve grid reliability. These implied it would not support a system which extended the life of coal power plants. “Firstly, it must be consistent with our emissions reductions ambitions, including net zero by 2050 and a strong roadmap to get there,” he said. “Secondly, it must encourage investment in renewable energy, rather than chilling it as many fear. “Third, it must be a bridge to dispatchable technologies like hydrogen, batteries and pumped hydro, not an indefinite subsidy for old technologies,” Bowen said. “And fourth, it must actually ensure that generators dispatch when needed.” Bowen noted that commonwealth-owned Snowy Hydro had recently refused to dispatch electricity from its Colongra gas plant below the market price cap of $15,000, an act he said was “reprehensible”. New National party leader, David Littleproud, meanwhile, earlier renewed his calls for the Albanese government to consider support for nuclear energy and even convene a national energy summit – issues not expected to get much heed at Wednesday’s meeting. “Small scale modular nuclear power should be included in that conversation as a source of reliable energy and a way of reducing the emissions,” Littleproud said. “A national energy summit that convened pre-eminent scientists, energy experts, economists as well as political leaders would be a positive contribution for policy development,” he said. Littleproud said his party was “not advocating large scale nuclear power plants”, rather smaller ones, but wanted “an agnostic debate on all energy sources available to Australia”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/13/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-202-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-13T10:15:10Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 202 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/13/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-202-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/13/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-202-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 202 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said his country’s forces had taken back 6,000 sq km (2,400 square miles) of Russian-held territory in the country’s south and east. Ukraine’s forces have continued to press their counterattack in Kharkiv, seeking to take control of almost all of the province. Ukraine’s troops headed north, reportedly recapturing towns all the way to the Russian border. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said fighting is still raging in Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv region. Hanna Malyar said: “The aim is to liberate the Kharkiv region and beyond – all the territories occupied by the Russian Federation. Fighting is continuing. It is still early to say full control has been established over Kharkiv region. Our strength stems from the fact that we are very motivated and that we plan operations thoroughly.” The Ukrainian military says it had freed more than 20 settlements in 24 hours. In recent days, Kyiv’s forces have captured territory at least twice the size of greater London, according to the British Ministry of Defence. Ukraine’s military says the Antonivsky Bridge across the Dnieper River near occupied Kherson in the south is now unusable by Russian military The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said Ukrainian forces had made important progress in their counteroffensive against Russian troops, although it was too early to predict the outcome. “Clearly we’ve seen significant progress by the Ukrainians, particularly in the north-east, and that is a product of the support we’ve provided, but first and foremost it’s a product of the extraordinary courage and resilience of the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukrainian people,” Blinken told reporters in Mexico City. Ukraine’s State Border Service has issued a video which purports to show soldiers tearing down Russian banners and burning the Russian flag in Vovchansk, which is in the north of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region and very close to the border with Russia. Russia’s military commanders have stopped sending new units into Ukraine after the counteroffensive, the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said on its Facebook page on Monday. “The current situation in the theatre of operations and distrust of the higher command forced a large number of volunteers to categorically refuse the prospect of service in combat conditions.” Russian troops have left behind stockpiles of ammunition and other supplies following Ukraine’s counteroffensive in Kharkiv oblast, the Kyiv Independent reports. One analyst estimated that more than 300 vehicles, including tanks, self-propelled mortars and supply trucks, had been lost between 7 and 11 September. Russia responded to the counteroffensive by launching missile strikes that cut electricity and water supplies in Kharkiv city for a second time in less than 24 hours, knocking out both on Monday morning just hours after the city authorities had restored 80% of the utilities that had been cut overnight. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, appeared on state TV on Monday evening, chairing a meeting on the economy at which he made no reference to the military situation and said Russia was holding up in the face of western sanctions. “The economic blitzkrieg tactics, the onslaught they were counting on, did not work”. Germany is well-positioned to get through the winter despite reduced gas flows from Russia thanks to measures including extending two nuclear power plants’ lifespans, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will say on Tuesday. Russia detained a top manager of an aviation factory on suspicion of passing secret military information to Ukraine, Russian news agencies reported on Tuesday, citing the FSB federal security agency. Clashes have erupted between Azerbaijani and Armenian troops, according to Russian news agencies, in a resumption of decades-old hostilities linked to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian government said it would invoke a cooperation agreement with Russia and appeal to a Russia-led security bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, as well as the UN security council. The US assesses that Russia has largely ceded its gains near Kharkiv and many retreating Russian soldiers have exited Ukraine, moving over the border back into Russia, a senior US military official said on Monday. However, the US-based Institute for the Study of War thinktank said that “Ukraine has turned the tide in its favour, but the current counteroffensive will not end the war”. Ukrainian authorities have said they are capturing so many Russian prisoners of war the country is running out of space to put them, the Associated Press reports. Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovich did not specify the number of Russian prisoners, but said the PoWs would be exchanged for Ukrainian service members held by Moscow. Military intelligence spokesperson Andrey Yusov said the captured troops included “significant” numbers of Russian officers. Municipal deputies from 18 districts of Moscow and St Petersburg have signed a public statement demanding that Vladimir Putin resign. “We, the municipal deputies of Russia, believe that the actions of President Vladimir Putin harm the future of Russia and its citizens,” read the statement published by Ksenia Torstrem, the municipal deputy of the Semenovsky district of St Petersburg. “Deputies are not yet forbidden to have an opinion. And it is also not forbidden to speak for the resignation of the president. He is not a monarch, but a hired worker, receives a salary from our taxes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/jun/27/isy-suttie-interview-peep-show-baby","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-27T07:00:05Z","webTitle":"Isy Suttie: ‘I was like: are they just here to see Dobby?’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jun/27/isy-suttie-interview-peep-show-baby","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/jun/27/isy-suttie-interview-peep-show-baby","fields":{"headline":"Isy Suttie: ‘I was like: are they just here to see Dobby?’","bodyText":"In one very important sense, motherhood is an exercise in mitigating risk: you are the cautious and dutiful protector of society’s most vulnerable. But what if you’re also a natural-born thrill-seeker who lives for transgressive fun? What then? In Jackpot, her new standup show, Isy Suttie explores precisley this contradiction. As a teenager growing up in the picturesque spa town of Matlock in Derbyshire, her life revolved around the pursuit of excitement: some of her weirder escapades included touring multiple house parties in a single evening with her Ouija board, and jumping off a 30ft bridge for a £1 bet. Now, her life has all the hallmarks of measured domesticity – she has a seven-year-old daughter and three-year-old son with her partner, fellow comic Elis James – and yet “the element of me that does want to take risks” remains, she explains over a flat white in a south London coffee shop that is full of mothers conscientiously attending to babes in buggies. It is something the 43-year-old still finds herself drawn to. In Jackpot, she recounts the time she encouraged her kids to explore a disturbingly spooky campsite in the woods near her house (they were terrified), and how, with them gone, she engaged in some light trespassing at a nuclear power station with a couple of friends from mum yoga (the police became involved). Jackpot is Suttie’s return to standup after a very long break: she has not toured for a decade. Instead, she has been busy writing books (in 2016 she published a memoir, The Actual One, and last year, a novel called Jane Is Trying), podcasting and acting; her CV includes recurring roles in Shameless, Man Down and Jo Brand’s social work sitcom Damned. But it’s as Dobby, the on-off girlfriend of Peep Show’s uber-relatable loser-geek Mark Corrigan, that she remains best loved. Nerdy, vivacious, kind and sharp-witted, Dobby is one of the most distinctive female roles in British TV comedy history. In her teens, Suttie says, she used to “dream” of playing Sally Phillips’s giggling receptionist in I’m Alan Partridge; in sitcom character terms, I’d say she ended up going one better. Yet as great as Dobby was, the role did end up derailing Suttie’s standup career. At drama school she had harboured ambitions to become a serious actor and/or musician. “Me and my college boyfriend Tom used to sit up all night going: ‘I’m going to be in a Mike Leigh film, then I’m going to be in a Ken Loach film, then I’ll tour with Théâtre de Complicité.’ There was no talk of: ‘I’ll do theatre in education for a year then I’ll get turned down for an advert,’” she recalls, with an enthusiastic appreciation of her own ridiculousness. Yet after graduating to zero work, she discovered London’s standup scene, and soon found herself performing musical comedy on the gay club circuit. Her material included a song about Geri Halliwell’s dog, a lullaby for Katie Price, and one about a man putting his penis into a chip fryer. “The chorus was: ‘Eh, come on love, what’s the matter / Have you never seen sausage in batter?’ In a northern accent,” recounts Suttie, trying and failing to keep a straight face. As much as her camp, celebrity-centric material chimed with the gay scene, it was also a “real baptism of fire”. She struggled to win over audiences, and soon migrated to the mainstream standup circuit. There, she thrived. In 2007, a Chortle review of her first solo Edinburgh show, a one-woman romcom musical set in a Matlock supermarket titled Love Lost in the British Retail Industry, hailed her as a “modern-day Victoria Wood”. The following year she made her Peep Show debut; she knew she had nailed the audition thanks to the “tingly” ASMR-related sensation she experienced afterwards. On the set of her first series on the show, she was “really scared all the time. I was aware of how good it was and I was very quiet and shy.” Off set, she found that Dobby had supercharged her standup career – not always for the better. She was promoted to the top of bills, and gigs were advertised on her Peep Show credentials. “I got a bit inside my own head and was like: ‘Why are people here? Are they here to see Dobby? What do they expect?’” She worried that audiences would presume it was her first foray into standup. The stress was exacerbated by the fact she believed her Edinburgh show that year wasn’t up to scratch, having felt pressure to do the fringe regardless as a rising comedian. “It can feel like a really long Edinburgh where you have to do a show every day and you’re not happy with it,” she says. Her new work is clearly not born of the same sense of Fomo: Suttie wasn’t planning on returning to standup when Jackpot’s concept came to her. It taps into a very different cultural zeitgeist than the irreverent, Heat magazine-adjacent spirit of the late 00s. Jackpot is part of a wave of comedy that muses, very amusingly, on the ways motherhood and identity intersect (see also: the work of standups Ali Wong and Jessica Fostekew, books by comedians Lucy Beaumont and Ellie Taylor and sitcoms Motherland and Better Things). It’s a theme that also runs through Suttie’s next TV project, The Baby, which tackles the topic of motherhood in a marginally more disturbing fashion. The horror-comedy follows Natasha (Michelle de Swarte), a contentedly childfree thirtysomething gradually losing all her friends to parenthood who is targeted by a homicidal infant: the child latches on to a new “mother” each time he kills his previous caregiver (and plenty of others along the way). Suttie plays Natasha’s newly pregnant best friend Rita – another deserter – and filming the show took her back to her pre-kids days. “I really, really related to Michelle’s character feeling bereft of friends when everyone around you starts having kids,” she says. “My first book was about that, really. In a way you do lose your friends when they have kids if you don’t have them, because it’s boring as hell to hear someone talk about their baby and be preoccupied, and not have a proper conversation with you.” The Baby is laugh-out-loud funny but also genuinely disturbing; one field-based scene literally gave me nightmares. Best of all, it’s packed with subtle, blisteringly evocative allegories for the specific hell – the boredom, the sleep-deprivation, the mania, the crushing sense of responsibility – that is caring for a very small child. One of the cleverest elements of the early episodes is the way Natasha turns into a martyr: she won’t let anyone else look after the baby lest it murders them, a neat parallel for the exhausting instinct many new mothers have to control everything. It’s something Suttie can relate to. “I remember not letting anyone else wash [her daughter] Beti’s bottles,” she says. “You’re so out of control of so many elements of it, like when they sleep, that you’re scrabbling to control what you can.” In fact, Suttie’s attempts to do it all after the birth of her daughter in 2014 took its toll in a dramatic way: she developed a condition called migraine-associated vertigo, partly because of the stress she was under. “I did the book tour, I was filming a lot, I was away the whole time – and I was spending a lot of time with her. I wasn’t sleeping much. Both Elis and I would be filming and we’d meet at a service station and swap Beti over into a different car. In the end it was like, ‘One of us has to pull back a little bit.’” Suttie ended up taking three months off work, even though, being “a perfectionist and a workaholic”, she didn’t particularly want to. During those months she realised not working wasn’t “right for me, but I shouldn’t be working as much. So it was a case of: what do I really want to do?” The answer seems to be a bit of everything. After our interview, I leave Suttie behind in the baby-garlanded coffee shop; she is staying to catch up on her reading in preparation for the new series of the Penguin books podcast she presents. It’s just one component of a life that takes in writing, acting, parenting, standup, podcasting and, of course, the odd foray into a haunted campsite or nuclear power plant. It may not be everyone’s idea of a good time, but Suttie has clearly worked out how to hit her own personal jackpot. Jackpot tours from 22 August, starting at London’s Soho theatre; The Baby airs on Sky Atlantic in July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/live/2022/dec/18/russia-ukraine-war-power-restored-to-6-million-ukrainians-after-strikes-says-zelenskiy-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-18T18:26:30Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: ‘fragile morale’ among Russian forces, says UK – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/18/russia-ukraine-war-power-restored-to-6-million-ukrainians-after-strikes-says-zelenskiy-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/dec/18/russia-ukraine-war-power-restored-to-6-million-ukrainians-after-strikes-says-zelenskiy-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: ‘fragile morale’ among Russian forces, says UK – as it happened","bodyText":"We are closing this blog now but you can read all our Ukraine coverage here. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Sunday proposed holding a global peace summit this winter, in a video message Kyiv was hoping would be broadcast ahead of the World Cup final in Qatar, although it appeared unlikely Fifa would allow the move.It was reported on Friday that Zelenskiy had asked world soccer’s governing body to let him share a message of peace before the final. “We offered peace formula to the world. Absolutely fair. We offered it because there are no champions in war, there can be no draw,” Zelenskiy said in a video message issued by his office. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “opened the gates of hell”, unleashing “every evil” force worldwide from murder and rape in occupied territory to famine and debt in Africa and Europe. Welby, the highest-ranking cleric in the worldwide Anglican communion, travelled to Ukraine last month to meet church leaders and Christians as well as those displaced by the conflict. He said he had been struck by the “size of the mass graves in Bucha, the photos of what had been done to the people there, the rape, the massacres, the torture by the occupying Russian forces”. Fragile morale almost certainly continues to be a significant vulnerability across much of the Russian force, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said in its latest defence intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine. In its daily briefing posted on Twitter, the MoD said soldiers’ concerns primarily focus on very high casualty rates, poor leadership, pay problems, lack of equipment and ammunition, and lack of clarity about the war’s objectives. Heating has been fully restored to Kyiv after the latest Russian bombardment that targeted water and power infrastructure, the capital’s mayor said on Sunday. Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app: “The city is restoring all services after the latest shelling. In particular, the capital’s heat supply system was fully restored. All sources of heat supply work normally.” Ukraine worked to restore electricity and water supplies on Saturday after Russia’s latest wave of attacks pitched multiple cities into darkness and forced people to endure sub-zero temperatures without heating or running water. Agence France-Presse reported that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Saturday that while electricity had been restored to almost 6 million Ukrainians, there were ongoing problems with heat and water supplies and “large-scale outages” in many regions. Russian president Vladimir Putin has held meetings with his military commanders and sought their proposals on how Russia’s campaign in Ukraine should proceed, during a visit to the operation’s headquarters, the Kremlin said. Russia has claimed its mass strikes against Ukraine on Friday were part of preventing foreign weapons being delivered to Ukraine. On Friday, “military command systems, the military-industrial complex and their supporting energy facilities of Ukraine were hit with a mass strike with high-precision weapons”, Russia’s defence ministry said in its daily briefing. The attacks have prompted accusations from Ukraine’s allies of war crimes. This is the drone video footage showing the explosions in Bakhmut, eastern Ukraine, which has been verified by the Guardian and Reuters. Moscow has denied it plans to increase the period of mandatory military service from six months to a year. A video showing Lieutenant Colonel Mikhail Fotin initially making the claim was later deleted, Sky News reported. The Russian defence ministry said it is “not considering any changes to the legal code of the Russian Federation”, adding this is “concerning changes to the length of military service by conscription”. It has been more than three months since two of the UK’s most senior judges sifted through thousands of pages of evidence and heard opposing arguments from some of the country’s lawyers about whether or not the government’s controversial plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda are lawful. On Monday at 10.30am, at the Royal Courts of Justice, they will deliver their judgment. Hayat (not his real name) an asylum seeker from Eritrea, lost both his parents when he was a child. He tried to find safety first in Ethiopia and then Sudan before managing to reach Russia in 2018 and then travelling on to Ukraine, where he claimed asylum. But no decision had been made about his case when Russia invaded Ukraine in February so, unlike Ukrainian citizens who were eligible to apply for a visa to come to the UK, he fled to France and arrived in the UK using the dangerous small boat route. “They have accepted thousands of Ukrainian refugees – so what about us? We are from the same place, so why are we being treated differently?” he asked. Here is my colleague Jon Henley’s coverage of the restoration of heating to Kyiv, announced this morning by the city’s mayor. Heating has been fully restored to Kyiv after the latest Russian bombardment, the city’s mayor has said, as Moscow unveiled plans to deploy musicians to the frontline in Ukraine in a drive to boost morale among its troops. Vitali Klitschko said on Sunday morning the capital was successfully “restoring all services after the latest shelling” and that “in particular, the capital’s heating supply system is fully restored. All sources of heat supply work normally.” Russia fired more than 70 missiles targeting Ukraine’s water and energy infrastructure on Friday in one of its heaviest barrages since the beginning of its invasion on 24 February, causing power blackouts and removing access to heat and water. Temperatures in Kyiv and across the country were below freezing on Sunday and forecast to fall to -6C (21.2F) by evening. Up to a third of the capital’s population of 3 million were still without electricity overnight in what officials called a “difficult and critical” situation. Full story is here: The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has posted images on Twitter of Ukrainian soldiers training in the north of England. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Sunday proposed holding a global peace summit this winter, in a video message Kyiv was hoping would be broadcast ahead of the World Cup final in Qatar, although it appeared unlikely Fifa would allow the move. It was reported on Friday that Zelenskiy had asked world soccer’s governing body to let him share a message of peace before the final. “We offered peace formula to the world. Absolutely fair. We offered it because there are no champions in war, there can be no draw,” Zelenskiy said in a video message issued by his office. “I announce the initiative to hold a global peace formula summit this winter. The summit to unite all nations of the world around the cause of global peace. Stadium stands get empty after the match, and after the war cities remain empty,” he said. Zelenskiy had wanted to appear via video link before Argentina take on defending champions France at Doha’s Lusail Stadium for the final with an expected global audience of hundreds of millions, it was reported. Fifa did not respond to repeated requests for comment, but it appeared unlikely to give Zelenskiy a platform given its stance on political messages at the World Cup. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter that Fifa “shows a lack of understanding of the disaster that the Russian federation is dragging the world into by starting a war in Ukraine”. My colleague Julian Borger has written a piece on the role of computer software in the war in Ukraine – a “decisive weapon” in the effort to force back the Russian invasion. He writes: Inside, the weapon glows from a dozen computer screens – a constantly updated portrayal of the evolving battlefield to the south. With one click on a menu, the map is populated with hordes of orange diamonds, showing Russian deployments. They reveal where tanks and artillery have been hidden, and intimate details of the units and the soldiers in them, gleaned from social media. Choosing another option from the menu lights up red arrows across the southern Zaporizhzhia region, showing the progression of Russian columns. Zooming in shows satellite imagery of the terrain in sharp detail. It is called Delta, a software package developed by Ukrainian programmers to give their armed forces an advantage in a contest of which side can see the battlefield more clearly and therefore predict the enemy forces’ moves and strike them faster and more accurately. While many scenes from the war in Ukraine look like a throwback to the first world war, with muddy trench networks and blasted landscapes, the conflict is also a testing ground for the future of warfare, where information and its dissemination in instantly usable form to individual soldiers will be critical to victory or defeat. Read the full article here: Significant fighting is taking place in the eastern Donetsk city of Bakhmut in Ukraine. Once home to 72,000, the civilian population has dwindled to 12,000 over the past six months, surviving in basements and supplied by mobile grocery trucks that enter the city when they can. Here are images uploaded today from the city. Russian military forces on Sunday shelled the centre of Kherson, the major city that Russian soldiers retreated from last month in one of Moscow’s biggest battlefield setbacks in Ukraine, AP reports. Three people were wounded in the attacks, said presidential deputy chief of staff Kyrylo Tymoshenko. The southern city and its surrounding region have come under frequent attack since the Russian pullback. Volunteers in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv have made a Christmas tree out of camouflage nets, the BBC reports. After the holidays, the nets will be donated to soldiers fighting on the frontline. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine, has posted an image of the tree on Twitter. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “opened the gates of hell”, unleashing “every evil” force worldwide from murder and rape in occupied territory to famine and debt in Africa and Europe. Welby, the highest-ranking cleric in the worldwide Anglican communion, travelled to Ukraine last month to meet church leaders and Christians as well as those displaced by the conflict. He said he had been struck by the “size of the mass graves in Bucha, the photos of what had been done to the people there, the rape, the massacres, the torture by the occupying Russian forces”. And he said the repercussions of the invasion were also being felt far beyond Ukraine’s borders. “Effectively we’re in the same struggle at one remove. When Ukraine was invaded at the decision of President (Vladimir) Putin, the gates of hell were opened and every evil force came out across the world,” he told BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuennsberg. “I was in Mozambique the week before I was in Ukraine where there is famine all the way up the East African coast,” he said. “There is inflation … there’s an energy crisis, there’s suffering, there’s shortages of drugs, everything evil has been unleashed and until there is withdrawal and ceasefire we can’t make progress on reconciliation,” he added. In the UK, he said, rising food and fuel prices at least partly driven by the conflict had resulted in a 400% rise in the past 18 months in people seeking help from food banks. “We are seeing debt rising, pressures on families just at all sorts of levels,” he added. Welby has been publicly critical of Russia’s war on Ukraine, calling its invasion in February “an act of great evil”. Visiting Mozambique the week before his Ukraine trip, he travelled to the jihadist-hit Cabo Delgado region where he met survivors of the insurgency there. Earlier this month, the US committed a further $2.5bn in food assistance to Africa, pledging to help the continent cope with rising prices blamed in part on Russia’s invasion of breadbasket Ukraine. The Horn of Africa has been hit especially hard after successive failed rainy seasons, with the United Nations saying that aid has staved off fully fledged famine in Somalia. Four people in the southern Russian region of Belgorod near the border with Ukraine were wounded by shelling on Sunday, the governor of the region said, Reuters reported. “Our air defence system was activated over Belgorod and the Belgorod region,” Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. “Four people are known to have been injured. Medical teams are taking them to hospital,” he said. Gladkov gave no further details of the incident. Three witnesses told Reuters that loud blasts were heard in the city on Sunday. Belgorod is one of several southern Russian regions where targets such as fuel and ammunition stores have been rocked by explosions since the start of what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine on 24 February. Fragile morale almost certainly continues to be a significant vulnerability across much of the Russian force, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said in its latest defence intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine. In its daily briefing posted on Twitter, the MoD said soldiers’ concerns primarily focus on very high casualty rates, poor leadership, pay problems, lack of equipment and ammunition, and lack of clarity about the war’s objectives. It said the establishment of two frontline “creative brigades” tasked with raising the morale of troops through providing entertainment and musical instruments among other things is “unlikely to substantively alleviate these concerns”. See the full briefing below: The people the Greeks called Scythians were formidable warriors and nomads who dominated the Eurasian steppe for more than 1,000 years from about 800BC – long before the creation of national borders. The fabulous gold weapons and ornaments they left behind ended up in museums across the region, many of them in Ukraine. Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine in February, however, much Scythian gold – along with millions of other priceless artefacts – has been looted or “evacuated”. Serhii Telizhenko, of the National Institute of Archaeology in Kyiv, who has been monitoring the wave of destruction, said he realised there would be losses after the invasion, “but I could not imagine the scale”. The time is approaching for a negotiated peace in Ukraine to reduce the risk of another devastating world war, but dreams of breaking up Russia could unleash nuclear chaos, the veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger said. Kissinger, an architect of the cold war policy of detente towards the Soviet Union as secretary of state under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, has met Vladimir Putin multiple times since he first became president in 2000. The Kremlin says Kyiv must acknowledge Moscow’s annexation of southern and eastern regions. Ukraine says every Russian soldier must leave its territory, including Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. “The time is approaching to build on the strategic changes which have already been accomplished and to integrate them into a new structure towards achieving peace through negotiation,” Kissinger wrote in The Spectator magazine. “A peace process should link Ukraine to Nato, however expressed. The alternative of neutrality is no longer meaningful,” Kissinger wrote in the Spectator magazine in an article entitled “How to avoid another world war”. Kissinger, 99, suggested that if it proved impossible to return to the status quo established in 2014, internationally supervised referendums in territory claimed by Russia could be an option. He warned that desires to render Russia “impotent”, or even seek the dissolution of Russia, could unleash chaos. Neither Ukraine nor any western state has advocated either path. “The dissolution of Russia or destroying its ability for strategic policy could turn its territory encompassing 11 time zones into a contested vacuum,” Kissinger said. “Its competing societies might decide to settle their disputes by violence. Other countries might seek to expand their claims by force. All these dangers would be compounded by the presence of thousands of nuclear weapons which make Russia one of the world’s two largest nuclear powers.” Russia may attempt to re-enact a version of its original invasion plans, Ukrainian military officials believe, as Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned this weekend that Vladimir Putin still has enough missiles to order more heavy strikes. The Ukrainian president was speaking in the aftermath of the latest wave of missiles to target his country’s critical energy infrastructure after Russia launched 98 rockets at 20 cities and towns on Friday. Officials said on Saturday, however, that repairs had been speedy with water supply restored throughout Kyiv and two-thirds of the capital now connected to electricity while the country’s second-biggest city, Kharkiv, had been reconnected to the grid after suffering a total blackout. The infrastructure update arrived as a Ukrainian military commander warned Russia may again attempt to seize Kyiv after invading from Belarus in the north, potentially around the late February anniversary of when Putin first ordered his troops to invade. Mark Townsend and Isobel Koshiw in Kyiv report here: Germany has inaugurated its first liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, built in record time, as the country scrambles to adapt to life without Russian energy. The rig in the North Sea port of Wilhelmshaven was opened by the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, at a ceremony on Saturday onboard a specialist vessel known as an FSRU, named the Hoegh Esperanza. He said from the boat: It’s a good day for our country and a sign to the whole world that the German economy will be able to remain strong. Agence France-Presse also reported that the Hoegh Esperanza sounded its horn as the chancellor, dressed in a hi-vis jacket, approached. The ship has already been stocked with gas from Nigeria that could supply 50,000 homes for a year, and the terminal is set to begin deliveries on 22 December. Germany plans to open four more government-funded LNG terminals over the next few months as well as a private terminal in the port of Lubmin. Together, the terminals could deliver 30bn cubic metres of gas a year from next year, or a third of Germany’s total gas needs – if Berlin can find enough LNG to service them. LNG terminals allow for the import by sea of natural gas that has been chilled and turned into a liquid to make it easier to transport. The installation of a protective dome has begun over the spent-fuel storage area at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, an official from the province’s Moscow-installed authorities said. Vladimir Rogov said the dome would protect against fragments of shells and improvised explosive devices carried by drones, Associated Press reported. The Russian-occupied plant in south-east Ukraine – Europe’s biggest nuclear power station – has been repeatedly shelled and its six reactors have been shut down for months. The International Atomic Energy Agency recently announced plans to station nuclear safety and security experts at Ukraine’s nuclear power plants to prevent any nuclear accident. The UN nuclear watchdog has already deployed a permanent mission to the Zaporizhzhia plant. Officials have reopened a popular Kyiv pedestrian bridge that had been damaged during an earlier air strike and were setting up a smaller-than-usual Christmas tree in a central square in the gloomy winter haze on Saturday. The vast space in front of the centuries-old St Sophia Cathedral is traditionally anchored by a hulking evergreen at Christmas, Reuters reported. But officials this year opted for a 12-metre (40ft) artificial tree festooned with energy-saving lights powered by a generator. Orthodox Christians make up the majority of Ukraine’s 43 million people. Klitschko said the tree was funded by donors and businesses and that no public celebrations would take place. Kyiv resident Iryna Soloychuk, who arrived with her daughter to see the tree just hours after another round of air-raid alerts wailed across the country, said: I doubt this will be a true holiday. But we should understand that we’re all together, that we should help one another. Here are some of the latest Ukraine images coming in on the wires. Heating has been fully restored to Kyiv after the latest Russian bombardment that targeted water and power infrastructure, the capital’s mayor said on Sunday. Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app: The city is restoring all services after the latest shelling. In particular, the capital’s heat supply system was fully restored. All sources of heat supply work normally. Reuters also reported that Ukrainian officials said Russia fired more than 70 missiles on Friday in one of its heaviest barrages since the start of its invasion, forcing emergency blackouts nationwide and cutting access to heat and water. Temperatures in Kyiv and many places across Ukraine were below freezing on Sunday morning, with forecasts expecting them to dip to -6C (21.2F) in the capital by the evening. Kyiv is by far the largest city in Ukraine with an estimated population of about 3 million, with up to 2 million more in the Kyiv region. As of late Saturday, a third of the city remained without power. Sergei Kovalenko, chief executive of Yasno, which provides electricity for Kyiv, said late on Saturday that access to power has been increasing with each hour. He said on his Facebook account: The situation remains difficult and critical. Ukraine worked to restore electricity and water supplies on Saturday after Russia’s latest wave of attacks pitched multiple cities into darkness and forced people to endure sub-zero temperatures without heating or running water. Agence France-Presse reported that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Saturday that while electricity had been restored to almost 6 million Ukrainians, there were ongoing problems with heat and water supplies and “large-scale outages” in many regions. He said in his nightly address: The main thing today is energy. There is still a lot of work to do to stabilise the system. In Kyiv, the metro had stopped running so that people wrapped in winter coats could take shelter at underground stations. But mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Saturday the service had resumed, while water supply had also been restored and 75% of the city’s population had heating back. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, power had also been fully returned, regional governor Oleg Sinegubov said on Saturday, after the strikes had left Ukraine’s second city without electricity. Ukraine’s national energy provider Ukrenergo had imposed emergency blackouts in response to the strikes, warning the extent of the damage in the north, south and centre of the country meant it could take longer to restore supplies than after previous attacks. The country’s energy system “continues to recover”, it said on Saturday. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, inspected the country’s troops involved in Moscow’s “special military operation” in Ukraine, the defence ministry said on Sunday. The ministry said on the Telegram messaging app: The head of the Russian military flew around the areas of deployment of troops and checked the advanced positions of Russian units in the zone of the special military operation. Reuters also reported the ministry said Shoigu spoke with troops “on the frontline” and at a “command post”. However, it was not immediately clear when the visit took place or if Shoigu had visited Ukraine itself. A short video posted with the statement showed Shoigu in a military helicopter and a couple of aerial shots of empty swathes of land. The announcement comes a day after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, held a meeting with the country’s top brass, including Shoigu, seeking proposals on how they think Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine should proceed. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Adam Fulton and here’s a brief look at the latest news as it approaches 8.10am in Kyiv. Power has been restored to nearly 6 million Ukrainians after Friday’s barrage of Russian missile strikes against the country’s infrastructure, including its electricity generating systems. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address on Saturday: Repair work continues without a break after yesterday’s terrorist attack. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram on Saturday that heat had been restored for three-quarters of the capital’s residents and engineers were continuing to work to stabilise supply. However, half of the Kyiv province still lacked electricity on Saturday, regional governor Oleksiy Kuleba was quoted as saying, with snow and rain complicating efforts. In other recent developments: Russian president Vladimir Putin has held meetings with his military commanders and sought their proposals on how Russia’s campaign in Ukraine should proceed, during a visit to the operation’s headquarters, the Kremlin said. Russia has claimed its mass strikes against Ukraine on Friday were part of preventing foreign weapons being delivered to Ukraine. On Friday, “military command systems, the military-industrial complex and their supporting energy facilities of Ukraine were hit with a mass strike with high-precision weapons”, Russia’s defence ministry said in its daily briefing. The attacks have prompted accusations from Ukraine’s allies of war crimes. Rescuers have recovered the body of a one-and-a-half-year-old boy from the rubble of Friday’s Russian strike on a three-storey residential building in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipro region, the region’s governor said. In total, four people were killed in the attack on Kryvyi Rih, Valentyn Reznichenko said. Thirteen others, including four children, were injured. Russia has denounced a decision by Moldova to temporarily ban six television channels as “political censorship”. Moldova accused the channels of airing “incorrect information” about the country and Russia’s military operation in Ukraine. Moldova has reached a short-term energy deal that will help wean it off its dependence on Russian natural gas, a senior official said on Saturday. The Moldovan deputy prime minister, Andrei Spînu, said the state gas firm Moldovagaz would buy 100m cubic metres of gas from domestic supplier Energocom this month. Russia’s campaign of strikes against Ukrainian critical infrastructure has largely consisted of air- and maritime-launched cruise missiles but has almost certainly also included Iranian-provided drones, according to the UK’s Ministry of Defence. In its latest intelligence update it also said Russia was probably concerned about the “vulnerability” of Crimea. A Ukrainian military commander has said Russia may try to invade from the north, potentially around the anniversary of when Vladimir Putin first ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. Maj Gen Andrii Kovalchuk told Sky News the fiercest fighting might be ahead and appeared particularly focused on the possibility of Russian troops invading via Belarus, on Ukraine’s northern border, in order to target the capital. A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said it is “unrealistic” to expect Kyiv to come to an agreement with Russia to end the war. “War must end only with its defeat,” Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter, saying Ukraine would act with “required proportions of artillery, armoured vehicles, drones and long-range missiles”. A 36-year-old man was killed inside his car after Russian forces shelled the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Saturday morning, the regional governor, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said. A 70-year-old woman was also injured after Russian troops struck a western district of the city with artillery and multiple rocket launchers, Yanushevych wrote on Telegram."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/06/boris-johnson-to-attack-corrosive-cynicism-on-net-zero-at-cop27","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-06T22:30:31Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson to attack ‘corrosive cynicism’ on net zero at Cop27","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/06/boris-johnson-to-attack-corrosive-cynicism-on-net-zero-at-cop27","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/06/boris-johnson-to-attack-corrosive-cynicism-on-net-zero-at-cop27","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson to attack ‘corrosive cynicism’ on net zero at Cop27","bodyText":"Boris Johnson will attack the “corrosive cynicism” on net zero that is hampering UK, and global, efforts to tackle the climate crisis, in a speech at the UN Cop27 climate summit on Monday. In a swipe at members of his own Conservative party, the former UK prime minister will contrast the success and spirit of optimism at Cop26 in Glasgow last November with the failures of governments – including the UK – to follow through on promises since. “Because the spike in oil and gas prices – and the consequent global inflation, the hikes in the cost of fertiliser and food, have had an impact here and everywhere, they have led some naysayers to a corrosive cynicism about net zero,” he will warn. Soon after the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow ended last November, some rightwing members of the UK’s ruling Conservative party – including many who originally backed Johnson for prime minister in the 2019 general election, but combined to help push him out of office in July – began to try to use the climate emergency as a “culture war” issue. They argued against the UK’s goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and set up a net zero scrutiny group of MPs to advocate for relaxing or reneging on the legally binding target. Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, which sent already rising gas prices soaring to record levels, added fuel to their efforts. Johnson, whose supporters have long claimed him as a green champion, will tell an audience at Cop27 on Monday: “We must end the defeatism that has crept in since last year, we must end Putin’s energy blackmail, we must keep up our campaign to end global dependence on hydrocarbons, and if we retain the spirit of creative and Promethean optimism we saw at Paris and Glasgow, then we can keep [the] 1.5C [limit on global temperature rises] alive.” Johnson is attending Cop27 as the guest of the Egyptian hosts. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak will also attend the Cop27 summit, having U-turned on his initial decision to snub the summit, which 110 world leaders will attend. He will hold meetings with French president, Emmanuel Macron, Italy’s prime minister, Georgia Meloni, and President William Ruto of Kenya. He is also expected to raise with the Egyptian government the issue of Alaa Abd El-Fattah, a British-Egyptian democracy activist and blogger who is on hunger strike in an Egyptian jail. Sunak will commit the UK to triple its funding for countries to adapt to the effects of extreme weather, from £500m in 2019 to £1.5bn in 2025, but there will be no new money for climate finance – the spending will come from the £11.6bn budget already agreed before Cop26. Sunak will say: “The world came together in Glasgow with one last chance to create a plan that would limit global temperatures to 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels]. The question today is: can we summon the collective will to deliver on those promises? I believe we can. By honouring the pledges we made in Glasgow, we can turn our struggle against climate change into a global mission for new jobs and clean growth. And we can bequeath our children a greener planet and a more prosperous future. That’s a legacy we could be proud of.” He is expected to herald progress on a UK initiative to conserve the world’s existing forests, and on ways to help communities where many jobs are currently dependent on fossil fuels to move to clean energy, the so-called “just transition”. Sir Keir Starmer, who is not at Cop27, will also mark the start of the conference by setting out proposals for clusters of net zero industry centred on steel, cement, ceramics and chemicals in areas including Humber and Teesside, Merseyside, Grangemouth and south Wales. Labour’s proposals would result in at least £1bn more invested in greening industry in the UK than under Conservative plans, Starmer will say. The money would come from a proposed National Wealth Fund. Labour accused the government of “dragging its feet on climate at every turn”, leaving British industry behind in the race for the clean and efficient technology of the future. Ed Miliband, shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said: “The Tories have shown us over the past 12 years that they simply do not understand the scale of the [climate] emergency. If Rishi Sunak can’t provide leadership on the world stage, we cannot expect him to lead at home.” Labour’s policies include an energy price freeze, paid for by a more effective windfall tax, along with a green prosperity plan for a national wealth fund and a national energy champion, GB Energy, to invest in renewable energy and nuclear power. Miliband said: “This is a plan that will drive jobs, support industries, tackle the cost of living, and protect our home for future generations by tackling the climate crisis. There is a global race on for the jobs of the future, and Britain under the Tories is falling behind.” About 110 heads of state and government are expected to gather in Sharm El-Sheikh on Monday for a two-day world leaders’ summit at the start of the fortnight of climate talks. The negotiations got off to a difficult start when countries stayed up to the early hours of Sunday morning wrangling over what should be on the agenda for the conference. The vexed issue of loss and damage will be an official agenda item at the talks, which will allow discussions on how poor countries can be helped to recover from the ravages of extreme weather that they are already experiencing. On Sunday, the UK formally handed over leadership of the global climate talks, a position it has held since the Cop26 summit in Glasgow last November, to Egypt. Egypt’s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, who will chair the Cop27 talks, said Egypt was determined to hold countries to account for their promises to tackle the climate crisis. He said: “We must not go beyond the point of no return [on the climate]. We must preserve our planet for future generations.” Security has been tight in Sharm El-Sheikh, as world leaders began to arrive on Sunday night, and there are concerns among climate activists that their voices will not be heard at the talks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/06/russia-ukraine-war-ukraine-retakes-more-settlements-in-kherson-zelenskiy-says-un-nuclear-chief-heads-to-kyiv-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-06T18:04:19Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Putin must lose or he will invade other European countries, Zelenskiy says – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/06/russia-ukraine-war-ukraine-retakes-more-settlements-in-kherson-zelenskiy-says-un-nuclear-chief-heads-to-kyiv-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/06/russia-ukraine-war-ukraine-retakes-more-settlements-in-kherson-zelenskiy-says-un-nuclear-chief-heads-to-kyiv-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Putin must lose or he will invade other European countries, Zelenskiy says – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s been a comparatively quiet day for news relating to the Ukraine invasion, but there have still been some important developments. The EU has imposed a new round of sanctions on Russia, expanding import and export bans and blacklisting individuals over Moscow’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions. Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told European heads of state gathered in Prague that Ukraine must win so that Russia does not “advance on Warsaw or again on Prague”. Ukrainian emergency services said three bodies have been pulled from rubble after a Russian rocket strike destroyed a five-storey apartment block in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia. The Kremlin denied reports that 700,000 Russians had fled the country since Moscow announced a mobilisation drive it said would call up hundreds of thousands to fight in Ukraine. Thank you for following the blog today. We’re closing it for now but will see you again tomorrow. Leaders of the European Union, the United Kingdom and Turkey met on Thursday to discuss the security and energy crises resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in a symbolic summit seen as underlining Moscow’s isolation. The gathering in Prague was the inaugural meeting of the European Political Community (EPC), the brainchild of French president, Emmanuel Macron, and was intended to unite the EU’s 27 member states with 17 other European countries. The meeting at the ancient Prague Castle was perceived as a grand show of solidarity for a continent grappling with multiple crises - from the security implications of the war in Ukraine to energy shortages and a looming recession. “This meeting is a way of looking for a new order without Russia,” the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said, adding that Moscow may not always be excluded but for now, President Vladimir Putin’s Russia “does not have a seat”. Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addressing the meeting via video link, urged leaders to turn the new political community into a “European community of peace”. “Let today be the starting point. The point from which Europe and the entire free world will move to guaranteed peace for all of us. It is possible,” he said, calling on leaders to “direct all possible powers of Europe to end the war” in Ukraine. The Guardian’s foreign correspondent Peter Beaumont has penned a dispatch from the Kherson region, shedding light on residents’ experiences of returning to their homes in newly liberated villages. Unlike the wooded hills of the Donbas, the land here is flat, broad fields sectored by tree lines of acacia and oak, poplars and eucalyptus. They provided meagre cover for the Russian armoured vehicles that can be see burned out in the distance, sometimes several together. Razor-sharp shrapnel fragments litter the road’s surface. Lines of Russian anti-tank mines, strung together to close access to the road, have been defused and pulled to one side of the carriageway. Everywhere the skeletal remnants of missiles that once carried cluster bombs stand like tree-stumps in the fields. One meadow is cratered every 20 metres by the dozen or so munitions that flew into it. Beyond that, the road is heavily damaged. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has said it was “obvious” the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant belonged to Ukraine during a visit to Kyiv on Thursday. In a press conference, Grossi said: For us it is obvious that since it is a Ukrainian facility, the ownership is Energoatom [the Ukrainian state nuclear agency]. With the safety and the security of the plant – and technical operation – we will continue to be guided by the agreements we have with Ukraine. We are an international organisation guided by international law and, as you know very well, annexations are not accepted under international law. Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ordered his government to take over operations at Europe’s largest nuclear power station in southern Ukraine this week. Shelling has hit the vicinity in recent months, with Ukraine and Russia blaming each other for the attacks that have raised fears of a nuclear disaster. US president, Joe Biden, has said he would not rule out meeting with Vladimir Putin during the G20 summit next month in Asia. “That remains to be seen,” the US leader told reporters when asked if he’d use the G20 gathering in Bali, Indonesia, as an opportunity to talk directly with Putin. However, travel plans for both men remain unconfirmed and the White House has said that if Putin attends the G20 summit, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, should also participate, even if Ukraine is not a member of the group. It is unclear whether Putin will attend the summit. Liz Truss has said she considers Vladimir Putin to be the shared foe of Europe for threatening democracy and pushing up energy prices, while her French counterpart, President Emmanuel Macron, is a “friend”. Truss’s comments during the Tory leadership race, when she declined to say whether Mr Macron was a “friend or foe”, were widely criticised. She told broadcasters in Prague, where she is attending the inaugural summit of the European Political Community and will meet with the French president: I work very, very closely with President Macron and the French government and what we’re talking about is how the UK and France can work more closely together to build more nuclear power stations and to make sure that both countries have energy security in the future. We’re both very clear: the foe is Vladimir Putin who has, through his appalling war in Ukraine, threatened freedom and democracy in Europe and pushed up energy prices which we’re now all having to deal with. Asked if Macron was then a friend, Truss said: “He is a friend.” A Russian-installed official in Ukraine has suggested President Vladimir Putin’s defence minister should consider killing himself because of the shame of the defeats in the war in Ukraine, representing an astonishing public insult to Russia’s top brass. After more than seven months of war in Ukraine, Moscow’s most basic war aims have still not been achieved, while Russian forces have suffered a series of battlefield defeats in recent months, forcing Putin to announce a partial mobilisation. In a four-minute video message, Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-installed deputy head of the annexed Kherson region, followed suit, publicly lambasting the “generals and ministers” in Moscow for failing to understand the problems on the front. Stremousov said: Indeed, many say: if they were a defence minister who had allowed such a state of affairs, they could, as officers, have shot themselves. But you know the word ‘officer’ is an incomprehensible word for many. Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza is being investigated for treason, according to his lawyer. State-owned news agency RIA has quoted lawyer Vadim Prokhorov as saying a criminal case for treason – which carries a sentence of up to 20 years – had been opened against Kara-Murza in connection with three of his public speeches. They included an address to the Arizona House of Representatives in which he said Vladimir Putin was bombing Ukrainian homes, hospitals and schools. Moscow says it does not deliberately target civilians, but thousands have been killed in Ukraine. On Thursday, at least three people died when a Russian missile destroyed an apartment block in the city of Zaporizhzhia. The EU has imposed a new round of sanctions on Russia, expanding import and export bans and blacklisting individuals over Moscow’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions. AFP reports: The measures, which came into force with their publication in the bloc’s official administrative journal, also pointed the way to an oil price cap on Russian crude transported around the world but only after details are worked out within the G7 group of nations. The EU regulation said the sanctions were in response to Russia’s “further aggression against Ukraine, the organisation of illegal sham ‘referenda’ in the parts of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions that are currently illegally occupied ... the illegal annexation of those Ukrainian regions ... as well as the mobilisation in the Russian Federation and its repeated threat to use weapons of mass destruction”. Thirty individuals and seven entities were added to the EU blacklist, including singers Yulia Chicherina and Nikolay Rastorguev, among others deemed pro-war “propaganda” artists. Other listings were Russia’s electoral commission and its head, proxy Russian officials in the annexed regions, and Russian defence officials and defence-affiliated companies. The regulation also introduced a “circumvention” list on which individuals or companies helping banned Russian entities get around the EU sanctions would be placed. It was the eighth packet of sanctions the EU has imposed on Russia since the Kremlin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February. The last couple of sanction packets have been losing steam compared with earlier ones, as leading Russian trade, energy, banking, military and political sectors have already been hit. The headline measure in the latest sanctions was meant to be an oil price cap on Russian crude transported around the world. But the legal text published on Thursday did not set out how that would work, leaving it to future deliberations by the European Commission and EU member states in consultation with the G7. The sanctions include expanding a ban to all Russian cryptocurrency transactions, regardless of amount, and the widening of an existing ban on Russian imports, and broadening a prohibition on weapon sales to include personal arms. Also, electronic components that can go into Russian weapons, such as transistors, electronic integrated circuits, controllers, and aerial surveillance cameras are banned for sale to Russia. Additionally, the EU is barring service providers in several sectors from exporting to Russia, including in the fields of legal advice, architecture, engineering and IT consultancy. The Guardian’s foreign correspondent, Peter Beaumont, has shared his impressions from a road towards Kherson today, where he has observed what appears to be the remnants of a big fight, including burnt-out Russian armoured vehicles and cluster munitions. He saw a little farmhouse that had been occupied by three different groups of Russians, which was “smashed to bits and an absolute pigsty”. He could hear Ukrainian artillery far in the distance. He added: This doesn’t feel to me like a small straightening of their line and regrouping but a rout. US Aid has announced $55m (£49.3m) to repair pipes and infrastructure destroyed by Russian troops, to help keep up to 7 million Ukrainians warm this winter. Many recently liberated villages no longer have energy supplies, and residents have been forced to cook their meals outside around open fires. Temperatures are still relatively mild in Ukraine, though they are beginning to fall, and winters are notoriously harsh. An article in today’s Bild looks into a surprising story, in which a local dentist in the recently liberated village of Pisky-Radkivski claims that teeth contained in a horror photo posted by Ukraine’s defence ministry stating they came from a torture chamber are in fact those from his cabinet, and had gone missing after his house was looted by Russians. The dentist, named as Sergey, said: These teeth look like the ones from my collection that was looted here. I’m the only dentist here. So if they were found here, they must be mine. Nearby residents reported to me that Russians apparently used this to scare people. The report adds that although this claim may be untrue, it is certain that torture did take place in the village. Volodymyr Zelenskiy is speaking at the first meeting of the European Political Community today. He has told European heads of state that Ukraine must win so that Russia does not “advance on Warsaw or again on Prague”, according to reporting by Agence France-Presse. Zelenskiy called on Western capitals to supply his army with more weapons “to punish the aggressor”. Ukraine’s general staff has reported that the armed forces liberated 93 settlements since 21 September in north-east Ukraine, while the armed forces advanced 55km (34.1 miles) deep into Russian-occupied territory and took control of more than 2,400 sq km. Norway’s government will restrict access for Russian fishing vessels to its ports in the latest tightening of security after last week’s discovery of significant leaks from the Nord Stream gas pipelines. Russian trawlers will from now on only be allowed to visit three ports and must undergo security checks when they do so, Anniken Huitfeldt, the Norwegian foreign minister, told a news conference. Many more details need to be worked out within the G7 and the European Union before a price cap for Russian seaborne oil deliveries to third countries could take effect, EU officials have said. Reuters reports: The EU agreed this week to the eighth package of sanctions against Russia for waging a war in Ukraine, including an oil cap that would align the bloc with the US and the G7 group of the world’s most industrialised countries, including EU members France, Germany and Italy. But many details are yet to be agreed including the actual pricing mechanism, said the officials, who spoke under condition of anonymity. That means the EU’s decision is more of a first step towards putting in place an oil cap, rather than actually already implementing it. The officials said: Discussions on how the pricing will be set are still needed. They added there was “some time pressure” to figure out the more nuanced approach compared with the EU’s previously agreed blanket ban for European firms on providing insurance and banking services to Russian oil shipments that would otherwise kick in from December. Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the UK’s Labour party, has issued the following statement on Liz Truss’s visit to Europe: I think it’s very important that the opportunity is taken to reassert and re-emphasise the unity of response that we have in relation to [Vladimir] Putin’s aggression and imperialism and I think that’s the single most important thing in relation to the meeting today. Whatever other issues we have with the government, in the UK, I’ve made it clear there will be no political divide in our support for Ukraine, and standing up against Putin’s imperialism. The Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has reassured his Ukrainian counterpart that Athens is in lockstep with its EU and Nato allies in strongly condemning Russia’s illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. Using the inaugural meeting of the European Political Community in Prague to hold talks with Denys Shmyhal, Ukraine’s prime minister, Mitsotakis said Greece would never recognise the change in borders, which he insisted was “in flagrant violation of international law”. Instead, he said, Greece saw the regions as an integral part of Ukraine and fully backed today’s EU council decision to impose a new package of economic and individual sanctions against Russia. Mitsotakis and his centre-right government have said persistently that Greece has elected to be on the “right side of history” by supporting Ukraine after Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion on 24 February. Support has included using the strategic port of Alexandroupolis, in north-east Greece, for the shipment by US armed forces of military material to Ukraine. What were once traditionally strong ties with fellow Orthodox Moscow have been badly strained in the process. This week, Greece’s anti-money laundering authority confirmed it was also investigating what the Kathimerini newspaper described as the “suspicious transfer” of large funds from Russia to the all-male monastic republic of Mount Athos, where monies had been directed to Moscow-friendly monasteries and monks. Several senior Russian officials have visited the Mount in recent months. Reuters has a quick snap that Volodymyr Zelenskiy has asked Ukrainian parliament to approve banker Andriy Pyshnyi as the new chairman of the country’s central bank. Earlier today, the parliament formally accepted the resignation of Kyrylo Shevchenko, who abruptly submitted his resignation on Tuesday, citing health reasons. Ukrainian emergency services said that a total of three bodies have been pulled from rubble after a Russian rocket strike destroyed a five-storey apartment block in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia. Other residents are trapped under rubble, the regional governor and emergency services said. Russia has submitted preliminary objections to a genocide case against Moscow brought by Ukraine. The International Court of Justice, which is the UN’s highest court for disputes between states, has tweeted that it had received the objections on 3 October, but these have not been made public. Parties can file preliminary objections if they believe the court does not have jurisdiction in a case. In a letter to the UN in March, Moscow argued that the ICJ did not have jurisdiction because the genocide convention does not regulate the use of force between states. The filing signifies a change in Moscow’s attitude to the ICJ case. Russia is now engaging with the court, whereas it has previously skipped hearings and not filed documents directly with the court. Ukraine filed a case with the ICJ shortly after Russia’s invasion began, saying Moscow’s justification, that it was acting to prevent a genocide in eastern Ukraine, was unfounded. The next step in the case will be a hearing on the objections against the jurisdiction of the court. No date has been set yet, but it is expected to take place in several months’ time. Reuters has a report on the problems that Russians opposed to the war in Ukraine or fearful of being sent to fight have encountered upon fleeing to Kazakhstan. Worries about money, sudden large increases in housing costs in response to the Russian influx, and scarce jobs are compounded by pressures from family back home – some have even been accused by relatives of betraying their country. And the scale of the exodus has given rise to concerns from some Kazakhs who see the incoming Russians as a potential economic burden and even a security risk. Rents have soared in Kazakhstan and other central Asian nations – as well as Georgia, where some landlords have started adding a “no Russians” clause to their rental ads. The Kazakh government said this week that more than 200,000 Russians had entered the country since Putin’s announcement, and 147,000 had since left. No data is available on their final destinations, though some are thought to have headed to neighbouring former Soviet republics. About 77,000 have registered in Kazakhstan’s national ID system, a prerequisite for getting a job or a bank account. Uzbekistan’s government said on Tuesday it was strengthening border controls, with border guard troops to be involved in vehicle and cargo checks alongside customs officials. Some Kazakh businesses have publicly announced job offers for those fleeing the Russian draft, but some of those offers explicitly stated they were aimed only at ethnic Kazakhs. Reuters has posted a helpful summary of its Ukraine-related reporting from today: Ukraine said its forces have retaken more settlements in Kherson, one of four partially Russian-occupied regions that President Vladimir Putin formally incorporated into Russia in Europe’s biggest annexation since the second world war. A Russian rocket strike destroyed a five-storey apartment block in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, killing at least one woman and leaving other residents trapped under rubble, the regional governor said. The bodies of two Russian soldiers lay bloating in trees on opposite sides of the road, close to the blasted hulks of the cars and the van in which Ukrainian army officers said the dead men’s unit was retreating into the eastern town of Lyman. Dozens of firefighters doused blazes in a town near Kyiv after multiple strikes caused by what officials said were Iranian-made loitering munitions, often known as “kamikaze drones”. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the battlefield reports. Putin signed laws admitting the Donetsk People’s Republic, the Luhansk People’s Republic, Kherson region and Zaporizhzhia region into Russia in the biggest expansion of Russian territory in at least half a century. He also said Russia would stabilise the situation in the regions, indirectly acknowledging the challenges it faces to assert its control. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, accused Russia on Thursday of “nuclear blackmail” over its seizure of the Zaporizhzhia power plant in southern Ukraine. The Kremlin said it was preparing to welcome the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to Moscow soon. Putin said he expected sanctions pressure on the Russian economy to intensify, in televised remarks from a meeting with government officials. The European Union gave its final approval for a new batch of sanctions, the bloc’s executive arm said. They include more limits on trade with Russia in steel and tech products, and an oil price cap for Russian seaborne crude deliveries through European insurers to align the EU with Washington. A crime scene investigation of the damages on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines has strengthened suspicions of “gross sabotage”, Swedish security police. Alexander Novak, the Russian deputy prime minister, said Moscow might cut oil production to offset negative effects from price caps imposed by the west over Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Europe may limp through the cold winter months with the help of brimming natural gas tanks despite a plunge in deliveries from Russia, only to enter a deeper energy crisis next year, the head of the International Energy Agency said. The Kremlin denied reports that 700,000 Russians had fled the country since Moscow announced a mobilisation drive to call up hundreds of thousands to fight in Ukraine. US intelligence agencies believe parts of the Ukrainian government authorised a car bomb attack near Moscow in August that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist, the New York Times reported. The Opec+ group of leading oil producers decided to reduce output by 2 million barrels per day to stabilise the market, according to a Kremlin spokesperson. Dmitry Peskov also said that by agreeing to reduce output, Opec+ has confirmed its credentials as an organisation responsible for market stability. The Saudi-led Opec+ cartel at a Vienna meeting on Wednesday ignored pleas from the White House to keep oil flowing and agreed the cut, its deepest since the Covid-19 pandemic. Separately, Peskov said that the Kremlin is preparing to welcome the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic energy agency (IAEA), to Moscow soon. The visit is likely to focus on the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, located in southern Ukraine in territory that Russia has proclaimed its own. He added that he understands there are no plans to invite Moscow to join an investigation into Nord Stream gas leaks. Nevertheless, Russia considers it is impossible to conduct such an investigation without Moscow’s participation. The Kremlin has denied reports that 700,000 Russians have fled the country since Moscow announced a mobilisation drive that it said would call up hundreds of thousands to fight in Ukraine. In a briefing with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he did not have exact figures for how many people had left the country since Vladimir Putin’s announcement on 21 September of a “partial mobilisation” that has called members of the general public up to the military. During today’s Kremlin briefing, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was asked about Wednesday’s New York Times report, which revealed that United States intelligence agencies believed parts of the Ukrainian government authorised the car bomb attack near Moscow in August that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist. The report said that US officials feared this was an element of a covert campaign that could widen the conflict. Peskov’s response was that Russian intelligence had always argued that Ukraine was behind the August killing of Darya Dugina so it was “positive” that the United States appeared to share that assessment. Kyiv on Thursday rejected the claims it was involved in the attack. Rachel Hall here taking over the blog – if there’s anything we’ve missed, do drop me a line. Russia hit the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia with seven rockets, flattening an apartment building early on Thursday morning. The city’s authorities told Ukraine’s public broadcaster, Suspilne, that at least two had died and at least another five were trapped under the rubble, although later reports revised the death toll down to one. Rescue workers at the scene said they saved a three-year-old girl. Zaporizhzhia’s branch of Suspilne reported more explosions in the city at mid-morning Kyiv time. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to admit severe losses in Ukraine, conceding the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals and insisting Russia would “stabilise” the situation in four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. “We are working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise,” Putin told Russian teachers during a televised video call on Wednesday. The UN nuclear agency chief is en route to Kyiv to discuss creating a security zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after Putin ordered his government to take it over. “On our way to Kyiv for important meetings,” the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head, Rafael Grossi, wrote on Twitter, saying the need for a protection zone around the site was “more urgent than ever”. Grossi is also expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant. The IAEA said it had learned of plans to restart one reactor at the plant, where all six reactors have been shut down for weeks. Ukraine’s forces are pushing their advance in the east and south, forcing Russian troops to retreat under pressure on both fronts. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukraine’s military had made major, rapid advances against Russian forces in the past week, taking back dozens of towns in regions in the south and east that Russia has declared annexed. Military experts say Russia is at its weakest point, partly because of its decision not to mobilise earlier and partly because of massive losses of troops and equipment. Ukraine has extended its area of control in the Kherson region by six to 12 miles, according to its military’s southern command. Zelenskiy confirmed the recapture of the villages of Novovoskresenske, Novohryhorivka and Petropavlivka, saying the settlements were “liberated from the sham referendum and stabilised”, in an address on Wednesday. Kherson region’s Moscow-appointed governor, Kirill Stremousov, said the withdrawal was a tactical “regrouping” to “deliver a retaliatory blow”. The extent of Russia’s retreat remains unclear. Moscow’s forces have left behind smashed towns once under occupation and, in places, mass burial sites and evidence of torture chambers. In Lyman, which was retaken by Ukrainian forces on Sunday, more than 50 graves have been found, some marked with names, others with numbers, the Kyiv-based outlet Hromadske reported on Wednesday. Leaders of 44 European countries on Thursday in Prague will send a clear signal of Russia’s isolation and try to create a new order without Moscow, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said this morning. “The meeting is looking for a new order without Russia,” he told reporters. The UN has warned Russia’s claimed annexation of Ukraine territory will only exacerbate human rights violations. Christian Salazar Volkmann said UN experts had documented “a range of violations of the rights to life, liberty and security” and warned the situation would only worsen as Russia pushes forward with the annexation of some Ukrainian regions. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I am handing over to Rachel Hall. I will be back later on. Here is a video clip showing some of the scenes in Zaporizhzhia after today’s attacks. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Nato to “demonstrate that they are not afraid of Russia”. During a video-link interview with the Lowy Institute in Australia on Thursday, Zelenskiy was asked whether he had received any response from Nato, and how quickly he expected the alliance to act on the application. He said his key message was: “You don’t need to be afraid of anyone.” Zelenskiy said it was important to build “security guarantees for the whole world so that nobody would have even a thought to become autocratic, and even if you’re autocratic that you shouldn’t have even a single thought that you can conquer the other territories or other nations”. “For that, you must have to be united. And I think that without Ukraine, Nato is not such a strong alliance, particularly the European continent. I believe for the strength in the east of Europe this is a very important step. We can offer this chance to Nato. We are grateful for their support to Nato. We are giving this opportunity at a very important moment.” Zelenskiy appealed for his Nato partners to show resolve. “Not only Ukraine has to demonstrate its strengths to Russia, but the alliance has also to demonstrate that they are not afraid of Russia. It’s a question to Nato. But I know that everyone realises that security guarantees for Ukraine are something that is necessary. And I think we are on that path. We shall definitely take this path. How fast it’s going to be, unfortunately, it depends not only on Ukraine.” Zelenskiy announced last week that Ukraine was officially applying for membership of Nato, after Vladimir Putin said he was annexing four Ukrainian provinces. Maria Zakharova is giving her weekly press briefing for Russia’s foreign ministry. So far she has stated that it would be impossible to investigate the damage to the Nord Stream pipelines without Russian involvement, and accused Denmark of being unwilling to cooperate and said that the west was creating obstacles to the repair work. She criticised Ukraine’s contribution to the grain export deal, saying it was depriving grain exports to poorer countries, and denied claims that Russia had damaged grain silos or agricultural land, reiterating that the armed forces of the Russian Federation only target military infrastructure. Reporter Kateryna Malofieieva is in Zaporizhzhia and has posted to say that rescue work in the Ukrainian city is being interrupted by air-raid sirens that force first responders to shelter. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has commented on this morning’s attacks on Zaporizhzhia, saying: Overnight, seven Russian missiles have hit people sleeping peacefully at their homes in Zaporizhzhia. More have struck during the day. Russians keep deliberately striking civilians to sow fear. Russian terror must be stopped — by force of weapons, sanctions, and full isolation. Here are some of the images of the aftermath from today’s attack on the city of Zaporizhzhia by Russian forces. The UK’s ministry of defence has published this map today of how it assesses the latest territorial situation on the ground. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, has said overnight Russian forces shelled across the front line in multiple locations. He reported that one civilian was wounded and that houses were damaged in several settlements. The claims have not been independently verified. Donetsk is one of the regions that Russia claims to have annexed without fully controlling the territory. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said he hopes a vote at the UN general assembly next week condemning Russia’s purported annexation of Ukrainian territory will be “as unanimous as possible”. Zelenskiy is addressing the Sydney-based Lowy Institute by video link on Thursday. In his opening remarks, Zelenskiy urged Australia to help secure an overwhelming UN vote against Russia’s actions: “I’m asking Australia to use all of its influence to convince as many countries as possible not to remain neutral and to vote for international law and against a Russian annexation.” Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, Oleksandr Starukh, has issued an update on the strikes in Zaporizhzhia this morning, revising the death toll down to one for now. He writes: So far it is known about the death of one woman. The death of another person has not been confirmed. Thanks to the doctors, her life was saved. Seven people were injured of varying degrees of severity, they were treated, including one three-year-old child. The rescue operation is still ongoing. The number of victims may vary. The number of victims could have been much higher, but thanks to the timely and professional actions of the Zaporizhzhia state emergency service, 21 victims were already saved. Russia hit the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia with seven rockets, flattening an apartment building on early on Thursday morning. The city’s authorities told Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne at least two have died and at least another five are trapped under the rubble, although later reports revised the death toll down to one. Rescue workers at the scene said they saved one three-year-old girl. Zaporizhzhia’s branch of Suspline reported more explosions in the city at mid-morning Kyiv time. Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, said on Telegram: “Attention. Another enemy missile attack. Stay in shelters”. Russia launched two rockets at the central Ukrainian city of Khmelnytsky, but both reportedly missed their targets. Elsewhere, Russia used what the Ukrainian authorities say are Iranian-supplied kamikaze drones to target the cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Odesa. Ukraine’s military say they managed to shoot down 18 additional drones before they reached Odesa and Mykolaiv. As the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont reported, the Iranian drones are able to remain airborne for several hours and circle over potential targets, the drones are designed to be flown into enemy troops, armour or buildings, exploding on impact – explaining their description as kamikaze drones. The city of Zaporizhzhia is the administrative centre of the Zaporizhzhia region which Russia claims to have annexed. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the exiled leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus, has commented on today’s strikes on Zaporizhzhia, saying: The Russian attack on residential buildings in Zaporizhzhia is another shameful act of terror against the population of Ukraine. Thousands of innocent adults &amp; children have paid with their lives for Putin and Lukashenko’s war. They lose on the battlefield &amp; take revenge on civilians. Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, has alerted people to an another attack on Telegram, posting “Attention. Another enemy missile attack. Stay in shelters”. If you need a reminder, this animated map posted by Ukraine’s minister of defence Oleksii Reznikov yesterday shows the territory that the Ukrainian armed forces have claimed to recapture during their counteroffensive over the last month. The BBC’s Paul Adams reports hearing three more loud explosions in Zaporizhzhia in the last few minutes. Kirill Stremousov, one of the Russian-imposed leaders in the occupied region of Kherson which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex, has been very vocal on Telegram in the last couple of days, attempting to counter any narrative that Ukrainian forces are making any progress in the south. This morning he has, without presenting evidence, again asserted that the defences in Kherson are holding. He said: The situation in the Kherson region is unchanged. The Kherson region is holding back the onslaught of the Ukronazis who are trying to break into Kherson. We repeat once again that despite the panic that is dispersed in the media, in the Kherson region, the ministry of defence and the Russian Guard stand to the death. The advances of the Ukronazis, fascists, Germans, Americans and other mercenaries have been stopped. The Russian Federation has signed into law an annexation of the Kherson region, despite not fully controlling it. Leaders of 44 European countries on Thursday in Prague will send a clear signal of Russia’s isolation and try to create a new order without Moscow, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said this morning. “The meeting is looking for a new order without Russia,” Reuters reports he told reporters in Prague. The Kremlin has published details of the decree that Vladimir Putin signed yesterday to “correct” aspects of the partial mobilisation. Russian state media RIA Novosti reports: According to the decree, the deferment is granted to those who receive education of the appropriate level for the first time in full-time and part-time (evening) forms of education. Students, graduate students and residents enrolled in state-accredited programmes of secondary and higher professional education also have this right. In addition, the basis for the postponement will be training in organisations located on the territories of innovative scientific and technological centres, as well as in spiritual educational organisations. Ukraine’s ministry of internal affairs has confirmed that seven Russian rocket attacks hit the city of Zaporizhzhia overnight. It says that first responders are present, and that “work is ongoing, all relevant services are on site”. Regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, earlier said that one woman was confirmed to have died in the attack while another person died in an ambulance. “At least five people are under the rubble of buildings,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Thursday morning. Images posted by the ministry included pictures of debris on fire, and rescue workers clambering through the rubble of a destroyed high-rise building, which had collapsed on to cars parked in front of it. Ivan Fedorov, Ukraine’s elected mayor of Melitopol, said on Telegram: “Dozens of people are under the rubble. The number of victims increases every hour. This is how the Russian terrorist hits civilians with its ‘high-precision’ weapons. It hits civilians and infrastructure, because it demonstrates to the whole world its worthlessness on the battlefield.” The city of Zaporizhzhia is the administrative centre of the Zaporizhzhia oblast, one of the regions of Ukraine that Russia has claimed to annex, despite not controlling all of the territory there. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, has posted a status update to Telegram to report no casualties overnight in his region. However he says that the region was again attacked by Shahed-136 “kamikaze drones”, and that some residential and farm buildings as well as agricultural lands has been damaged. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian-imposed authorities in the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, occupied Ukrainian territory which the Russian Federation has claimed to annex, have issued casualty figures for the last 24 hours. They claim that six civilians have been wounded and three killed by shelling from Ukrainian armed forces. Additionally they say that 12 houses and five civil infrastructure facilities were damaged. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam in London, you can reach me on martin.belam@theguardian.com Before I hand you over to my colleague Martin Belam here is a rundown of where things stand as of 9am in Ukraine. Two people have been killed after Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia was allegedly hit by Russian missiles in the early hours of Thursday morning. Regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said one woman was confirmed to have died in the attack while another person died in an ambulance. “At least five people are under the rubble of buildings,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Thursday morning. Starukh earlier alleged Russia “fired 7 rockets at high-rise buildings” while rescuers continue to pull people out from under the rubble. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to admit severe losses in Ukraine, conceding the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals and insisting Russia would “stabilise” the situation in four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. “We are working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise,” Putin told Russian teachers during a televised video call on Wednesday.

The UN has warned Russia’s claimed annexation of Ukraine territory will only exacerbate human rights violations. Christian Salazar Volkmann, said UN experts had documented “a range of violations of the rights to life, liberty and security” and warned the situation would only worsen as Russia pushes forward with the annexation of some Ukrainian regions. European leaders are set to meet in Prague on Thursday in the face of Russia’s war. Leaders from Ukraine, Britain and Turkey will join their EU counterparts in Prague on Thursday for a summit aimed at bringing the continent together in the face of Russia’s aggression. The gathering has been billed by Brussels as a “platform for political coordination” for the disparate 44 nations attending. Attempts to play down retreats in Ukraine are no longer washing inside Russia with the latest military failures spilling on to local television screens. “Why do we advance metre by metre when they advance village by village?” Olga Skabeyeva, the country’s top state-TV host, asked a Russia-appointed official in Luhansk in a recent broadcast. Pro-war military bloggers and journalists are also criticising the Kremlin and painting a bleak picture of deteriorating Russian morale. Russia is lobbying for a secret ballot instead of a public vote when the 193-member UN General Assembly next week considers whether to condemn Moscow’s move to annex four partially occupied regions in Ukraine. The car bombing that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of prominent Russian political figure Alexander Dugin, was allegedly authorised by elements within the Ukrainian government, according to US intelligence sources who spoke with the New York Times and CNN. The United States took no part in the attack, either by providing intelligence or other assistance, the officials said.

Pro-war military bloggers and journalists are also criticising the Kremlin and painting a bleak picture of deteriorating Russian morale. Roman Saponkov, a prominent war correspondent, described his despair over the pullback in Kherson on his Telegram channel: Friends, I know you’re waiting for me to comment on the situation. But I really don’t know what to say to you. The retreat … is catastrophic.” Aleksandr Kots, a pro-Kremlin journalist who travels with with the Russian army, added: “We do not have enough people … fatigue has set in … there is no longer any strength left to hold on to the territories won.” Two people have been killed after an alleged Russian missile attack hit Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Thursday morning. Regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said one woman was confirmed to have died in the attack while another person died in an ambulance. “At least 5 people are under the rubble of buildings,” Starukh wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Thursday morning. “Many people were saved. Among them is a three-year-old girl, the child is in foster care. A rescue operation is underway at the scene.” Starukh earlier alleged Russia “fired 7 rockets at high-rise buildings” while rescuers continue to pull people out from under the rubble. Bodies of Russian soldiers, shredded uniforms and burned out military vehicles litter parts of Lyman in Ukraine after it was liberated from Russian occupation. The city in Donetsk became the latest strategically important city Russian occupiers surrendered as the Kremlin faces heavy losses. The gains by Ukraine come after Russia illegally claimed four territories as its own last week. Russia is lobbying for a secret ballot instead of a public vote when the 193-member UN General Assembly next week considers whether to condemn Moscow’s move to annex four partially occupied regions in Ukraine. Ukraine and its allies have denounced the votes in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia as illegal and coercive. A western-drafted UN General Assembly resolution would condemn Russia’s “illegal so-called referenda” and the “attempted illegal annexation” of the areas where voting occurred. Meanwhile, the UN has warned Russia’s claimed annexation of Ukraine territory will only exacerbate human rights violations. Christian Salazar Volkmann, said UN experts had documented “a range of violations of the rights to life, liberty and security” and warned the situation would only worsen as Russia pushes forward with annexing the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The referendums have been dismissed as a “sham” by the west. “With the purported annexation... the Russian Federation has taken steps which deepen rather than resolve the conflict, and exacerbate the human rights violations associated with it,” Salazar Volkmann said. Leaders from Ukraine, Britain and Turkey will join their EU counterparts in Prague on Thursday for a summit aimed at bringing the continent together in the face of Russia’s aggression. The gathering has been billed by Brussels as a “platform for political coordination” for the disparate 44 nations attending. Those set to meet also include the leaders of Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia, Georgia, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Switzerland. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will connect via video link from Kyiv as his prime minister will stand in for him at the talks, according to AFP. British Prime Minister Liz Truss is set to tell fellow leaders: Europe is facing its biggest crisis since the Second World War. And we have faced it together with unity and resolve. We must continue to stand firm - to ensure that Ukraine wins this war, but also to deal with the strategic challenges that it has exposed.” Despite the rhetoric there are expected to be few concrete results from the summit. EU officials expect to agree to hold a follow-up gathering of the community in six months’ time in a country outside the bloc, with Britain and Moldova both offering to host. Unconfirmed reports of shelling in Ukraine’s southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia has damaged or destroyed several residential buildings overnight leaving some residents trapped under rubble, according to the region’s governor. “As a result of the enemy attacks, fires broke out in the city,” Oleksandr Starukh wrote on the Telegram messaging app early on Thursday morning. “There are possible casualties. Rescuers are already pulling people out from under the rubble.” Starukh later alleged Russia “fired 7 rockets at high-rise buildings” and said the number of victims is still being clarified. As Russian troops have retreated, they have left behind smashed towns once under occupation and, in places, mass burial sites and evidence of torture chambers. The Guardian’s Isobel Koshiw brings us this dispatch from Kyiv. In the town of Lyman, which was retaken by Ukrainian forces on Sunday, more than 50 graves have been found, some marked with names, others with numbers, the Kyiv-based outlet Hromadske reported on Wednesday. The Russians forced Ukrainians they suspected of collaborating to collect bodies and bury them. One boy, who was detained by the Russians and forced to bury bodies, told Hromadske that some of the bodies were left lying on the street for a long time. More evidence of tortured and extrajudicial killings has been discovered in Kharkiv region. Two civilians corpses aged 30-35 were found in a grave in the village of Novoplatonivka, Kharkiv region, according to Ukrainian authorities. The left hand of one man was handcuffed to the right hand of the second man. Investigators said one of the skulls was fractured and the other had suffered a gun shot wound to the head. Kharkiv prosecutors and police said 250-350 Russian special forces were stationed near the grave. They said their initial suspicion is that the men were killed by Russian special forces. In Pisky-Radkivskyi, another village in Kharkiv region, Ukraine authorities said they found another torture chamber. Serhii Bolvinov, chief investigator for Kharkiv region said: “Neighbours constantly heard screams from here. Investigators found a terrible torture chamber in the village. “Police have been made aware of the torture of burying people alive and the use of a gas mask with a smouldering rag.” Ukraine’s forces are pushing their advance in the east and south, forcing Russian troops to retreat under pressure on both fronts. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s military had made major, rapid advances against Russian forces in the past week, taking back dozens of towns in regions in the south and east that Russia has declared annexed.

Kherson region’s Moscow-appointed governor, Kirill Stremousov, said Russia’s withdrawal was a tactical “regrouping” to “deliver a retaliatory blow”. The extent of Russia’s retreat remains unclear for now. Ukraine’s minister of defence, Oleksii Reznikov, said his soldiers “continue moving forward” in its autumn offensive. “While the ‘Russian parliament’ is intoxicated from the futile attempts at annexation, our soldiers continue moving forward,” he said in a Twitter post on Thursday. “This is the best answer to any and all ‘referenda’, ‘decrees’, ‘treaties’ and pathetic speeches.” The UN nuclear agency chief will shortly arrive in Kyiv to discuss creating a security zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after Putin ordered his government to take it over. “On our way to Kyiv for important meetings,” International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi wrote on Twitter, saying the need for a protection zone around the site was “more urgent than ever”. Putin earlier signed a decree ordering the Russian government to take control of Europe’s largest atomic plant and make it “federal property”. Grossi is also expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss safety at the plant, Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported. The IAEA said it had learned of plans to restart one reactor at the plant, where all six reactors have been shut down for weeks. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to concede the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals in Ukraine, insisting Russia will “stabilise” the situation in the four Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. Putin told Russian teachers during a televised video call on Wednesday: We are working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise.” His comments appear to indirectly acknowledge the challenges Moscow faces to assert its control. When later asked by journalists whether there was a contradiction between Russia’s annexation rhetoric and the reality on the ground, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there was none. There is no contradiction whatsoever. They will be with Russia forever and they will be returned.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments for the next few hours. Ukraine’s forces are pushing their advance in the east and south, forcing Russian troops to retreat under pressure on both fronts. In the Kherson region, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s military has made major advances against Russian forces and recaptured the villages of Novovoskresenske, Novohryhorivka and Petropavlivka during a Wednesday evening address. The UN nuclear agency chief, Rafael Grossi, will shortly arrive in Kyiv to discuss creating a security zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after Putin ordered his government to take it over. Here are all the major developments you may have missed: The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to admit severe losses in Ukraine, conceding the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals and insisting Russia would “stabilise” the situation in four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. “We are working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise,” Putin told Russian teachers during a televised video call on Wednesday.

The request from the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, is widely seen as symbolic and appears to be the latest example of nuclear signalling to deter Putin. The White House, however, said it had not received such a request. The car bombing that killed Darya Dugina, the daughter of prominent Russian political figure Alexander Dugin, was allegedly authorised by elements within the Ukrainian government, according to US intelligence sources who spoke with the New York Times and CNN. The United States took no part in the attack, either by providing intelligence or other assistance, the officials said.

Do most listeners mentally, if not actually, tune out during these patently dull “farming bits” the Ministry of Agriculture once levered into proceedings? Back in the day, they were the pedagogical pill for which the rural adultery, mutual loathing, etc, were merely the sweeteners. I admit I find them marvellously soothing. The real story of The Archers, however, may be about the characters’ relentless pursuit of sugary baked goods: faced with Natasha’s gestational diabetes, her parents-in-law, Tony and Pat, have decided to “have an affair” with puddings, setting forth for secret cheesecake in the Orangery at Lower Loxley and clandestine sticky toffee pudding at the Feathers. “The world’s our rum baba,” claimed Tony, inaccurately: as we all know, there’s a mystery forcefield preventing him from leaving Borsetshire at all. When someone asked Kathy Perks whether you can get Radio Borsetshire in Hereford, the answer should have been a resounding no, just like you can’t get Radio Brigadoon in Perth. Yes, Kathy Perks! After years of silence, the manager of Grey Gables is audible again – revealed as the mystery wearer of the Easter bunny costume who, face it, was never going to be Rob Titchener returned in disguise to abduct little Jack, though that would have been quite exciting. She’s reappeared just in time for Oliver and his new business partner, Adil, to pull a P&amp;O and make the entire workforce of Grey Gables redundant without a statutory consultation period. It had to happen: the fabled gables were increasingly, well, grey and, by the sounds of it, peeling. It seems it’s going to be renovated for a year and reopened as a slightly less terrible hotel. I would have thought a different business might provide more plot opportunities. Nuclear power station, à la Springfield? Young offenders’ unit? Asylum seekers’ “reception centre”? That would be nicely topical, what with the real-life plans to establish “Guantánamo-on-Ouse” in a bucolic Yorkshire village. Ruairi has come back from university – in an eyebrow-raisingly implausible twist – on the game, or at least being kept in expensive booze and holiday flats by one Julianne, a loaded older woman.

The energy secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, set out legislation on Tuesday that would share the early construction costs with consumers, with the aim of reducing the UK’s reliance on overseas funding for nuclear projects by making them more attractive to domestic investors. The long-awaited legislation could also pave the way for the government to take a direct stake in the Sizewell C nuclear plant by using tens of millions of pounds of public money during its risky development phase – replacing the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN), which has a 20% share of the project. Kwarteng said the existing financing scheme, which was used to back the Hinkley Point C nuclear scheme in Somerset, had led to “too many overseas nuclear developers walking away from projects, setting Britain back years”. The legal backing for a new financing model is expected to help clear the way for the energy firm EDF to build Sizewell C in Suffolk after years of wrangling over how to fund the huge upfront cost of constructing a nuclear plant. Under the new financing framework, known as a regulated asset base (RAB) model, EDF would start earning money – collected from energy bills – long before the reactor begins generating electricity. The government said each household would not have to pay more than a few pounds a year extra on its bills to support the project during construction, but Sizewell C could save households more than £30bn over the facility’s lifetime. The plant, which is still going through the planning process, could eventually power 6m homes, but has been plagued by opposition from local campaigners, concerns about costs and the involvement of state-owned CGN. CGN is a minority partner in EDF’s Hinkley Point scheme, and is interested in building its own reactor at Bradwell-on-Sea in Essex. However, its involvement in the nuclear industry has faced growing worries over national security. The US has urged the UK to cut the company from its nuclear programme. Kwarteng said: “We urgently need a new approach to attract British funds and other private investors to back new large-scale nuclear power stations.” The government’s nuclear ambitions have foundered in recent years, with companies including the South Korea power utility company Kepco and Japan’s Hitachi and Toshiba abandoning plans to build in the UK. Greg Hands, the minister for energy and clean growth, said the legislation would help the UK to build “the new nuclear power stations we need to ensure a resilient, low-carbon electricity system for future generations. “This finance model will also support the UK’s thriving civil nuclear industry, which currently employs 60,000 in high-skilled jobs, and help create thousands more as we level up opportunities across the whole country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/sep/28/will-labours-energy-plans-work","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-28T07:00:01Z","webTitle":"Will Labour’s energy plans work?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/28/will-labours-energy-plans-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/sep/28/will-labours-energy-plans-work","fields":{"headline":"Will Labour’s energy plans work?","bodyText":"Labour’s ambitious plan for zero-carbon power by 2030 raises legitimate questions – which we’ll come to shortly – but the commentary in rightwing newspapers is bizarrely wide of the mark. Perhaps the strangest was a Daily Telegraph editorial that claimed Labour’s plan “would make the country more dependent on imported gas, not less”. As should be obvious, the opposite is true. The UK used 254 terawatt hours (TWh) of gas last year to generate 123TWh of electricity, 40% of the national total. Under Labour’s plan, gas demand for electricity would be 97% lower by 2030. (Why does it take 254TWh of gas to make 123TWh of electricity? Simply because burning fossil fuels is inefficient and half of the energy in the gas is wasted at the power station.) The UK’s low-carbon electricity sources are already saving huge amounts of gas: In 2022 to date, nuclear and renewables have generated 129TWh, more than the 95TWh we got from gas. The Daily Telegraph editorial echoed comments made by the likes of Darren Grimes and Julia Hartley-Brewer, who complained that we “can’t rely on solar or wind to keep our lights on”. Similarly, while interviewing the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg asked if fossil fuels would still be needed as backup in 2030, pointing to low wind output last Friday. Elsewhere, the Daily Mail said Starmer had been “forced to backtrack” by “admit[ting]” fossil fuels might still be used as backup under his 2030 plan. This was not so much an admission as a reiteration: Labour’s own press release had said it would “maintain … a strategic reserve of backup gas power”, as well as a range of other sources. Indeed, Labour’s plan does not rely on wind and solar alone. The hour-by-hour electricity system modelling behind Labour’s plans shows what would fill the gaps when the wind does not blow. In line with the clear consensus that cheap renewables will make up the bulk of electricity supplies in the future, Labour sees wind and solar making up about 70% of the electricity mix in 2030. Almost all of the remaining 30% of the nation’s electricity would come from a mixture of other low-carbon sources including additional new nuclear plants, other renewables and hydrogen. The modelling then leaves a very small share – about 0.7% of annual electricity in 2030 – coming from gas power. A further 0.5% would come from gas plants fitted with carbon capture equipment that prevents their carbon dioxide emissions from reaching the atmosphere. It’s clear that it would be possible to run a reliable UK electricity system on virtually 100% clean power, even during so-called “kalte dunkelflaute” with cold weather and little wind or sun. It’s also worth noting that Labour is not alone in imagining a fully decarbonised UK electricity system will soon be possible. The current government ambition, which is also backed by detailed modelling, is for 95% clean power by 2030 and close to 100% by 2035. Similarly, the National Grid Electricity System Operator has set out a range of “credible ways” to meet the UK’s net zero 2050 target, including one which reaches 98% clean power by 2030. Nevertheless, there are legitimate questions about the pace of Labour’s ambition, which would imply going from the current level of about 55% clean power to 99% in less than a decade. This rate of change would be historically unprecedented, at the same time as electricity demand increases to meet growing demand from electric vehicles and heat pumps. Until the 1960s, fossil fuels supplied more than 95% of the UK’s electricity. The development of nuclear power pushed the low-carbon share of electricity towards 25% by the late 1980s, where it remained into the early part of this century. More recently, the rapid growth of wind, solar and other renewables has seen the UK transform its electricity supply in a decade. Yet despite clean sources growing their share of UK electricity by 2.9 percentage points every year since 2010, fossil fuels still make up 45% of the total. Reaching Labour’s ambition for 99% by 2030 would mean increasing the rate of growth from 2.9 percentage points a year up to 4.9, starting this year. If this sprint only begins after the next election in 2024, the pace would need to be faster, at more than 7 percentage points a year. These are not only mathematical challenges – and it is not only a matter of doubling onshore wind, tripling solar and quadrupling offshore wind, as Starmer has pledged. (Meeting these renewable targets is likely to require planning reform to speed up the process of approvals.) If Labour’s goal is to be met, the UK must also build new nuclear plants, gas plants with carbon capture and storage, hydrogen turbines with clean hydrogen to fuel them, along with huge increases in electricity network capacity, energy storage and “demand-side response”. While the UK need not follow the precise pathway set out in the modelling behind Labour’s proposals, it would need an equivalent set of alternatives to reach close to 100% clean power. And even if Labour’s 2030 target proves too ambitious to meet, the government’s goal of a fully decarbonised electricity system by 2035 is not exactly far behind. Regardless of these question marks, one thing is for sure – whatever the editorial pages of the Daily Telegraph suggests: Whether the UK reaches 100% clean power by 2030 or 2035, the shift towards wind, solar and other low-carbon sources is 100% guaranteed to cut our demand for gas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/28/a-greener-marx-kohei-saito-on-connecting-communism-with-the-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-28T06:00:14Z","webTitle":"A greener Marx?

Kohei Saito on connecting communism with the climate crisis","bodyText":"When academic Kohei Saito submitted his manuscript on Karl Marx, the ecological crisis and arguments for degrowth economics, he hoped it might introduce at least some people in Japan to a new perspective on the climate crisis. Fast forward three years and the subsequent book, Capital in the Anthropocene, has sold more than half a million copies and Saito, a thoughtful 36-year-old, is now something of a Marxist celebrity. “It was a big surprise,” admits Saito on Zoom from his study in Tokyo, “because who cares about Marx and communism?” Now Saito, who says he has not always been a “degrowth communist”, has written a more academic text, Marx in the Anthropocene, which builds on those arguments to propose degrowth communism as a “new way of living”. At a time when degrowth economics is being hotly debated within and outside the environmental movement, Saito’s aim, he explains, is to “overcome the divide between Marxism and degrowth”, bringing together the red and the green. Many in the environmental movement argue that capitalism and its “infinite accumulation on a finite planet … is the root cause of climate breakdown”, writes Saito. But because Marx’s writings on ecology have often been marginalised, there’s a view that his socialism is pro-technological and anti-ecological – supporting the development of technologies to lay the foundation for a post-capitalist society and ignoring nature’s limits, believing it can be dominated by humans. According to Saito, it is possible and necessary to reconstruct Marx so we can see how he analysed economic and ecological crisis. Saito first studied Marx when he was an undergrad at the University of Tokyo, trying to understand degrading working conditions among temporary workers in Japan. After the earthquake and the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, he realised “how capitalism is not just simply exploiting workers but also seriously degrading the environment”. Influenced by scholars who made the case for Marx as an ecological thinker – including Paul Burkett and John Bellamy Foster – Saito sharpened his analysis studying in the US and began to learn German before his next move. It was in Berlin, where he researched his PhD-cum-award-winning book, that he became involved in editing the new complete works of Marx and Friedrich Engels, Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe, including some of Marx’s long-neglected notebooks. “If you look at his notebooks, one realises he studies two weird fields: one is natural science and the other one is capitalist societies.” While Marx was supposed to be finishing Volume II and III of Capital, he was “actually studying natural science, chemistry, geology”. This shift points to a vital change in Marx’s thinking, argues Saito. “With his growing interest in ecology,” Saito writes, “Marx came to see the plunder of the natural environment as a manifestation of the central contradiction of capitalism.” By synthesising these different approaches, Saito developed a “unique way of reading Marx”, he says, as a “degrowth ecological communist”. Degrowth argues that economic growth – the holy grail for governments in most countries – is simply not sustainable and that to stop climate breakdown, we need to reduce consumption. Saito cites Jason Hickel’s work as one example. He is conscious of the critique that denying many countries in the global south the chance to “develop” in the way the north has could be destructive to people who are already very poor. Woven throughout Marx in the Anthropocene is a mindfulness of this global imbalance. “Like many degrowth people I limit the scope of the argument to the global north, developed countries like the UK, Japan and the US. I am obviously pro-growth for those poor countries in the global south.” What is needed to achieve that is a new idea of “abundance” and “progress”, Saito says. Everyone on the planet should have access to the basic things we need to live – electricity, water, education – but “we need to come up with a vision where mass production, mass consumption and mass waste can be avoided.” Crucial to imagining this alternative world is another strand of thinking in Marx’s notebooks: his interest in pre-capitalist, non-western societies. Contra to the ethnocentrism in some of his earlier work, in the end, Marx emphasised “the importance of learning” from these parts of the world “for the western societies”. Informed by this and his ecological studies, Marx’s idea of communism changed significantly, and was no longer growth-driven. “The pre-capitalist society had a unique way of communal regulations of land,” Saito says, “and they also imposed various rules on their production and consumption which realised a more steady-state of sustainable production.” Still, you may wonder why such a deep engagement with a 19th-century thinker matters today. Saito argues that Marx’s way of understanding the relationship between humans and nature – encapsulated in the theory of “metabolic rift”, a vigorously debated subject in Marxist circles – can determine how we respond to the climate and ecological crisis we now face. The basic premise of this thesis is that human/nature interaction is the “basis of living”, but capitalism organises “human interactions with their ecosystems” in such a way that it creates “a great chasm in these processes and threatens both human and nonhuman beings”, Saito says. Some criticise this concept, arguing that it divides nature and society so as to ignore how the former is completely transformed by capitalism. But Saito doesn’t agree. His use of the term Anthropocene is meant to recognise that the “entire planet is now fully transformed by our economic activities”, but he rejects that this means we don not have to distinguish between nature and society. If we understand the two as the same, Saito argues, we risk believing environmental problems can be overcome through more human intervention. We must be attuned to the differences to grasp what “we cannot change” – such as temperature increases due to CO2 and the natural chain reactions that flow from that – and what we can: most urgently “the fossil fuel industry”, Saito says. This makes him sceptical of technological utopianism. Though he had once been optimistic about the possibility of technological progress, he now sees the limitations. “By hoping there will be new technologies, we simply wait until they will be invented but the result will be they will never be and we will be all dead,” Saito says. This is not just a criticism of much-lauded technological fixes within capitalism, such as carbon capture and storage, but of the idea that we can transfer capitalist technologies to an automated communist utopia – where collectively owned robots do the vast majority of the work and there is no more resource scarcity thanks to green energy and things like asteroid mining. Saito welcomes these attempts for imagining a post-capitalist world but sees them as ultimately misguided. “This kind of abundant future appeals to the satisfaction of people’s immediate desires without challenging the current imperial mode of living in the global north,” he observes. “Such a vision accepts too uncritically existing value-standards and consumerist ideals.” Capitalism doesn’t just flout natural scarcity, caring little for the planet’s limits, Saito argues – it artificially creates a social scarcity, where we are always compelled to want more: the latest phone, car or jacket. But we can reorganise our relationship with nature, Saito insists, to imagine a new kind of abundance: regulating advertising, SUV usage and constant mobile phone model changes while “distributing both wealth and burdens more equally and justly among members of the society”. Some sectors – those that don’t make a profit and so are underdeveloped in capitalism – would be improved, which would mean more money and resources for “education, care work, art, sports and public transportation”. Saito maintains this is not a miserabilist alternative future. Pointing to Kate Soper’s thinking, he says that the constant need to engage in competitive work and consumption is not a mark of the good life and in fact limits opportunities for fulfilling experiences outside the market. Without the need to produce for excessive, unnecessary consumption (that which is “necessary” for economic growth, not the development of the individual), jobs could be fundamentally changed. We could spend far fewer hours working, using our abilities and talents to do what we can and sharing the unpleasant and boring tasks more fairly. Saito, though, does not see this as a romanticised “return-to the countryside”, abandoning all technologies in the process; nor is he a Soviet Marxist. Using André Gorz’s distinction between “open” and “locking technology”, he advocates for the former. While the latter is “about domination over people and nature”, where “technology is for discipline and monopoly” – he gives nuclear power plants as an example – open technologies can be run at a local level by cooperatives. Solar panels, for instance, are a more democratic way of “controlling energy and electricity”, he says. This doesn’t amount to doing away with the state entirely, but he stresses: “My vision is not Soviet-style – I am not arguing for the state ownership of everything or state-planned economy.” That would simply change too little. One question, though, is how possible any of this actually is. Saito is aware of the challenges, but he points to Gen Z, Just Stop Oil, climate protests around the world, and Alberto Garzón, the Spanish minister for consumer affairs, who recently wrote about the limits of growth. This is a big change compared with the past 30 years, when such movements have been marginalised. “I am hoping the 2020s and 2030s will become much more turbulent as the crisis deepens,” he says, and hopes that the amount of radical protest will grow and changes in our values will continue to accelerate. “What I am trying to do,” Saito says at the end of our conversation, “is, inspired by these movements, offer something for them … I tried to show why it is necessary to criticise capitalism and why socialism or communism can be a more solid foundation for their movements too.” Marx in the Anthropocene: Towards the Idea of Degrowth Communism is published by Cambridge University Press on 28 February"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/oct/18/fukushima-japans-new-pm-wont-delay-release-of-contaminated-water-into-ocean","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-18T04:32:19Z","webTitle":"Fukushima: Japan’s new PM won’t delay release of contaminated water into ocean","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/18/fukushima-japans-new-pm-wont-delay-release-of-contaminated-water-into-ocean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/oct/18/fukushima-japans-new-pm-wont-delay-release-of-contaminated-water-into-ocean","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima: Japan’s new PM won’t delay release of contaminated water into ocean","bodyText":"Japan’s new prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has said that there can be no delay to plans to release contaminated water from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the sea, despite opposition from fishers and neighbouring countries. Kishida, who made his first trip to the plant at the weekend since becoming prime minister last month, said every effort would be made to reassure local people that disposing of the water in the Pacific Ocean was safe. The wastewater, which is pumped up from reactor basements and treated to remove all but one radioactive material, has built up at the site since the plant suffered a triple meltdown in March 2011. “I felt strongly that the water issue is a crucial one that should not be pushed back,” Kishida told reporters after being shown around by the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power. More than one million tonnes of water are being stored in 1,000 tanks at the site, and Tepco has warned that space will run out late next year. The government and Tepco said in April that work to release the heavily diluted water would begin in the spring of 2023 and take decades to complete. The move is opposed by nearby fishing communities which say it will undo years of hard work rebuilding their industry’s reputation since the plant was struck by a huge tsunami in March 2011, soon after Japan’s north-east coast was rocked by a magnitude-9 earthquake. The decision ended years of debate over what to do with the water, with other options including evaporation or the construction of more storage tanks at other sites. Neighbouring South Korea, which still bans seafood imports from the region, has repeatedly voiced concern, claiming that discharging the water represented a “grave threat” to the marine environment. The South Korean Olympic committee made separate catering arrangements for the country’s athletes during the Tokyo Olympics amid concern they could be served food from Fukushima, even though produce from the region undergoes rigorous safety checks. Japan’s government says releasing the water is the most realistic option and will enable workers at the site to proceed with decommissioning the plant – a costly operation that is expected to take about 40 years. “We will provide explanations about safety from a scientific viewpoint and transparency in order to address people’s concerns,” Kishida said. Japan has requested help from the International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure the discharge meets global safety standards, including treating the wastewater so its radioactivity levels are below legal limits. Tepco’s Advanced Liquid Processing System reduces radioactive substances in the water to safe levels, but the system is unable to filter out tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. Experts say tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, is only harmful to humans in very large doses, while government and Tepco officials have pointed out that working nuclear plants routinely dilute and release tritium into the ocean. Kishida, who supports the restart of nuclear reactors that were idled after the Fukushima meltdown, offered flowers and prayed at a monument to the disaster in Namie, one of several communities near the plant that were declared no-go zones after the disaster. Some residents have since returned to their homes after evacuation orders were lifted. Kishida has said that nuclear power must be part of Japan’s energy mix if it is to become carbon neutral by 2050. But he has yet to confirm if he will attend the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow early next month, with Japanese media reports suggesting he won’t decide until after lower house elections are held at the end of this month. Boris Johnson encouraged Kishida to attend the summit during a phone call last week, adding that Britain was considering lifting import restrictions on Fukushima produce that were introduced while it was a member of the European Union, according to the Kyodo news agency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/27/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-216-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-27T15:19:59Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 216 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/27/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-216-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/27/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-216-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 216 of the invasion","bodyText":"Russia’s “referendums” in Ukraine, which could lead to Moscow annexing 15% of the country’s territory, are due to end on Tuesday. Voting in the eastern provinces of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia began on Friday, Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Tuesday that Russia wants to “save people” in the four Moscow-controlled territories. Russian media have announced early results, claiming that with approaching a quarter of the “votes” counted in each of the four referendums, all the regions have voted by at least 97% to be annexed by Russia. The process has been dismissed as a sham by western nations, and described as a “propaganda show” by Ukrainian authorities, which have pledged not to recognise the results. Putin is scheduled to address both houses of Russian parliament on Friday 30 September, and may use the address to formally announce the accession of the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine into Russia, the British Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Denmark’s military has issued an image of gas bubbling at the surface of the Baltic Sea after “unprecedented” damage to the Nord Stream pipelines, which has seen three offshore lines of the system damaged in one day. Seismologists in Sweden say on Monday they detected what they described as two explosions in the regions of the Baltic sea where the leaks have occurred. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has already called the leaks “an act of sabotage” which he said “related to the next step of escalation of the situation in Ukraine.” The United Nations human rights office has said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had caused a dire human rights situation and led to a wide range of rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and torture, that could amount to war crimes. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said in a report that it was particularly concerned about torture and ill treatment of detainees by Russian forces and affiliated armed groups, but said there had been rights violations by both sides. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called Russia’s mobilisation “a frank attempt to give commanders on the ground a constant stream of “cannon fodder”,” in the Ukrainian president’s nightly address on Monday evening. Ukraine claims some Russian conscripts from the Kremlin’s mass mobilisation are being sent directly to the frontlines without training. Those included newly drafted personnel in Crimea as well as conscripts in the Luhansk region who have received draft summonses in recent days. The Kremlin said it had made no decision on closing Russia’s borders as the first mobilisation since the second world war prompted some to flee. Georgia and Kazakhstan said that tens of thousands of Russians had flooded into their countries from neighbouring Russia as military-aged men avoid military call-up The Russian Orthodox Church head says Russian soldiers who die on the battlefield will have their sins absolved. Patriach Kirill, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and a staunch supporter of the Ukraine invasion, said the “sacrifice washes away all sins”. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish deputy chairman of the security council of Russia, has again threatened the west with the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and said “Imagine that Russia is forced to use the most formidable weapon against the Ukrainian regime, which has committed a large-scale act of aggression, which is dangerous for the very existence of our state. I believe that Nato will not directly intervene in the conflict even in this situation. After all, the security of Washington, London, and Brussels is much more important for the North Atlantic Alliance than the fate of Ukraine, which no one needs, even if it is abundantly supplied with various weapons.” Germany’s economy minister expects to have to extend the lifespans of the country’s last two nuclear power plants to avoid possible outages and grid bottlenecks in Europe’s biggest economy this winter. Refugees arriving from Ukraine have helped drive Germany’s population to its highest level, the Federal Statistical Office said, with more than 84 million people now living in the European Union’s most populous country. Germany’s female population grew by 1.2%, significantly more than its male population, which increased by 0.8%, reflecting the fact that mainly women and children fled the war in Ukraine. Japan’s foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, has commented on the detention of the country’s consul, telling reporters that he was subjected to a “coercive interrogation” during his detention by Russia’s FSB security service and that Japan has demanded an apology. Hayashi told reporters on Tuesday that consul Motoki Tatsunori had not engaged in any illegal activity and described his detention, which lasted several hours, as “totally unacceptable”. The Philippines is in talks with Russia to buy fuel and other commodities, according to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who said the country’s national interests had to take precedence over politics. A Russian man on Monday shot the leader of the local military draft committee in a Siberian town after telling him he would refuse to fight in Ukraine. Video showed the gunman, dressed in camouflage, firing at the official from point-blank range as other potential draftees for the Russian invasion fled the room. The US pledged to provide Ukraine with $457.5m in civilian security aid. The support was aimed at “saving lives” and “bolstering” Ukrainian law enforcement, said the secretary of state, Antony Blinken. The UK announced 92 new sanctions on Monday in response to Russia’s “sham referendums” in Ukraine.

The government said the measure will save the average household about £1,000 a year and is in addition to the £400 of support for all households announced by the former chancellor Rishi Sunak in May. People who are on fixed-term tariffs are likely to receive a matching discount, after negotiations by the government with suppliers. Households who do not pay directly for mains gas and electricity, such as those living in park homes, using heating oil or on heat networks, will not be worse off and said they would receive personal support through a separate fund. Help for businesses Businesses and public sector organisations will have a new-six month scheme offering “equivalent support”. The detail is limited but it is expected to be an intervention to subsidise the wholesale price of gas. After the end of the six months, there will be ongoing support for “vulnerable industries”. Truss’s spokesperson described vulnerable industries as likely to include hospitality such as pubs, but would not go further on what percentage of firms were likely to be classified as such. A review will take place in three months’ time to consider whether the scheme should become more targeted. New oil, gas and fracking licences A licensing round will be launched as early as next week and is expected to lead to more than 100 new licences. The moratorium on UK shale gas production is to be lifted. “This will enable developers to seek planning permission where there is local support, which could get gas flowing in as soon as six months,” the government said. The government has decided to publish the British Geological Survey’s report into fracking, which was commissioned by the then business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, earlier this year. The study suggests “more drilling is required to establish data on shale resources and seismic impacts”, effectively reopening the door to an industry that has been on hold since 2019. The government hopes to “continue progressing” in its mission to generate 24 gigawatts of power from nuclear by 2050. A dedicated body, Great British Nuclear, has been set up to attempt to achieve this aim. Truss also announced a review of the government’s net zero strategy, under the “altered economic landscape”. The review is likely to raise alarm bells from environmental campaigners, but will be led by Chris Skidmore, who chairs the Net Zero Support Group of Conservative MPs and is a key proponent of meeting the targets. Help for suppliers The Treasury will work with the Bank of England to “address the extraordinary liquidity requirements faced by energy firms operating in UK wholesale gas and electricity markets”. The energy markets financing scheme, which is meant as a “last resort”, is designed to “enable stability to both energy and financial markets, and reduce costs for businesses and consumers”. It will open “by the end of October or sooner”. Energy companies have sought to secure their balance sheets amid fears they will have to buy their energy in advance in volatile wholesale markets. Reforms to the structure and regulation of the energy markets are expected to be undertaken after a review of regulations. Funding the support The government will fund the scheme to reduce the unit cost of energy via increased borrowing, likely to exceed £100bn. However, Whitehall sources said estimates for the cost will not come until the chancellor’s fiscal statement later this month. A new windfall tax on energy firms “would discourage the very investment we need to secure home grown energy supplies”, said Truss. The government expects to be able to reduce the cost of the intervention in three ways: negotiating the long-term gas contracts; negotiating with renewable producers to reduce the prices they charge; and accelerating new sources of energy supply. Costs to the exchequer are also hoped to be reduced via a positive impact on gross domestic product, on tax receipts and household incomes. But internally Treasury officials have warned the cost of doing nothing to save customers defaulting, and businesses and energy companies from collapsing would be far greater. The Treasury is declining to outline the costs because of the volatility in the price of gas over the coming year, but sources suggested £150bn was at the upper end of predictions. The Treasury will amend the Debt Management Office’s remit in the coming weeks, to account for the substantial extra borrowing after the mini-budget. Reducing wholesale prices An energy supply taskforce headed by Madelaine McTernan, who led the UK’s Covid vaccine taskforce, has begun negotiations with “domestic and international suppliers” to agree contracts that reduce the price they charge for energy. The taskforce will also negotiate with electricity generators – including wind, solar and nuclear power producers, some of whom have made windfall gains from the rise in wholesale gas prices – to reduce the prices they charge. The talks follow proposals for a scheme where producers on renewable obligation contracts are encouraged to switch to contracts for difference."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/07/eu-sets-out-plans-for-windfall-taxes-and-power-savings-amid-energy-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T15:07:41Z","webTitle":"EU sets out plans for windfall taxes and power savings amid energy crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/07/eu-sets-out-plans-for-windfall-taxes-and-power-savings-amid-energy-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/07/eu-sets-out-plans-for-windfall-taxes-and-power-savings-amid-energy-crisis","fields":{"headline":"EU sets out plans for windfall taxes and power savings amid energy crisis","bodyText":"The head of the EU executive, has set out plans for windfall taxes, mandatory electricity savings and a cap on the price of Russian gas to limit Kremlin revenues used to finance the “atrocious” war in Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen outlined a five-point plan in response to an energy price crisis, driven by the Russian shutdown of the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline but exacerbated by the climate crisis and lingering effects of the Covid pandemic. Low-carbon energy companies, renewable and nuclear suppliers that have reaped “enormous revenues … they never dreamed of” from generating electricity will face a cap on their revenues, Von der Leyen said, with proceeds earmarked to help domestic consumers and companies pay “astronomical” bills. Under EU energy rules, the price of electricity is determined by the cost of the most expensive fuel, usually gas, rather than cheaper renewables and nuclear power. As a result of all-time-high gas prices, low-carbon electricity generators have been rewarded with a big increase in income. “These revenues do not reflect their production costs,” Von der Leyen said. “So it is now time for the consumers to benefit from the low costs of low-carbon sources.” The commission, she said, proposed “to re-channel these unexpected profits” to allow member states to support vulnerable households and companies. Oil and gas companies that have made “massive profits” would also be subject to a windfall tax, which Von der Leyen called a “solidarity contribution”. While she did not mention specific numbers, a leaked document seen by the Guardian shows the commission wants a €200 (£173) per megawatt hour limit to the price of electricity generated by low-carbon technologies. The paper states this “mimics the market outcomes that could be expected were global supply chains functioning normally and not subject to the weaponisation of energy through gas supply disruptions”. The leaked document also reveals that the EU executive wants a mandatory 5% reduction in electricity use in peak hours. This echoes an earlier plan for gas savings, although EU member states decided those efficiency measures should be voluntary, raising questions about whether they will accept a mandatory target. Finally, Von der Leyen proposed a cap on the price of Russian gas, saying it was necessary to cut revenues that “Putin uses to finance his atrocious war in Ukraine”. The EU has spent nearly €88bn on Russian fossil fuels since the invasion began on 24 February, according to a tracker from the NGO Europe Beyond Coal. The plan to cap Russian gas ran into immediate opposition from the Czech Republic’s industry minister, Jozef Síkela, who is due to chair an EU crisis meeting on Friday. “It’s not a constructive proposal,” he told the Czech senate, adding that it looked like further “sanctions against Russia [rather] than an actual solution to the energy crisis in Europe”. Criticising the plan from a different angle, Poland argues the bloc should cap the price of all non-EU gas as it fears that targeting Russia will trigger retaliation that will deprive Ukraine of lucrative pipeline transit fees. Speaking in Vladivostok, Vladimir Putin dismissed attempts to cap the prices of oil and gas as “completely stupid” and “sheer nonsense”, while claiming that Russia had enough customers in Asia to ride out the damage. “Will they make political decisions contradicting contracts?” he said. “In that case, we won’t supply anything if it goes against our economic interests. We don’t supply anything: no gas, no oil, no coal, no heating oil, nothing.” Asked about his comments, Von der Leyen said Russia had already partially or completely cut off gas to 13 EU member states. “We don’t give anything any more on these announcements by Russia, because we know they’re blackmailing us. The best thing is to fortify ourselves and go towards other suppliers. And have solidarity.” The Kremlin-controlled state energy company Gazprom announced last Friday it would not be restarting gas flows through Nord Stream 1, the biggest pipeline connecting Russia and Europe. While Gazprom blamed “malfunctions” in a turbine along the pipeline, the Kremlin later said it would not resume full gas supplies until Europe lifted sanctions imposed in response to Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. Before the recent shutdown, gas deliveries from Russia to the EU had fallen to 30% of the 2016-21 average. Even before the war, Europe was already facing spiralling gas prices as Chinese demand for fuel surged in the economic rebound after the pandemic. Problems have been compounded by the record-breaking hot dry summer that has pushed up demand for air-conditioning, while reducing hydropower from rivers and reservoirs. Meanwhile half of France’s ageing fleet of nuclear reactors have been forced offline because of corrosion problems in key pipes and safety checks, reversing the country’s traditional role as exporter of electricity to its neighbours. Von der Leyen said the EU was seeing the effects of climate change and drought and described renewables as “our energy insurance for the future”. The long-awaited plans will be discussed by EU energy ministers in emergency talks on Friday. Von der Leyen – who has been accused of a slow response to the energy price surge – is due to discuss the plans with the bloc’s ambassadors on Wednesday, before further diplomatic talks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/04/pressure-mounts-germany-embargo-russian-energy-imports","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-04T14:05:56Z","webTitle":"Pressure mounts on German ministers to embargo Russian energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/pressure-mounts-germany-embargo-russian-energy-imports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/04/pressure-mounts-germany-embargo-russian-energy-imports","fields":{"headline":"Pressure mounts on German ministers to embargo Russian energy","bodyText":"The German government is facing growing pressure at home and abroad to introduce an energy embargo against Russia as reports of atrocities committed on Ukrainian civilians in Bucha increased the urgency of calls for action. Berlin has so far pushed back on appeals for an outright ban on energy imports from Russia, warning that the consequences for Europe’s largest economy and the entire European Union would be devastating. However, discussions are widespread about reducing industry production times to save energy, while ordinary Germans are being urged to turn down thermostats and drive more slowly. Pressure from Germany’s neighbours has been growing, particularly the Baltic states and Poland. Mateusz Morawiecki, the prime minister of Poland, on Monday accused Germany of “standing in the way” of harder sanctions against Russia. “Anyone who reads the notes of EU meetings knows that Germany is the biggest impediment when it comes to more decisive sanctions,” he told journalists in Warsaw. A spokesperson for the German government said it would not be considering an immediate energy embargo but it was determined to speed up its efforts to wean Germany off Russian gas and oil. “After these pictures of the weekend, we will once again see how we can more quickly, and by using further measures, reduce our dependence,” said Oliver Krischer, from the ministry for the economy and climate protection, on Monday morning. Efforts were being made to introduce a “quasi-embargo”, he said, through “non-purchase” and “energy-saving measures” as well as “diversification”, including buying liquefied petroleum gas. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said the atrocities – in which hundreds of civilians are believed to have been murdered north of Kyiv – would not go unanswered, calling them war crimes, and promised on Sunday night that Germany, together with its partners, would be increasing sanctions against Russia in the coming days. The defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, later went further, saying it was time for the EU to jointly discuss the option of a complete ban on Russian gas. “There must be a response,” she said in a television interview. “Such crimes cannot remain unanswered. But in a sign of debate even within the governing coalition, the finance minister, Christian Lindner, rejected a gas embargo. “We are dealing with a criminal war,” Lindner said before talks with his EU colleagues in Brussels. “It is clear we must end as quickly as possible all economic ties to Russia. We must plan tough sanctions, but gas cannot be substituted in the short term. We would inflict more damage on ourselves than on them.” Opinion polls have shown that the majority of Germans – between 55% and 77% – are in favour of stopping imports of gas from Russia, despite the impact it might have on their ability to heat their own homes. The majority said they were also in favour of temporarily increasing the lifespan of coal-fired plants and of making nuclear power plants – the phase-out of which began following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011 – operational again. As a whole, Europe gets about 40% of its gas supplies from Russia, but in Germany the figure is 55%. The EU gets 25% of its oil from Russia. The UK intends to press for a timetable for a total embargo on the import of Russian coal, gas and oil at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers, the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss said on Monday. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who met Truss in Warsaw, urged any country thinking of voting against such an embargo to come first to Bucha. He said he was not making the call for the embargo on the purchase of Russian fossil fuels as a foreign minister but as the demand of “the victims of rape, torture and killings, their relatives and the entire Ukrainian nation.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Monday said he was in favour of a new round of sanctions targeting Russia’s oil and coal sectors, but did not call for a EU ban on gas imports. Macron was named by Morawiecki as he called for European leaders to do more against Russia. “President Macron, how many times have you negotiated with Putin? What have you achieved? ... Would you negotiate with Hitler, with Stalin, with Pol Pot?” he asked. “Chancellor Scholz, Olaf, it is not the voices of German businesses that should be heard aloud in Berlin today. It is the voice of these innocent women and children.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had on Sunday accused the former German chancellor Angela Merkel and the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy of contributing to Russian aggression by making too many concessions towards Putin. “I invite Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy to visit Bucha and to see for their own eyes where the politics of making concessions to Russia in over 14 years has led. You will see tortured Ukrainian men and women with your own eyes,” he said in his nightly video address to Ukrainians. In particular, he levelled criticism at Merkel for not backing Ukraine’s attempts to join Nato in 2008. Merkel’s office responded unusually swiftly to the criticism. In a statement, a spokesperson said: “The retired German chancellor Dr Angela Merkel stands by her decision in conjunction with the Nato summit in Bucharest in 2008.” The spokesperson added that Merkel supported every effort of the German government to stop Russia’s invasion, especially in light of the “atrocities of Bucha and other parts of Ukraine”. Germany’s economics minister, Robert Habeck, who as a leading Green has pushed for years for the abolition of coal-fired plants and the scrapping of nuclear power plants, said Germany was working on reducing its reliance on Russian energy but that it could not happen overnight. “We are working every single day to create the preconditions and to pave the way towards an embargo,” he said when asked if news of the murder of civilians in Bucha would lead to a government rethink. “This is also, in the view of the federal government, as well as in my own opinion, the way forward and one which harms Putin on a daily basis.” • This article was amended on 5 April 2022 to remove a suggestion that the proportion of Germany’s gas supply that comes from Russia is the highest in Europe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/15/we-need-a-practical-handbook-to-build-a-bottom-up-democracy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-15T17:36:37Z","webTitle":"We need a practical handbook to build a bottom-up democracy | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/15/we-need-a-practical-handbook-to-build-a-bottom-up-democracy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/15/we-need-a-practical-handbook-to-build-a-bottom-up-democracy","fields":{"headline":"We need a practical handbook to build a bottom-up democracy","bodyText":"Many of us have been crying out for a sea change in our politics such as the one described by George Monbiot (Feeling the urge to take back control from power-mad governments? Here’s an idea, 13 July). He mentions the social ecology of Murray Bookchin, but getting to grips with that is very hard work, so I recommend reading The Dawn of Everything by David Wengrow and David Graeber, which suggests that the way things are is not inevitable and that people have lived successfully in decentralised polities for thousands of years. Many of the older generation, who continue to prop up this dishonest and incompetent Tory government, yearn for things to be the way they were in “the good old days”. Perhaps knowing that our ancient ancestors actually were capable of caring about their less well-off neighbours, and seeing to it that people like Boris Johnson got their comeuppance before they had the chance to ruin the country, might make them feel that governance from the bottom up is not new and terrifying but simply another way of doing things that has always been an option. What we need is a practical handbook for making the change in these increasingly undemocratic times. Perhaps Monbiot could write one – preferably soon, as I am on the last leg of my life journey, and I want to be part of this revolution. Janet Bayford Little Hulton, Greater Manchester • George Monbiot is right, but the solution to our enfeebled democracy lies in a complete revision of economic and legal systems as well as the political. People cannot be enfranchised politically while just a few thousand extremely wealthy individuals protect and enhance their asserted right to use the planet’s resources for their own benefit, at the expense of everybody else. In particular, we a have a completely inequitable ownership of land – Britain is a stark example, with only a dozen or so owning most of it – and the assumed right to exploit assets such as farming, fishing, minerals and fossil fuels on or under that land, with no participation, ownership or control by the population in general. It’s feudal. Among the necessary reforms is the urgent need to define the true wealth of environmental assets – breathable air, clean water, fertile soil, biodiverse forests and oceans – and to establish legal and economic systems that protect those things from harm. For instance, we should define a crime of environmental theft, which is what pollution amounts to. Today’s political class seek millionaire status by doing the bidding of the billionaires who are stealing the planet’s resources. Getting rid of them and their silly circuses is just the starting point. Bill Dixon The Hague, Netherlands • I am very happy to support George Monbiot’s call for participatory democracy in the form of assemblies. I would be even happier if he would accept the recommendations from an assembly that has actually taken place, the Climate Assembly UK, in September 2020. There, a majority of assembly members agreed that three ways of generating electricity should be part of how the UK gets to net zero: offshore wind, solar and onshore wind. Nuclear power, which Monbiot continues to advocate, saw lower levels of support. Here is an example of his “enclaves of democracy” that it seems he would rather disregard. Linda Rogers Llangoed, Anglesey • No, George, no. As Simon Jenkins explains so eloquently (Why the Labour party is praying for the Tories not to vote for Rishi Sunak, 12 July), the answer to our governmental ills is not more power to the people – which has brought us Trumpism, Johnsonism and populist rule by the angry old white men of the Daily Express and Daily Mail. The answer is to strengthen our institutions so that errant prime ministers cannot prorogue parliament or disobey international law when they feel like it, or have their cheerleaders squeal “enemies of the people!” when the law gets in their way. If ever there was a lesson from the last few disastrous years, it is this. Jonathan Harris Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

With the threat of shortages possible this winter, officials have raised the option of the UK public being requested to reduce their energy usage, after countries in the EU including France and Germany were asked to cut gas demand by 15%. People across Europe have been urged to switch off lights and use appliances less often, after all member states apart from Hungary agreed to a voluntary cut in usage. However, Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, who is likely to be Truss’s next chancellor, is opposed to such a move, believing it is not necessary for the UK and that energy use should be up to individuals. Asked whether people should reduce how much energy they use given the high cost and worries about supply, a spokesperson for Boris Johnson said on Monday: “These decisions, in terms of energy consumption, remain decisions for individuals. “Households, businesses and industry can be confident that they will have the electricity and gas that they need.” The government favours a plan put forward by National Grid to incentivise households with smart meters to save energy by paying them to use appliances at off-peak times. “We support the National Grid in developing all options which could benefit consumers and help to reduce bills by spreading out peak demand,” No 10 said. Concern about energy security has risen since a report was leaked to Bloomberg showing the government had prepared crisis plans modelling a situation where businesses and even consumers could face blackouts this winter. Under the government’s latest “reasonable worst case scenario”, officials believe the UK could experience blackouts for several days in January if cold weather combined with gas shortages to leave the country short of power. At the same time, annual energy bills are forecast by one analyst, Auxilione, to top £6,000 next year, triggering Labour to warn that Britons face “serious hardship on a massive scale” if the government does not intervene. Advising households on how to cut energy usage has previously been attempted in a 1922 Committee report published in April, led by Andrea Leadsom, a former energy secretary. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) committee she chaired proposed that there should be improved guidance on cutting energy usage, better access to existing education and incentive schemes, and clearer messaging on money-saving ideas such as turning off radiators in unused rooms, reducing pressure to hot water taps and reducing radiator settings on gas boilers to between 55C and 65C to optimise energy output. The committee also suggested stronger public messaging on the advantage of smart meters and pressure on energy companies to bring forward smart tariffs. Leadsom said on Monday there was a “really strong case” for these measures. However, politicians can be sensitive about public perceptions of asking people to use less energy. Some energy bosses have been pilloried for giving tips on keeping warm, such as putting on jumpers, doing star jumps, cuddling pets or eating porridge. In the EU, Brussels is urging governments to launch campaigns to encourage people to switch off lights and turn down thermostats and air conditioning. Industrial users may also be given targets to reduce heating and cooling. EU governments are being urged to speed up the switch to renewable energy, but are also asked to consider delaying their exit from nuclear power or coal – an effort to find any alternative to Russian gas. The government insists that power cuts and energy shortages are extremely unlikely. However, Adam Bell, a former policy senior official at BEIS, told the BBC’s PM programme he thought there was about a one-in-10 chance of seeing limited, planned blackouts in certain parts of the country over the winter. He also said: “The right thing to do now is to get used to lowering our demand so we can eliminate that chance as much as we can.” Bell said there were stages that could be gone through, including switching some industry off, then export pipelines and then homes. “But because we might be in that situation, there’s a lot households should be thinking about now, to help minimise the likelihood … like turning down your thermostat by one degree and optimising the flow temperature in your boiler as well as draught-proofing where you can.” A government spokesperson said: “Households, businesses and industry can be confident that the UK’s secure and diverse energy supplies will provide the electricity and gas they need. “Decisions on energy consumption rightly remain a matter for individuals and we recognise households will have different energy usage needs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/09/ukraine-russia-war-live-zelenskiy-counteroffensive-pressure-russian-troops","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-09T18:07:24Z","webTitle":"Ukraine-Russia war: power infrastructure in Enerhodar destroyed by shelling, says UN – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/09/ukraine-russia-war-live-zelenskiy-counteroffensive-pressure-russian-troops","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/09/ukraine-russia-war-live-zelenskiy-counteroffensive-pressure-russian-troops","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine-Russia war: power infrastructure in Enerhodar destroyed by shelling, says UN – as it happened","bodyText":"It is just past 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: The European Commission on Friday urged EU member states to reassess the terms on which they grant visas to Russian travellers and to root out applicants that pose a security threat. “We should not be naive, Putin’s aim is to destroy the EU and he would like to attack us where we are weakest,” warned EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson. Russia said on Friday it was dispatching reinforcements to the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine where Kyiv’s forces have announced robust gains as part of a broader counter-offensive. State media broadcast footage of columns of Russian tanks, support vehicles and artillery travelling along paved roads and dirt tracks, emblazoned with the letter “Z”, the symbol of Moscow’s invasion. The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said on Friday that it had pushed back against Russian attacks near 10 settlements, the Kyiv Independent reports. It added that Russian forces had launched more than 12 missiles and more than 12 airstrikes on Ukrainian territory in the last 24 hours. Shelling has destroyed power infrastructure at the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar where staff operating the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant live. The shelling posses a growing threat to the plant, the UN nuclear watchdog said on Friday. EU finance ministers on Friday supported a €5bn ($5bn) loan for Ukraine to help maintain the country’s schools, hospitals and other needed operations in the midst of Russia’s invasion. The €5bn loan agreed on Friday, which will be backed by guarantees of EU member states, is part of an overall €9bn package announced in May. The EU executive pledged on Friday to devise unprecedented measures in the coming days to address an energy price shock as a result of Russia’s war on Ukraine, including a controversial gas price cap that could further anger the Kremlin. European energy ministers tasked the European Commission with working through the weekend to draw up legal texts that will include emergency funding for consumers struggling to afford soaring bills. The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Friday conditions at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are increasingly precarious and that a safety zone around it needs to be established immediately to prevent a nuclear accident. IAEA director Rafael Mariano Grossi said that there is minimal chance of re-establishing reliable offsite power lines to the plant and its Ukrainian operator is considering shutting down the only remaining operating reactor. A Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region announced on Friday that civilians are being evacuated from three of the region’s Russian-controlled territories that have come under threat from a Ukrainian counteroffensive. The European Commission on Friday urged EU member states to reassess the terms on which they grant visas to Russian travellers and to root out applicants that pose a security threat. “We should not be naive, Putin’s aim is to destroy the EU and he would like to attack us where we are weakest,” warned EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson, Agence France-Presse reports. Johansson warned that civilians could act as spies, saboteurs or provocateurs and alleged that some Russian travellers had sought to harass and humiliate Ukrainian refugees, who have been granted protected status within the EU. “We can not exclude that people are coming with the aim to provoke, to try to get some social unrest, or to provoke violence or riots or things like that or to try to use propaganda,” she said. On Friday, the EU formally suspended a 2007 visa facilitation pact that had made it easier and cheaper for Russians to travel to Europe, but stopped short of the full travel ban demanded by some member states. Johansson said the new rules would still allow passage to vetted dissidents, journalists and humanitarian cases, but that applications for simple tourist and business visas should be “reassessed.” Just under a million Russians already hold visas for the EU’s Schengen travel area, and the commissioner said member states should also reassess these existing travel documents. Russia said on Friday it was dispatching reinforcements to the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine where Kyiv’s forces have announced robust gains as part of a broader counter-offensive. Agence France-Presse reports: State media broadcast footage of columns of Russian tanks, support vehicles and artillery travelling along paved roads and dirt tracks, emblazoned with the letter “Z”, the symbol of Moscow’s invasion. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said meanwhile that Russia’s push to send reinforcements showed Moscow was paying “huge costs” in its bid to capture and then hold Ukrainian territory. A Moscow-installed official in the region, Vitaliy Ganchev, said in televised remarks that “fierce battles” were under way near Balakliya, a town in the Kharkiv region that Ukraine said it had recaptured on Thursday. “We do not control Balakliya. Attempts are being made to dislodge the Ukrainian forces, but there are fierce battles and our troops are being held back on the approaches,” Ganchev said. “Now Russian reserves have been brought there, our troops are fighting back,” he added. His comments come after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy shared footage late Thursday showing camouflage-clad Ukrainian soldiers holding his country’s blue-and-yellow flag over Balakliya. The town, which had been under Russian control for around six months and had a pre-war population of around 30,000 people, fell easily and early on to Russian forces who invaded in February. Now, Russian officials in the Kharkiv region say they are evacuating civilians towards Russia “until the situation stabilises.” “We have been trying to focus all our efforts on evacuating the local population for three or four days,” Russian-appointed official Maxim Gubin said. The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said on Friday that it had pushed back against Russian attacks near 10 settlements, the Kyiv Independent reports. It added that Russian forces had launched more than 12 missiles and more than 12 airstrikes on Ukrainian territory in the last 24 hours. Shelling has destroyed power infrastructure at the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar where staff operating the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant live, posing a growing threat to the plant, the UN nuclear watchdog said on Friday. Reuters reports: The plant’s offsite power lines, vital lines of defence against potential nuclear meltdown, have already been cut and the shelling at Enerhodar has caused a lasting blackout there. That has prompted Ukraine to say it may have to shut down the last operating reactor supplying power to Zaporizhzhia including the cooling systems for the plant’s nuclear fuel. “This is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious. Enerhodar has gone dark. The power plant has no offsite power. And we have seen that once infrastructure is repaired, it is damaged once again,” International Atomic Energy Agency chief, Rafael Grossi, said in a statement. EU finance ministers on Friday supported a €5bn ($5bn) loan for Ukraine to help maintain the country’s schools, hospitals and other needed operations in the midst of Russia’s invasion. The €5bn loan agreed on Friday, which will be backed by guarantees of EU member states, is part of an overall €9bn package announced in May. The first €1bn was fully sent in early August, while the Czech finance minister, Zbynek Stanjura, said upcoming meetings would decide how the remaining €3bn in the package could be split into loans or grants. “All member states agreed on further support for Ukraine,” Stanjura said. The ministers also discussed short-term financing options and longer-term options to help Ukraine fund its reconstruction in the future. A report released Friday by the World Bank, Ukrainian government and European Commission calculated Russia’s invasion caused more than $97bn in direct damages to Ukraine through to 1 June, while it could cost nearly $350bn to rebuild the country. The European Commission vice-president, Valdis Dombrovski, said costs to help re-build Ukraine would be immense as the war drags into a seventh month. “Clearly Ukraine needs short-term financial assistance to keep the country running on a daily basis and maintain essential services,” he said. “We also need to look beyond immediate needs, as long-term costs for Ukraine’s reconstruction are likely to keep growing as long as war continues.” The EU executive pledged on Friday to devise unprecedented measures in the coming days to address an energy price shock as a result of Russia’s war on Ukraine, including a controversial gas price cap that could further anger the Kremlin. European energy ministers tasked the European Commission with working through the weekend to draw up legal texts that will include emergency funding for consumers struggling to afford soaring bills. The EU will table “unprecedented measures next week for an unprecedented situation”, energy commissioner Kadri Simson said, after meeting the ministers. Simson said compensation for struggling households and businesses would be covered by a levy on non-gas electricity companies, such as nuclear, solar or renewable firms, that are seeing a revenue bonanza on the back of high prices for electric power. She added that fossil fuel companies would also be levied on their mega profits from the inflated energy prices. The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Friday conditions at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are increasingly precarious and that a safety zone around it needs to be established immediately to prevent a nuclear accident. IAEA director Rafael Mariano Grossi said that there is minimal chance of re-establishing reliable offsite power lines to the plant and its Ukrainian operator is considering shutting down the only remaining operating reactor. This would leave the plant fully dependent on emergency diesel generators to provide electricity for vital nuclear safety functions. “This is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious,” Grossi said, the Associated Press reports. “The power plant has no offsite power. And we have seen that once infrastructure is repaired, it is damaged once again,” he said. “This is completely unacceptable. It cannot stand.” Grossi called for an “immediate cessation of all shelling in the entire area” and the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. “This is the only way to ensure that we do not face a nuclear accident,” he said. A Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region announced on Friday that civilians are being evacuated from three of the region’s Russian-controlled territories that have come under threat from a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Vitaly Ganchev said on state television host Vladimir Solovyov’s daily livestream that civilians were being evacuated from the towns of Izium, Kupiansk and Veliky Burluk, Reuters reports. Civilians are being evacuated from Russian-held Izium, and Kupiansk in eastern Ukraine, according to a Russian-appointed local official, Reuters reports. This is a developing story with more details to come … If you’re just joining us, here’s a round-up of all the day’s news from Ukraine so far … Ukraine’s counter-offensive in Kharkiv continues, with Ukrainian forces appearing to be closing in on the city of Kupiansk, a key logistical hub for Russian forces in the region US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said late last night it was likely the city would be taken within 72 hours, and that its recapture would severely hinder Russian lines of communication on the ground. Unverified photos posted to social media appeared to show soldiers holding a Ukrainian flag on the outskirts of the city. Footage reportedly shot in the city of Balakliia, another city in the Kharkiv region, shows residents welcoming soldiers following its recapture by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s military has said the number of Russian soldiers killed since the start of the invasion has reached 51,900. It also said that information provided to it by Ukrainians inside occupied territory has contributed to a recent rise in Russian personnel losses from 150-200 a day to about 600. At least 10 people, three of them children, were injured and a kindergarten was set on fire amid heavy shelling in Kharkiv, city mayor Igor Terekhov has said Nine civilians have also been killed and 23 have been injured by Russian forces in the Donetsk region, according to local officials. A Russian airstrike hit and destroyed a hospital in the north-eastern region of Sumy near the Russian border on Friday, Ukrainian officials said. A total of 127 medical facilities have been destroyed and 826 have been damaged since the start of the invasion, according to the Ukrainian ministry of health. The Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has arrived in Kyiv for talks on energy and military security. A spokesperson said the visit was intended as a “political signal to the Kremlin”. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has said it is “highly unlikely” Belarus is preparing to enter the war in Ukraine, despite ongoing military exercises being conducted by the country’s military A spokesperson for President Putin has said he is “not considering” attending the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. A European Union proposal to cap the price Europe pays for Russian gas did not receive broad support from energy ministers in a meeting on Friday, two diplomats with knowledge of the talks told Reuters. “There was a big debate about capping the price of gas, and the Commission should come up with a proposal that will help reduce the prices of all gas, but at the same time will not jeopardise gas supplies to Europe,” one of the diplomats said. On Wednesday, the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said European Union countries should set a price cap on Russian gas. The finance ministers from the G7 countries have already agreed to impose a price cap on Russian oil exports. Asked about the plans at an economic form last week, President Putin said Russia’s response to price caps would be to “just halt supplies” of gas, oil, diesel oil, and coal. At least 10 people, three of them children, have been injured amid heavy shelling in Kharkiv, the city’s mayor has said. Writing on Telegram, Igor Terekhov said that private homes and a school were among the buildings hit, and that a kindergarten in the centre of the city was on fire. “I ask all Kharkiv residents to be as careful as possible and stay in shelters,” he said. It is highly unlikely that Belarus’s ongoing military exercises near the Ukrainian border are a sign that it is preparing to enter the war in Ukraine, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. On Thursday, the Belarusian military began routine drills close to Brest near the Polish border, around capital Minsk, and in the north-eastern region of Vitebsk. Belarus said the exercises, set to run until Wednesday, were intended to practice “liberating territory temporarily seized by the enemy” and regaining control over border regions. In its latest intelligence update, the UK ministry of defence said: “Although Russia’s use of Belarusian territory was instrumental in Russia’s failed advance on Kyiv early in the invasion, Belarusian forces have limited offensive capabilities and there is a remote chance that they have deployed forces into Ukraine. “It is highly unlikely that these exercises are an indication of preparations for direct Belarusian involvement in the Ukraine war.” Russian personnel losses are increasing because Ukraine is being fed information about the location of Russian forces by Ukrainians who remain in occupied territory, the Ukrainian military has said. Recent figures from the Ukrainian authorities have seen estimates of the number of Russian soldiers being killed each day rise from 150-200 to about 600. The figure for Thursday was 650, bringing the total since the start of the war to 51,900. Oleksii Hromov, the deputy head of the general staff of the armed forces, was asked about the rise during a press briefing on Thursday, Pravda reported. “Conscious Ukrainians, no matter where they are, in occupied Crimea or in the occupied territories of Kherson region, or Zaporizhzhia Oblast, or in Donetsk, Luhansk and other oblasts, conscious citizens effectively help our armed forces,” he said. “It is no secret that thanks to them we have certain information concerning the location of the Russian occupying forces. “Thanks to them we are able to increase these numbers [of Russian losses].” Moldova’s national airline has announced the resumption of flights to Russia. In a statement on its website, Air Moldova said it would begin operating flights to Moscow starting on 1 October. It said the decision was the “result of countless requests from citizens of the Republic of Moldova, who are in the Russian Federation and want to return home”. “The safety and comfort of flights are the company’s priority, thus Air Moldova will continue to make constant efforts to respond to the needs and requests of our passengers,” it said. Air Moldova suspended flights to Russia in February. Moldova, which shares a border with Ukraine, also closed its entire airspace in the immediate wake of the Russian invasion, but partially reopened it the following month. A Russian airstrike hit a hospital in the north-eastern region of Sumy on Friday, Ukrainian officials have said. Posting to Telegram, Dmytro Zhivytsky, head of the regional administration, said the attack occurred after 9am local time and that the building, in the Velyka Pysarivka district, had been destroyed. He added that people had been wounded. “The Russians continue to cynically fire at the civilian infrastructure of Sumy oblast,” he said. “Russian enemy aircraft, without crossing the border of Ukraine, fired at a hospital.” Velyka Pysarivka is a small settlement a few miles from Ukraine’s north-western border with Russia. The Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has arrived in Kyiv for talks on energy and military security, Polish broadcaster Polsat News reports. A spokesperson told the outlet that the visit was intended as a “political signal to the Kremlin” of Poland’s support for Ukraine. They added that the invasion was a breach of all possible international standards and that Poland considered the defence of Ukraine part of the defence of its own security. A photo shared on social media appears to show Ukrainian soldiers on the outskirts of the city of Kupiansk. Ukrainian forces have been advancing on the city, which serves as a key logistical hub for Russian forces in the Kharkiv region. The US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said last night Ukraine would probably recapture the city within 72 hours, and that its loss would severely hinder Russian lines of communication on the ground. A picture posted to Twitter by Illia Ponomarenko, a defence reporter at the Kyiv Independent, showed soldiers holding a Ukrainian flag while stood in front of a large road sign bearing the Russian name for Kupiansk. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify the image. President Putin is “not considering” attending the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, his spokesperson has said. Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti quoted Dmitry Peskov saying the Kremlin would “wait for the announcement of the protocol of the ceremony” before deciding who would represent Russia. Ukraine’s counteroffensive in Kharkiv has proved that it can drive Russia out of its territories, a key adviser in President Zelenskiy’s government has said. Writing on Twitter, Mykhailo Podoliak, adviser to the Head of the Office of President of Ukraine, said: “What does effective Ukrainian counteroffensive tell the world? “1. Ukraine proved the capability of de-occupying its territories. There will be no freezing of the conflict. “2. Ukraine proved that it can effectively use modern western weapons. “3. Russian troops have to get out. It will hurt.” A total of 127 medical facilities have been destroyed and 826 have been damaged since the start of the invasion, according to the Ukrainian ministry of health. The ministry said it was cooperating with global health organisation Project Hope to restore healthcare access across Ukraine. It added that 62 facilities damaged by Russian forces had already been restored. In a statement, deputy health minister Bohdan Borukhovskyi said: “We are now consolidating efforts with our partners to first of all restore hospitals that have received minor damage and can be rebuilt in the shortest possible time. “In parallel with this, we are implementing several more projects in Kyiv Oblast and Sumy Oblast, where medical facilities are being built virtually from scratch.” President Zelenskiy has said efforts continue to keep agricultural exports moving through Ukrainian ports and maintain global food security. Exports of grain and other agricultural goods have been been able to leave Ukraine since a deal agreed between Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, and the UN in July. Speaking in his nightly address on Thursday, Zelenskiy spoken with Kenyan president-elect William Ruto about overcoming food shortages. “We are doing everything for this,” he said. “Just today, four ships with agricultural products for Asian countries left our ports. “At [present], more than 65,000 tons of wheat [are entering] the port of Sudan for unloading. Yesterday, a bulker with wheat departed for Kenya – more than 50,000 tons. Vessels for Lebanon and Libya are now being loaded in Odesa. “In the Pivdennyi Port [a port near Odesa], a ship bound for India is waiting to be loaded. “Literally every working day of the grain export initiative refutes Russian lies about it. Ukraine supplies agricultural products to consumers from different continents. And it is our supply that guarantees food security at the global level.” In a speech on Wednesday, President Putin said the deal should be revised, claiming it was delivering products to the European Union and Turkey rather than to poor countries. Footage reportedly shot in the city of Balakliia near Kharkiv shows residents welcoming soldiers following its recapture by Ukrainian forces. Balakliia lies around 70km (43 miles) south-east of Kharkiv city, in the centre of the territory on which Ukraine has launched a major counter-offensive. One clip posted to twitter by Ukrainian journalist Nataliya Gumenyuk shows men and women emerging from a building to hug soldiers as they arrive. Some of the people can be seen crying. Another shows two women hugging and taking photos with soldiers gathered on a plaza. Nine civilians have been killed and 23 have been injured by Russian forces in the Donetsk region, according to Ukrainian officials. Posting to Telegram, Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration, said: “Russia kills civilians! “On September 8, the Russians killed nine civilians of Donetsk region: five in Bakhmut, two in Zaitsevo, one in New York and one in Fedorivka. Another 23 people were injured.” He added that it was not possible to establish how many people had been killed in Mariupol and Volnovas. “All Russians will be held accountable for their crimes on our land!” he said. US secretary of state Anthony Blinken has left Ukraine after making an unannounced visit on Thursday. The trip, Blinken’s third since the war began on 24 February, included meetings with President Zelenskiy and Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba as well as a visit to a children’s hospital in Kyiv. Photos posted to Twitter showed him speaking with officials before boarding a train. “Stay strong, Kyiv,” a caption read. “I leave with redoubled respect for your ferocity, your courage, and your confidence that Ukraine will prevail.” A further 650 Russian soldiers have been killed in the war in Ukraine, according to the latest update from the Ukrainian ministry of defence. Figures posted to twitter said Russia’s personnel losses since the start of the war had reached 51,900, up from 51,250 since yesterday. It added that, since the start of the invasion, Russia had lost a total of 2122 tanks, 4575 armoured combat vehicles, 239 jets, and 211 helicopters. The tweet also opened with a quote from a second world war radio broadcast delivered to the children of the Commonwealth by Queen Elizabeth II in October 1940, when she was still a princess. “When peace comes, remember it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place,” it read. The G7’s planned price cap on Russian oil exports will fail and drive prices even higher, Russia’s top lawmaker has claimed. Posting on Telegram, Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of Russia’s lower house of parliament, the Duma, said that “what G7 state officials call a price ‘ceiling’ will become a price floor”. “The global market is not limited to seven countries,” he said. “The marginal price announced by the west will become the lower bar.” Last week, the finance ministers from the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan announced plans for a cap intended to “reduce Russian revenues and Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression”. The European Union has also proposed a price cap for Russian gas, and is set to phase in a ban on Russian oil imports over the coming months. Speaking in Vladivostok on Wednesday, President Putin threatened to cut off energy supplies if price caps are imposed on Russia’s oil and gas exports. Ukraine is likely to retake the city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region within 72 hours, US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War has said. The group’s latest assessment said Ukrainian forces had advanced to within 20km of the city, and that retaking it would significantly worsen communication between Russian forces in the region. “Russian rear positions in Kharkiv Oblast are now exposed to further Ukrainian advances, and Ukrainian forces will likely capture Kupiansk within the next 72 hours,” it said. “The loss of Kupiansk and other rear areas on critical ground lines of communication will hinder Russian efforts to support offensive and defence operations, but will not completely sever Russian lines of communication to Izyum.” The space between the Izyum and the city of Kharkiv to its north-west currently forms part of the frontline between Ukrainian and Russian forces. Good morning and welcome to our Ukraine live blog. We’ll be bringing you all the latest updates from the conflict throughout the day. First up, President Zelenskiy has said Ukraine has recaptured more than 1,000 sq km of territory over the last week. It follows a surprise counter-offensive in the north-eastern Kharkiv region and sustained pressure on Russian forces in the south. Speaking in his nightly address on Thursday, Zelenskiy said: “Our heroes have already liberated dozens of settlements. And today this movement continued, there are new results. “In total, more than a thousand square kilometres of our territory have been liberated since 1 September.” He went on to thank everyone serving in the armed forces and the brigades that had retaken territory. Zelenskiy also acknowledged $675m in military aid announced yesterday by the US and the $1bn Ukraine is set to receive from a general package of support for 19 European countries deemed at risk of future Russian aggression. “Each of these steps of our partners has a real impact on the strength of our state and the whole of Europe in defence against Russian terror,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/sep/07/liz-truss-energy-crisis-climate-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T15:14:44Z","webTitle":"Watch out, Liz Truss: this energy crisis may spark a climate revolution we can all get behind | Zoe Williams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/07/liz-truss-energy-crisis-climate-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/07/liz-truss-energy-crisis-climate-bills","fields":{"headline":"Watch out, Liz Truss: this energy crisis may spark a climate revolution we can all get behind","bodyText":"It’s not looking great for the climate, our change of prime minister: Liz Truss, who has about as much expertise in British geomorphology as she does in cheese, seems to think we can frack our way out of the energy crisis by Christmas, and that nuclear power is a similarly quick answer. Her newly appointed chief economic adviser, Matthew Sinclair, wrote a book entitled Let Them Eat Carbon in 2011, in which he argued that “the temperatures we face today may not be the ideal conditions for humanity to live and flourish”. Let warming go wild, in other words. It might be fun. Sure, it was over a decade ago and don’t let’s cancel him for ever over a tiny little book – all he did was mindlessly risk the end of the species. However, beneath these morbid symptoms the global energy crisis has sparked conversations that are real, perhaps for the first time – certainly, it’s the first time that so many nations have been having them simultaneously. It seems likely that the prime minister’s first move will be to tear up everything she campaigned on and roll over to the opposition’s suggestion that energy bills be frozen at April 2022’s levels. Partly because of her inelegant flip-flopping, partly due to harsh economic realities, it is obvious that this sticking plaster, while necessary, is insufficient. The competing alternative narratives are red (sequester North Sea gas and let wholesalers take their rampant profiteering elsewhere) and green (ramp up renewables until fossil fuel supply is no longer relevant – 45% of UK electricity is already from renewables). Crucially, these narratives don’t compete with each other. You don’t need to gate off the conversation about the pros and cons of retaking gas at source before you can start talking about expanding renewables. It would be reasonable to split the energy market into clean power and fossil power, so that the price of gas was not setting the price of solar and wind, and the incentive to lean heavily on the latter and reduce consumption of the former became universal. Ideas that seemed unthinkably radical a year ago now look much less extreme than the reality we’re facing this winter. We’ve now spent 12 years living this cognitive dissonance, where we have longstanding net-zero ambitions enshrined in law, a climate crisis unfolding with alarming speed, and successive Conservative prime ministers making asinine remarks about “green crap”, then throwing the environmental agenda to the wind whenever they needed to assuage their sociopathically short-termist party members. Any progress we’ve made has been despite our own government, and so much of our collective mental energy has been lost to denial: denying that we’re not moving fast enough, denying that the heatwave was of our own making, denying that we’ve probably already left it too late to save the things we love – whether that’s beaches or biodiversity . We needed Vladimir Putin’s energy war to get serious about how stark our situation is. This is not to predict any sudden conversion to sense from Truss, but rather to point out that the brass-necked irrationality of Tory arguments – that somehow net zero targets were pushing everyone’s bills up, and woke warriors had started it all by cancelling Nigel Lawson – will no longer fly. Having given the opposition a lead in the polls, the Conservatives have also given it an electorate sick of rhetoric and inaction, ready for bold ideas. Even with an energy bill freeze, the cost of living crisis has already moved the dial. The idea that hardship is mainly down to personal inadequacy has become fanciful. The notion that people can scrimp their way to solvency, which is given in justification for so many harmful policy decisions, has been comprehensively overturned. There are the green shoots of a new solidarity across all nine bottom deciles. For goodness sake, this woeful party has radicalised centrist dad Martin Lewis, and they don’t even seem to understand how serious that is, what it means for their prospects. Putin, meanwhile, has overplayed his hand: his threat of disruption to energy supply has historically been enough to keep his neighbours docile, and maintain the scratchy equilibrium between democratic states and his increasingly authoritarian one. Actually disrupting the energy supply, conversely, will force us and the EU towards renewable alternatives, and once that gains momentum, the link between geopolitics and carbon resources will ultimately be severed. Good luck with strongman politics when there’s nothing underpinning them but bot farms tweeting mean things. No one would ever wish to have been brought to a place where there are no alternatives. It would be better if Russia had not invaded Ukraine, if inflation were under control, if energy bills weren’t spiralling into impossibility. It would be better if the UK’s situation weren’t so particularly, idiosyncratically, bad. This is what a country looks like after 12 years of people who don’t believe in government, being in government. It turns out if you focus all your energy and resource on cronyism and getting re-elected, you can make life much harder for millions of people in a relatively short space of time. But, for the want of alternatives, we will emerge from the next election with not only a new government but a radical and uncompromising plan for energy that will transform the way we live. We’ll look back on this as the inflection point that got us to net zero.

Historic England is launching an aerial photography tool that allows users to explore images of England over the past century. The bird’s eye views range from second world war defences and nuclear power stations to the remains of neolithic monuments, Roman farmsteads and medieval villages. More than 400,000 photographs from 1919 to the present day, covering 30% of England, will be available to search and view online for the first time. They include images of the remains of a neolithic long barrow near Broughton, Hampshire, iron age forts such as Pilsdon Pen in Dorset and medieval villages such as Old Sulby in Northamptonshire. There are photos of second world war defensive measures such as anti-aircraft obstructions at Hampton Court Palace and camouflaged runways at RAF Kenley in 1941. Images of Greenwich Park in 1946 show it covered in a patchwork of allotments for food after it aided the war effort. A modern photo from August 2006 shows outlines of the allotments appearing through the grass in hot weather. Bomb damage can be seen in images of central Liverpool and the Albert Dock from 1941, 1946 and 1948. Other photographs of note are of 20th-century industrial sites, such as the construction of Tilbury power station in 1955 and its demolition in 2017, and famous buildings, such as views of St James’ Park football stadium in Newcastle from the 1920s and St Paul’s Cathedral after the war. Last year Historic England launched a digital aerial archaeology tool that allows people to discover archaeological details about local landscapes. Duncan Wilson, Historic England’s chief executive, said: “I am delighted that our new online tool will allow people to access easily our wonderful collection of aerial images and enjoy the historic photography that our team uses every day to unlock the mysteries of England’s past.” Nigel Huddleston, the heritage minister, said the tool offered “a bird’s eye view of our past” and encouraged “everyone to explore the thousands of English sites from the last century”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/23/ukraine-100000-civilians-trapped-in-mariupol-amid-russias-constant-bombing-says-zelenskiy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-23T05:26:00Z","webTitle":"100,000 civilians trapped in Mariupol amid Russia’s ‘constant bombing’, says Zelenskiy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/ukraine-100000-civilians-trapped-in-mariupol-amid-russias-constant-bombing-says-zelenskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/23/ukraine-100000-civilians-trapped-in-mariupol-amid-russias-constant-bombing-says-zelenskiy","fields":{"headline":"100,000 civilians trapped in Mariupol amid Russia’s ‘constant bombing’, says Zelenskiy","bodyText":"Almost 100,000 people remain trapped in the ruined city of Mariupol, facing starvation amid “constant” Russian bombardment, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said, as he appealed for the release of a convoy he said had been captured by Russian forces. In a video address late on Tuesday, he renewed his calls for Russia to allow safe humanitarian corridors, and said civilians faced “inhumane conditions. In a total siege. Without food, water, medication, under constant shelling and under constant bombing.” More than 7,000 people had escaped the city in the past 24 hours, he said. However one humanitarian convoy travelling on an agreed route west of the city had been “captured by the occupiers”. The convoy near Mangush consisted of bus drivers and emergency service personnel. “We are doing everything we can to free out people and unblock the movement of humanitarian aid.” he said. Tens of thousands of residents have already fled the besieged southern port city, bringing harrowing testimony of a “freezing hellscape riddled with dead bodies and destroyed buildings”, according to Human Rights Watch. Satellite images of Mariupol released by Maxar on Tuesday showed a charred landscape, with several buildings ablaze and smoke billowing from the city. The Pentagon has said Russia was now pummelling Mariupol using artillery, long-range missiles and naval ships deployed in the nearby Sea of Azov. “They bombed us for the past 20 days,” said 39-year-old Viktoria Totsen, who fled into Poland. “During the last five days, the planes were flying over us every five seconds and dropped bombs everywhere on residential buildings, kindergartens, art schools, everywhere.” “It is clear that the occupiers are not interested in the city of Mariupol, they want to raze it to the ground, to reduce it to ashes of a dead land,” one local official said. Amid the bloodshed, Zelenskiy held out hope for negotiations, which have yielded little since the invasion began on 24 February. “It’s very difficult, sometimes confrontational,” he said. “But step by step we are moving forward.” For the first time, there are signs that Ukrainian forces are going on the offensive, retaking a town near Kyiv and launching counter attacks in the south of the country, amid claims that Russian forces have just a few days of supplies remaining. In the face of intense Ukrainian resistance, the Pentagon believes Russia’s forces may have been reduced by as much as 10% in the four weeks of fighting since the invasion began. “The Russians may be slightly below a 90% level of assessed available combat power,” a senior defence official told reporters in Washington, adding that some Russian forces were suffering from frostbite. The US president, Joe Biden, is due to travel to Brussels this week for Nato and G7 talks to discuss further action against Russia, including tighter sanctions. Biden discussed Moscow’s “brutal” tactics in a call with European leaders on Monday. Biden will then head to Poland, which has received the bulk of more than 3.5 million Ukrainians fleeing war in their country. Zelenskiy will speak virtually at the Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday. Amid concerns that Vladimir Putin, who Biden believes has “his back against the wall”, is considering the use of chemical and biological weapons, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov spoke to CNN about the circumstances in which Russia would use nuclear weapons. Speaking to Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday, Peskov repeatedly refused to rule out that Russia would consider using nuclear weapons against what Moscow saw as an “existential threat.” US Department of Defence spokesman John Kirby said Moscow’s nuclear remarks were “dangerous” and were “not the way a responsible nuclear power should act”. However, Kirby added that Pentagon officials “haven’t seen anything that would lead us to conclude that we need to change our strategic deterrent posture”. Peskov also insisted that the military operation was going “strictly in accordance with the plans and purposes that were established beforehand.” In other developments: Russian forces “looted and destroyed” a laboratory at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials said. “Russian occupiers illegally seized the newest laboratory,” Ukrainian authorities said in a statement late on Tuesday. The laboratory processes radioactive waste and contains “highly active samples” which are now in the hands of Russian forces, the agency added. The deputy head of Kyiv’s police force accused Russia of using white phosphorous munitions in the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk. Oleksiy Biloshytskiy shared online footage, which could not be independently verified, of material burning fiercely underneath a pile of aggregate. “Another use of phosphorus ammunitions in Kramatorsk,” he said. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, has said it is time for Russia to end its “absurd” and “unwinnable” war in Ukraine, as the EU prepared to set up a “trust fund” aimed at helping Kyiv repel the invasion and rebuild afterwards. “Even if Mariupol falls, Ukraine cannot be conquered city by city, street by street, house by house,” Guterres said. Russia plans to unleash a “great terror” on Kherson by kidnapping residents and taking them across the Russian border, an FSB whistleblower has claimed. The Kremlin was no longer willing to “play nicely” with protesters in the Ukrainian city, a letter said. About 300,000 people in the occupied southern city of Kherson are running out of food and medical supplies, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry said.

Yet they were completed within a few years of each other, 1975 and 1973, a few miles apart on the coast of north-west Wales. A good way to experience the poles of British 20th-century architecture is to walk from one to the other, and enjoy some ravishing landscapes on the way. This is a land that runs to extremes of large and small, and harsh and sweet. There are mountains, rising towards their highest point at Snowdon, and extra-terrestrial terrains sculpted by slate quarries, but also little cottages and wooded lanes, and the narrow-gauge Ffestiniog railway, whose minus-sized steam engines chug endearingly over dizzying valleys. Portmeirion is at the pretty end of the spectrum. “As a child,” declared its creator Williams-Ellis, “I just lamented that my lot was cast in Victorian non-conformist Wales, instead of some such sparkling setting as decadent 18th-century Venice.” In 1925, he bought a scenic snippet of the coastline, where a steep cleft in the land descends to the broad sands of the Dwyryd Estuary, and set about bringing a bit of the Mediterranean to his home country. For the next 50 years, with a break from 1939 to 1954, he created what stands there now, an artful assembly of turrets, domes and loggias, of scrolls and finials, blue-pink-turquoise-peach-ochre, with images of mermaids, cherubs and eagles and fragments of older buildings salvaged from demolition sites. The prevailing Italian spirit also accommodates touches of Scandinavia and Japan, and an Alpine or Habsburg onion-domed tower. The industrial world is wished away – a single petrol pump (now antiquated but modern in its time) is surmounted by a plumed heraldic bust. The village is avowedly theatrical. An imposing portico turns out to have nothing behind it, like a stage set, and illusionistic paintings of stone and carving mingle with the real things. Living rock, which sometimes bursts through the delicate architecture, is juxtaposed with papery representations of it. Views are framed and managed, like pictures, by archways and openings. Portmeirion seems also to have drunk from the local Alice-in-Wonderland potion of shrinking and enlarging: optical tricks make buildings look bigger than they really are. It is brilliant and seductive, but also a bit weird. It has the Truman Show creepiness that comes from inhabiting someone else’s all-encompassing fantasy, for which reason it made the perfect location for The Prisoner, the cult 1960s TV series about an intelligence agent trapped in a mysterious village. Also contributing to its odd atmosphere are some quite terrible wall paintings, which show the lifeless cavorting of sexless nudes. Coleg Harlech was built as an adult education college to the designs of the north Wales practice of Colwyn Foulkes &amp; Partners. Its housing tower, a plain oblong standing like a sentinel at the foot of a sea-facing slope, has, as Owen Hatherley puts it in Modern Buildings in Britain, “the elemental power of the Welsh landscape”. It is finished in greenish-grey pebbly concrete, scored with exaggerated joints between the panels to give what Hatherley calls its “ascetic intensity”. The regular rhythm of its windows is interrupted by one off-beat move, a bridge that exploits the slope behind to make the main entrance high up the block, with a band of high windows that lights the shared areas to which it leads. The theatre is more intricate and dramatic, with a curved-walled auditorium hovering above glassy foyers, and the vertical shafts of stair towers rising up the outside, a version of the constructivism of the early Soviet Union modified for the land of Owain Glyndŵr. In between the theatre and tower is Wern Fawr, a stony classical structure originally built as a house in the 1900s. They are a punchy and distinctive triptych. In fairness to the reader, I must report that the current state of the Coleg Harlech buildings makes for an austere experience, one perhaps only for serious students of brutalism. The theatre and old house are under renovation, while the tower is currently disused and broken-windowed. If you’re looking for more conventional tourist attractions there’s the magnificent Unesco world heritage site of Harlech Castle, round-towered on a clifftop like one from a story book – as relentless and stark as the college, to be sure, but lent romance by the passage of centuries. And then there’s the walk between the picturesque village and the brutalist college. You’re travelling along a geological border, where the high land gives way to coastal levels that were once submarine, so you get sweeping views of bodies of water and distant mountains, and winding routes through dense woods, hamlets and small fields. A lovely moment is the dragonfly-rich Llyn Tecwyn Isaf, reflecting trees and cloud-shadowed slopes in its glassy surface, that is everything you could want a lake to be. Exactly which route you take is up to you, but it’s better (where possible) to take the lanes and footpaths that loop inland than the less charming A-roads and B-roads to which Google maps will direct you. It should also be noted that this part of Wales, if coming from other parts of Britain, is hard to reach by public transport, so it’s best to enjoy the journey and take your time. It’s possible, for example, to travel to the coastal town of Llandudno, then inland to Blaenau Ffestiniog, and then walk the 10 or so miles from there to Portmeirion. Or use the holidaymakers’ ride of the Ffestiniog railway as an actual transportation facility (if an expensive one) and travel on it part of the way. This route offers more sights of the tough and the sublime. Blaenau Ffestiniog is the location of the area’s most dramatic slate quarries, and you’ll get views, while walking through wooded slopes and over rushing rivers, of the gigantic, decommissioned nuclear power station at Trawsfynydd, designed by the architect of Coventry Cathedral, Basil Spence. Wherever you go, it’s hard to go wrong in this part of the country, where fearless and singular buildings punctuate the majestic landscape."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/12/property-donated-by-family-of-john-clarke-embroiled-in-victorian-first-nations-dispute","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T20:00:23Z","webTitle":"Property donated by family of John Clarke embroiled in Victorian First Nations dispute","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/12/property-donated-by-family-of-john-clarke-embroiled-in-victorian-first-nations-dispute","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/12/property-donated-by-family-of-john-clarke-embroiled-in-victorian-first-nations-dispute","fields":{"headline":"Property donated by family of John Clarke embroiled in Victorian First Nations dispute","bodyText":"A property donated by the family of renowned satirist and comedian John Clarke has become embroiled in a long-running dispute between two First Nations groups in Victoria. The land on Phillip Island, about 120km south-east of Melbourne, was donated by Clarke’s widow, Helen McDonald, to conservation group Trust for Nature after his death in 2017. Trust for Nature intends to transfer the eight-hectare property to the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation, however a local traditional owner has demanded that be halted. While the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation is the registered local Aboriginal party, the area involves land on which members of the Boonwurrung people is seeking native title via the federal court. Boonwurrung elder Carolyn Briggs said Trust for Nature had made no effort to consult with her people about the handover. “Once again we have been ignored and decisions made for us by non-Indigenous people,” she told Guardian Australia. Briggs argued the Trust for Nature should postpone the land transfer to allow the legal process to run its course. Gayle Austen, the chair of Trust for Nature, said it was continuing negotiations with the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation regarding the Phillip Island property. “This does not in any way affect the native title claim that the Boon Wurrung Foundation are pursuing, and which doesn’t apply to privately owned property,” she said. “Trust for Nature continues to work with all traditional owner groups across Victoria on a range of projects and Caring for Country initiatives. We have expressed our desire to connect with the Boon Wurrung Foundation and explore opportunities with them into the future.” The agreement includes 12 months access and managed rights followed by a title transfer next year. The chair of the Bunurong Land Council Aboriginal Corporation board of directors, Kelly Lehmann, said the transfer was an “amazing opportunity” for Bunurong people. “Through this land we can further support our future generations in learning culture and Caring for Country,” she said in a statement. The native title lawyer James Fitzgerald said the dispute highlighted “the challenges faced when you try to unscramble the eggs of colonialism 200 years after the event”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning According to the Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Council, the only known Boon Wurrung (Bunurong) apical ancestors with living descendents are believed to be women who were abducted by sealers in the early 18th century. The council said due to this disruption, the historical record linking current day people with Boon Wurrung – also known as Bunurong – ancestors is in some places incomplete or contradictory. The Boonwurrung Land and Sea Council has long argued that it is not represented by the Bunurong Land Council, which it has previously claimed was largely made up of interstate members. The Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Council – a public body made up of the 11 traditional owners appointed by the state government – has previously rejected the Boonwurrung Land and Sea Council’s application to be listed as a registered Aboriginal party. Registered Aboriginal parties are traditional owner groups that are legally recognised under the state’s Aboriginal Heritage Act and have responsibility for managing and protecting Aboriginal cultural heritage relating to Country. Under the state’s Traditional Owner Settlement Act, traditional owners are also recognised outside the federal native title scheme. Briggs has previously criticised the Aboriginal Heritage Council for recognising the Bunurong Land Council as representatives of the Boonwurrung people. But in 2019 the state’s supreme court upheld the council’s move to grant the Bunurong Land Council the status of a registered Aboriginal party. The Boonwurrung group is pursuing a native title claim covering about 13,000 sq km over large swathes of Melbourne and Gippsland. The Bunurong Land Council did not respond to questions about the dispute when contacted by Guardian Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/12/go-west-if-you-can-desperate-sydney-tenants-priced-out-of-rentals-even-far-from-cbd","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T20:00:23Z","webTitle":"Go west, if you can: desperate Sydney tenants priced out of rentals, even far from CBD","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/12/go-west-if-you-can-desperate-sydney-tenants-priced-out-of-rentals-even-far-from-cbd","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/12/go-west-if-you-can-desperate-sydney-tenants-priced-out-of-rentals-even-far-from-cbd","fields":{"headline":"Go west, if you can: desperate Sydney tenants priced out of rentals, even far from CBD","bodyText":"By the time Rebecca Khadka arrived at a midweek inspection for a unit to rent in Homebush, she already felt as if she had compromised too much in her desperation to find a home. It is Khadka’s 11th rental inspection. Her expectations have shrunk from a three-bedroom apartment in Strathfield to a two-bedroom unit anywhere in the surrounding suburbs, and her budget has increased by $100 a week to $700. Her applications keep being rejected. “It’s really tough out there, because I don’t want to go too far, I want to live closer to the city, not further from it,” she said. “We didn’t expect the market to be this competitive, and this expensive.” “It’s frustrating having to move from where you are comfortable … I don’t want that change in environment.” Khadka, who works as a nurse in central Sydney, said she had seen up to 40 people at some inspections, scrambling just like she is to find a home as the rental market approaches crisis levels. A survey conducted by the Real Estate Institute of NSW shows the vacancy rate has dropped to a “historical low” of 1.7%. The number of renters per available property had risen by 28% year-on-year, according to the June 2022 rental report from property analysts PropTrack, and Sydney and Melbourne had the greatest increases. The report also found that the number of new rental listings was 13.8% lower nationwide than the 10-year average. The total volume of rental listings was 18.2% lower year-on-year for June, and 27.7% lower than the 10-year average. The consequences of this rental property shortfall is skyrocketing rent, cut-throat demand and a market that leaves those unable to compete without a home. Maya, who asked to go by her first name only, is a single mother of four-year-old twins. She was given just two weeks’ notice to vacate her rental home in Yagoona. That was extended to four weeks after she begged her landlord, she said. Maya said she rushed to inspect and apply for as many properties as possible, spending all day at inspections and all night on the phone with real estate agents. “The landlords kept calling me, every day, pushing me to leave,” she told Guardian Australia. “They said they wanted the property, and when I told them how hard it had been to find somewhere, they said they didn’t care. “They told me it was my problem, that I could end up on the street with my twins.” She applied for more than 15 properties and was finally accepted one day before her notice to vacate took effect. Her new home is smaller but is also more expensive than her previous rental. “Even if it wasn’t what I wanted, even if it was completely different to my expectations, I’m going to love it no matter what,” she said. “It was just so painful to find.” Matthew Everingham, a director and auctioneer at Richard Matthews Real Estate, said that while rent increases were difficult for tenants, “the cost of ownership has significantly increased”.“To be fair though, we haven’t seen a rental market increase like this in many, many years,” he said. “I think the lack of supply is a real catalyst for the competitive nature of the rental market. If there’s not many available, and you’ve got a large amount of prospective tenants looking, then, of course, you’re going to get that demand.” Everingham said some rental inspections had gone from attracting four or five people, to averaging groups of “40 to 50 people”. He said he had noticed more people moving farther west to secure cheaper rent. “We’re seeing a real push from some – moving into the south-west, looking for more value for money and for larger properties,” he said. “And since cost of living has gone up significantly, if they could save a couple of hundred a week and move 15 minutes down the road, they’re going to take it up.” Prof Nicole Gurran, an urban planner and policy analyst at the University of Sydney, said a reduction in rates of homeownership was a major driver behind increased competition for rental properties. “We’ve got a squeezing out of people who would have previously been moving into homeownership, and are stuck in the rental market, as well as those who don’t have the income support, and don’t have the budgets to afford rent,” Gurran said. “We’ve not provided sufficient subsidies for people to be able to afford decent housing in the private rental sector. So there’s been a chronic shortage of low-cost, rental housing in the right location.” “You now have moderate and low income families competing in the same market as those on solid incomes, and it’s squeezing them.” Gurran said that while increasing the amount of social housing provided by the government would alleviate some supply issues, she said expanding the commonwealth rent assistance program would be “the quickest short-term fix”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2022/aug/13/judith-neilson-institute-dismisses-remaining-members-of-advisory-board-after-earlier-director-walkout","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T20:00:23Z","webTitle":"Judith Neilson Institute dismisses remaining members of advisory board after earlier director walkout","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/13/judith-neilson-institute-dismisses-remaining-members-of-advisory-board-after-earlier-director-walkout","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/aug/13/judith-neilson-institute-dismisses-remaining-members-of-advisory-board-after-earlier-director-walkout","fields":{"headline":"Judith Neilson Institute dismisses remaining members of advisory board after earlier director walkout","bodyText":"The Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas (JNI) has dismissed the remaining members of its international advisory council ahead of a review of the not-for-profit which has now been stripped of its founding board, expert journalism panel and management. The billionaire philanthropist funded the institute to the tune of $100m in 2018, but blindsided the organisation earlier this year by announcing she wanted to take it in a different direction. The chief executive officer of the Judith Neilson Foundation, Simon Freeman, said it made sense to dissolve the panel while an internal review of the JNI’s direction is undertaken. “A number of the advisory council members have indicated they may be interested in continuing to work with us,” Freeman told Guardian Australia on Friday. In June, Neilson took control after four independent directors – the former New South Wales chief justice James Spigelman, the Australian’s editor-at-large, Paul Kelly, the chief executive of Free TV, Bridget Fair, and Kate Torney, the former chief executive of the State Library – walked out en masse. Staff and media beneficiaries remain perplexed about what the institute’s new mission to promote “social change journalism” means. The executive director, Mark Ryan, formally exited the institute last week saying he was considering legal action. “To date, no coherent rationale has been provided for what was a totally unnecessary disruption to the institute and its hard-working staff,” Ryan said in an email to council members. “I remain unable to provide a full account of the behaviour of the patron and have no intention of responding to the many media requests I’ve received to provide my version of events. “I’m advised by Australia’s preeminent employment law firm Clayton Utz that I have strong grounds to pursue an adverse action claim and I’m reserving my rights in that regard.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Neilson recently arrived back in the country after an extended overseas trip. Her daughter Beau joined the JNI board, along with Neilson’s lawyer, Daniel Appleby, after the resignation of the independent directors. Sources say Neilson wants to become more personally involved in the activities of the institute and for it to focus more on the consumers of journalism rather than the producers, including non-English speaking communities and those in regional areas. Freeman told the advisory council members, who included Australians Tom Switzer, Catherine Liddle, Richard McGregor and Antoinette Lattouf, their services were no longer needed because JNI was taking a “different approach”. In an email seen by Guardian Australia, Freeman added that Neilson “remains committed to the future of JNI”. JNI once described the council, who include Kyle Pope, the editor-in-chief and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review, as “a group of eminent figures in journalism from around the world” appointed to advise the “independent, non-partisan institution”. “As JNI embarks upon its new direction we would hope that you remain friends of the institute and remain open to the possibility of working together in the future,” Freeman said. “Judith and the board acknowledges and appreciates your contribution in establishing the Institute and bringing it to its present position.” JNI has funded several projects for large and small media outlets, including Nine newspapers and Guardian Australia. It has also organised events and education. Until mid-2021, the institute had distributed $2.5m in grants and had a total expenditure of $7.7m, according to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/13/the-first-monkeypox-vaccines-have-arrived-in-australia-what-do-we-know-about-the-jab-and-who-is-eligible","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T20:00:23Z","webTitle":"The first monkeypox vaccines have arrived in Australia.

What do we know about the jab and who is eligible?","bodyText":"The first monkeypox vaccines have arrived in Australia, with the rollout commencing in Victoria this week. The virus was declared last month as a “communicable disease incident of national significance” by Australia’s chief medical officer, Paul Kelly. The Victorian minister for health, Mary-Anne Thomas, announced on Tuesday that the state had received an initial 3,500 doses of the Jynneos vaccine. Thorne Harbour Health, which operates clinics in Abbotsford and St Kilda, began vaccinating people at 11am the next morning, said Colin Batrouney, its director of health promotion, policy and communications. Demand has been high. “People are very, very motivated and mobilised to get vaccinated,” Batrouney said. “All of our vaccine slots were filled prior to us even opening the door on Wednesday.” Dr George Forgan-Smith, a general practitioner at the Collins Street Medical Centre in Melbourne’s CBD who also began administering Jynneos on Wednesday, said he had a waiting list for the vaccine of about 200 people. As of Friday, there had been 34 cases of monkeypox recorded in Victoria. In the first phase of the rollout, the vaccine is primarily available from five clinics in metro Victoria. Several regional locations are also involved in the rollout, but supplies will be limited until September, when more doses are set to arrive. What do we know about Jynneos? Jynneos is a third-generation smallpox vaccine that is also effective against monkeypox, because the two viruses are closely related. It has fewer side-effects than previous smallpox vaccines, and is administered in two doses, at least 28 days apart. The vaccine is administered under the skin near the tricep muscle in the upper arm. Some people may experience a sore arm, redness or itchiness at the injection site, and flu-like symptoms, Forgan-Smith said. “I had my shot on Wednesday with my GP, and I didn’t have much of a reaction other than feeling a bit tired. Most of my patients have been OK.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The only group that might have a slightly bigger response is people who have eczema or [predisposition to] allergies,” Forgan-Smith said, emphasising that it was still safe for people with skin conditions. “It’s safe for all who are HIV positive. It’s safe for people who are immunocompromised, and it’s safe for people with eczema.” Who is eligible for the monkeypox vaccine? Currently, eligibility is limited to high-risk close contacts of monkeypox cases, laboratory workers who analyse monkeypox specimens, and certain men (both cis and trans) who have sex with men. The last category includes those living with HIV, who attend sex on premises venues, or are intending to engage in sexual practices in North America or Europe before 31 October. Sex workers who engage with any of the mentioned groups are also eligible. For those planning to travel to a country experiencing a significant outbreak, vaccination is recommended four to six weeks ahead of departure, Batrouney said. Forgan-Smith emphasised monkeypox was not a sexually transmitted disease. “It’s transmitted through skin to skin contact,” he said. “Sex is a brilliant way to have skin to skin contact … but [the virus can also be transmitted by] giving somebody a hug, or going to an event and rubbing against people.” “In some ways we’re lucky it’s winter in Australia because people are covered more,” Forgan-Smith said. He urged people who have recently returned from overseas to be vigilant. “If you notice that you’re getting a flu-like illness and you’re feeling horrible, if you’re developing a rash that looks a little bit like chickenpox, then it could be monkeypox,” he said. “The patients I’ve seen didn’t have hundreds of sores.” “The numbers are small, so we can potentially contain this outbreak in Australia if we can get enough people vaccinated.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2020/may/14/the-atom-a-love-affair-review-nuclear-power-documentary-vicky-lesley","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-14T11:00:08Z","webTitle":"The Atom: A Love Affair review – changing reactions to nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/14/the-atom-a-love-affair-review-nuclear-power-documentary-vicky-lesley","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2020/may/14/the-atom-a-love-affair-review-nuclear-power-documentary-vicky-lesley","fields":{"headline":"The Atom: A Love Affair review – changing reactions to nuclear power","bodyText":"Vicki Lesley’s sprightly, inconclusive documentary tackles a perennially controversial subject: nuclear power and its contested ethical status. Like almost all documentaries these days, this begins with a clip of some sonorous 1950s propaganda film – shorthand for the hilariously naive, reactionary stance that we’ve supposedly overcome. It is an amusing gimmick, but in danger of being overused here. Nuclear power was idealistically embraced after the war as part of our white-hot technological future (a notable partisan was once Labour politician Tony Benn) but then rejected with the news of terrifying accidents, notably the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in the United States in 1979. (Lesley perhaps should have mentioned the very real importance of James Bridges’ movie The China Syndrome, a nuclear-disaster drama that came out just before Three Mile Island; praised as prophetic and genuinely instrumental in popularising anti-nuclear attitudes.) Ecological campaigners, particularly in West Germany, led the charge in Europe against nuclear energy. The Chernobyl horror in 1986 frightened even the most diehard pro-nuclear interests; and in 2011, just when we were getting complacent, there was the chilling incident at Fukushima in Japan. Yet the climate crisis, the key question of the age, brought a new revisionist case for nuclear power. The climate crisis is the slo-mo disaster that looms as large in our minds as Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima; nuclear does not emit greenhouse gases, and is still capable of wholesale power generation. Should theoretical future increases in nuclear safety be weighed against the climate disaster that is happening right now, under our noses? For the time being, our love affair with nuclear is over, leaving us with a joyless marriage to fossil fuels, and a chaste courtship with renewables. Lesley gives the last word to the passionate and persuasive anti-nuclear campaigner Ralph Nader, though her film does not commit itself in the same way. • The Atom: A Love Affair is available on Curzon Home Cinema from 15 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/15/first-edition-energy-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T05:20:44Z","webTitle":"Monday briefing: From Germany to Japan, five plans to confront the energy crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/15/first-edition-energy-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/15/first-edition-energy-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Monday briefing: From Germany to Japan, five plans to confront the energy crisis","bodyText":"Good morning. The energy standoff between Russia and the rest of Europe continues to spiral. At the end of July, Russia further reduced supply to the continent, making it harder – and more expensive – for countries to ensure reserves of gas ahead of the winter. In the UK, the government has offered a trickle of policies that are supposed to lighten the load, including a one-off £400 energy bill discount for households and windfall taxes on energy companies that are reporting exceedingly high profits. But is this enough – and how is the rest of the world coping? In today’s newsletter we outline the measures taken by five other countries to address the global energy crisis. Five big stories NHS | The health minister Maria Caulfield has admitted that 34 hospitals have roofs made of concrete that are so badly maintained they could collapse at any moment. Salman Rushdie | The author’s “road to recovery has begun” but “will be long” after his stabbing in western New York, the novelist’s agent has said. “The injuries are severe,” Andrew Wylie told the Guardian in an email – Rushdie received “life changing” injuries to his neck, stomach, eye, chest and thigh. “But his condition is headed in the right direction.” Water | A Lib Dem councillor has called for Thames Water to be fined after it cut water supplies leading to hundreds of households in Surrey having to go three days without tap water at the height of the heatwave. Labour | Keir Starmer has set out a £29bn proposal that Labour says would avoid people having to pay “a penny more” on their energy bills this winter. It includes an £8bn windfall tax on energy company profits and insulating 19m homes over the next decade. Immigration | Data released by the ONS shows there has been a dramatic drop in EU citizens moving to the UK. Last year 43,000 EU citizens received visas for work, family, study or other purposes, in comparison with 230,000 to 430,000 between 2014-2020. In depth: From nationalising utilities to aircon bans, how other countries are coping With reports that energy bills are going to cost the equivalent of two months’ wages by next year, it seems increasingly important that the British government takes a preemptive, rather than reactive, approach to the crisis. So what’s everyone else doing? *** Germany In 2020, Russia supplied over 50% of Germany’s natural gas, roughly a third of all oil, and almost half of all of its coal imports. So when Russia cut gas supplies to Germany at the end of July, the results were catastrophic. In response, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has been labouring to wean the country off its heavy reliance on Russian exports of oil and gas. He has assured German citizens that they won’t be left without energy this winter or with extortionate bills landing on their doorstep. The first thing Scholz did was to pass emergency legislation to reactivate closed oil and coal power plants. It’s not ideal – the government’s environmentalist economics minister, Robert Habeck, has described the move as “painful but necessary”— but it is an effective way of alleviating some pressure in the short term. Scholz has also indicated that he is considering U-turning on Germany’s policy to phase out nuclear energy, and lengthening the lifetime of the country’s only three remaining nuclear plants. The German government is aware these are temporary responses to stop the bleeding. Looking ahead, a central part of Germany’s long term plan is to achieve energy sovereignty by investing in and scaling up the generation of renewable energy. The government is installing more solar and wind energy farms and has recently released an energy efficiency support package of $180bn to Germany’s climate and transformation fund. *** France There are various factors exacerbating the energy crisis in France, and fewer than half of the country’s nuclear reactors are up and running because of maintenance issues. France has decided the best way to mitigate wider economic damage is to cap retail energy prices. This move has already played a crucial role in insulating France from the energy price shock afflicting the rest of the continent. In comparison with the UK, Germany and even the US, France’s inflation rate, at 6.5%, is considerably lower. Another measure Macron has taken to stabilise the situation is to renationalise EDF, France’s main electricity supplier, at a cost of nearly €10bn. The government has also reduced taxes on electricity and approved a €20bn package of measures to help struggling households cope with rising energy and food prices. *** US It’s not just Europe dealing with this debilitating problem. The US is contending with the worst energy crisis since the 1970s. Last month, gasoline prices reached $5 a gallon for the first time ever, natural gas hit its highest mark in 14 years and electricity grid operators announced controlled outages are likely. In response, Senator Joe Manchin is backing a $369bn climate and energy deal. The legislation would include tax credits for buying environmentally friendly vehicles, incentives to accelerate the rollout of wind and solar farms, and support for nuclear power production. However, for this legislation to have any impact on the current crisis, it would have to be rolled out quickly and efficiently – which in the context of the US’s political gridlock is unlikely. *** Japan Japan is no stranger to an energy crisis. After the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in 2011 that triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, energy saving became a cornerstone national project for the country. So, unlike in many other countries, Japan already has a blueprint for how to deal with this kind of crisis. Instead of large, governmental interventions, the focus seems to be on individuals cutting back. The government has long encouraged businesses and households to lower their use of air conditioners and avoid using other power-hungry appliances. The suspension of nuclear power for the last decade has made problems worse – as the crisis continues, it’s clear Japan is going to have to reevaluate the way it generates energy. *** Pakistan For Pakistan, a country that depends on imported fuel, the global energy crisis has left its economy in a dire place. Power cuts have significantly affected commercial activity, and gas rationing to the textile industry, a vital part of Pakistan’s economy, has resulted in a loss of $1bn in export orders. To deal with this, Pakistan has announced that it is open to long-term contracts of up to 30 years – most likely with Qatar and the UAE. Long-term contracts however are reportedly 75% more expensive than they were a year ago. Experts estimate that if Pakistan signed a deal now, a single cargo could cost roughly $55m-$61m. Pakistan is also looking inward and, like many other countries, turning to its nuclear plants to alleviate some of the pressure. Whether this will be enough is unclear.

At least, if we weren’t in the village where we sometimes spend weekends away from our home in Kyiv. The bread we bought in the village was always tastier than the city stuff. In the Ukrainian countryside, there is a long tradition of having plenty of bread on the table and of eating it with butter and salt or dipping it in milk. Bread dipped in fresh cow’s milk was also given to little kids and they loved it. Since arriving in western Ukraine, where like hundreds of thousands of my fellow countrymen my family has sought relative safety, we find ourselves eating much more bread than before. Our boys have always loved fresh bread. They enjoy making and eating sandwiches. In our village shop, we would buy our favourite Makariv loaf – a soft, white, brick-shaped loaf. It was baked at the well-known Makariv bakery which is 20km from our village. Occasionally, you could find this bread in Kyiv, but only in small corner shops, not supermarkets. I have been thinking about that Makariv bread for several days now, remembering the taste. Only now, as I remember, I sense the taste of blood on my lips, like when I was a child if someone split my lip in a fight. The fact is Makariv bakery was bombed a few days ago by Russian troops. The bakers were at work. I can imagine the fragrant smell that surrounded them the moment before the attack. In an instant, 13 bakery staff were killed and nine were injured. And the bakery is no more – “Makariv bread” is a thing of the past. * * * I have long since run out of words to describe the horror brought by Putin to Ukrainian soil. Ukraine is the land of bread and wheat. Even in Egypt, bread and cakes are baked using Ukrainian flour. It’s the time of year to prepare the fields for sowing, but this work is not being done. The soil of the wheat fields is full of metal – fragments of shells, pieces of blown-up tanks and cars, the remains of downed planes and helicopters. And it’s all covered in blood. The blood of Russian soldiers who do not understand what they are fighting for, and the blood of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians who know that if they do not fight, Ukraine will no longer exist. In its place there will be a cemetery with a caretaker’s hut and some kind of governor general sent from Russia will sit and guard it. Bread was mixed with blood in Chernihiv as well when Russian bombers dropped “dumb” unguided bombs on a square next to a bread shop. People had lined up outside, waiting to buy some fresh, warm bread. Someone was just leaving the store with a bag of it. Many people died in this bombing raid. Amnesty International has documented this crime committed by the Russian army. Every day the list of crimes grows longer as more and more of Putin’s actions are added to it – the shooting of young volunteers who were carrying food to the dog shelter in Hostomel; the murder of postmen who were delivering pensions to elderly residents in Sumy region; the killing of five people in an attack on the Kyiv television tower. The list goes on and on. We certainly don’t yet know about all the crimes that have been committed, but we will definitely find out about them all, and the list will be presented at a new Nuremberg trial. It doesn’t matter where it takes place. The main thing is that we know who will be judged. International lawyers have already begun to collect evidence of crimes. Ukrainians are looking forward to the verdict on the murderers and war criminals. But for now, they must survive under the shelling of the Russian army. They spend their nights in basements, in bomb shelters, in bathrooms – the latest advice circulating on the internet tells us that in case of a bombing raid, the safest places to be are inside your cast-iron bath or in interior corridors where there are no windows. The people of Kyiv have grown suddenly much more attached to their metro, one of the most beautiful and deepest in the world. The metro is no longer a form of transport – it is a haven, like something from an apocalyptic movie. It is covered with signs of permanent presence of non-travelling “passengers” and there is living space everywhere. The station platforms are being turned into cinemas where films are shown for free – children’s films in the morning and films for a wider audience later in the day. Large screens have already been hung or are being hung right now at 14 Kyiv metro stations. There is a constant supply of tea, the internet is already there, but the connection is poor. There are not enough toilets, but people don’t complain about queuing for 40 minutes or more. Everyone waits patiently. They are waiting for the end of the war and the beginning of the trial – a trial that the whole world will have to follow, as the whole world followed at Nuremberg. * * * And, in Russia, what do they think about the future court proceedings? I am afraid they don’t think about it at all. They are now busy buying dollars and euros. Sanctions targeting the banking sector have caused the value of the rouble to fall dramatically, provoking panic. Panic is also observed on the Russian-Finnish border, via which many Russians are now trying to leave their homeland. They are those who are ashamed to stay in Russia, and those who could be drafted into the army, those who do not want to die or do not want to kill or do not want to be cannon fodder for the Kremlin. Some captured Russian soldiers have asked for permission to remain in Ukraine for good. “Jail awaits us if we return!” they say. On the borders of Ukraine with Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland, there are still queues of refugees. It’s said that some Ukrainians are trying to leave the country using fake Russian passports. These are those who don’t want to fight either. I won’t judge them. Let time and history judge everyone. I am glad that at this most difficult of times, most Ukrainians have maintained their humanity and try to help each other. Mobilisation has been announced, but no one is forcibly taken into the army. Those who themselves want to defend their homeland come to the military registration and enlistment offices and get registered. Most often, they are asked to leave a phone number and to wait for a call. There are many who want to fight the invaders, but not all of those who want to fight are really ready to participate in military action. In the last couple of days, I’ve started to dread opening Facebook. More and more often in the news feed, I see posts by young Ukrainian women declaring their love for their recently killed husbands. I know some of these women and have met their husbands. I cannot read these cries of despair thrown into the bottomless well of the internet without tears. But I can’t not read them either. I want to see and hear everything that is happening now in my country. I know that in the occupied Melitopol, in the south of Ukraine, arrests of Crimean Tatar activists and other active citizens have begun. I know that the workers of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have been kept inside the station by the Russian invaders, that their mobile phones were taken away and that they have not been allowed to leave the station for more than a week now. Moscow television propagandists have gone there under the protection of the Russian military to make news stories. I don’t know what they are saying in Russia about this war, about the captured Chernobyl nuclear power plant, about the captured Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is still in operation. Why do they need this non-military atomic installation? Are they planning to blackmail Ukraine and the world? Why are they bombing children’s hospitals and schools? Why destroy residential areas of Chernihiv, Borodianka, Kharkiv, and Mariupol? Why, after all, are they bombing bakeries and bread shops? I don’t have answers to these questions. “You can’t understand Russia with your mind!” wrote the 19th-century Russian poet Fyodor Tyutchev. I agree with him, but I still have a question: how can one understand Russia at all, if the mind does not help?

Bogs, meanwhile, sound comical. Marshes are pleasanter, although bring malaria to mind, while wetlands emanate wholesomeness but are also wet in the “meh” sense of take it or leave it. Yet, as Tom Blass explains, these words all refer to the same thing: a place where land and water have got into a tussle and can’t decide which has won. The result is not so much an equilibrium, although these states of semi-submersion can hold their nerve for millennia, more a temporary detente where both sides are too exhausted to declare an outcome. It is in search of these in-between places that Blass travels from Cyprus to Lapland, Romania to Virginia, eyes peeled and treading gingerly lest he fall into the murk that lies beneath. Early on, Blass reveals himself to be more ethnologist than naturalist. While he pays respectful attention to the fauna that he encounters as he tacks from the Romney Marshes to Louisiana’s bayous by way of the Danube delta, it is the people he is after. The Lipovans, Cajuns and Seminole are all ethnic groups that have moulded a culture from the sludge squelching between their toes and this is the true subject of Blass’s bracingly original work. Above all, he is scrupulous about avoiding cliches. There are, for instance, very few glorious sunsets in Swamp Songs or encounters with gnarly old locals acting as aquifers for ancient wisdom, small mercies for which the reader should be grateful. This desire to skewer the cliches of his chosen genre starts early on, when Blass makes a trip to Dungeness, which in summer “is overrun by sea kale, psycho-geographers and, dammit, by people like me”. What people like him tend to be after, of course, is Prospect Cottage, the isolated clapperboard dwelling in which the film director Derek Jarman spent his last years cultivating his garden, a Shintoesque, salt-blown wonder in the lee of the looming nuclear power station. Even here, Blass can’t resist undercutting the conventions of his chosen genre, which may, indeed, be psycho-geography. “‘That’s it,’ they say. ‘That’s Derek Jarman’s house.’ And they move on, because really, there isn’t a great deal to see.” Such deadpanning is much in evidence too when Blass heads for the Great Dismal Swamp of Virginia’s coastal plane. The very name of the place is tautologous, since from the 17th century the word “dismal” was a catch-all term for a quagmire. “In other words, all swamps were dismal by dint of being swampy,” he writes. Still, Dismal does seem to live up to the modern usage, offering the visiting Blass nothing but a series of guarded, misfiring interactions with the inhabitants who are doing their favourite thing of fishing for bowfin and bullheads while giving nothing away. The only clue as to what may lie behind this persistent sense of Dismal’s menace is the fact that in the domestic front yards you can see Confederate flags alongside the more usual stars and stripes. The year is 2016, and as Blass drives round the edge of the swamp the US presidential election is only a few weeks away. Everywhere he sees placards that bear the slogans “Lock Her Up” and “Make America Great Again”. Most chilling of all, though, is the exhortation to “Drain the Swamp”. Blass discovers that historically the Dismal was the last redoubt of Black people running away from the plantations, fugitive Native Americans, English and Irish indentured labourers. Seen in this context, to “drain the swamp” is to recast a cluster of oppressed and vulnerable people as bogeymen. Before Britons feel too smug, Blass finds this dynamic alive and well closer to home. Back at the Romney Marshes, near to where he lives, he explores the local romance of smuggling, which has endured over centuries thanks to the watery inlets that allow small boats to drift quietly ashore and unload well away from the customs officer’s gaze. But Blass turns his binoculars sharply round and, before we know it, we are confronting the fact that every month refugees are smuggled across the Channel to land at nearby Dover. They are greeted, if not as swamp monsters exactly, then certainly as creatures from the deep to be swiftly dealt with and dispatched. • Swamp Songs: Journeys Through Marsh, Meadow and Other Wetlands by Tom Blass is published by Bloomsbury (£20).

Peter Dutton has delivered his budget reply speech, focusing on rising power prices and again calling for a discussion around nuclear power. It came hours before the UN warned there was now “no credible pathway” to limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C, the goal set to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis. Two weeks after the Medibank cyber-attack, the question that remains unanswered is: will the company pay a ransom? The hacker claimed to have extracted 200GB of files with data on all of the company’s 3.9 million customers. Richard Buckland, a professor of cybercrime at the University of New South Wales, said the Medibank case was one of the few where a company should pay the ransom, contrary to official advice. The climate crisis has reached a “really bleak moment”, one of the world’s leading climate scientists has said, after a slew of major reports laid bare how close the planet is to catastrophe. The UN’s environment agency has said there is “no credible pathway to 1.5C in place” and the failure to reduce carbon emissions means the only way to limit the worst impacts of the climate crisis is a “rapid transformation of societies”. The grieving mother of 15-year-old Cassius Turvey, killed in an alleged violent attack in Perth, has questioned why police took only a brief statement from the schoolboy before he died in hospital. She said she was frustrated that police, apart from taking a brief statement from Cassius the night he was admitted to hospital, did not take a further statement from him before he died. “We did not hear from any detectives, no police. Nothing. For five full days. That was their opportunity. That was their window,” Turvey said. Australia A chance discovery has ended the trial of Bruce Lehrmann for the alleged rape of Brittany Higgins, with ACT supreme court chief justice Lucy McCallum forced to abort the trial after it was found that a juror was thought to have brought in outside research material into the court.

The agreement was announced by Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, and her Israeli counterpart Yair Lapid, despite evidence that spyware made by Israeli company NSO Group had probably been used to spy on two British lawyers advising the ex-wife of the ruler of Dubai, Princess Haya. In a joint article in the Daily Telegraph, Truss and Lapid said the agreement amounted to “a new strategic plan for the next decade spanning cyber, tech, trade and defence,” while the two countries would “work night and day to prevent the Iranian regime from ever becoming a nuclear power”. The ministers added that the two countries would “work closer” to defend themselves in cyberspace, while Israel would become a tier one cyber partner for the UK and have greater access to the British market. “Our partnership will keep us at the forefront of the technological revolution,” Truss and Lapid added. Just over a week ago, Priti Patel, the home secretary, announced that the UK would proscribe the political wing of Palestinian political group Hamas, bringing the UK in line with the US and the EU. “Hamas is fundamentally and rabidly antisemitic,” Patel said in a speech she gave in Washington DC. But it comes after a British court ruled that NSO’s Pegasus spyware had been used against divorce lawyer Lady Shackleton, and an associate, at a time when they were advising Princess Haya in a child protection battle being played out in the UK. British complaints at the time were relatively muted, although sources close to the company said it had altered its software to prevent +44 UK numbers from being spied on again. NSO technology has since been put on a US blacklist, citing use of the company’s software by regimes around the world for “transnational repression”. Meanwhile, talks with Iran on salvaging the 2015 nuclear deal restart on Monday in Vienna after a five-month break, although there is little hope of a breakthrough that would allow the US to rejoin the agreement given Tehran’s negotiating demands. Nevertheless, in the joint statement by the foreign ministers, Britain seeks to reassure Israel that it will remain vigilant on the issue. “We will also work night and day to prevent the Iranian regime from ever becoming a nuclear power. The clock is ticking, which heightens the need for close cooperation with our partners and friends to thwart Tehran’s ambitions,” Truss and Lapid said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-reacts-cautiously-to-russias-plan-to-station-tactical-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-26T17:00:17Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Russian plans for nuclear weapons in Belarus ‘dangerous and irresponsible’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-reacts-cautiously-to-russias-plan-to-station-tactical-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-reacts-cautiously-to-russias-plan-to-station-tactical-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Russian plans for nuclear weapons in Belarus ‘dangerous and irresponsible’ – as it happened","bodyText":"It is now 8pm in Kyiv, and that concludes today’s Ukraine war live blog. Thanks for following along. Here is a summary of today’s events: Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports. Kyiv has reacted to Russia’s plans in Belarus by calling for an emergency meeting of the United Nations’ Security Council. In a statement, Kyiv’s foreign ministry described Russia’s plans to station nuclear weapons in Belarus as “another provocative step” by Moscow that undermines “the international security system as a whole”. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, said the Kremlin has taken Belarus as a “nuclear hostage”. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak accused Vladimir Putin of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and resorting to “scare” tactics. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has cautioned Belarus against hosting Russian nuclear weapons on its territory. Borrell tweeted: “#Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation &amp; threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” The United States has not seen any indication that Russia has yet moved nuclear weapons to Belarus, national security council spokesman John Kirby said Sunday. “We have not seen any indication that he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around,” Kirby told CBS. Three people were reported injured and three residential buildings were damaged following an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region. Law enforcement has attributed the blast to a Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV drone “packed with explosives”. None of the people hurt in the blast are believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in a televised interview broadcast. Putin stated that the two countries’ military cooperation was transparent, news agencies reported. The UK Ministry of Defence says that since the start of March 2023, Russia is likely to have launched at least 71 Iranian-designed Shahed series one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicle (OWA-UAVS) against targets across Ukraine. It says Russia is likely launching Shaheds from two axes: from Russia’s Krasnodar Krai in the east and from Bryansk Oblast in the north-east. Ukraine will no longer resort to “dangerous” monetary financing to fund the war against Russia, its central bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday. Ukrainian refugees are increasingly being targeted for sexual exploitation with an increase in interest in pornography claiming to feature refugees from the war-torn country, according to research by Thomson Reuters. Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence Hanna Maliar went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all.

Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”. Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid.” The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. Separately, Britain’s defence ministry said the months-long Russian assault on the city had stalled, mainly as a result of heavy troop losses. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. Several buildings were damaged but no one was injured following the detonation of a naval mine that hit some coastline facilities in Odesa, according to the Odesa city council. The Kyiv Independent quoted authorities as saying that no one was injured. Russian oil company Gazprom reduced gas exports to the EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports.

The United States has not seen any indication that Russia has yet moved nuclear weapons to its neighbor Belarus, national security council spokesman John Kirby said Sunday, according to AFP. “We have not seen any indication that he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around,” Kirby told CBS. Three people were reported injured following the explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region, which law enforcement has attributed to a Ukrainian drone. “A Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV was the cause of an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk, Tula region,” the Tass news agency quoted a law enforcement agency source as saying, according to Reuters. “The drone was packed with explosives.” None of the people hurt in the blast are believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell cautioned Belarus against hosting Russian nuclear weapons on its territory, warning the move may trigger additional sanctions. In a Sunday tweet, Borrell said: “#Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation &amp; threat to European security.” “Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice,” he added. “The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” On Saturday, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced an agreement reached with Belarus will see Moscow stationing tactical nuclear weapons on its smaller neighbors’ territory. Here are some images coming to us over the wires. More details are emerging about the reported explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region, where two people suffered shrapnel wounds. The crater was caused by a drone, the Tass news agency quoted law enforcement as saying, Reuters reports. Three residential buildings were also damaged following the explosion, a regional security agency said. More reaction from Kyiv on plans by Russian president Vladimir Putin to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. In a statement, Kyiv’s foreign ministry described it as “another provocative step” by Moscow that undermines “the international security system as a whole”. The ministry said: Russia once again confirms its chronic inability to be a responsible steward of nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence and prevention of war, not as a tool of threats and intimidation. It demanded a UN security council session and called on the Group of Seven countries and the European Union to warn Belarus of “far-reaching consequences” if it accepts the Russian weapons. The Ukrainian statement added: Ukraine calls on all members of the international community to convey to the criminal (P)utin regime the categorical unacceptability of its next nuclear provocations and to take decisive measures to effectively deter and prevent any possibility of the aggressor state’s use of nuclear weapons. Two people have suffered shrapnel wounds following an explosion on Sunday in the town of Kireyevsk, about 220km (140 miles) south of Moscow, the Tass news agency cited emergency services as saying. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known, but it left a crater in the centre of the town, in the Tula region, Reuters reports. “The explosion sounded at 1519 (1219 GMT). Two victims, born in 2002 and 2006, have shrapnel wounds. Emergency services are on the scene,” Tass quoted a local emergency services representative as saying. “There is a crater. This explosion was in the heart of the city,” the representative added. The representative said the injuries were not life-threatening and that investigators were working at the site. Several nearby buildings were damaged but no one was injured after a naval mine detonated after hitting some some coastline facilities in Odesa, according to Odesa city council. The Kyiv Independent quoted authorities as saying that no one was injured. Ukraine fans have been gathering near Wembley, in north London, ahead of this evening’s UEFA Euro 2024 Group C qualifying match against England: It is just after 4pm in Kyiv. Here is a summary of events so far. Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports. Kyiv has said Russia was holding Minsk as a “nuclear hostage” after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to ally Belarus, Agence France-Presse reports.

Ukraine has called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations’ Security Council over Russia’s announcement that it would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. The Ukrainian foreign ministry said: Ukraine expects effective actions to counteract the Kremlin’s nuclear blackmail from the United Kingdom, China, the United States and France... We demand that an extraordinary meeting of the UN Security Council be immediately convened for this purpose. Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports. A Nato spokesperson said on Sunday: Nato is vigilant, and we are closely monitoring the situation. We have not seen any changes in Russia’s nuclear posture that would lead us to adjust our own. Russia’s reference to Nato’s nuclear sharing is totally misleading. Nato allies act with full respect of their international commitments. Russia has consistently broken its arms control commitments, most recently suspending its participation in the New START Treaty. The Associated Press reports on a new recruitment campaign launched across Russia seeking volunteers to enlist troops for the war in Ukraine. Advertisements promise cash bonuses and enticing benefits. Recruiters are making cold calls to eligible men. Enlistment offices are working with universities and social service agencies to lure students and the unemployed. A new campaign is under way this spring across Russia, seeking recruits to replenish its troops for the war in Ukraine. As fighting grinds on in Ukrainian battlegrounds like Bakhmut and both sides prepare for counter-offensives that could cost even more lives, the Kremlin’s war machine badly needs new recruits. A mobilisation in September of 300,000 reservists – billed as a “partial” call-up – sent panic throughout the country, since most men under 65 are formally part of the reserve. Tens of thousands fled Russia rather than report to recruiting stations. The Kremlin denies that another call-up is planned for what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, now more than a year old. But amid widespread uncertainty of whether such a move will eventually happen, the government is enticing men to volunteer, either at makeshift recruiting centres popping up in various regions, or with phone calls from enlistment officials. That way, it can “avoid declaring a formal second mobilisation wave” after the first one proved so unpopular, according to a recent report by the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War. One Muscovite told the Associated Press that his employer, a state-funded organisation, gathered up the military registration cards of all male employees of fighting age and said it would get them deferments. But he said the move still sent a wave of fear through him. “It makes you nervous and scared – no one wants to all of a sudden end up in a war with a rifle in their hands,” said the resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared reprisal. “The special operation is somewhat dragging on, so any surprises from the Russian authorities can be expected.” Former Russian state TV editor Marina Ovsyannikova, who in 2022 interrupted a live news broadcast denouncing the Ukraine war, has said her son called her a “traitor” for her actions, adding that she may never be able to return to Russia. Ukrainian-born Ovsyannikova, who was an editor at Channel One, burst on to the set of the nightly news in March 2022 shouting: “Stop the war. No to war.” She also held a sign saying: “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” It was signed in English: “Russians against the war.” At the time, she was fined 30,000 roubles (£460) for ignoring protest laws. She continued protesting against the war after quitting her job at Channel One. Last August, she was charged with spreading false information about the Russian army for holding up a poster that read “Putin is a murderer, his soldiers are fascists” during a solo protest on the Moskva River embankment opposite the Kremlin. She was subsequently forced to wear an electronic ankle bracelet and placed under house arrest in Moscow, where she was to await trial. She faced up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. However, she escaped her pre-trial house arrest and fled to Europe. She now lives in Paris, France, with her daughter. Shortly after she left Russia, she said her son had told her that her decision to protest had ruined the family’s life. She told BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: My son still called me a traitor, that I betrayed our family. I betrayed our country. I can say that for millions of families [this] is the same situation – war ruins a lot of families. And this is a real catastrophe because Russians have been destroyed by Putin, not only physically by him sending them to war but also on a psychological level. Russia is now deep in depression, there is an apathy everywhere and millions of people just don’t know what the future holds. When asked if she thought it would ever be safe for her to return to Russia, she said: I can’t go back now. But I do see my future with Russia. My son is there, my family is there, my mum, and they don’t want to leave the country. For me, I am not indifferent to the future of this country and I will fight for the future even being outside of Russia. Ovsyannikova said she was “ashamed” of Russia for invading Ukraine and recalling how she had “mixed emotions” before she made the 2022 protest, she explained: A lot of factors came together. Over a long time I realised that the Russian TV became like a gigantic brainwashing machine. Secondly, I have Ukrainian roots – my father is from Ukraine. It was like this huge emotional outburst. But I didn’t really care what would happen to me later.” Ovsyannikova had worked at the channel for nearly 20 years and admitted she had in the past “shut my eyes to it [the propaganda]”, but the war became “a point of no return”. She said: This propaganda is made on a very high level …These people who are working in the main media channels, they don’t really believe it. They have similar views to me, and also, you can say that people who are pro-Putin, who are convinced in him, as no more than 10 or 20%. The arrest warrant handed to President Putin by the international criminal court could herald change, she added: I think this is the first signal that the Russian elite should take notice of, and perhaps some kind of resistance will start within the Russian elite and they might plot against him. At least this is some kind of hope for me. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak has accused Vladimir Putin of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and resorting to “scare” tactics. On Saturday, Putin announced Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in neighbour and ally Belarus “without violating our international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation”, Agence France-Presse reports. But Podolyak said on Twitter: Making a statement about tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, he admits that he is afraid of losing and all he can do is scare with tactics … Second. He once again states his involvement in the crime. Violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty … Ukrainian refugees are increasingly being targeted for sexual exploitation with an increase in interest in pornography claiming to feature refugees from the war-torn country, according to research. Thomson Reuters has conducted the research, which has found that Ukrainian refugees may be victims of both traffickers on the ground and cyber-voyeurs. Researchers identified an increased interest in Ukrainian pornography since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 by analysing global internet search engine traffic. They believe the increased interest online may be encouraging traffickers to act more often and with greater impunity. The organisation has called for urgent action to strengthen protections to help keep Ukrainian women and children who are at risk from sexual exploitation safe. The analysis of internet search trends has found views of pornographic videos claiming to show Ukrainian refugees have exploded in the past six months. A snapshot of 13 pornographic videos claiming to feature Ukrainian refugees shows they were viewed 275,000 times in January. While there was evidence of sexual exploitation and trafficking of some Ukrainians before the war started, the latest data shows a significant increase since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Worldwide search traffic for exploitative terms such as “Ukrainian porn” have been consistently at higher levels since the February 2022 invasion. Thomson Reuters is working with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to raise awareness about this sexual exploitation. They have partnered to launch the “Be Safe” campaign to encourage the global community to provide Ukrainians with safety information and to help them to spot the warning signs of traffickers. Valiant Richey, the OSCE special representative and coordinator for combating trafficking in human beings, said: “This analysis shows just how crucial it is to keep women and children fleeing the war safe. The high demand from men for sexual access to Ukrainian women and girls creates an enormous incentive for traffickers to recruit vulnerable people in order to meet that demand and profit from it. “We already found direct evidence of recruitment attempts on chats used by Ukrainians and an increase in the advertisement of Ukrainians online.” The new data is based on “interest scores”, which relate directly to search traffic and compare a term’s popularity over a specific period. Earlier analysis in 2022 found that global internet searches for sexually exploitative terms specifically relating to Ukrainian refugees surged following the outbreak of the war. In March 2022, research found a 300% global increase in these terms. You can read the full report here. Here are some images coming to us over the wires. Here’s some more on football. Later on Sunday, Ukraine take on England at the UK’s Wembley Stadium in a qualifying match for the men’s Euro 2024 football competition. UK ministers offered 1,000 free tickets to Ukrainians and their sponsors to attend the match at Wembley. Denys Dreyzer, 18, from Kherson, fled Ukraine in May 2022 and came to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. He and his family have since moved out from their hosts' home. Dreyzer, who works as caretaker for the Ukrainian Community Centre and is studying at the University of Bolton, will attend the game with his mother and sister, who he lives with in Bradford. His father is in Kyiv. Discussing the match, he told PA News: I hope it will be amazing, because it’s like new fresh air to our community to watch our guys fighting to get to the Euros. We hope this game our guys will show what we can do. And also it will be good present for our military, because they are every day fighting for our freedom. I hope they will watch this game and this game will will make them happy. The Azadi Stadium in Tehran can hold up to 78,000 at capacity. As Anton Miranchuk of Lokomotiv Moscow kicked off under a giant portrait of the former supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini on Thursday night, let’s generously say it wasn’t quite full. Still, what crowd there was made a pretty decent noise. There were even a few hundred travelling fans, who were rewarded when Miranchuk scored for Russia from the penalty spot. Early in the second half the Porto striker Mehdi Taremi equalised for Iran, and although the later stages disintegrated into a procession of substitutions, the visitors were ultimately a little fortunate to escape with a 1-1 draw. Honours even on the pitch, then, which felt like a diplomatically fitting result. Over the past year, as the west has begun to close ranks, these two pariah states have found themselves locked in a pragmatic but increasingly enthusiastic embrace. Russian money has been pouring into Iranian mining and infrastructure projects, to the point where it is now Iran’s largest source of foreign investment. Iran has invited Russian businesspeople to Tehran to share advice on circumventing western sanctions. The two countries have linked their banking systems and embarked on joint naval drills. And last month the Russian and Iranian sports ministers signed a “memorandum of mutual understanding”, vowing to strengthen their sporting ties. On Sunday evening, Ukraine’s footballers will step out at Wembley Stadium to a vivid fanfare: a sea of flags and bold gestures, an outpouring of affection and solidarity that has greeted them pretty much everywhere they have travelled in the last year. At exactly the same time, in St Petersburg’s Krestovsky Stadium, Russia will play Iraq in their first national team game on home soil since the start of last year’s war. Good luck finding the game on television or tracking down a match report on the Fifa website. But seamlessly, almost imperceptibly, Russia has returned to the international football treadmill, and nobody seems overly perturbed by it. Even Ukraine, who called for Iran to be thrown out of last year’s World Cup for its role in supplying drones to the Russian war effort, has in this instance opted for apathy over outrage. “Those countries who play Russia, an aggressor, support Russian aggression and what Russia is doing to Ukraine,” said Ukraine’s caretaker manager, Ruslan Rotan, last week. “We don’t have to think about those countries, we don’t have to pay attention to them. They are not worthy. The bottom line is, forget Russia.” Read the full report here. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in a televised interview broadcast on Sunday, stating that the two countries’ military cooperation was transparent, news agencies reported. Putin also said western powers were building a new “axis”, bearing some resemblance to Germany and Japan’s second world war alliance. Interfax quoted Putin as saying: We are not creating any military alliance with China. Yes, we have cooperation in the sphere of military-technical interaction. We are not hiding this. Everything is transparent, there is nothing secret. Kyiv on Sunday said Russia was holding Minsk as a “nuclear hostage” after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to ally Belarus, Agence France-Presse reports. “The Kremlin took Belarus as a nuclear hostage,” the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, Oleksiy Danilov, wrote on Twitter, adding that the move was “a step towards the internal destabilisation of the country”. The UK Ministry of Defence says that since the start of March 2023 Russia is likely to have launched at least 71 Iranian-designed Shahed series one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicle (OWA-UAVS) against targets across Ukraine. It says Russia is likely launching Shaheds from two axes: from Russia’s Krasnodar Krai in the east and from Bryansk Oblast in the north-east. Ukraine will no longer resort to “dangerous” monetary financing to fund the war against Russia, its central bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday. The head of the National Bank of Ukraine said that it had “created huge risks for macro-financial stability” when the bank was last year forced to print billions of hryvnia to plug a budget shortfall, adding that an “open conflict” with the government over the issue had been resolved. “It was a quick remedy, but very dangerous,” Pyshnyi told the newspaper. Reactions continue on Vladimir Putin’s announcement Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. “It’s a very significant move,” Nikolai Sokov, a senior fellow at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, told Reuters. “Russia had always been very proud that it had no nuclear weapons outside its territory. So, now, yes, they are changing that and it’s a big change.” Putin did not specify when the weapons would be transferred to Belarus, which has borders with three Nato members – Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. He said Russia would complete the construction of a storage facility there by 1 July. “This is part of Putin’s game to try to intimidate Nato … because there is no military utility from doing this in Belarus as Russia has so many of these weapons and forces inside Russia,” said Hans Kristensen, director of the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons called Putin’s announcement on an extremely dangerous escalation. “In the context of the war in Ukraine, the likelihood of miscalculation or misinterpretation is extremely high. Sharing nuclear weapons makes the situation much worse and risks catastrophic humanitarian consequences,” it said on Twitter. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Christine Kearney to bring you up to speed with the latest developments. The US – the world’s other nuclear superpower – has reacted cautiously to Russia’s deal to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. A senior US administration official says there are no signs Moscow plans to use its nuclear weapons. Putin likened his plans to the US stationing its weapons in Europe and said that Russia would not be transferring control to Belarus. But this could be the first time since the mid-1990s that Russia were to base such weapons outside the country. Hawkish Russian politicians and commentators have long-speculated about nuclear strikes, saying Russia has the right to defend itself with nuclear weapons if it is pushed beyond its limits. “Tactical” nuclear weapons refer to those used for specific gains on a battlefield rather than those with the capacity to wipe out cities. It is unclear how many such weapons Russia has, given it is an area still shrouded in cold war secrecy. Experts say the development is significant, since Russia had until now been proud that unlike the US, it did not deploy nuclear weapons outside its borders. The senior US administration official noted that Russia and Belarus had been speaking about the transfer of nuclear weapons for some time. “We have seen reports of Russia’s announcement and will continue to monitor this situation,” the US defence department’s press office said in a written statement. “We have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture nor any indications Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon. We remain committed to the collective defence of the Nato alliance.” In other key developments shortly after 9am in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv: Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence Hanna Maliar went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. The head of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”. Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid.” The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. Separately, Britain’s defence ministry said the months-long Russian assault on the city had stalled, mainly as a result of heavy troop losses. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. Russian oil company Gazprom reduced gas exports to the EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On 24 March, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5m cubic metres. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2m cubic metres. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reported that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported. More than 5,000 former criminals have been pardoned after finishing their contracts to fight in Russia’s Wagner mercenary group against Ukraine, the founder of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said on Saturday. The Wagner group, originally staffed by battle-hardened veterans of the Russian armed forces, took on a much more prominent role in the Ukraine war after the Russian army suffered a series of humiliating defeats last year, Reuters reported. The United Nations has said it is “deeply concerned” by what it said were summary executions of prisoners of war by both Russian and Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. A report from the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights said its monitors had documented dozens of the executions by both sides, that the actual number was likely higher and that they “may constitute war crimes”. Police in Russia have placed a former speechwriter for Vladimir Putin on a wanted list of suspects, the latest step in a sweeping crackdown on dissent. The Associated Press reports that Abbas Gallyamov wrote speeches for Putin during the Russian leader’s 2008-12 stint as prime minister. Gallyamov later became an outspoken political consultant and analyst who was frequently quoted by Russian and foreign media. He has lived abroad in recent years. Russia’s parliament speaker has proposed banning the activities of the international criminal court (ICC) after the court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accusing him of war crimes. Vyacheslav Volodin, an ally of Putin’s, said on Saturday that Russian legislation should be amended to prohibit any activity of the ICC in Russia and to punish any who gave “assistance and support” to the court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/26/how-does-the-eu-plan-to-cut-gas-usage-by-15-this-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-26T17:33:07Z","webTitle":"How does the EU plan to cut gas usage by 15% this winter?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/26/how-does-the-eu-plan-to-cut-gas-usage-by-15-this-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/26/how-does-the-eu-plan-to-cut-gas-usage-by-15-this-winter","fields":{"headline":"How does the EU plan to cut gas usage by 15% this winter?","bodyText":"The EU has agreed to cut its gas consumption by 15% in an attempt to stave off a winter crisis triggered by a sharp reduction or total shutdown of Russian gas supplies to the bloc. What has been agreed? From next month until the end of March 2023, all EU member states will strive for a voluntary 15% reduction in gas consumption. In the event of a major supply shock – a complete shutdown of Russian gas – the EU may declare an emergency and make the target mandatory with immediate effect. Three island nations that are not connected to the EU gas network – Cyprus, Ireland and Malta – would be exempt from the compulsory energy savings. But almost any member state, especially those with little connection to the gas network, or those facing an electricity supply shock, would be entitled to apply for an opt-out. How would it work? EU governments can choose how to ration gas, as long as they protect supplies to households. Industrial users will feel the pinch first; factories could be given targets to reduce heating and cooling. Some could be spared, such as manufacturers of critical goods, or plants that are difficult to restart after switching off energy. While consumers are protected, they are expected to do their bit. EU authorities are urging governments to launch campaigns to encourage people to switch off lights and turn down thermostats and air conditioning. EU governments are being urged to speed up the switch to renewable energy, but are also asked to consider delaying their exit from nuclear power or coal – an effort to find any alternative to Russian gas. Member states are required to report to EU authorities in Brussels on their energy savings plan every two months, a form of peer pressure intended to chivvy them into action. Why is the EU doing this now? As the EU was in the final throes of negotiating the plan, Gazprom announced that a drastic cut in supplies via the crucial Nord Stream 1 pipeline would take effect on Wednesday. The timing was a coincidence, but underlines why the EU is pushing to reduce Russian gas use. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the EU has decided to phase out Russian fossil fuels, which are major sources of funding for the Kremlin’s war effort. For many EU member states, ending the use of Russian gas will be painful. Before the invasion, Russia supplied 40% of the EU’s gas and 55% of Germany’s, although Europe’s biggest economy has since reduced its dependence. How is the bloc divided on the subject? EU member states have very different energy mixes: a few countries were nearly 100% dependent on Russian gas, while others used none. Countries that took little or no Russian energy objected to making sacrifices for those that benefited from years of cheap fuel from their eastern neighbour. Spain and Portugal, which have little connection to the EU gas network, argued that the blanket 15% target was unfair. In the end, all countries in the bloc supported the plan with the exception of Hungary, where the government is a longtime Kremlin ally that supports EU sanctions reluctantly. France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands supported the original plan, fearing the economic ripples of a recession from the German economy. How much energy will be saved? If the EU reduces gas use by 15%, it would avoid using 45bn cubic metres of the fuel, according to European Commission estimates. The various opt-outs depress that total, but officials say that even if countries took full advantage of the exemptions, the plan would still see the EU through an averagely cold winter. The 15% target, however, was designed to see the EU through a bitterly cold winter. Expect the long-range weather reports to be as keenly studied as the EU’s economic forecast. What happens next? The 2022-23 winter is expected to be difficult, especially if temperatures plunge. But some fear the following winter could be even worse. EU gas storage levels are at 66%, but by the end of next spring they could be seriously depleted with fewer options to replace stocks. EU officials suggest the gap could be filled by pipeline gas from Norway and Azerbaijan, more tanker-delivered liquified natural gas from as far afield as the US, and efforts to reduce demand. The original gas-savings plan was meant to last for two years, but EU governments reduced the scope to one year. The plan for winter 2023-24 still has to be written."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/10/brexit-legacy-is-just-the-start-of-incoming-pms-problems-as-cost-of-living-crisis-spirals","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-10T07:00:29Z","webTitle":"Brexit legacy is just the start of incoming PM’s problems as cost of living crisis spirals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/10/brexit-legacy-is-just-the-start-of-incoming-pms-problems-as-cost-of-living-crisis-spirals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/10/brexit-legacy-is-just-the-start-of-incoming-pms-problems-as-cost-of-living-crisis-spirals","fields":{"headline":"Brexit legacy is just the start of incoming PM’s problems as cost of living crisis spirals","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has left the Conservative party in policy la-la land. “Cakeism” has run riot – vast, incoherent ambitions detached from political, economic and business realities. Thus the aim is to be “Global Britain” but an ultra-hard Brexit ensures shrinking exports, falling inward investment, dwindling financial muscle and inevitably global retreat. Britain is to be a high-wage, high-innovation economy but there is only one hi-tech company in the FTSE 100, and no strategy to add any more. We are to be a science superpower but there is little chance when we are excluded from the biggest transnational scientific organisation on earth – the EU Horizon programme. There are targets to level up Britain’s glaring geographical inequalities but with scant resources – with what little there is directed at Tory constituencies. As the cost of living crisis intensifies, the government consistently offers too little, too late. A mid-ranking European power must collaborate with others to have leverage over any significant policy area: instead, rancour, rows and delusions of a capacity to go it alone dominate. There are commitments to fiscal responsibility while simultaneously advocating more spending and lower taxes. It is an intellectual black hole. The incoming PM’s problems start with the legacy of Johnson’s Brexit – the unchallenged, sacred verity of Conservative politics. But this allegedly “oven-ready” deal paid no attention to the realities of the 21st-century economy, now dominated by products and services that compete on their knowledge content, resilience and compliance with the highest regulatory standards. To exclude ourselves from the EU single market, which sets the standards for the whole of the EU, is thus a ball and chain around Britain’s growth potential – and by menacing our exports worsens the deficit in our current balance of payments so that a sterling crisis is an ever-present risk. Importantly, the attempt to shoehorn Northern Ireland back into the UK market and suspend its relationship with the EU by unilaterally rewriting the NI protocol had led to no new contracts being awarded in the EU Horizon programme, and to existing ones being cancelled. It is a self-defeating debacle. Beyond that, Johnson was an opportunistic policy jackdaw – backing whatever seemed attractive to whatever audience but with no sense of how it was to be delivered or financed, or how it fitted with a larger vision. Levelling up was his commitment to the former Labour “red wall” seats in the Midlands and north which turned Tory in the 2019 general election. They deserved better, he rightly insisted, from life expectancy and public transport to career prospects: but how? The levelling up white paper set 12 interlinked economic, social and political priorities – but their achievement demands a mobilisation of resources, strengthened institutions and serious devolution. Johnson, obsessed with favouring only Brexit Tories and their constituencies, could deliver none of it. Above all, no serious creative thought had been given to how the UK could find the billions necessary, over many years, to fund levelling up. In the event, the HS2 link from Birmingham to Leeds was cancelled. The entire strategy needs urgent attention if it is not to collapse. Yet in principle it should be a national priority. So should developing lifelong learning, placing big bets on innovative projects, renewing our infrastructure, confronting digital monopolies, securing energy resilience consistent with lowering carbon emissions, and offering a national social care system for our elderly. To none of these challenges did Johnson give sustained attention. Is the health and social care levy even going to survive, let alone deliver what was promised? Energy policy in the wake of the crisis in prices after the Ukraine war is a particular jumble; grandiloquent impossible ambitions to build eight new nuclear power stations in the decade ahead sit alongside drawing back from commitments to renewables. Any chance of meeting net zero commitments by 2050 (and capping energy bills) means insulating a million homes a year: the figure runs at a derisory 30-40,000, with no commitment to improvement. Looming in the background – and undermining all of it – is the commitment to a smaller state and lower taxes. Rarely has any government or any party faced in so many contradictory directions at once, with so little chance of achieving any of its goals. Exit Johnson – leaving behind a mess for others to clear up."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/04/ukraine-pm-thanks-germany-solidarity-calls-more-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-04T15:14:31Z","webTitle":"Ukraine PM thanks Germany for solidarity and calls for more weapons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/04/ukraine-pm-thanks-germany-solidarity-calls-more-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/04/ukraine-pm-thanks-germany-solidarity-calls-more-weapons","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine PM thanks Germany for solidarity and calls for more weapons","bodyText":"Ukraine’s prime minister has thanked Germany for its solidarity in the face of the Russian invasion while calling for more weapons, in a sign of easing tensions between Berlin and Kyiv. Denys Shmyhal, who was welcomed by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, with military honours in Berlin on Sunday, is the most senior Ukrainian official to visit the German capital in months, since Kyiv accused the EU’s biggest economy of doing too little. Starting his Berlin trip, Shmyhal met the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who was blocked from visiting Kyiv in April because of his past advocacy of strong German-Russian ties. Steinmeier, a former German foreign minister, who conceded in April that his approach to Moscow had been mistaken, offered to travel to Ukraine’s capital in the early weeks of the war to show solidarity but was told his visit was “not desired in Kyiv”. In a tweet after the meeting with Steinmeier, Shmyhal said they had discussed the military situation, strengthening sanctions and the need to provide weapons for Ukraine. “Thanked for solidarity with Ukrainians and support,” the tweet said. Germany will “continue to stand reliably by Ukraine’s side”, Steinmeier told Shmyhal, according to the German president’s spokesperson. “Germany has made huge progress in its support of Ukraine with weapons,” Shmyhal told German media before his trip, according to Agence France-Presse. But the prime minister added that Kyiv needed more from Berlin, including “modern combat tanks” such as the Leopard 2. Writing on Telegram, Shmyhal urged allies to provide Ukraine with more heavy weapons. “The MARS II multiple rocket launchers and the Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled artillery units, which Germany has provided, have performed well on the battlefield,” he said, adding that he expected Germany to become one of the leaders in supporting Ukraine’s air defence. The rapprochement between Kyiv and Berlin came as Scholz declared that Germany “will get through this winter”, as his government announced on Sunday a €65bn (£56bn) package to help households and companies cope with soaring energy prices. Scholz told local media that Germany would use income from windfall taxes to reduce end-consumer prices for gas, coal and oil. Europe faces an energy crisis after Russia shut down gas flows from the Nord Stream 1 pipeline into Germany. Gazprom said on Friday that the pipeline – the largest gas pipeline to Europe with capacity to deliver 55bn cubic metres a year – would be shut indefinitely because of a leak and would not restart until repairs were completed. Siemens Energy, which supplies and maintains equipment to Nord Stream 1, said the leak could be sealed and there was no reason to shut down the entire pipeline. In his nightly video address on Saturday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Moscow of weaponising its energy supplies against European countries it cannot yet attack with missiles. “Russia wants to destroy the normal life of every European – in all countries of our continent,” Zelenskiy said. “It is trying to attack with poverty and political chaos where it cannot yet attack with missiles.” The answer to this “decisive energy attack” was unity of European states and sanctions to limit Russia’s oil and gas revenues, he said. With the war in its 193rd day, Ukrainian officials said an eight-year-old child died and three other children were injured by Russian overnight shelling in the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv. Russian forces hit multiple residential targets in the region, according to Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv. Posting on his Telegram account, he said Russian shelling had damaged homes, three hospitals, two education facilities, a hotel and a museum in the area. Zelenskiy urged the EU to deliver a promised €9bn emergency financial aid package “asap”, he reported on Sunday in a tweet about a phone call he had with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. So far the EU has released only €1bn of the total because of wrangling over the balance between grants and loans. The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, said last week he was confident the EU would soon meet its promise, although Ukraine needs an estimated €5bn a month to keep going. Ukraine’s prime minister said he expected €5bn in macrofinancial assistance from the EU this week, which will “help ensure the stability of our economy, support of the army and the passing of the heating season”. Concerns remained high over Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is relying on a reserve line to supply electricity to the grid. In a statement on Saturday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the plant had again lost the connection to its last remaining main external power line, but continued to supply electricity to the grid via a reserve line. The plant was occupied by Russian forces in March but remains connected to Ukraine’s electricity grid and run by Ukrainian staff. After mounting concern about nuclear disaster, the IAEA inspectors arrived at the plant last Thursday with the aim of establishing a permanent presence. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on Saturday that his country could play a facilitator role regarding the plant, Erdoğan’s office said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/mar/06/observer-view-ukraine-western-support","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-06T06:00:45Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on Ukraine and western support | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/06/observer-view-ukraine-western-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/06/observer-view-ukraine-western-support","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on Ukraine and western support","bodyText":"The world has watched in horror as Vladimir Putin has deployed the same tactics of indiscriminate slaughter of civilians in Ukraine as he did in Syria and Chechnya. The power of despots derives from their willingness to inflict unthinkable evil to bend the will of those they seek to dominate and Putin is no different. Ukrainians are locked into a mortal fight for their freedom and their liberty; the extraordinary bravery of its ordinary citizens should humble us all. Yesterday’s bellicose rhetoric from the Russian leader, including his threat to dismantle Ukraine’s statehood, offers no suggestion of compromise. His war crimes are intensifying. Over the past week, we have seen civilians targeted with mass shellings. Densely populated cities have been under constant bombardment for days, as people hide in basements with dwindling supplies of food and water. Hospitals and kindergartens have been destroyed by the bombs. Whole families trying to flee the carnage have been shot in cold blood by Russian soldiers. In Volnovakha, shells hit civilian buildings every five minutes from a line of contact 20km away; barely a building in the town has been left unscathed. Bodies have been left in the streets; the peril facing those carrying out rescue missions is so great that they have to prioritise the living. Just as he did in Syria, Putin has ordered that key cities such as Mariupol should be besieged. Just as he did in Syria, he appeared to make concessions for humanitarian corridors to be established from Mariupol and Volnovakha, to allow for the evacuation of civilians, only to rip up the terms of that ceasefire as soon as it had been agreed. Putin’s aim appears to be to break the morale of the Ukrainian people and to brutally terrorise them into surrender. There will be a time to go over the failings of the west that brought us to this dreadful point, where there seems to be no way for other democracies to avert a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine; all they can do is to try to lessen the toll. For now, the most important question is what we can do to support Ukrainians and their democratically elected leader, President Zelenskiy, in their fight and what we can do to limit the scale of the human catastrophe. There are actions the west can take that should not even be the subject of debate, yet on which the British government seems to be dragging its feet. Despite minor relaxations, the UK’s policy with respect to Ukrainian refugees remains far more restrictive than that of the EU. There are stories of families fleeing war who remain separated because of British bureaucracy and mean-spiritedness. This should be a source of national shame. Economic sanctions on Russian oligarchs may have limited direct effect on Putin on the short term. But there is no justification for not clamping down swiftly and hard: these are people who have profited directly from Putin’s regime. Yesterday, the Italian government seized yachts and villas worth at least €140m from four Russians on the EU sanctions list. The UK government’s sluggishness is likely to prove costly in terms of allowing individuals to escape the sanctions they must face. These are the easier questions to answer about what actions the west must take. Far harder is what Nato should do to support Ukrainian forces and minimise civilian casualties in Ukraine itself. Here, the UK has led the way on providing accurate intelligence and military supplies, but there is the ever-present question of what more there is to do. Nato cannot declare war on Russia, which is what a no-fly zone would amount to. This would be a reckless escalation of conflict with a nuclear power. But there are lessons the west must learn from Syria about effective military and humanitarian support in the face of Russian brutality. There must be more support for evacuating civilians, especially vulnerable adults and children, from cities not yet under siege. Cities should be flooded with humanitarian supplies and basic infrastructure, such as satellites and generators. Russian guarantees for humanitarian corridors cannot be relied upon. It is vital that war crimes are documented, not just in the interests of justice when the conflict is over, but to assist in negotiations for humanitarian access. Ukraine has reported that some of the anti-aircraft defence missiles it has received from Germany do not work, and has asked for more, a call that must be heeded. The bravery of the Ukrainian resistance will be remembered by generations to come: the people from all walks of life volunteering to defend their country; the unarmed protesters marching against their occupiers in Kherson, the only city the Russians have so far captured. Citizens of liberal democracies owe the people of Ukraine a debt of gratitude; they are at the frontline of the fight for freedom and democracy in the face of authoritarianism, for rights that most of us are complacent about. Russia’s strike on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station should serve as a reminder that they are more fragile than we would like to think. It is too early to know the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict for the global order. China, guilty of genocide within its own borders, will be watching closely how Nato countries respond to the Russian threat. The people of Ukraine fight for their nation’s existence. What the US, Europe and the UK choose to do to support them could shape the course of history."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-302-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-22T16:06:36Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 302 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-302-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-302-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 302 of the invasion","bodyText":"The Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has travelled to the US in his first foreign visit since Russia’s war on Ukraine to secure support for his war effort well into next year. Joe Biden told Zelenskiy that “it’s an honour to be by your side” and promised he “will never stand alone” as the US president pledged continued financial, military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine. The two leaders held a joint news conference before heading to Capitol Hill to address a joint session of the US Senate and House of Representatives. In an address to Congress, Zelenskiy said Ukraine “will never surrender” as he reiterated how his country and the US “are allies in this battle”. “Next year will be a turning point, the point when Ukrainian courage and American resolve will guarantee Ukrainian freedom, the freedom of people who stand for their values,” Zelenskiy said. “The Russian tyranny has lost control over us,” he added. “Against all odds and doom and gloom, Ukraine didn’t fall. Ukraine is alive and kicking.” Zelenskiy also sought to persuade Republican lawmakers to continue to fund his country’s defence against Russia. “Your money is not charity. It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way,” he said. The Kremlin said US supplies of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, announced during the visit of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to Washington on Wednesday, would not contribute to settling the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv, and would not prevent Russia from achieving its goals. In a call with reporters, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said there had been no signs of readiness for peace talks during Zelenskiy’s visit, and this was evidence the US was fighting a proxy war with Russia “to the last Ukrainian”. Zelenskiy met with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, on Thursday while returning to Ukraine from the US. Ukraine’s president posted a photo of the meeting on his Telegram and said the pair “summed up the year, which brought historic challenges due to a full-scale war”. The two spoke “for a long time, almost two hours”, according to an aide for President Duda. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has visited army units fighting in Ukraine, state media cited the ministry as saying. Shoigu visited Russian units deployed to the “area of the special military operation”, the state-owned news agency Ria reported, using Moscow’s term for the conflict in Ukraine. It did not specify where the visit took place. Russia’s chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said the frontline in Ukraine was stable. In an end-of-year message delivered to foreign military attaches and published by the defence ministry, Gerasimov said Moscow had concentrated its forces on “completing the liberation” of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. A fire broke out on Russia’s only aircraft carrier on Thursday, Russian state media reported. The Admiral Kuznetsov, a flagship of the Russian navy, suffered a “minor” fire while docked at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in the Arctic port of Murmansk, located in the far north-west of Russia, according to reports by the Russian state-owned Tass and Ria Novosti news agencies. A former Russian deputy prime minister and a pro-Moscow official were injured when Ukrainian forces shelled the eastern city of Donetsk on Wednesday, Russian news agencies said. Donetsk, controlled by pro-Moscow troops, is in the industrial Donbas region, the centre of recent bitter fighting between Russia and Ukraine. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said that recent military manoeuvres were not aimed at Ukraine and dismissed “conspiracy theories” about deployments of Belarusian armed forces at the border. Speaking at a conference of military leaders marking the end of snap military inspections held this month, Lukashenko also said he could not rule out “aggression” against Belarus on the part of unspecified “neighbours”. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, met officials from Russia’s military and state atomic energy company, Rosatom, to discuss setting up a safe zone around Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s chief, said more negotiations were needed after “another round of necessary discussions”. Rosatom described the talks on measures needed to safeguard the Zaporizhzhia facility and the surrounding region as “substantive, useful and frank”. The Ukrainian ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said the number of children who had been “forcibly deported” to Russia could be in the hundreds of thousands. Authorities had established the identity of more than 13,000 children deported to Russia, Lubinets said, adding that investigators had uncovered a cell inside a “torture chamber” in the recently liberated Kherson where children were allegedly detained and mistreated. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for Europe to reduce its reliance on the US and develop its own defence capabilities while taking a more assertive role within Nato. Speaking to reporters on his return to Paris from a summit in Amman, Jordan, Macron stressed that he doesn’t see his push to develop European defence as an alternative to Nato. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will hold a summit with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy early next year, according to an EU spokesperson. The summit will take place on 3 February but its location has not yet been determined. The White House has pledged a new $1.58bn aid package to Ukraine and will send advanced Patriot missile batteries to the war-torn country, saying the assistance will be vital to stop Russia’s “barbaric” rocket attacks on critical infrastructure. Zelenskiy told a White House news conference that the weapons were “the only way that we can deprive the terrorist state of its main instrument of terror – the possibility to hit our cities, our energy”. In a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned that continued western arms supplies to Ukraine would lead to a “deepening” of the conflict. The US has already supplied $22bn in military assistance to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February. The Biden administration also unveiled new curbs on technology exports to Russia’s Wagner military group. The group, a private military contractor with close ties to the Kremlin, will now be labelled a military end-user and face tough new curbs on access to technology made anywhere in the world with US equipment. The US under-secretary of commerce for industry and security, Alan Estevez, said the group was “actively committing atrocities and human rights abuses across Ukraine”. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has pledged to give his army anything it asks for, promising no financial limits on what the government would provide in terms of equipment and hardware. Speaking in Moscow after meeting with Russia’s top military officials, Putin said there were no “funding restrictions” for the military. “The country, the government will give everything that the army asks for. Everything.” Putin also gave his backing to a plan by his defence minister to boost the size of the armed forces by more than 30% to 1.5 million combat personnel. Putin also acknowledged that the call-up of 300,000 reservists he ordered in September had not gone smoothly, the latest in a series of recent comments in which he has admitted the challenges his army is facing. “The partial mobilisation that was carried out revealed certain problems, as everyone well knows, which should be promptly addressed,” he said. The call-up drew strong criticism as new recruits were deemed to be physically unfit or too old and lacking basic equipment. The UN will allocate an additional $20m from the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund to support more than 300 civil society organisations and volunteer groups. “These groups have always been the backbone of the humanitarian response in Ukraine and even more since the war started in late February,” said Denise Brown, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine. In an overwhelming vote of 93-2, the US Senate confirmed the appointment of Lynne M Tracy as the new US ambassador to Russia on Wednesday. Tracy, a career diplomat of the US foreign service, “will be tasked with standing up to [Vladimir] Putin”, the Associated Press quoted the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, as saying."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/may/24/rishi-sunak-windfall-tax-electricity-generators-oil-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T13:53:47Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak reportedly considering windfall tax on electricity generators","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/rishi-sunak-windfall-tax-electricity-generators-oil-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/may/24/rishi-sunak-windfall-tax-electricity-generators-oil-gas","fields":{"headline":"Rishi Sunak reportedly considering windfall tax on electricity generators","bodyText":"Rishi Sunak is reportedly considering imposing a wider windfall tax on electricity generators, as well as on oil and gas producers, that could bring in billions of pounds to help households struggling with soaring food and energy costs. The chancellor has instructed Treasury officials to work on plans for a potential tax on more than £10bn of excess profits made by electricity generators, including renewable energy operators such as windfarms, according to sources cited by the Financial Times. That would go far beyond Labour’s plan for a one-off levy applied only to North Sea oil and gas producers, which would raise an estimated £2bn. Profits on these firms are taxed at 30% corporation tax plus a 10% surcharge, but Labour has proposed raising the combined rate from 40% to 50%. Oil and gas producers have benefited from rocketing global energy prices amid Russia’s war in Ukraine. Higher gas prices have pushed up wholesale prices across the electricity market, including for some producers of renewable and nuclear power. Shares in the biggest electricity generators fell sharply on Tuesday. Drax, which owns a large power station near Selby in North Yorkshire, tumbled 14%, while British Gas owner Centrica fell 8% and SSE 7%. Government estimates suggest electricity producers could have made more than £10bn in excess profits as a result of higher gas prices, the FT reported. The chancellor appears to have shifted his position after initially opposing a windfall tax. He said earlier this month that he was “pragmatic”, saying “no options are off the table” if oil and gas companies did not raise investment in the UK economy. However, Royal London Asset Management, a big UK fund manager, raised concerns about a windfall tax on electricity generators, including renewable energy developers. Mike Fox, the head of sustainable investments, said: “The social consequences of higher energy prices cannot and should not be ignored. However, levying additional taxes on businesses directly investing in renewable generation feels contradictory to the UK’s desire for greater energy independence and a greener power system that can help to deliver a net zero economy. “The government has other tools which it could use to both raise funds to help tackle the cost of living crisis and encourage greater investment in the UK’s green economy, such as encouraging the crown estate to unlock more seabed for offshore wind.” The Investec analyst Martin Young was also sceptical about the idea. He said: “A windfall tax on generation could possibly jeopardise much-needed investment, and could see higher returns demanded [by electricity generators].” He noted there were huge investment needs in electricity generation such as offshore wind, nuclear and hydrogen storage. “Longer term, neither would be good for the consumer or the net zero pathway. Cost of energy crisis? Yes. Insufficient action so far by government? Yes. A windfall tax on generators the right answer? No. Be careful what you wish for. The spectre of intervention, however, could weigh on the generators.” The Bernstein analyst Deepa Venkateswaran was sceptical about the £10bn excess profit figure. She said: “We believe that the Treasury has grossly overstated the potential take from a windfall tax on renewable generators and shaken investor confidence in the sector, as can be seen from the share price reaction today, which we believe is an overreaction.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/21/further-russia-sanctions-eu-ukraine-poland-russia-eu-baltic-states-poland","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-21T16:27:16Z","webTitle":"After eight rounds, is there space for further EU sanctions on Russia?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/21/further-russia-sanctions-eu-ukraine-poland-russia-eu-baltic-states-poland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/21/further-russia-sanctions-eu-ukraine-poland-russia-eu-baltic-states-poland","fields":{"headline":"After eight rounds, is there space for further EU sanctions on Russia?","bodyText":"Since Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, Russia has been subjected to the heaviest sanctions of any country in the world. A fossil fuel superpower, Russia is no longer able to export coal to the European Union and will soon lose 90% of its oil sales to the bloc. In the other direction, the EU has banned the export of hundreds of goods to Russia, from hi-tech military kit and semiconductors that could aid Russia’s military, to makeup, handbags and clothes that may turn a handsome profit for Russian entrepreneurs. EU asset freezes and travel bans have been imposed on 1,239 individuals and 116 companies. The list includes Putin, his most powerful acolytes and cheerleaders in state-controlled media, oligarchs and generals, as well as some of Russia’s largest banks and arms manufacturers. But after eight rounds of EU sanctions, the appetite for further measures is diminishing. “Member states are working on additional possible measures, but we need to see the scope, because we have adopted so much so far that the space is rather limited,” a senior EU official said. “That’s a matter of fact.” Ukraine’s most vocal supporters in the EU think the bloc could go further. “Our sanctions are working, but our sanctions unfortunately did not bring so far the result we expected,” Lithuania’s president, Gitanas Nausėda, told reporters as he arrived at an EU summit on Thursday. “I think we have very big potential to improve our sanctions and to tighten them.” The Baltic states and Poland have a long shopping list: a ban on liquified petroleum gas, which is used for heating and fuel, as well as ending cooperation with Russia on nuclear power. They also want to close loopholes in earlier sanctions by banning civilian drones, smartphones and speeding up an end to trade in certain metals. It seems no stone is left unturned: the group wants to ban the sale of specialist wine fridges, a luxury missed off earlier lists. Denmark, Sweden and Finland are broadly supportive of the ideas, but a host of western European states, Germany, France and Belgium, are seen as cautious of new sanctions. Berlin argues there is little left to impose sanctions on, although German officials say they are not opposed to further measures. One diplomat suggested some proposed sanctions risked hurting Europe more than Russia: “If we harm our own economies, and the extreme right and the extreme left, the pro-Putin forces, get into power, then Putin wins.” Even some sanction hawks say the easy things have been done, while suggesting further steps would be symbolic, rather than a major strike against the Russian economy. The EU is also increasingly focused on countries helping Russia’s war effort. This week the bloc imposed sanctions on three senior Iranian commanders and the company that develops the so-called “kamikaze drones” that have been used by Russia to attack Ukraine. For many insiders this was only the beginning. “It’s an important step in order to send a political message to Iran, but also to other malign actors that would be thinking of aiding Russia’s war effort,” a second EU diplomat said, adding that further sanctions were needed to “cripple Iran’s production capacity”. The EU is also preparing tougher sanctions against Belarus, in case Alexander Lukashenko formally enters the war against Ukraine. Speaking on Friday, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU was very concerned about “circumventions via third countries” and could now place sanctions on individuals who help Moscow evade the restrictions. “And this is a very strong deterrent,” she added. One sore point for sanction hawks is Russian diamonds, which have been repeatedly exempt, meaning the gems can continue to be bought by Antwerp dealers. Before the invasion, Belgium was the top destination for Russian diamond imports, buying €1.8bn (£1.6bn) of them. Some European diplomats are scathing about what they see as Belgian lobbying to protect a special interest, when every member state has been asked to make sacrifices. Belgium’s government says the trade is winding down and insists it has never blocked a ban on Russian diamonds. The dispute briefly burst into the open last month, when a draft sanctions list included Russia’s state-owned diamond company, Alrosa, which was included because EU officials said it was supporting the Russian navy. Yet after backroom dealing, the company dropped off the list. Much noisier opposition to sanctions comes from Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, who has criticised “Brussels sanctions”, as “primitive” and claimed they are “destroying the economies of Europe and Hungary”. Diplomats point out that the Hungarian prime minister has agreed to every round of sanctions against Russia, which included exemptions for Hungary. Orbán sounds less confrontational in Brussels than he is talking to his voters in Hungary, say diplomatic sources. Nonetheless, even sanction hawks say he has to be taken into account and stress they will only support sanctions that preserve EU unity. The desire to maintain unity may help explain why rising imports of Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) have gone under the radar. As Russia’s pipeline gas exports to the EU have plunged, several member states have quietly been increasing their imports of Russian LNG. Before the war, Russia was the world’s fourth-largest supplier of LNG and this year 78% of Russian LNG was bought by countries that had sanctioned Russia, according to Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. France, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands have all increased their LNG imports in 2022, while Italy and Portugal have occasionally imported the gas, according to Columbia. Maria Pastukhova at the E3G thinktank in Berlin said Russia remained a “very minor actor” on LNG compared with pipeline gas. She suggested the reason this trade had escaped attention was because Russia’s largest LNG producer was a private company, Novatek, which paid relatively little taxes in Russia, so could not be seen as fuelling the Kremlin’s war effort. But that is changing: from 2023, tax on LNG projects will increase to 32%, whereas previously Novatek has paid 13% taxes, according to Russian media. As the EU wrangles over how to cope with an energy shock that has sent consumer bills soaring, even staunchest supporters of sanctions are not proposing to ban Russian LNG. “It would be very difficult to find a compromise on this,” another EU diplomat said. • This article was amended on 24 October 2022. Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy found that France, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands all increased their imports of Russian liquified natural gas (LNG) in 2022, not increased their LNG exports as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/04/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-223-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-04T14:05:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 223 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/04/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-223-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/04/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-223-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 223 of the invasion","bodyText":"The upper house of Russia’s parliament has voted to approve the incorporation of four occupied Ukrainian regions into Russia, as Moscow sets about formally annexing territory it seized from Kyiv since staging its latest invasion of Ukraine in February. In a session on Tuesday, the Federation Council unanimously ratified legislation to annex the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, following a similar vote in the state Duma, Russia’s lower house, yesterday. No lawmakers in the lower house voted against the bill either. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has signed a decree formally declaring the prospect of any Ukrainian talks with Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin “impossible”. The decree formalised comments made by Zelenskiy on Friday after the Russian president proclaimed the four occupied regions of Ukraine were to become part of Russia. Russia, however, no longer has full control of any of the four provinces it claims to annex, after Ukrainian troops reportedly advanced dozens of kilometres in Kherson province. The Russian military has acknowledged that Kyiv’s forces had broken through in the Kherson region. It said the Ukrainian army and its “superior tank units” had managed to “penetrate the depths of our defence” around the villages of Zoltaya Balka and Alexsandrovka. On Monday, Putin’s spokesperson said the Kremlin would consult with residents of the areas it has “annexed” to determine where the borders should be, suggesting Russia does not know where its new self-declared international borders are. Putin has vowed to protect Russia’s newly claimed territories using “all means at its disposal”, indicating a potential nuclear strike. The lack of a clear red line may undermine his attempts at using nuclear deterrence to halt Ukraine’s successful counteroffensive and western support for Kyiv. Ukraine has “fully cleared” Russian forces from the key eastern city of Lyman, Zelenskiy confirmed on Monday, a day after Moscow admitted its troops had pulled out after they were encircled. Russia’s retreat from Lyman has sparked vociferous criticism of the handling of the war on Russian state television. Vladimir Solovyov, host of a primetime talkshow on state TV channel Russia 1 and one of the Kremlin’s biggest cheerleaders, said on air on Sunday. “We need to pull it together, make unpopular, but necessary decisions and act.” Lyman’s recapture by Ukrainian troops is Russia’s largest battlefield loss since Ukraine’s lightning counteroffensive in the north-eastern Kharkiv region in September. Russias’s ministry of defence spokesperson, Igor Konashenkov, said Russian troops had occupied what he called a “pre-prepared defensive line”. His comments are an admission that Ukraine’s southern counter-offensive is dramatically gaining pace, two months after it began. Russia is at risk of losing control of the strategic towns critical to retaining the city of Kherson and eventually Crimea, western officials said, but they warned the fighting along the Dnipro River “will not be an easy rush into constrained territory”. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has claimed that in the last 24 hours two people were injured on the territory it occupies, and 13 houses and 12 civil infrastructure were damaged by fire from the Ukrainian armed forces. More than 200,000 people have been called up for military service since Russia announced a “partial mobilisation” two weeks ago, according to the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. A Russian court has fined the streaming service Twitch 4m roubles (£60,000/$68,000) for failing to remove an interview with a Ukrainian political figure. The court said the interview violated Russian laws on the spreading of fake information. North Korea has become the only UN member state apart from Russia to recognise the “results” of the Moscow-backed “referendums” in the occupied areas of Ukraine. Diplomatic relations between Russia and Japan continue to deteriorate. Japanese foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi has ordered a Russian consul in Sapporo to leave Japan by 10 October. European Union finance ministers agreed Tuesday to integrate the EU’s support payments to Ukraine into its 2023 budget to make payments more structured and predictable, European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said. The British government has said it has imposed a travel ban and an asset freeze on Sergei Yeliseyev as part of its broader sanctions against Russia. Ukraine needs to revamp its labour laws and redouble efforts to privatise thousands of companies to repair its economy, its president’s economic adviser has said. Alexander Rodnyansky, an adviser to the president, said the war-torn country needed to speed up efforts to reform industries as it looked to rebuild after Russia’s invasion. Elon Musk has prompted an online row with Zelenskiy after he asked Twitter users to weigh in on his ideas to end Russia’s war. In a tweet, Musk suggested UN-supervised elections in four occupied regions that Moscow has falsely annexed after what it called referendums. Zelenskiy responded with his own poll. “Which @elonmusk do you like more?,” he wrote, offering two responses: one who supports Ukraine, or supports Russia. The Kremlin has praised the Tesla boss, with Kremlin spokesperson Peskov saying “It is very positive that somebody like Elon Musk is looking for a peaceful way out of this situation.” The US will deliver four more of the advanced rocket systems to Ukraine. The High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, known as HIMARS, will be part of a new $625m aid package to be announced on Tuesday, according to US officials. The head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine has been released, according to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi. Ihor Murashov was detained on Friday by a Russian patrol as he travelled from the Zaporizhzhia plant to the town of Enerhodar, according to the state-owned company in charge of the plant. Russia has put Marina Ovsyannikova, the former state TV editor who interrupted a news broadcast to protest against the Ukraine war, on a wanted list after she reportedly escaped house arrest. The Ukrainian-born Ovsyannikova, 44, gained international attention in March after bursting into a studio of Channel One, her then employer, to denounce the Ukraine war during a live news bulletin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/jul/21/dining-across-the-divide-miles-jasper","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-21T11:30:30Z","webTitle":"Dining across the divide: ‘He supports a new Heathrow runway – we should invest in trains’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/21/dining-across-the-divide-miles-jasper","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/21/dining-across-the-divide-miles-jasper","fields":{"headline":"Dining across the divide: ‘He supports a new Heathrow runway – we should invest in trains’","bodyText":"Jasper, 26, London Occupation Architect Voting record Jasper, who was born and brought up in south Wales, describes himself as left-of-centre and has always voted Labour. He voted remain in the EU referendum Amuse bouche Jasper once had a pet turkey called George Bush Miles, 27, London Occupation Campaign organiser Voting record Mostly Conservative. Miles used to be the chair of his local Young Conservatives. In the EU referendum he wanted to vote leave but didn’t think it would be good for the City and foresaw problems with the Irish border Amuse bouche Miles says he once told Theresa May a joke: “I said the only problem with being a Tory is when you go on dates, you end up going home alone. She thought that was hilarious” For starters Jasper He seemed like a nice bloke. I was slightly surprised. I was expecting someone from a fee-paying school, maybe dressed in Harris tweed. He did say he considered wearing tweed. I think he was relieved I wasn’t some super-duper activist – he kept joking that I hadn’t glued myself to the table. Miles I was worried he was going to be a complete weirdo. We bonded over Wales. I’ve lived in London all my life, but my dad is from Cardiff. Jasper I thought I was middle-class in south Wales where I grew up, but when I moved to London, suddenly I wasn’t. I met a lot of quite posh people and I was the roughest person they’d met. Miles A teacher at school showed us an Ed Miliband speech and I just felt: you don’t get it, you don’t get people. One of his lines was: “Labour wants the best for Britain” and I thought: that sounds like someone who doesn’t leave north London, and someone has told him this is what people in the sticks want to hear. Jasper The current lot only have their self-interest at heart. People used to go into government because they wanted to serve their country. Now it seems they do it because they want to become multimillionaires afterwards. Or while they’re in office. The big beef Miles We should open the coalmines. Closing them permanently damaged communities; deindustrialisation in this country has made millions of people feel aimless and depressed. Opening the coalmines in the Welsh valleys isn’t going to make climate change any worse. Jasper That’s not forward-thinking if burning coal is going to be banned in 20 years. He talked about emissions in other countries, but we had the Industrial Revolution much earlier. Miles You can’t get countries like India and China to stick to targets – you can’t say they can’t grow their economies, get more people into cars, use electrical goods, etc. Jasper was in favour of flying less, changing our living habits to fight climate change. I said, “We need to focus at the top and build more nuclear power stations.” Jasper Miles supports the new Heathrow runway. Heathrow expansion is clearly a bad idea – we should be investing in trains. Sharing plate Miles We agreed on the need for proportional representation. And I agreed with him that all the levelling up is focusing on northern England, not Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales. I’m in favour of any measure that will keep the union together. Jasper We both thought austerity was a tragedy. For many people I know, it’s one of the reasons they could never vote Conservative. For afters Miles I’m in favour of putting troops on the ground in Ukraine. It’s not just about Ukraine, it’s about Europe and about Russia’s worldview. It was basically a proxy attack on us, and we should have demonstrated to Putin that we knew that. Jasper I wouldn’t go and fight there. And I don’t think world war three is the best idea. There’s a risk of turning up and then pulling out like in Afghanistan, where it is flooded with weapons from the west and no one takes responsibility. It would be saturating Europe with arms. Takeaways Miles It’s useful to listen to people who can challenge your views and make you think a bit harder. Face-to-face is definitely more intense – you have to be challenging but gentle as well. Jasper My main takeaway was shock about his idea of sending the army into Ukraine. That overshadowed most things for me as I was walking home.

Earthly Order: How Natural Laws Define Human Life is an ambitious effort to bridge the gap between politics and science, drawing on his experience as a National Geographic field explorer who has worked in more than 150 countries. Ali has three passports, having been born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, moved to Pakistan aged nine and lived in Australia for several years. In a phone interview from Delaware, he happily ruffles feathers by defending nuclear power, suggesting that democracies can learn lessons from autocracies and attacking the last sacred space on television: the nature documentary. “Some of these nature biodiversity documentaries can, in fact, create a problem because they lead to niche thinking,” he says. “They are good for some things like biodiversity conservation but they are not making the connections often that you need to do.” Indeed, the 48-year-old revels in complexity and loathes dumbing down – even if it means frustrating literary agents. “When I was writing the book, agents would ask me, ‘What’s your one argument?’ I’d say, ‘You know, I’m writing a book about earth systems, I can’t have one argument. I have to approach the issues with nuance.’ This is the problem we have, unfortunately, in terms of communication of environmental issues.” To illustrate the point, Ali cites predictions that Dubai in the United Arab Emirates will soon be so hot that it will be uninhabitable. “That is such a ludicrous statement from the point of view of looking at how humans have interacted with the environment,” he contends. “Most cities in the western world are uninhabitable in winter without infrastructure, including New York City or London – if you didn’t have heating you wouldn’t be able to survive or you could have a very short existence with hypothermia. “We have developed adaptive mechanisms so to say that Dubai would be uninhabitable in summer without air conditioning makes no sense from the point of view of earth systems. But it makes a good headline because people immediately start panicking and they’re like, ‘Oh my goodness, it’s becoming so bad.’” Humanity will have to adapt, he argues, for example through different types of architecture and more subterranean dwellings. He believes this is the pragmatic way forward in responding to some climate crisis thresholds that are now irreversible – while still aggressively reducing dependence on fossil fuels and refusing to surrender to the worst-case scenario. “If we frame the conversation as, look, this is going to be a future which is not ideal, we wish we had not gone that pathway, we wish we had reduced emissions, but now we need to figure out what’s the best way to adapt to this new future, that would be much more constructive and realistic to work through with some of the people who have been climate deniers. “But it wouldn’t mean complacency. You still need a lot of action around it. That’s where I feel as though we’ve been remiss in attacking this issue.” Ali is among the voices who contend that nuclear power, long anathema to many on the left, deserves a second look. It currently provides about a fifth of electricity in the US, accounting for about half the country’s carbon-free energy, and some companies – including one started by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates – are developing smaller, cheaper reactors that could supplement the grid. But the US has no long-term plan for managing or disposing of radioactive waste that can persist in the environment for thousands of years. Nuclear disasters at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island, Chernobyl in Ukraine and Fukushima in Japan have cast a long shadow. Although countries such as France are sticking with the technology or planning to build more plants, others, including Germany, are phasing out their reactors. Ali argues: “There has been a completely emotional kneejerk response to Fukushima, especially in Germany, which they are realising now was a mistake. If you look at the actual science in terms of the natural order of how energy is extracted from materials, nuclear energy is the most energy-dense resource. “If you look at the data in terms of the the morbidity and mortality of Fukushima, you had not a single person die of radiation exposure; they died of the tsunami. The International Atomic Energy Agency published a report last year which showed that there were no cancer clusters around there either. And yet you had an entire energy policy recrafted. That is why Germany is in this dependency situation.” Indeed, Ali does not believe that western democracies have all the right answers. He suggests that for decades their leaders have been talking about climate in a fashion that is too narrow, failing to join dots in the public imagination. He is donating all royalties from the book to environmental literacy programmes in developing countries. “There was a strategic mistake made in terms of framing it just as climate change. I always like, with my students, to talk about global environmental change. We’re talking about many aspects of the global system which are changing. When people think of climate change, immediately it is just resonating as, ‘Oh, are we getting more heat or cold?’ “That’s not really what’s going on. We’re talking about water scarcity. We’re talking about the ways in which energy is going to be delivered. If we had framed the conversation around global environmental change, it would have been easier to be able to figure out all of these interconnections.” Ali, who has a PhD in environmental planning, continues: “We assume that democratic systems are going to be able to deliver efficient outcomes but the reality is democratic systems are often very short-term-oriented because they are driven by election cycles. “We have the same problem with reference to even business decision making, especially publicly traded companies which are driven by quarterly earnings reports. When you’re talking about long-range impacts, there is definitely a disconnect between both aspects. “We threw the baby out with the bathwater when we started to lobby against planning. ‘Planning’ had these connotations that it was going back to somehow centrally planned economies but you need a certain bureaucracy to continue the planning programmes and we needed to have planning independent of the political apparatus. That’s been another reason why, unfortunately, we have ended up in this current impasse with climate change.” Do autocracies, which Joe Biden warns are locked in a global struggle with democracies, do it better? Ali, whose book draws a contrast between China and India, says: “China is going to have problems in terms of their dependence on coal but there is definitely a much more technically oriented approach to decision making in China. Even if you take out the part about the central planning, the Confucian approach has been much more around let’s bring technocracy to the mix.” Public transport in a classic example, he believes, with China deciding to switch from planes to trains as the dominant mode between major cities and getting it done within a decade. “Here in the US we’re stuck with Amtrak, which they have still not been able to change because there isn’t this sense of let’s work through all of the technical details and make it happen based on those decisions. “That’s also linked to the fact we have a very litigious culture that makes it very challenging to be able to develop new projects. Unfortunately, in current democracies the actual process of getting feedback and stakeholder engagement and litigation becomes an end in itself. There is just no point at which you draw the line and say, OK, now we have to move forward.” This, he continues, is one of the reasons that the outsider businessman Donald Trump was an attractive proposition to millions of frustrated voters in the 2016 presidential election. “People saw that at least there was this willingness to make a decision. Much as I lament many aspects of his policies – building the wall – there was a decision. “In environmental discourse, we often talk about the precautionary principle, that you have to be careful about things, but if you go to the extreme, it becomes paralysis because you can’t make any kind of forward movement. That’s the main problem we have had.” But no, Ali is not calling for dictatorship in America, as he insists: “Democracies can correct that. I don’t see this as being something that only autocracies can do. We just need democracies to be made more efficient and form processes where decisions are based on technical knowledge and, after a certain point, that technical knowledge should trump – for want of a better word – negotiations.” By Ali’s lights, environmental awareness is no longer enough; environmental literacy is critical to the survival of the planet. Or as he puts it: “Depth in understanding of complexity is essential for functional order on Earth.” Earthly Order: How Natural Laws Define Human Life is out on 15 July"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/01/kwasi-kwartengs-stand-for-green-energy-isnt-everything-but-it-helps","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-01T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"Is the UK government finally seeing sense on renewables?

","bodyText":"On Monday, as war in Ukraine caused turbulence in the European energy market, and just before the publication of the “bleakest warning yet” from scientists on the climate crisis, the UK’s secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, Kwasi Kwarteng, took to Twitter to set out his case for a clean energy future for the UK. It was a major intervention from the business secretary, at a vital juncture. Kwarteng is joining many of the biggest voices and leading experts in the UK energy industry in arguing for clean energy and rejecting fossil fuels. But this new emphasis from the government will need to be backed up by further policy and action if it is to mean real change. So what should we make of Kwarteng’s statements? The invasion of Ukraine has led to a huge upheaval of the energy markets, as the International Energy Agency chief Fatih Birol predicted. Gas prices in Europe were already soaring, owing, in part, to Vladimir Putin’s tightening of gas supply to the EU – a move that now seems a clear precursor to his invasion aims. Germany has announced a suite of new energy policies alongside its historic foreign policy reversals, and the country’s Green party – in the ruling coalition – is even reconsidering its implacable opposition to nuclear power. EU nations are ramping up their low-carbon energy efforts, and businesses have been affected too: earlier this week BP gave up its stake in Rosneft, and on Monday Shell did the same with Gazprom. In the UK, the war has added impetus to the claims of many Conservative politicians and rightwing commentators, fuelled by soaring gas prices, that the UK must put off the goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions in favour of fostering domestic fossil fuel supplies. Kwarteng’s statements, in response to these issues, acknowledge that North Sea oil and gas are totemic for many opponents of the UK’s net zero plans – the UK’s own fossil fuel resources are seen as a bulwark against energy insecurity and economic threats. However, this overlooks the fact that much of the UK’s production of North Sea oil and gas is sold overseas to the highest bidder – in fact, the amount exported doubled late last year. The UK has no gas supply issues, but what Kwarteng carefully leaves out is that the UK certainly does have a gas storage issue. The Conservative government decided in 2017 to allow the closure of major gas storage facilities, meaning that the UK now has puny storage capacity compared with EU countries such as Germany and the Netherlands. Being unable to store large quantities of gas makes the UK more dependent on imports and vulnerable to price shocks, like the current one. Kwarteng is absolutely right – but why then is he planning a big expansion of exploration in the North Sea? The Committee on Climate Change found last week that granting new licences to explore for oil and gas in the North Sea would do nothing to alleviate high prices, as those new fields would take decades to come into production. But although the CCC clearly “favoured” a moratorium on new licences, the government’s response made clear it was minded to press ahead with them anyway. Again, Kwarteng is right – those calling for a return to fracking as the answer to the UK’s energy problems are deluded. Fracking failed because the industrialisation of densely populated countryside for meagre returns was always a doubtful business in the UK. But it’s notable that Kwarteng, one of the authors of Britannia Unchained, chooses an entirely different argument to slap down the frackers – the fact that any gas produced would not reduce the market price. The UK led the dash for gas, and away from coal, in the 1990s, which is the main reason why UK greenhouse gas emissions have fallen further and faster than many comparable developed countries over that time. But gas cannot be the long-term answer if we are to tackle the climate crisis. However, as the energy commentator Michael Liebreich also pointed out on Twitter on Monday, moving away from gas needs to be planned and carefully executed – otherwise, consumers will face price shocks. The UK could have ramped up renewable energy much sooner, but chose to rely on North Sea fossil fuels for much longer than necessary. Why does nuclear come first? Building new nuclear power stations will take even longer than new North Sea oil and gas fields, or new fracking wells. The only new nuclear power station currently being built in the UK, at Hinkley Point C in Somerset by French energy giant EDF, has taken the best part of two decades to move from planning to construction and is still years away from producing electricity. Financial backing for new nuclear is also in serious doubt, as critics say it is likely to be the most expensive form of generation. Again, Kwarteng is absolutely right: renewables are cheaper than gas. Onshore wind is one of the cheapest forms of renewable energy. Why then has the UK made onshore windfarms almost impossible to build in England? Solar prices have also plummeted. So why has the government failed to mandate solar panels on new housing, and reduced the incentives available for households to install them? The case for energy efficiency is abundantly clear. The UK has the leakiest housing stock in Europe, so insulation will cut energy bills, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make people healthier. But since the scrapping of the ill-administered green homes grant last April, households across England have been left without any assistance scheme. In fact, apart from the short-lived green homes grant scheme, there has been no nationwide insulation programme for the last seven years, and meanwhile more than 1m new homes have been built to high-carbon standards, and will have to be retrofitted. Ed Matthew, of the thinktank E3G, says: “The business secretary is right to flag that energy efficiency investment is the best way to bring down energy bills. There is potential to cut UK home energy use in half with energy efficiency. “But the £6bn the government has committed is only half of the investment needed to get on track to net zero and reach the target to end fuel poverty by 2030. The Ukraine crisis is a reminder of the price we pay due to our addiction to gas. “For energy security, for net zero, for energy bills, the solution is the same – we need a bold new infrastructure programme to insulate every UK home within a decade and massively accelerate the switch to electrified heat. There is no greater patriotic mission.” Jan Rosenow, director at the Regulatory Assistance Project, applauds Kwarteng’s intentions but says that the UK is coming at this from a slow start. “The government rightly identifies an expansion of renewables and home energy efficiency upgrades as important levers to move away from imported fossil gas,” he says. “Whilst on renewable energy the UK has achieved a lot and recent announcements of annual auctions are welcome, on energy efficiency the UK is trailing far behind its European neighbours. A well-funded, long-term energy efficiency programme is still nonexistent and this needs to change.” Nothing that Kwarteng says in this thread represents a departure in government policy. What’s important is that he has chosen to say it, at this time and in this way. He is not alone: Alok Sharma, the cabinet minister who presided over the Cop26 climate summit last year, has repeatedly called for more climate action. Other Conservatives are also joining the fray: Samuel Hall of the Conservative Environment Network told Darren Grimes on GB News on Monday that renewables would work better than fracking in bringing bills down. These interventions have come amid renewed concern over the UK’s energy future, sparked by the war in Ukraine. They also come as a belated riposte to attempts by the right wing of the Tory party to turn net zero into a culture war. For months now, almost as soon as the last delegate departed from Cop26 in Glasgow last November, the UK’s right-leaning press has been full of attacks on the government’s climate policy by the opponents of net zero. The wounding of Boris Johnson in the partygate scandals gave rightwing Conservatives and commentators the opening they needed, as the “green agenda” has long been closely identified with the prime minister. Soaring energy prices fanned the flames. For Kwarteng now to take such a public stand in favour of green energy, slapping down fracking enthusiasts and deflating claims for North Sea gas, marks a significant ramping up of green rhetoric. Perhaps the fightback starts here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/17/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-16T18:00:01Z","webTitle":"What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week?

Catch up with the must-read news and analysis","bodyText":"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis and opinion. Putin preparing for major new offensive in new year Senior Ukrainian officials say Vladimir Putin is preparing for a major new offensive in the new year, Isobel Koshiw and Peter Beaumont reported, despite a series of humiliating battlefield setbacks for Russia in recent months. In an interview with the Guardian, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said that while Ukraine was now able to successfully defend itself against Russia’s missile attacks targeting key infrastructure, including the energy grid, evidence was emerging that the Kremlin was preparing a broad new offensive. Reznikov’s comments echoed similar remarks made to the Economist this week – including from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the head of the armed forces, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, and the chief of ground forces, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskii. The briefings appeared to be part of a broad, coordinated effort to warn against complacency among western allies and highlight the continuing threat Russia poses to Ukraine. Deadlocked enemy forces slog it out in ‘Bakhmut meat grinder’ Ukraine’s current defining battle is taking place in the eastern Donetsk city of Bakhmut. Once home to 72,000, the civilian population has dwindled to 12,000 over the past six months, surviving in basements and supplied by mobile grocery trucks that enter the city when they can. A widespread assessment that Russian forces have until mid-December before the onset of full winter conditions forces a slowing of their efforts has supplied one motive for the sense of urgency, Peter Beaumont writes from the region. A recent assessment for the Institute for the Study of War determined that even if Russia succeeded in a controlled Ukrainian withdrawal from the city, Bakhmut itself offered them little operational benefit. “The costs associated with six months of brutal, grinding and attrition-based combat around Bakhmut far outweigh any operational advantage that the Russians can obtain from taking Bakhmut.” Safety of Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant hangs in balance The Russian shell that struck in the night had taken away the wall of a top-floor apartment, and in its place was just freezing air blowing off the Dnieper River – and a view of Europe’s biggest nuclear power station on the other bank. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant’s silhouette – with its two fat cooling towers and the row of six squat blocks – has become globally familiar since it was dubbed the most dangerous place on Earth: six nuclear reactors on the frontline of a catastrophic war. On a fairly typical night last week, the Russians on the left bank of the river fired 40 shells and rockets into Nikopol, a town on the Ukrainian-held right bank, falling on its rows of krushchevky, five-storey blocks of flats built for factory workers in the 1960s and named after the Soviet leader of the time. After 10 months of war, the blocks are half empty, so there are fewer people to kill. The only reported casualty on this particular night was a 65-year-old man who was taken to hospital, and whose flat now afforded such a comprehensive view of the power plant. By the next morning, the repairs had already begun. Julian Borger had this report. Was the Viktor Bout exchange deal a win for Moscow? The Russian arms dealer is back in Moscow after the prisoner swap for US women’s basketball star Brittney Griner. Kremlin officials say it’s a “capitulation by America” – but others believe Bout is a declining asset. Was the Viktor Bout exchange deal really a win for Moscow? Andrew Roth asked this week. Both Russia and Bout had long denied suspicions that he was an asset for the Russian spy services, and in his first remarks after arriving, Bout seemed to nod and wink at the belief that he held some secret value for the Kremlin. “I don’t think I’m somehow important for Russian politics,” he said, before adding a line now common in Russian war films and military circles: “We don’t abandon our own, right?” Russians connected to the Kremlin have treated the swap as greatly advantageous but analysts gave a more careful evaluation, noting that Bout has already served more than a decade in prison and most of his contacts and knowledge will have withered with time. Putin won’t hold end-of-year press conference Vladimir Putin will not hold a year-end press conference for the first time in at least a decade, Andrew Roth reports, in what Kremlin-watchers view as a break with protocol due to his war in Ukraine. The marathon press conferences are traditionally an occasion for the Russian president to burnish his image, a campy spectacle that allows Putin to play the populist on national television each December. On Monday, the Kremlin announced it would not be holding the press conference this year. There would also be no new year reception at the Kremlin, officials said, possibly a decision influenced by the reluctance to celebrate because Russia’s war in Ukraine has not gone to plan. Putin mentioned a potential settlement to end his war in Ukraine on Friday while still claiming that his “special military operation” was going to plan. “The settlement process as a whole, yes, it will probably be difficult and will take some time. But one way or another, all participants in this process will have to agree with the realities that are taking shape on the ground,” the Russian president said during remarks at a press conference in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. His remarks came just days after he appeared to be girding Russians for a protracted war in Ukraine, saying that his military operation could be a “long-term process”. Crimea is Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s greatest bargaining chip This week, Patrick Wintour took a look at the differing views on how Ukraine might approach the question of Crimea. In a little noticed intervention, the former British prime minister Boris Johnson – seen as a bosom ally of Volodymyr Zelenskiy – made the startling statement that if Russian troops were returned to lands they held inside Ukraine before the 24 February invasion, that would represent a basis for reopening talks between Ukraine and Russia. The statement implies Ukraine would have to accept that the removal of Russian troops from Crimea would not be a precondition for the start of talks. In proposing this, in a piece last week in the Wall Street Journal, Johnson was making an admission made in private by many diplomats that a militarily enforced return of the Crimean peninsula – which was annexed by Russia in 2014 in a move rejected by the UN – to full Ukrainian control is fraught with risk. Historically and ethnically, Crimea is different from the rest of Ukraine, the argument goes. There are also 30,000 Russian forces dug in with little available Ukrainian amphibious access. Crimea’s retention in some form is so precious to Vladimir Putin that if he felt it were slipping from his grasp, some fear he may act on his threat to deploy tactical nuclear weapons – the escalation that terrifies, and holds back, Washington and Europe. Moldovans weigh political future as Ukraine war hits economy Electricity blackouts, stray missiles and 35% inflation: collateral damage from Russia’s war on Ukraine has plunged neighbouring Moldova into a crisis that goes beyond higher energy bills. “I see elderly people crying in front of the shop window. It’s not that they can’t afford salami, they can’t even afford the basics like milk,” Carolina Untilă, who works in a corner shop in the suburbs of the capital, Chișinău, told the Guardian’s Paula Erizanu. Moldova’s dependence on energy imports is driving record inflation. Prices of some products have doubled; in her shop, grocery sales have halved, Untilă says. To alleviate the burden of winter, as the former Soviet republic weans itself off almost total energy reliance on Russia, the government has had to turn to its western partners for emergency financial support. Russia’s state gas company, Gazprom, slashed supplies to Moldova in October, while reliance on Ukrainian electricity interconnectors has made the country an indirect casualty of the violence, as Kyiv stopped exporting electricity to Moldova in October after Russian airstrikes on its critical infrastructure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/05/charity-linked-to-uk-anti-onshore-wind-campaigns-active-again-renewable-energy-foundation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-05T13:39:56Z","webTitle":"Charity linked to UK anti-onshore wind campaigns active again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/05/charity-linked-to-uk-anti-onshore-wind-campaigns-active-again-renewable-energy-foundation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/apr/05/charity-linked-to-uk-anti-onshore-wind-campaigns-active-again-renewable-energy-foundation","fields":{"headline":"Charity linked to UK anti-onshore wind campaigns active again","bodyText":"While the name of the Renewable Energy Foundation (REF) suggests it is a charity dedicated to promoting low-carbon electricity, it appears to spend most of its time campaigning against onshore wind. When it was founded in 2004, with the TV personality Noel Edmonds as its chair, the organisation was clear it wanted to fight against the “grotesque political push” for onshore renewable energy in the UK. It styles itself on its website as “a registered charity promoting sustainable development for the benefit of the public by means of energy conservation and the use of renewable energy”. However, many in the energy sector believe the charity to be full of anti-wind lobbyists. As onshore wind expanded at the beginning of the century, many people felt affronted by what they saw as “eyesores”. It was something many grassroots Conservative party members were angry about, and articles in the Daily Mail and Telegraph frequently complained about a “plague” of windfarms. Some conservationists prefer other forms of renewable energy to onshore wind, which is feared to deplete biodiversity in some areas. The REF was on hand to help with the campaign against onshore renewables, providing research and quotes to the rightwing press. But at the time, others, including the Guardian, questioned the motives of this group. In 2008, the REF had what it described as a “dialogue” with the Charity Commission over whether it was violating its charitable status by being too political in its campaigning. The Charity Commission said it assessed the complaint relating to the REF’s campaigning activities and determined there was no evidence that it was not charitable, but also provided guidance about how to achieve its objectives as an organisation. The REF has strong links to a group accused of climate science scepticism, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, started by the former chancellor Nigel Lawson, who has denied global heating is a problem. Prof Michael Kelly, a trustee of the REF also has a position on the board of the GWPF. John Constable, an adviser to the GWPF, has been quoted as an REF spokesperson and was previously its director of policy and research. Constable answered the Guardian’s questions for this article on behalf of the REF. Since the first onshore wind farm was built in Cornwall in 1991, local groups have formed to fight against the construction of turbines in their area. By 2004, when the REF formed, there were many of these groups. Articles based on the REF’s findings appeared in rightwing papers, helping to sway public opinion against renewable energy. MPs also used briefings from the REF to lobby the government. This seemed to bear fruit. Although in 2011, what was then the Department of Energy and Climate Change said there was a need for onshore wind and that it was a cheap and effective source of renewable energy, the then prime minister David Cameron began to listen to his backbenchers about their distaste for it. In 2015, he said he wanted to rid the countryside of the “unsightly” structures. He did just that. Onshore wind was officially blocked from bidding for financial support available to other forms of renewable energy in 2016, leading to a 94% decline in the number of new projects. It has become very difficult to secure planning permission for renewables, with figures from RenewableUK showing that there are approximately 7,000MW worth of onshore schemes waiting for planning permission. While the REF has been relatively quiet in recent years, growing pressure on the government to support wind energy to help solve the energy crisis seems to have led to it becoming more active again. In recent weeks, the charity has provided anti-onshore wind research to the Telegraph and Daily Mail. Colin Davie, a trustee of the REF, has appeared on Radio 4’s Today programme to oppose onshore wind. Opposition to wind energy has been building in parliament, too. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, last week emphasised that he supported offshore wind, and made no mention of onshore. He is understood to believe that the renewable energy source is unpopular among Conservative MPs. Government sources have briefed that he would prefer to press on with a nuclear energy scheme, aiming for a quarter of the UK’s energy to be supplied by nuclear by 2050. This seems to be out of tune with the public’s thinking. Recent polling for Politico found that 72% of people would support new windfarms in their local area, 52% more permits for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea, and just 38% nuclear power stations in their area. Constable, on behalf of the REF, said: “Our data is often used in planning debates, but we neither make planning applications nor create local opposition groups, so cannot be said to ‘start’ such discussions.” Some Conservative MPs have supported expanding onshore wind. The Thirsk and Malton MP, Kevin Hollinrake, said that now was “the right time” to develop onshore energy “where there is local support”. He continued: “I welcome the government’s decision to hold a new auction for onshore wind and solar. Public opinion has shifted decisively in favour of renewable energy in recent years, with CEN [Conservative Environment Network] polling showing that 74% of Conservative voters back onshore wind.” Environmental campaigners have also been pushing for onshore wind expansion. A Greenpeace UK spokesperson said: “It’s a no-brainer that we should build more onshore wind. It’s the country’s cheapest energy source, one of the quickest to get up and running, and is supported by 80% of the public. Boris Johnson himself has had to rethink his former opposition to wind power and is now considering speeding up the deployment of onshore turbines. With huge public concern about our dependence on fossil fuel imports and skyrocketing bills, any politician actively campaigning against the UK’s cheapest source of homegrown energy has some serious explaining to do to their constituents.” But onshore wind expansion will be unpopular with many Conservatives, including those in the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, which says it accepts the fundamental facts of the climate emergency and the need to reduce emissions, but has been campaigning for more oil exploration, nuclear power and fracking as well as arguing against green subsidies and expansion of renewables. Constable added that the REF had “no blanket policy” on renewables – but that the charity did not see them as a large part of the net zero strategy. He added: “Each proposal must be judged on its own merits, and providing that local environmental concerns offer no obstacle, niche applications may be suitable, as they may be for all renewables.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jun/06/south-korea-and-us-fire-eight-missiles-into-sea-in-show-of-force-to-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-06T02:16:48Z","webTitle":"South Korea and US fire eight missiles into sea in show of force to North Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/06/south-korea-and-us-fire-eight-missiles-into-sea-in-show-of-force-to-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jun/06/south-korea-and-us-fire-eight-missiles-into-sea-in-show-of-force-to-north-korea","fields":{"headline":"South Korea and US fire eight missiles into sea in show of force to North Korea","bodyText":"South Korea and the US have fired eight surface-to-surface missiles into the sea in response to North Korea’s launch of a similar number of ballistic missiles the previous day, a South Korea defence ministry official said. South Korea said Monday’s tit-for-tat launch off its east coast was a demonstration of Seoul’s “capability and readiness to carry out precision strikes” against the source of North Korea’s missile launches or the command and support centres, the Yonhap news agency cited the South Korean military as saying. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has vowed to take a tougher line against the North and agreed with Joe Biden at a summit in Seoul last month to upgrade joint military drills and their combined deterrence posture, including the deployment of more powerful US weapons. On Monday, Yoon said the North’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes had reached a level where they “threatened regional and world peace”, and promised a “firm and stern response” to any future provocations. The militaries of South Korea and the US fired eight missiles over a period of about 10 minutes starting at 4.45am, Yonhap said. US Forces Korea said in a statement that the exercise had involved one US army missile and seven South Korean army missiles. It said the countries’ alliance “remains committed to peace and prosperity on the Korean peninsula and throughout the Indo-Pacific. The US commitment to the defence of [South Korea] remains ironclad.” North Korea fired eight short-range ballistic missiles towards the sea off its east coast on Sunday, a day after the US aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan concluded a three-day naval exercise with South Korea in the Philippine Sea, apparently their first joint drill involving a carrier since November 2017. The South’s military said it had detected the North firing the missiles over a 35-minute period from at least four different locations, in what appeared to be a single-day record for the regime’s ballistic launches. North Korea, which is several weeks into battling its first known outbreak of Covid-19, has criticised previous joint drills as proof of Washington’s continued “hostile policies” toward Pyongyang, despite its talk of resuming nuclear diplomacy. Pyongyang has not commented on its recent missile tests and appears to be focusing on its Covid-19 response for the domestic audience, but it is continuing to modernise its military, according to Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. While the regime has not yet demonstrated miniaturised nuclear warheads, missiles with multiple warheads, or warhead reentry capability, even launches of short-range missile launches can provide valuable lessons, he said. “Firing many projectiles at once from various locations suggests Pyongyang is practicing to overwhelm South Korea’s missile defences,” Easley said, adding that the US and South Korea had “quickly responded to the Kim regime’s recent missile firings with counter-launches that demonstrate combined readiness for precision strikes against the origin of an attack”. North Korea has conducted a flurry of missile launches this year, from hypersonic weapons to intercontinental ballistic missiles [ICBM], for the first time in nearly five years. Washington and Seoul officials also recently warned that North Korea appeared ready to resume nuclear weapons tests for the first time since 2017, as Kim attempts to push his country’s status as a genuine nuclear power to win economic and security concessions from the US. Last month, North Korea fired three missiles, including one thought to be its largest ICBM, after Biden ended his three-day trip to South Korea, where he and Yoon agreed to new measures to deter the regime. The combined forces of South Korea and the US also fired missiles in response to those tests, which the two allies said violated UN security council resolutions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/13/nationals-leader-says-party-must-rebuild-trust-with-women-but-rejects-quotas","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T06:07:31Z","webTitle":"Nationals leader says party must rebuild trust with women but rejects quotas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/13/nationals-leader-says-party-must-rebuild-trust-with-women-but-rejects-quotas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/13/nationals-leader-says-party-must-rebuild-trust-with-women-but-rejects-quotas","fields":{"headline":"Nationals leader says party must rebuild trust with women but rejects quotas","bodyText":"The leader of the Nationals, David Littleproud, has said his party will make rebuilding trust with women a top priority, but rejected quotas for his party. “I don’t believe in quotas,” he said. “I believe in creating the environment for women to come forward. “We’ll be looking to identify female candidates in new seats and those seats that we will have retiring members in and we’ll start that process as part of this journey in being open and honest, but we want to be genuine about this.” Littleproud outlined his vision for the Nationals to the party faithful gathered in Canberra for a federal council meeting on Saturday. In the first address of the meeting, the Nationals federal president, Kay Hull, spoke of the importance of women in politics and the contribution they made to key regional industries, including agriculture. “We need to be resetting, ensuring we are embracing particularly the women of our nation,” she said. “And so they are part of our heartland … we stand as one of the few parties that have such a proud track record. “I think there are many areas that we need to embrace and further reset.” Analysis of the Coalition’s election defeat showed women deserted the Liberal party in droves, as a number of women – the teal independents – won city seats from the Liberal party. The independents campaigned strongly on climate change action and integrity. Hull said the Nationals was the most diverse of any political party, and spruiked the lived experience of its members. “They’ve had to make decisions and pay for mistakes out of their own pocket, not out of the taxpayers’ purse,” she said. “They make decisions on good economic basis on what they would do if this was their own business and their own livelihood.” Littleproud said he would take policies representing regional and rural communities to the Albanese government’s national jobs summit next month. “It’s disappointing that regional Australia wasn’t even thought of,” he said. “We were an afterthought, and it’s important regional Australia has a voice there. “We want to prosecute our case with some pragmatic solutions. “The fact that regional Australia wasn’t even invited just goes to show that this stunt was all aimed at just sending the symbolic messages to the electorate.” The federal government will hold its jobs and skills summit in Canberra over the first two days in September. Labor invited the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, to attend, or send a Coalition member in his place, but the Liberal party turned down the offer. At the Nationals meeting on Saturday Littleproud said pensioners and veterans should be able to work more without their payments being affected, as a reward for their service to the nation. “This is a payback to them,” he said. The party will also fight for a visa to fast-track permanent residency for workers in rural and regional communities. “We believe that it needs now to go forward and to incentivise those migrants that come to regional Australia,” Littleproud said. “We need to give them the incentive of becoming residents and citizens of this great country. “This is an opportunity to grow regional Australia to make sure the next generation are out there and taking us to our full potential.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Littleproud said the program of paying university debt of healthcare workers in the regions should be extended to other graduates in areas experiencing skills shortages. Littleproud was elected leader in May, following Labor’s election victory, emerging the winner of a three-way contest with ousted leader Barnaby Joyce and former minister Darren Chester. He has called for the party to “evolve” with the changes in the electorate, but to continue to stand up for rural and regional Australians."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/13/watershed-moment-horror-and-hope-from-inquiry-into-queensland-police","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T20:00:23Z","webTitle":"‘Watershed moment’: horror and hope from inquiry into Queensland police","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/13/watershed-moment-horror-and-hope-from-inquiry-into-queensland-police","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/13/watershed-moment-horror-and-hope-from-inquiry-into-queensland-police","fields":{"headline":"‘Watershed moment’: horror and hope from inquiry into Queensland police","bodyText":"Of all the shocking allegations heard during five weeks of public hearings by a commission of inquiry, one conversation between two Queensland police officers stood out for Betty Taylor. The alarming allegation was that police did not investigate the suspicious death of a victim as she and her partner were “a pair of scumbags” who lived in a “shit area in a shit house”. The comment, allegedly made by a senior officer to his colleague in 2019, shocked Taylor, who has spent three decades working in the domestic violence sector. As chief executive of the Red Rose Foundation, Taylor says it warrants an independent investigation. “I don’t think that can just stand and not be taken further. We can’t have women being killed and we’re not doing thorough investigations,” Taylor says. “If they start to look at other suspicious deaths, [there are] probably going to be more.” The independent commission of inquiry into the Queensland police service’s responses to domestic violence incidents was recommended by the state’s women’s safety and justice taskforce after submissions from victims outlining alleged police failures. The taskforce said “cultural problems within the QPS persist and appear to be widespread”, despite the “best efforts” of senior leadership and officers trained specifically in domestic violence. For Thelma Schwartz, the principal legal officer of the Queensland Indigenous Family Violence Legal Service, the allegation that a proper investigation wasn’t conducted into a death is feared to be the tip of the iceberg. Schwartz says she’s heard similar claims about a lack of willingness by police to investigate acts of violence. “The commonwealth has just established an inquiry into murdered and missing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women,” she said. “Why have these women just disappeared and there’s been no response?” A QPS spokesperson says the ethical standards command “has commenced internal inquiries into specific allegations raised as part of the inquiry which it had not previously been made aware of”. “A number of matters raised which have been the subject of previous ESC investigations have also been reviewed,” they say. “Officers are rightly expected to meet a high level of service and standard of conduct.” ‘Too ugly to be raped’ The inquiry, which has held five weeks of public hearings, heard from dozens of witnesses including current and former police officers, service providers and advocates. One police officer broke down in tears at the hearings as he described hearing officers referring to domestic violence as “foreplay”, describing rape as “surprise sex” and saying victims were “too ugly to be raped”. Indigenous women are some of the worst affected by police inaction, the inquiry heard, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders regularly misidentified as perpetrators of domestic violence and not considered the “ideal victim”. An internal report by an intelligence officer also found domestic violence deaths were likely in the Torres Strait Islands, with allegations of police inaction even after officers had observed victims’ “bloodied lips, swollen faces” and “black eyes”. The Queensland police union was contacted for comment. Ian Leavers, the president of the union, said in a written submission there was “no widespread culture problem” in how police respond to domestic violence incidents. His submission said that while there are still “unsatisfactory behaviour and attitudes within the service”, this involves a “very small minority of serving police officers”. Leavers said he believed failures are more likely caused by “workload pressures or inadequate training”. Schwartz says the hearings highlight systemic police failures in responding to victims, “irrespective of race, gender or sexuality”. “It does not shock me one single bit what has finally come out of Pandora’s box at all,” she says. “I hope that the general public have seen how widespread this rot is.” Nicole Moulding, the director of the Safe Relationships and Communities Research Group at the University of South Australia, says it’s hard to quantify when an issue becomes widespread. But the evidence brought by experts, as well as submissions to taskforce, shows this is a common problem. “These negative misogynistic attitudes about domestic violence victims also exist in the wider community but it’s totally reasonable to expect more of the police,” Moulding says. Moulding says most victims never report domestic violence to police, so it’s likely police failures may also be going unreported. For officers it’s also daunting to take a stand, Moulding says, as whistleblowers may confront professional blow-back. “There are a lot of officers that are well educated and have a sound understanding of domestic violence but there are also a lot of barriers to police speaking out,” Moulding says. “Police culture historically has been one about supporting your buddies.” The hope for lasting change After decades of “denial” and “deflection” by police, Prof Kerry Carrington, an expert on the policing of domestic violence, says the inquiry has been a “watershed moment” for the state. But she believes the hearings could have “gone further” by compelling several influential police figures to give evidence in person, including the QPS commissioner, Katarina Carroll; the president of the Queensland police union, Ian Leavers; and the police minister, Mark Ryan. “I would have liked to have seen the inquiry ask those in charge what are they gonna do. They’ve heard the evidence. Do they take it on board?” Carrington said. The commission’s final report will be handed down by 4 October. Guardian Australia understands a further hearing is being considered on 18 August, with plans under way to determine the witnesses and location. A QPS spokesperson says all the inquiry’s recommendations will be “thoroughly considered” and police remain “committed to refining and enhancing” responses to domestic violence. Advocates are in firm agreement that any recommendations to come out of the inquiry need to more than a tokenistic or “Band-Aid” approach. As an advocate for specialist domestic violence police stations, Carrington hopes the commission will suggest their introduction following recommendations from coronial inquests into Doreen Langham and Hannah Clarke and her children. Moulding believes police training must be accompanied by “structural changes” such as police hiring more women in positions of power. Taylor hopes for “strong, sustainable” change. “You had to have the inquiry to shine the light,” Taylor says. “Now it’s out there and we need to get on with the reforms.” In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

The dividend payouts are the result of the Gulf nation’s investments in a raft of FTSE 100 firms, including Barclays, Shell and utility firm Severn Trent, which have reported strong profits amid a cost of living crisis and the worst UK drought in centuries. The figures, compiled by the Guardian, cover funds distributed to Qatari state-owned shareholders in the 10 months leading up to the controversial tournament in November. However, the Qatari state’s income from UK-listed firms is likely to have been in the billions of pounds since it won the rights to host the Fifa World Cup in 2010. The figures will raise concerns over how everyday spending by British consumers, through bank transactions, grocery shopping and air travel, may be inadvertently supporting the Qatari host, which has criminalised homosexuality and been accused of exploiting migrant workers to build World Cup infrastructure. Although the shareholdings of listed companies are publicly available, there is little awareness about the types of investors that hold shares in UK firms. Amnesty International UK’s director of economic affairs, Peter Frankental, said British firms needed to be more upfront about the destination of dividend payouts. “Qatar’s considerable wealth and its extensive portfolio of overseas investments have been accompanied by the systematic exploitation of its vast migrant labour force, many of whom have toiled for years for abusive employers with the connivance of the Qatari authorities,” Frankental said. “UK companies need to be transparent about any human rights abuses that may have occurred in their investor chain, including those originating in Qatar’s notorious construction sites.” Qatar’s $450bn (£389bn) sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), has taken a huge interest in UK-listed investment in recent decades, spending billions to acquire stakes in a raft of British blue-chip firms such as the London Stock Exchange Group and Royal Dutch Shell. UK stocks make up nearly a fifth of the QIA’s equity portfolio at 17%, and are worth a combined $8.8bn. That makes the UK the third-largest destination for the authority’s equity investments, behind Germany which makes up 29% of the portfolio at a value of $15bn, and Qatar where shares make up nearly 19% of the portfolio at $9.6bn. Those UK stakes have meant that the investment authority – and therefore the Qatari state – have benefited from British companies’ profits, which have subsequently been handed to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Guardian analysis of publicly available data shows Qatari vehicles, including QIA, have pocketed around £475m in dividends since January alone, helping support Qatari finances at a time when the state is estimated to have spent about $200bn preparing to host the World Cup. That includes Shell, which handed nearly $17m worth of dividends to Qatar in a year when it reported record profits on the back of surging energy prices linked to the shortages caused by the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the QIA earned £13m through its 4.6% holding in Coventry-based water company Severn Trent, which has come under fire for bumper executive payouts – including £3.9m for its boss Liv Garfield – even though the country suffered under the worst drought conditions in centuries. The QIA also earned £11m from the London Stock Exchange Group, in which the QIA still holds a 7% stake, and further £33m from its shareholding in supermarket chain Sainsbury’s. That is on top of £64m from a 6.3% stake in banking giant Barclays. Its holding in the UK bank is a hangover from its controversial involvement in the bank’s emergency fundraising at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. The funding arrangement helped Barclays avoid a public bailout that would have placed it under government control, but later led the Serious Fraud Office to accuse three former Barclays bankers of funnelling secret fees to Qatar in exchange for the emergency funding. A jury found those executives not guilty in early 2020. The bank itself is now appealing against a regulatory fine over the deal. One of the biggest sources of UK dividend revenue came from UK-listed mining giant Glencore, which paid Qatar Holding – a subsidiary of the QIA – a total of $387m (£347m) since January. The dividends are the result of an 8% stake in the company. While Glencore is headquartered in Switzerland, rather than the UK, most UK pensions will have a stake in the FTSE 100-listed firm, which trades metals used in key technologies such as electric batteries. Glencore became one of the largest commodity companies in the world thanks to a £50bn merger with mining company Xstrata, sealed thanks to late-night talks involving Tony Blair and Qatari billionaire politician Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani. Other dividend payouts came from stakes in Dettol disinfectant and Nurofen maker Reckitt Benckiser, which paid £382,000 to QIA, and private equity group and GKN-owner Melrose Industries, at £14,000. The state-owned Qatar Airways also holds a 25.23% stake in British Airways owner IAG, though the group – which is still recovering from the Covid pandemic – has not yet paid a dividend this year. The QIA, Glencore, Barclays, Severn Trent, and the London Stock Exchange declined to comment. Melrose Industries did not respond to requests for comment. Sainsbury’s said in a statement that it did not choose its shareholders, and that the majority were UK pension funds and private investors including Sainsbury’s staff. Reckitt Benckiser said the company recently strengthened policies meant to prevent modern slavery and had a zero-tolerance policy on human rights abuses. “We have a track record of working throughout our supply chain to strengthen human rights and labour standards, excluding suppliers where our standards are not achieved, and working with suppliers, peers and civil society to enable change at scale.” Shell did not directly comment on the dividend payouts but shared a statement regarding its approach to separate investments in Qatar. “A commitment to worker welfare and respect for people is fundamental to how companies in the Shell group operate globally, including in Qatar.” Those dividends from listed firms are on top of valuable stakes in private British companies including Harrods, Heathrow, The Shard and Starling Bank. In December engine maker Rolls-Royce announced the QIA was spending £85m to take a 10% stake in a UK government-backed project to develop small nuclear power plants, known as Rolls-Royce SMR. QInvest, another investment vehicle of the Qatari royal family, also maintains a 43% stake in stockbroker and investment bank Panmure Gordon, which posted its first profit in three years in 2021. Meanwhile, Farnborough-headquartered arms company BAE Systems announced in March that it had signed an agreement to develop warship support for the Qatar Emiri’s Naval Force. And amid the UK’s energy crisis, Qatar’s participation in the South Hook LNG terminal has come into focus. State-owned Qatar Energy has a 67.5% share in the Pembrokeshire-based terminal. Qatar is one of the UK’s largest sources of liquefied natural gas (LNG), a role that led Boris Johnson to discuss increased supply from the Gulf state in late 2021, as global gas prices soared."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jan/16/russia-ukraine-war-belarus-begins-air-force-drills-with-russia-dnipro-strike-death-toll-rises-to-35-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-16T19:00:37Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Russia launches overnight attack on Zaporizhzhia, officials say; Belarus begins air force drills with Russia – live","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jan/16/russia-ukraine-war-belarus-begins-air-force-drills-with-russia-dnipro-strike-death-toll-rises-to-35-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jan/16/russia-ukraine-war-belarus-begins-air-force-drills-with-russia-dnipro-strike-death-toll-rises-to-35-live","fields":{"headline":"UK confirms it will send Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine and pressures Germany to increase support – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Britain will send a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine to help push back Russia’s invasion, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has confirmed. Outlining details to the UK’s parliament, Wallace described the military support as “the most significant package of combat power to date to accelerate Ukrainian success”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, thanked Wallace, Rishi Sunak and the people of Britain for the “powerful contribution to our common victory over tyrany”, adding that tanks, APCs and artillery are “exactly what Ukraine needs to restore its territorial integrity”. The Kremlin said the tanks Britain plans to send to Ukraine “will burn”, warning the west that supplying a new round of more advanced weapons to Ukraine would not change the course of the war. The announcement makes the UK the first western power to supply the Ukrainians with main battle tanks, which would be used to help train Ukrainian troops, and will heap further pressure on Germany to approve a wider delivery of the vehicles this week. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, urged Germany to permit the supply of Leopard tanks to Ukraine, adding that the move could unlock support from other nations. Germany should take “decisive actions” and send “all sorts of weapons” to Ukraine to help its troops defend themselves against Russia’s invasion, Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. Morawiecki, speaking in parliament, implicitly criticised the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for his reluctance to supply Kyiv with heavier weaponry. Ukraine expects to receive the first €3bn of an €18bn macro-financial assistance package from the EU this week, its prime minister Denys Shmyhal said. Matti Maasikas, the EU’s top representative to Ukraine, said the package “brings much needed predictability and relief to Ukraine’s state budget”. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and her Dutch counterpart, Wopke Hoekstra, condemned the deportation by Russians of thousands of Ukrainian children. Russia “must account for the whereabouts of these children”, Baerbock said at a joint news conference with Hoekstra, who said this “deliberate Russian policy” is “tearing families apart and traumatising children”. Russia carried out two mass rocket strikes on Ukraine on Saturday, devastating an apartment block in the south-central city of Dnipro, where at least 40 people have died and scores were injured. Dozens are still missing, city official Gennadiy Korban wrote on Telegram on Monday. 75 people were wounded in the strike, including 14 children, he said. The victims from the attack included a 15-year-old girl, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest nightly address. Russia and Belarus began joint air force drills this morning, triggering fears in Kyiv and the west that Moscow could use its ally to launch a new ground offensive in Ukraine. According to a statement published to the Telegram account of the Belarus ministry of defence, units from Russia’s aerospace forces arrived at the airfields of Belarus late on Sunday night. Shortly after 8am local time the ministry said the planned combat training tasks had begun. Russia launched an attack on Ukraine’s south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia overnight, wounding civilians and destroying residential infrastructure, according to regional officials. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the office of the president of Ukraine, said “The occupiers launched a rocket attack on the regional centre. The rocket hit next to a five-story building. Five people, including two children aged nine and 15, were injured by glass fragments. The children were hospitalised.” Ukraine’s forces have “almost certainly” maintained positions in Soledar, north of Bakhmut, according to the UK’s ministry of defence’s latest intelligence update. Over the weekend, intense fighting continued in both the Kremina and Bakhmut sectors of the Donbas front, the ministry added. President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke by phone on Monday where they discussed the conflict in Ukraine, according to readouts of the call from both sides. The pair discussed the question of a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, the Kremlin said, as well as the export of Ukrainian grain from Black Sea ports and ways to unblock fertiliser and food exports from Russia. The UN’s nuclear watchdog is expanding its presence in Ukraine to “help prevent a nuclear accident” during the ongoing conflict, the agency’s head, Rafael Grossi, has said. Grossi is in Ukraine this week to establish the “continuous presence” of nuclear safety and security experts at all the country’s nuclear power facilities, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in its latest update on Ukraine on Friday. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Ukraine could expect more deliveries of heavy weapons from western countries soon. Western allies will consider sending battle tanks to Kyiv ahead of a meeting in Ramstein in Germany on Friday, where governments are expected to announce their latest pledges of military support. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, has announced her resignation following a series of blunders and a growing impression that she has struggled to deal with the challenges of overseeing the country’s military since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Lambrecht’s resignation comes at a crucial moment with Germany expected to deliver battle tanks to Ukraine, in a huge decision for the country as it changes the longstanding direction of its defence policy. A Russian man who reportedly fought for the private mercenary Wagner group has crossed into Norway and requested political asylum, according to Norwegian authorities. Andrey Medvedev, who reportedly served as a high-ranking Wagner group member, has sought shelter in Norway, authorities confirmed to the Associated Press. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has thanked Britain and its prime minister and defence secretary after the announcement that UK will supply 14 Challenger 2 tanks as part of a new military support package for Kyiv. Tanks, APCs and artillery are “exactly what Ukraine needs to restore its territorial integrity”, Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter. The UK will send a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine to help push back Russia’s invasion, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has confirmed. Speaking in the House of Commons, Wallace announced what he described as “the most significant package of combat to date to accelerate Ukrainian success”. The announcement makes the UK the first western power to supply the Ukrainians with main battle tanks, which would be used to help train Ukrainian troops, and will heap further pressure on Germany to approve a wider delivery of the vehicles this week. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has called for the establishment of a special international tribunal to prosecute Russian leaders over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Baerbock and her Dutch counterpart, Wopke Hoekstra, also condemned the deportation by Russians of thousands of Ukrainian children, calling it a deliberate policy of cruel and inhumane abductions that is tearing families apart. A tribunal must be created to “investigate the Russian leadership and put them on trial”, the German minister said in a speech at the Academy of International Law in The Hague, where the international criminal court is based. It could be supplemented with international elements, “at a location outside Ukraine, with financial support from partners and with international prosecutors and judges, so that impartiality and legitimacy are guaranteed”, she continued. Ukraine and the EU have publicly backed the idea of a special tribunal. Russia has denied accusations of war crimes, including the deliberate targeting of Ukrainian civilians. During a news conference later today, Baerbock addressed Ukrainian reports of children being deported to Russia and given up for adoption there. Russia “must account for the whereabouts of these children”, she said. Baerbock added: Their parents, families, caregivers must no longer be in uncertainty and fear. These children have their homes with their families in Ukraine. These children did not leave their homes voluntarily. These children have been abducted. At least 1,000 children were seized from schools and orphanages in the Kherson region during Russia’s eight-month occupation of the area, according to local authorities. Their whereabouts are still unknown. Her Dutch counterpart, also speaking at the press conference, said: This deliberate Russian policy is tearing families apart and traumatising children. It is cruel and it is inhumane. And let me be clear that children abducted by Russia must be returned to their own country as soon as possible. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has urged Germany to permit the supply of Leopard tanks to Ukraine, adding that the move could unlock support from other nations. Berlin is under pressure to approve an increase in international military support for Kyiv by allowing the export of German-made Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine. Germany has resisted the move so far, saying western tanks should only be supplied to Ukraine if there is agreement among Kyiv’s main allies, particularly the US. Speaking in parliament today, Wallace said: It has been reported that obviously Poland is very keen to donate some Leopards, as is Finland. All of this currently relies on the German government’s decisions - not only whether the Germans will supply their own Leopards, but whether or not they’ll give permissions to others. I would urge my German colleagues to do that. Finland’s defence minister, Mikko Savola, said today that Finland’s stance on giving Leopard tanks to Ukraine depends on Germany’s lead, after President Sauli Niinisto said Finland could donate a small number of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine if a wider group of European nations also decided to do so. Savola told Reuters: It depends very much on Germany’s lead how we act with these Leopard tanks. These require a German export permit and in addition to that, the German defence industry has a very strong role in this, in how substitutive equipment can be obtained. On Thursday, Germany’s vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, said Berlin should not stand in the way of countries that want to send Leopards to Ukraine. That would give the green light to countries such as Poland, which has said it wants to take such a step as part of a coalition. Ukraine expects to receive the first €3bn of an €18bn macro-financial assistance package from the EU this week, its prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said. Matti Maasikas, the EU’s top representative to Ukraine, said the package “brings much needed predictability and relief to Ukraine’s state budget”. Britain’s shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said the government’s first package of UK military assistance for 2023 “has Labour’s fullest support”. Ukraine needs more combined military firepower “to break the battlefield deadlock”, Healey said, adding that 2023 would be a “decisive year” in the war in Ukraine. He added: That’s why this first package of UK military assistance for 2023 with tanks, artillery, infantry vehicles, ammunition and missiles has Labour’s fullest support. Challenger 2 is a world-class tank and it can help Ukraine retake lost ground and limit the cost in Ukrainian lives. The death of dozens of Russian soldiers in a new year missile strike on a building in occupied eastern Ukraine has not dented Moscow’s resolve almost a year after it first launched its invasion, according to a report. The strike in Makiivka killed 89 people, Russia’s defence ministry has so far conceded. It is the biggest loss of life from a single attack that Moscow has acknowledged since it began its invasion in February. Yet the strike provoked little more than murmurs of discontent in the region of Samara in southwestern Russia, where many of the dead were from, the Wall Street Journal reports. Few people in the region are openly resisting Russia’s war in Ukraine, which the paper writes “highlights an advantage for the Kremlin as it digs in for a long war”. It says: Mr Putin faces little domestic pressure over its costs, even as the body count rises. His decision to mobilise 300,000 men appears to have shored up Russian lines, which were wobbling late last year after a series of defeats, and allowed them to advance for the first time since July, claiming the town of Soledar in eastern Ukraine. Russian state-run polling on the war suggests public support for what Moscow calls its special military operation dropped after President Vladimir Putin ordered a partial mobilisation of troops to fight in Ukraine, before soaring again in November once the mobilisation was declared order. The polling suggests Russians will tolerate another round of mobilisation, according to a former Kremlin official. The UK’s defence ministry has confirmed the announcement by its minister, Ben Wallace, that Britain will send a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine. The Ministry of Defence shared a video of the battle tank “doing what it does best”. The UK’s decision to send Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine is a “calibrated response to Russia’s growing aggression and indiscriminate bombing”, Wallace continues. He says none of the international support for Ukraine is “an attack on Russia, or Nato-orchestrated aggression, let alone a proxy war”. From the outset, President Putin believed his forces would be welcomed with open arms, that Ukrainians wouldn’t fight and that western support would crumble. He has been proved wrong on all counts. Today’s package will help accelerate the conclusion of Putin’s occupation and all its brutality and ensure that in 2023 and beyond, if necessary, Ukraine retains its momentum supported by the international community that is determined more than ever, that Putin’s illegal and unprovoked invasion will fail. Wallace welcomed the decision by the French government to send AMX 10-RC light combat tanks to Ukraine as well as the US’s new weapons package that will include about 50 Bradley fighting vehicles. These contributions are “important in and of themselves” but they represent part of an international effort that “collectively conveys a force multiplier effect”, he said. Wallace says: In December, I told the house that I was developing options to respond to Russia’s continued aggression in a calibrated and determined manner. Today, I can announce the most significant package of combat power to date to accelerate Ukrainian success. This includes a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks with armoured recovery and repair vehicles. We will donate AS-90 guns to Ukraine. This comprises a battery of eight guns of high readiness and two further batteries at varying stages of readiness. Today’s package is an “important increase to Ukrainian capabilities”, he continues. It means they can go from existing to expelling Russian forces from Ukrainian soil. President Putin cannot win, but he’s equally certain he can continue inflicting this wanton violence and human suffering until his forces are ejected from their defensive positions and expelled from the country. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, says it is “notable” that Russia is using forced labour of convicts to manufacture weaponry. Moscow’s appointment of Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff, as its overall commander for the war in Ukraine, in the latest of several major shake-ups of Moscow’s military leadership is a “visible tip of an iceberg of factionalism within the Russian command”, Wallace tells MPs. He says there is no loss of momentum from the international community in its support of Ukraine in 2023, he said. Wallace adds: Quite the opposite. President Putin believed the west would get tired, bored and fragment. Ukraine is continuing to fight. Far from fragmenting, the west is accelerating its efforts. Britain will send a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine to help push back Russia’s invasion, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has confirmed. Speaking in the House of Commons, Wallace said Russia had “singularly failed to break the will of the Ukrainian people” and had “managed to lose significant numbers of generals and commanding officers”. He said: We now would expect a trend back towards a Russian offensive, no matter how much loss of life accompanies it. Ukraine’s allies must “accelerate our collective efforts to dramatically, economically and militarily to keep the pressure” on Vladimir Putin, Wallace said. Announcing what he described as “the most significant package of combat to date to accelerate Ukrainian success”, Wallace said the UK would send a squadron of Challenge 2 tanks with armoured recovery and repair vehicles. The announcement makes the UK the first western power to supply the Ukrainians with main battle tanks, which would be used to help train Ukrainian troops, and will heap further pressure on Germany to approve a wider delivery of the vehicles this week. In a call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Saturday, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, confirmed for the first time that it was Britain’s intention to provide a small number of Challenger 2 tanks to Kyiv. After the phone call, a spokesperson for the prime minister said the offer of Challenger 2 tanks and additional artillery systems was a sign of the UK’s “ambition to intensify our support to Ukraine”. In response, the Kremlin said today that the Challenger 2s “will burn” on the battlefield, and claimed the supplies were an attempt to draw out the conflict. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russia has carried out two mass rocket strikes on Ukraine on Saturday, devastating an apartment block in the south-central city of Dnipro, where at least 40 people have died and scores were injured. Dozens are still missing, city official Gennadiy Korban wrote on Telegram on Monday. 75 people were wounded in the strike, including 14 children, he said. The victims from the attack included a 15-year-old girl, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest nightly address.

A Russian man who reportedly fought for the private mercenary Wagner group has crossed into Norway and requested political asylum, according to Norwegian authorities. Andrey Medvedev, who reportedly served as a high-ranking Wagner group member, has sought shelter in Norway, authorities confirmed to the Associated Press. Tanks arguably decided the first world war, after four years of deadlock, and were indispensable throughout the second. Yet after the initial Russian invasion, one of the surprising features of the war in Ukraine is that it has not been a war of dramatic manoeuvre, but rather only modestly changing fronts. However, with the Russians trying to fortify their positions, ahead perhaps of a renewed attack, Kyiv is under pressure to find a breakthrough this spring. With Nato unwilling to help Ukraine with combat air power, the answer, for now, lies in the heavily armoured tank – which finally, the west is prepared to provide. Britain will send a squadron of 14 Challenger 2 tanks and Poland wants to send another 14 German-made Leopard 2s, if Berlin (as is increasingly looking likely) grants permission. It is a start, but well short of a pre-Christmas Ukrainian demand for 300 tanks and at least 600 fighting vehicles (of which about 90 have been pledged). Only tanks have the “protection, mobility and firepower to maintain momentum even once they make contact with enemy forces in strength”, said Nick Reynolds, a land warfare expert at the Rusi thinktank. The question, however, is what number will give Kyiv chance to mount its own offensive. Read the full analysis by Dan Sabbagh here: President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone today where they discussed the conflict in Ukraine, according to both readouts of the call from both sides. The pair discussed the question of a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine, the Kremlin said, after talks between Moscow and Kyiv’s human rights commissioners in Turkey last week. Putin “drew attention to the destructive line of the Kyiv regime, which relies on the intensification of hostilities with the support of western sponsors, increasing the volume of transferred weapons and military equipment”, the Kremlin’s readout of the call continued. It said the two leaders also discussed the export of Ukrainian grain from Black Sea ports and ways to unblock fertiliser and food exports from Russia. They also discussed the creation of a gas hub in Turkey, as well as the normalisation of Turkish-Syrian relations, it said. Erdoğan’s office said the Turkish president renewed his offer to help mediate an end to the conflict in Ukraine during the call. A statement read: During the call, President Erdoğan reiterated that Turkey is ready to undertake the task of facilitating and mediating for the establishment of a lasting peace between Russia and Ukraine. The Russian-imposed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, has posted to Telegram to say that in total the air defences of the Crimean city repulsed 10 drones from Ukraine this morning. He told residents: The air defence and the Black Sea Fleet shot down ten out of ten [Ukrainian drones] over the sea. No objects either in the city or in the water area were damaged. Everything is calm in the city. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia claimed to annex Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne has posted to its Telegram news channel to report that its correspondents say explosions have been heard in Kherson. More details soon … A Russian man who reportedly fought for the private mercenary Wagner group has crossed into Norway and requested political asylum, according to Norwegian authorities. Andrey Medvedev, who reportedly served as a high-ranking Wagner group member, has sought shelter in Norway, authorities confirmed to the Associated Press. Police in Arctic Norway said last week that a person had illegally entered from Russia by crossing the border. The man, identified only as a foreigner, was detained by border guards after he reportedly visited a private house in the border area and asked for help. The case was handed to Norwegian immigration police and the man was transferred to Oslo, where he was placed in a centre for violators of migration laws. Police in Norway have declined to comment on the case. The independent Russian news website Meduza writes that Medvedev reportedly served as the commander of the unit that included Yevgeny Nuzhin, a Wagner mercenary who was apparently executed by the group with a sledgehammer in a video that surfaced online in November. The UK’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, writes that he has been hit with sanctions by the Russian government. Cleverly writes on Twitter: I’ve been sanctioned by the Russian government. Good. If this is the price for supporting Ukrainian freedom, then I’m happy to be sanctioned #SlavaUkraini The Shakhtar Donetsk president, Rinat Akhmetov, has donated £20.5m of Mykhaylo Mudryk’s Chelsea transfer fee to the Ukrainian war effort. Chelsea beat Arsenal to the signing of Mudryk on Sunday and paraded him at Stamford Bridge, where they beat Crystal Palace 1-0 in the Premier League. Mudryk, who has agreed an eight-and-a-half-year contract, had a Ukraine flag draped over his shoulders. Chelsea have paid an initial €70m (£62m) for the winger with €30m (£26.5m) to follow in add-ons. The money is a boost to Shakhtar, who have been displaced from their home in Donetsk, but Akhmetov – Ukraine’s richest businessman, according to Forbes – has made clear that without his country’s soldiers there would be no football. As such, he has made the financial gesture, launching the Heart of Azovstal project. Azovstal is Akhmetov’s steel plant in Mariupol, where Ukrainian fighters defied weeks of Russian bombardment before the city fell. Azovstal has become a symbol of bravery, endurance and the indomitable spirit of the Ukrainian people. “I want to thank the entire civilised world for helping Ukraine,” Akhmetov said. We can only talk about Ukrainian football because of the Ukrainian army, the Ukrainian people and the tremendous support we have had during this incredibly difficult time. And the only way we can defeat the evil that has come to our homes is by working together. Read the full story here: The UN’s nuclear watchdog is expanding its presence in Ukraine to “help prevent a nuclear accident” during the ongoing conflict, the agency’s head, Rafael Grossi, has said. Grossi is in Ukraine this week to establish the “continuous presence” of nuclear safety and security experts at all the country’s nuclear power facilities, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in its latest update on Ukraine on Friday. He is expected to travel to south Ukraine and Rivne nuclear power plants (NPPs) as well as to the Chornobyl site to launch the missions consisting of two IAEA experts at each of the facilities. The IAEA already has a permanent presence of up to four experts at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and a two-member team will also be stationed at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear plant in the coming days. In a statement, Grossi said: Soon the IAEA will be permanently present at all of Ukraine’s nuclear power facilities, including Chornobyl. This is an important step in our work to help Ukraine during these immensely difficult and challenging times. Our nuclear safety and security experts will monitor the situation at the plants, assess their equipment and other needs, provide technical support and advice, and report their findings to IAEA headquarters. The Kremlin has denied that Russian missile strikes hit residential buildings in Ukraine, after local officials in Dnipro said at least 40 people were killed in Saturday’s attack on a residential block in the Ukrainian south-central city. During a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: The Russian armed forces do not strike residential buildings or social infrastructure facilities. Attacks are made on military targets, either obvious or disguised. Ukraine’s air force has said the residential block was struck by a Russian Kh-22 missile, which is known to be inaccurate and that Kyiv says it has no way of shooting down. Here are some of the latest images we have received showing the aftermath of Russia’s missile attack on a residential block in Dnipro. Germany should take “decisive actions” and send “all sorts of weapons” to Ukraine to help its troops defend themselves against Russia’s invasion, Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. Morawiecki, speaking in parliament, implicitly criticised the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for his reluctance to supply Kyiv with heavier weaponry. He said: I call for decisive actions by the German government. For all sorts of weapons to be delivered. The battle for freedom and our future is raging as we speak ... Tanks must not be left in storehouses, but placed in their hands. A Swedish prosecutor has said there will be no formal investigation into a demonstration last week in Stockholm in which a puppet of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, was hung from its feet, according to a report. Images of the hanged effigy near the Swedish capital’s city hall were published by a pro-Kurdish group, the Rojava Committee of Sweden, who compared the Turkish leader to Italy’s fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini, who was hung upside down after his execution in the final days of the second world war. Sweden’s prime minister condemned the demonstration and said it was a sabotage of Sweden’s bid to join Nato. Turkey summoned Sweden’s ambassador, Staffan Herrstrom, on Thursday and demanded that those responsible for the demonstration be prosecuted. But a Swedish prosecutor, Lucas Eriksson, told the Aftonbladet newspaper: I received the case as defamation, but did not think it could amount to defamation. Therefore, I decided not to initiate a preliminary investigation. In a historic decision in May, Sweden and Finland announced they wished to join the Nato military alliance, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While 28 out of 30 Nato members have ratified their bids, Hungary and Turkey have not, with the latter likely to prove the biggest hurdle. Ankara has so far refused to ratify the applications unless the two countries do more to clamp down on Kurdish groups it regards as terrorists. The number of people killed in Saturday’s Russian missile attack on a residential block in Ukraine’s south-central city of Dnipro has risen to 40, according to a local official. Dozens are still missing, Gennadiy Korban wrote on Telegram. 75 people were wounded in the strike, including 14 children, he said. The victims from the attack included a 15-year-old girl, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest nightly address. Rescue efforts are still under way. Russia and Belarus have begun joint air force drills this morning, triggering fears in Kyiv and the west that Moscow could use its ally to launch a new ground offensive in Ukraine. According to a statement published to the Telegram account of the Belarus ministry of defence, units from Russia’s aerospace forces arrived at the airfields of Belarus late on Sunday night. Shortly after 8am local time the ministry said the planned combat training tasks had begun. Viacheslav Chaus, the Chernihiv governor, has warned residents that there is likely to be an increase in air raid warnings as a result of the exercises. Belarus has described the drills as purely defensive. The country was used as a base for Russian troops to launch their failed assault on Kyiv in February 2022, Russia launched an attack on Ukraine’s south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia overnight, wounding civilians and destroying residential infrastructure, according to regional officials. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the office of president of Ukraine, said “The occupiers launched a rocket attack on the regional centre. The rocket hit next to a five-story building. Five people, including two children aged nine and 15, were injured by glass fragments. The children were hospitalised.” Air defences in Sevastopol in Crimea have been active against Ukrainian drones, according to the Russian-imposed regional governor in the area which Russia annexed in 2014. As of Sunday, Ukraine’s forces have “almost certainly” maintained positions in Soledar, north of Bakhmut, according to the UK ministry of defence. Over the weekend, intense fighting continued in both the Kremina and Bakhmut sectors of the Donbas front, the ministry added. The number of people killed in a Russian missile attack on a residential block in Dnipro has risen to 37, the state broadcaster Suspilne reported Ukrainian officials had confirmed to it. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Sunday latest address that the victims included a 15-year-old girl. At least 73 people were wounded and 39 people had been rescued as of Sunday afternoon. The city government in Dnipro said 43 people were still reported missing. “The chances of saving people now are minimal,” Dnipro’s mayor, Borys Filatov, told Reuters. I think the number of dead will be in the dozens.” Claiming responsibility for the missile strikes across Ukraine, Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that it achieved its goal. A ministry statement posted on Telegram said: “All designated targets have been hit. The goal of the attack has been achieved.” However, it did not mention the attack on the Dnipro residential building. President Vladimir Putin has told Russian state television that what he calls the “special military operation” in Ukraine has gained positive momentum. “The dynamic is positive,” he told Rossiya 1 state television. “Everything is developing within the framework of the plan of the ministry of defence and the general staff.” German defence minister Christine Lambrecht on Monday announced ger resignation. Her decision to step down comes as Germany is under pressure to approve an increase in international military support for Kyiv, and Germany’s defence capabilities have been called into question after several Puma infantry tanks were put out of service during a recent military drill. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you for the next few hours to continue our live coverage. The Kremlin said on Monday that the tanks Britain plans to send to Ukraine “will burn”, warning the west that supplying a new round of more advanced weapons to Ukraine would not change the course of the war. “They are using [Ukraine] as a tool to achieve their anti-Russian goals,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said when asked about the British tanks, Reuters reports. “These tanks are burning and will burn just like the rest,” Peskov said. Britain said on Saturday it would send 14 of its Challenger 2 main battle tanks as well as other advanced artillery support to Ukraine in the coming weeks. Peskov said the new supplies from countries like Britain and Poland would not change the situation on the ground. The Kremlin spokesperson also, according to Russian-owned news agency RIA, denied that there was any conflict between Russia’s ministry of defence and the Wagner mercenary group. RIA posted to Telegram a report which said: The “conflict” between the ministry of defence and Wagner exists only in the information space, Peskov said. He noted that everyone is doing a common thing – fighting for the motherland. Ukrainian state broadcaster Suspilne has reported on Telegram that the death toll from the weekend’s Dnipro missile attack has risen to 37. It reports that local authorities have confirmed the higher number to it. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, has today resigned, she said in a statement on Monday, the culmination of growing scepticism about her ability to bring the German army into shape against the backdrop of the Ukraine war. Reuters reports Lambrecht, a member of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic party (SPD), said in the statement: “Today I asked the chancellor to dismiss me from the office of federal minister of defence.” Her decision to step down comes as Germany is under pressure to approve an increase in international military support for Kyiv, and Germany’s defence capabilities have been called into question after several Puma infantry tanks were put out of service during a recent military drill. Viacheslav Chaus, the Chernihiv governor, has warned residents that there is likely to be an increase in air raid warnings as a result of the joint air exercises being carried out by Russia and Belarus. In a message posted to Telegram, Chaus said: 125 explosions on the outskirts of six border settlements of Chernihiv region over the past week. The enemy uses mortars, grenade launchers, BM-21 Grad rocket artillery. Important! From 16 January to 1 February, a joint flight and tactical exercise will be held with the aviation units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation. The number of air alarms on the territory of Chernihiv oblast and the country in general may increase significantly. Don’t ignore any threat message. Chernihiv has borders with both Belarus to Russia to the north. Russian news agency Interfax is reporting that air defences in Sevastopol have been active against Ukrainian drones, according to the Russian-imposed regional governor. Interfax reports. “An attack by drones again. Air defence systems shot down a UAV over the sea in the direction of Belbek ,” [Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev] wrote in his telegram channel. Interfax adds the governor also reported one downed drone over the bay. Sevastopol is the largest city in the Crimean peninsula, an area of Ukraine which Russia claimed to annex in 2014. Belbek is an airfield north-west of the city which has previously been a target for Ukraine. In Germany, Die Welt reports that at a demonstration in Berlin on Sunday, the flag of the chiefly unrecognised self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic was seen, a report which is being picked up by Russian state media Tass. Martin Heller writes for Die Welt: The content of a video of the demonstration march in Berlin on Sunday, with which thousands commemorated Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, is now causing a stir. In the video of the demonstration, left-wing demonstrators - white skin, accent-free German and mostly male - chant anti-Western slogans: “Mali, Donbass, Gaza City: finally flatten the West!”. A banner from a “communist organization” carried in front of the group reads: “The main enemy is at home”. At the same event, international observers noticed a flag from the “Donetsk People’s Republic” illegally proclaimed by Russia. This also causes discussions on the internet. Suspilne, the Ukrainian state broadcaster, is reporting that three people were killed in the Kherson region yesterday. In a message posted to Telegram, it stated: On 15 January, the Russian army shelled the territory of the Kherson region 90 times with artillery, anti-aircraft guns, mortars and tanks. Three people died, 14 were injured, said the head of the region Yaroslav Yanushevych. The claims have not been independently verified. Kherson is one of the regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the office of president of Ukraine, has given more details of an attack of Zaporizhzhia in a Telegram post. He writes: The occupiers launched a rocket attack on the regional centre. The rocket hit next to a five-story building. Five people, including 2 children aged 9 and 15, were injured by glass fragments. The children were hospitalised. In the building itself, the windows were broken, the supporting structures were not damaged. He added that in a separate attack: The rocket hit the territory of a business. A fire broke out on the spot. There is no information about the victims. Rescuers are working on the spot. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian state-owned news agency is reporting claims from the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) that in the last week two people died and four were injured by Ukrainian fire into the territory which the LPR occupies and which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Tass also reported the claim that 52 houses and three civil infrastructure facilities were destroyed and damaged, including one educational institution, in the attacks. Tass said that the claims, which have not been independently verified, were reported by a representative of the so-called “Joint centre for control and coordination of issues related to war crimes of Ukraine”. Prior to Russia’s claim to have annexed the Luhansk region, the LPR, which was formed in 2014, was recognised as a legitimate authority by only three UN member states: Russia, Syria and North Korea. Reuters reports that a Ukrainian vessel carrying peas was grounded in Istanbul’s Bosphorus strait on Monday, and traffic in the strait was suspended. No damage was reported. The joint coordination centre in Istanbul, which runs the UN-brokered Black Sea grain deal operations, said at the weekend the ship was travelling from Pivdennyi – a commercial seaport in the Ukrainian city of Yuzhne, near Odesa – to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Mersin. Several tugs were among vessels sent to provide assistance to the ship, the coastguard authority said. This is Martin Belam taking over the blog in London. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russia launched an attack on Ukraine’s south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia overnight, wounding civilians and destroying residential infrastructure, according to regional officials. Oleksandr Starukh, the Zaporizhzhia regional state administration head, said Russia launched a rocket attack on the regional centre in a Telegram post at about 1am local time. The enemy launched a rocket attack on the regional centre and suburbs. There is destruction of civil, residential and industrial infrastructure. Information was received about several lightly wounded. All relevant services are on site.” The secretary of the Zaporizhzhia city council, Anatoly Kurtev, confirmed three people were taken to hospital. Russians fired at our city again. As a result of the night attack, people were injured. There are damaged houses. Three people were transported to hospitals. Among them are two children aged nine and 15.” As of Sunday, Ukraine’s forces have “almost certainly” maintained positions in Soledar, north of Bakhmut, according to the UK ministry of defence. Over the weekend, intense fighting continued in both the Kremina and Bakhmut sectors of the Donbas front, the ministry added. “Overall, the UAF continue to gradually advance their front line east on the edge of Kremina town,” the report read. “Over the last six weeks, both Russia and Ukraine have achieved hard-fought but limited gains in different sectors. “In these circumstances, a key operational challenge for both sides is to generate formations of uncommitted, capable troops which can exploit the tactical successes to create operational breakthroughs.” The US military has launched an expanded, more sophisticated training programme of Ukrainian forces that is focused on large-scale combat and designed to bolster Ukraine’s ability to take back territory from Russian forces, the Pentagon’s top general said on Sunday. Gen Mark A. Milley, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said the training had begun on Sunday at the Grafenwoehr training area in Germany and will continue for five or six weeks, according to a Washington Post report. About 500 soldiers will reportedly go through the initial version of training, focused on what the military calls combined-arms warfare, in which tanks, artillery, combat vehicles and other weapons are “layered to maximise the violence they inflict”, according to the Post. We want the Ukrainians to have a capability to successfully defend their country,” Milley said. “Ukraine is doing nothing more than defending itself, and they are trying to liberate Russian-occupied Ukraine.” “It’ll take a bit of time,” Milley added. “Five, six, seven, eight weeks, who knows. We’ll see what happens here. But in terms of the criticality of it, the need is now.” Nato’s secretary general said Ukraine could expect more deliveries of heavy weapons from western countries soon. The recent pledges for heavy warfare equipment are important – and I expect more in the near future,” Jens Stoltenberg told Germany’s Handelsblatt daily on Sunday. Western allies will consider sending battle tanks to Kyiv ahead of a meeting in Ramstein in Germany on Friday, where governments are expected to announce their latest pledges of military support. Zelenskiy has pleaded for more western weaponry, saying that Russian “terror” could be stopped only on the battlefield. Earlier this month, France, Germany and the US respectively promised French AMX-10 RC light tanks, 40 German Marder infantry vehicles, and 50 Bradley fighting vehicles. However, pressure is growing on the allies to go further and agree to delivery of battle tanks. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, pledged on Saturday to provide 14 Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine, making it the first western country to supply the heavy tanks Kyiv has been calling for. Russia’s embassy in Britain warned that “bringing tanks to the conflict zone … will only serve to intensify combat operations, generating more casualties, including among the civilian population”. As Russian and Belarusian forces conduct joint air force drills today in a show of cooperation, it appears to be business as usual for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader earlier told Rossiya 1 state television that what he calls the “special military operation” in Ukraine has gained positive momentum and is going according to plan. The dynamic is positive. Everything is developing within the framework of the plan of the ministry of defence and the general staff.” Putin said he hoped soldiers would deliver more wins after Russia claimed control of the eastern Ukrainian saltmining town of Soledar – a claim disputed by Kyiv. Belarus’s ministry of defence has just issued this statement regarding its joint air force drills with Russia this morning. Today, a joint tactical flight exercise of the aviation units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation, which are part of the aviation component of the regional grouping of troops (forces), has started.” The ministry added that the main goal of the exercise is “to increase operational compatibility in the joint performance of combat training tasks”. Russia and Belarus have begun joint air force drills this morning, triggering fears in Kyiv and the west that Moscow could use its ally to launch a new ground offensive in Ukraine. According to a statement published to the Telegram account of the Belarus ministry of defence, units from Russia’s aerospace forces arrived at the airfields of Belarus late on Sunday night. Shortly after 8am local time the ministry said the planned combat training tasks had begun. A subdivision of the 120th Separate Guards Mechanised Brigade, as part of the coordination of the Belarusian and Russian parts of the regional grouping of forces, began to carry out a number of combat training tasks. After the march to the 227th combined-arms training ground, the military personnel will begin to conduct control classes in combat training subjects.” Minsk earlier said the drills are defensive. However, the ongoing buildup of Russian troops in Belarus, combined with a flurry of military activity in the country, is an echo to what was happening there just before Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine, when Moscow used the country as a springboard to launch the attack. Together with Moscow, Minsk has also been bolstering the drills with weaponry and military equipment. Unofficial Telegram military monitoring channels have been reporting a series of fighters, helicopters and military transport planes coming to Belarus since the start of the year – eight fighters and four cargo planes on Sunday alone. The Belarusian defence ministry said only that “units” of Russia’s air forces have been arriving in Belarus. During the tactical flight exercise, all airfields and training grounds of the Air Force and Air Defence Forces of the Armed Forces of Belarus will be involved,” the ministry said in a statement as cited by Reuters. The situation on Belarus’s southern border – the border with Ukraine – was “not very calm”, and Ukraine has been “provoking” Belarus, said Pavel Muraveyko, first deputy state secretary of the Belarusian security council, according to a post on the Belarusian defence ministry’s Telegram app on Sunday. We’re maintaining restraint and patience, keeping our gunpowder dry,” Muraveyko said. “We have the necessary set of forces and means that will respond to any manifestations of aggression or a terrorist threat on our territory.” Ukraine has continuously warned of possible attacks from Belarus and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week that the country must be ready at its border with Belarus. The Kremlin has denied that it has been pressuring the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, to take a more active role in the conflict in Ukraine. Minsk has said it will not enter the war. A series of haunting images show the aftermath of Sunday’s missile attack on a residential block in Dnipro. The number of people killed in a Russian missile attack on a residential block in Dnipro has risen to 35, according to Ukrainian officials. Dnipro’s regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, confirmed 35 people were killed in the attack in an update shared to Telegram about 8.30am on Monday. The search and rescue operation in Dnipro has been going on for almost 40 hours. At night, rescuers pulled out several more dead from under the rubble of a high-rise building destroyed by a Russian missile. At that time, the enemy attack claimed the lives of 35 residents of the building. Among them are two children. 39 people were saved, 75 were injured. Among the injured are 14 children. The fate of another 35 residents of the building is unknown. The search for people under the rubble continues. Dnipro’s mayor, Borys Filatov, told Reuters: The chances of saving people now are minimal. I think the number of dead will be in the dozens.” Claiming responsibility for the missile strikes across Ukraine, Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that it achieved its goal. A ministry statement posted on Telegram said: “All designated targets have been hit. The goal of the attack has been achieved.” However, it did not mention the attack on the Dnipro residential building. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned the Russian people’s “cowardly silence” over the attack, noting that Ukraine had received messages of sympathy from around the world over “this terror.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. Rescuers continue to comb the rubble of a nine-story apartment building that was destroyed by a Russian strike in Dnipro on Sunday, as the death toll from the attack climbs to 35. Russia and Belarus will begin joint air force drills on Monday, which have triggered fears in Kyiv and the west that Moscow could use its ally to launch a new ground offensive in Ukraine. Minsk says the drills are “purely defensive in nature” though Ukraine has warned of possible attacks from its neighbour to the north. If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: The number of people killed in a Russian missile attack on a residential block in Dnipro has risen to 35, according to Ukrainian officials. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest address that “the list of the dead includes 30 people, including one child – a girl, she was 15 years old”. At least 73 people were wounded and 39 people had been rescued as of Sunday afternoon. The city government in Dnipro said 43 people were still reported missing. “The chances of saving people now are minimal,” Dnipro’s mayor, Borys Filatov, told Reuters.

Battle tanks from German industrial reserves wanted by Ukraine will not be ready to be delivered until 2024. The warning from arms manufacturer Rheinmetall will dampen Kyiv’s hopes that the UK’s promise to deliver Challenger 2 tanks would encourage other European nations to swiftly follow suit. “Even if the decision to send our Leopard tanks to Kyiv came tomorrow, the delivery would take until the start of next year,” Rheinmetall’s chief executive, Armin Papperger, told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. The UK prime minister has confirmed the country will provide 14 of its Challenger 2 main battle tanks and other advanced artillery support to Ukraine in the coming weeks. Downing Street said Rishi Sunak made the pledge during a call on Saturday morning with Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a sign of the UK’s “ambition to intensify our support to Ukraine”. Russia’s embassy in Britain said the move would only “intensify” the conflict. The UK foreign secretary has said “now is the time to accelerate and go further and faster” in giving Ukraine the support it needs. In a column for British tabloid the Sun on Sunday, James Cleverly writes that the Russian army is on the defensive and morale among its troops is pitiful, blaming the “shambolic state of Russian military logistics”. Nato’s secretary general said Ukraine could expect more deliveries of heavy weapons from western countries soon. “The recent pledges for heavy warfare equipment are important – and I expect more in the near future,” Jens Stoltenberg told Germany’s Handelsblatt daily on Sunday. Western allies will consider sending battle tanks to Kyiv ahead of a meeting in Ramstein in Germany next Friday where governments are expected to announce their latest pledges of military support. Belarus’s security council said on Sunday that joint air force drills with Russia, due to start on Monday, were purely defensive in nature and would focus on reconnaissance missions and how to thwart a potential attack. “The exercise is purely defensive in nature,” said Pavel Muraveyko, first deputy state secretary of the Belarusian security council, according to a post on the Belarusian defence ministry’s Telegram app on Sunday. “It will be a set of measures to prepare our and Russian aviation to carry out the relevant combat missions.” For any updates or feedback you wish to share, please feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/sep/05/what-policies-will-liz-truss-pursue-as-britain-new-prime-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-05T11:43:34Z","webTitle":"What policies will Liz Truss pursue as Britain’s new prime minister?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/05/what-policies-will-liz-truss-pursue-as-britain-new-prime-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/sep/05/what-policies-will-liz-truss-pursue-as-britain-new-prime-minister","fields":{"headline":"What policies will Liz Truss pursue as Britain’s new prime minister?","bodyText":"The policy focus of a Truss prime ministership will, inevitably, be largely a work in progress, given she is taking office amid a hugely turbulent economic period. But during a long leadership campaign the new PM has set out a series of proposals and plans for government: Taxation and cost of living Truss’s clear economic priority is to cut taxes, a move she insists will reboot a stalled economy and help people with soaring energy bills. She has promised to reverse the recent increase in national insurance and to cancel a scheduled rise in corporation tax, at a combined cost of about £30bn a year. Truss’s team has also mooted the idea of slashing VAT by 5% or cutting income tax to help household budgets. While Truss has said her plans would be paid for by fiscal headroom and delaying the repayment of Covid-related debts, critics have argued she will need to borrow considerable sums, at potentially expensive rates, at some cost to the economy. One option could be to expand a windfall tax on energy firms, but Truss has said she dislikes this. There is also considerable scepticism about a tax cut-based response to the energy costs crisis, which would disproportionately benefit high earners and do nothing for those reliant on pensions or benefits. Truss has not ruled out more direct help over energy bills, but has refused to say explicity what this might be, and talked about her distaste for “handouts”. It is a position that is about to be tested against economic reality. Climate and green energy While Truss has stressed her commitment to the UK’s existing net zero target, and her team insists she will focus on renewable energy, some on the greener side of the Conservative party are becoming worried about her priorities. One of Truss’s few direct policies on the cost of living would be to suspend green levies on energy bills, which are used to invest in renewable schemes. She opposes onshore wind, and described seeing solar farms on farmland as “one of the most depressing sights” of modern Britain. In contrast, she supports fracking for shale gas and reportedly wants to see a push for new drilling in the North Sea, and has backed a major expansion of nuclear power. She has not talked about efforts to reduce energy consumption, such as subsidising insulation for homes. Health and social care Truss has received relatively little scrutiny over her plans for the NHS and care, especially given the crisis in the health service, and the widespread expectation things will get much worse into the winter. While she remains committed to existing plans to support the NHS, there is the issue that Truss has promised to reverse the national insurance rise aimed at providing cash firstly to help clear the Covid-exacerbated backlog of NHS procedures, and in the longer term to pay for better social care. Much of the problems with delayed ambulances are because hospital beds are filled with people unable to access social care. Truss will need a coherent plan, and soon. Levelling up This is another area on which Truss said relatively little during the leadership campaign but could increase in significance as she faces the country, and her own MPs, as prime minister. Levelling up was Boris Johnson’s self-stated defining purpose, and while Truss has said she remains committed to this agenda, it is unclear whether she would back this with significant spending. Truss has said she will level up “in a Conservative way”, seen as a focus more on deregulation and tax cuts. One of the reasons Johnson was popular with many “red wall” Tory MPs was that they could point to specific, Whitehall-financed infrastructure projects, whether a new local bypass or a revamped high street. If Truss was to take this away, it could create disquiet. Immigration and home affairs During the campaign, Truss has promised to double down on the policy of deporting asylum seekers and other immigrants to Rwanda, and to seek other countries who will take them. It remains to be seen how feasible this is, or if it would have any impact on the numbers of people crossing the Channel by unofficial means, even if some did depart. Truss is likely to link any failure to remove people to the continued jurisdiction of the European court of human rights. While removing the UK entirely from its oversight would be complex and tricky, she is likely to push ahead with plans for a so-called UK bill of rights, with fewer protections for asylum seekers and others. Culture wars Truss is more of a keen amateur culture warrior than a die-hard aficionado, keeping the Tory faithful happy at hustings events with passing swipes at “woke” culture and trans rights. However, if as tipped she appoints Suella Braverman as home secretary and Kemi Badenoch to education, the temperature could rise considerably. Culture war issues tend to be more focused on seeking debate and political dividing lines than actual policies, but particularly in education it could lead to changes in approach, for example on trans rights and free speech. Foreign policy and Brexit Wider foreign policy is likely to be more of the same, given Truss led on this under Johnson, so expect more vehement support for Ukraine, plus occasional gaffes such as her recent refusal to say whether the French president, Emmanuel Macron, a neighbour and close ally, is a “friend or foe”. Truss has made much of her toughness over the Northern Ireland protocol, and her camp has hinted she could trigger article 16, the emergency procedure clause in the post-Brexit deal with the EU, within days of entering No 10. But with so many other crises to face, and the leadership contest over, Truss might decide a potential trade war is not what she needs as well."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/feb/06/de-ageing-on-screen-ai-artificial-intelligence-film","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-06T15:19:07Z","webTitle":"‘We’re going through a big revolution’: how AI is de-ageing stars on screen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/06/de-ageing-on-screen-ai-artificial-intelligence-film","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/feb/06/de-ageing-on-screen-ai-artificial-intelligence-film","fields":{"headline":"‘We’re going through a big revolution’: how AI is de-ageing stars on screen","bodyText":"Craggy, grey-haired and 80 years old, Harrison Ford might seem a bit old to don his brown Fedora-style hat or crack his whip as Indiana Jones. But a trailer for his upcoming film Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny offers a flashback to Indy in his swashbuckling glory days. “That is my actual face at that age,” the actor explained on CBS’s The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. “They have this artificial intelligence (AI) programme. It can go through every foot of film that Lucasfilm owns because I did a bunch of movies for them and they have all this footage including film that wasn’t printed: stock. They could mine it from where the light is coming from, the expression. But that’s my actual face. Then I put little dots on my face and I say the words and they make it. It’s fantastic.” Having discovered the secret of eternal youth, Ford joked: “That’s what I see when I look in the mirror now.” He is not the only actor to get a digital facelift with an assist from AI. Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and other cast members will play younger versions of themselves in Here, directed by Robert Zemeckis, thanks to a tool that the AI company Metaphysic says can create “high-resolution photorealistic faceswaps and de-ageing effects on top of actors’ performances live and in real time without the need for further compositing or VFX work”. Metaphysic’s website proclaims: “We are world leaders in creating AI generated content that looks real” and suggests: “Use AI to create your own hyperreal avatar”. The company has just struck a deal with the Creative Artists Agency “to develop generative AI tools and services for talent”, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Just as the buzzy AI chatbot ChatGPT threatens to upend journalism, speechwriting and school essays, so AI could turn digital de-ageing from something that requires many months of highly skilled artists to something that many people can do in their bedrooms. And as the technology becomes ever more sophisticated, there are fears that deepfake technology could fall into the wrong hands and be weaponised. Olcun Tan, a German-born visual effects supervisor based in Los Angeles, reflects: “We’re going through a big revolution. This is like the invention of nuclear power. This is a big deal. It’s underestimated and overlooked. Currently, it feels like, ‘Oh, it’s a toy, it’s awesome, look what it can do,’ but this is just the start of a big change in our economic structure because it will do a lot more than normal humans can do.” De-ageing has met mixed results so far. Examples include Brad Pitt in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Jeff Bridges in Tron: Legacy, Robert Downey Jr in Captain America: Civil War, Michael Douglas in Ant Man, Kurt Russell in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, Will Smith in Gemini Man and Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill in various instalments of Star Wars. One of the more impressive was Samuel L Jackson who, in 2019’s Captain Marvel, shed about 25 years and featured in the entire story rather than just a cameo. “The artists meticulously compared Jackson to how he looked in his mid-90s-era movies to see precisely how skin would hang off his face or how light would hit his cheeks,” according to the Wrap website. Why bother? Better to have a de-aged Harrison Ford, some argue, than to have a different actor playing one of his indelible roles, as happened when he took on the young Han Solo in Solo: A Star Wars Story. Many fans found it a jarring experience. Drexel Heard, a political activist who has worked in Hollywood, says: “We’re getting to the point where viewers want to see that same person where it’s not going to take them out of the moment. Because our brains automatically go, ‘Well, that’s not the same person. Who’s that actor? Will that actor be better than the actor that we are watching right now?’ Nobody wants to have to go through that as an audience member.” Not everyone sees it that way, however. Tan, who uses an AI-assisted tool called Shapeshifter, says: “It’s time for the old farts to make space. It’s annoying. There’s no reason for somebody to be in his 80s and still look like in his 30s. There’s no point. What it does is create a culture of recycling. “It’s like Mickey Mouse going on forever. You have a Mickey Mouse and it doesn’t need any water, it doesn’t need any food, it doesn’t need a contract. They can monetise it any way they want. It doesn’t need to sleep. It works 24 hours if they want in 10 copies or 30 copies simultaneously. What’s happening right now is these actors are becoming more that. They become like a brand.” Tan adds: “In Harrison Ford’s case, the guy did of course Indiana Jones but there could be easily a new Indiana Jones introduced, a next generation. Why even recycle all that stuff constantly? Because it’s a sure thing for money making, obviously, but the question arises, what does it do to our society if you have always the same idols being recreated on the screen? It’s like we got stuck somehow in the past and we don’t want to look into the future.” Martin Scorsese’s 2019 movie The Irishman knocked four decades off Al Pacino, then 79, and Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, both 76, but fell into the “uncanny valley” trap of being distracting, eerie and not quite lifelike enough. If the test of visual effects is that you shouldn’t notice them, The Irishman failed. And for all the digital wizardry, the actors’ bodies betrayed the ravages of time. Joe Pavlo, an Emmy award-winning visual effects artist based in London, says: “Marty should have come to me. I would have told him you can’t do that with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci – they’re just too damn famous and everybody knows them. If you’re going to do it, do it with unknown actors and age them and get a young guy and age them. “Bless his heart but Robert De Niro moves like a guy in his 70s. An old person doesn’t move like a young person. They don’t walk the same. Their mannerisms are not the same. There’s all kinds of problems but people will figure this out and it’s just going to be another tool for film-making. A tool for film-making can be used by someone very artistically and with great vision or it can be used hamfistedly as a novelty and a gimmick. Building on Industrial Light and Magic’s de-ageing work in The Irishman, a fan rapidly created a deepfake version that was released on YouTube and widely praised as an improvement. Pavlo, who uses AI tools to save time on boring and mundane tasks, adds: “The technology is just getting better and better. You can see stuff falling apart a little bit and not being perfect but, every time I dive into it again, I find that it’s improved exponentially since the last time I looked at it.” Asked if he is worried about a Pandora’s Box of deepfakes being opened, Pavlo notes that AI software is also used to detect deepfakes with high accuracy. “AI technology is the disease and the cure.” Tan, however, has misgivings. He says: “AI is in a sense cool and fun in the beginning but then you realise it’s actually dangerous. It can imitate people and make them do things on screen and then you can have a whole societal belief that those people are disgraced for whatever they did on screen and in reality it wasn’t even them. It’s just a ploy to wind people up. “You see it in warfare, which I think Russia tried with Ukraine. There was this use that had the Ukrainian president saying they were giving up and soldiers should put their weapons down. That was done with AI. A simple tool which doesn’t look dangerous suddenly can be very dangerous because now you are affecting reality with it.” It has the makings of an ethical quagmire and government regulators are struggling to catch up. One source in the visual effects industry, who did not wished to be named, writes in an email: “In the hands of well-meaning people, I don’t think it crosses an ethical line since we’ve been doing this manually with makeup or CG for decades already and it can be a really effective part of storytelling. “However, the issue is when it becomes so accessible that it’s used by less scrupulous people and when society hasn’t caught up in terms of understanding how to deal with it. Where the skill required was a deterrent, now anyone can make people say or do what they want.” The source adds: “You can see this already with the inception of deepfakes for celebrity pornography. The ability for the average person to realise if something is fake is always years behind the state of the art in technology, and it’s ripe for dissemination of misinformation. The last few years have shown how much fake news (often foreign state-sponsored efforts) affects society, even just as text. “How will we cope when we can’t trust what we see or hear? How will we be able to trust that a celebrity didn’t say something heinous years ago versus it just being a poorly shot cellphone video? Or conversely, how would we hold people accountable when they can just pretend it’s all fake?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/03/greens-give-crucial-support-to-labors-climate-bill-for-43-emissions-reduction-by-2030","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T10:49:45Z","webTitle":" Labor’s climate bill set to pass with support from Greens and Bridget Archer ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/03/greens-give-crucial-support-to-labors-climate-bill-for-43-emissions-reduction-by-2030","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/03/greens-give-crucial-support-to-labors-climate-bill-for-43-emissions-reduction-by-2030","fields":{"headline":" Labor’s climate bill set to pass with support from Greens and Bridget Archer ","bodyText":"The House of Representatives is moving towards passage of Labor’s bill enshrining emissions reductions targets for 2030 and 2050 after the Greens signalled they would support the legislation and Liberal MP Bridget Archer confirmed she would cross the floor. After weeks of negotiations, the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, confirmed on Wednesday his party would back the Albanese government’s legislation in both chambers, and king-making Senate independent, David Pocock, confirmed his priority was “getting a target locked in and legislated”. The legislation will pass the lower house on Thursday morning before moving to the Senate during the next parliamentary sitting fortnight in September. Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday the measure – an opening salvo in ending Australia’s decade long climate wars – was “as important a piece of legislation as will come before this parliament”. Despite losing a swathe of heartland metropolitan seats to climate-focussed independents at the election on 21 May, the Coalition has resolved to oppose the bill. But Archer confirmed on Wednesday night she would support Labor’s primary legislation, but not the consequential amendments bill. Archer told the chamber climate change was an issue that “transcends age, gender, political beliefs and socioeconomic circumstances” and she had been approached from all types of constituents – including a Baptist minister, business leaders and pensioners of the left and right – “all of who believe this is not an issue of left or right”. At the National Press Club on Wednesday Bandt said the Greens would support Labor’s legislation. He said the bill now ensured the 43% emissions reduction target was a floor and not a ceiling, and ambition could be ratcheted up over time. He said Labor had bolstered its initial proposal by ensuring government agencies would have to consider climate targets before funding new projects, and had clarified the role the Climate Change Authority would play in providing expert advice. But while supporting the legislation, he foreshadowed further discussions with Labor about the safeguards mechanism, and about inserting a climate trigger in environmental regulations, which would make it hard for new fossil fuel developments to secure approval. “The fight begins now to get Labor to stop opening coal and gas mines,” the Greens leader said. Bandt vowed to “comb the entire budget for any public money … going to coal and gas corporations and amend the budget to remove them”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Albanese told reporters in Canberra that Labor had agreed to amendments that were “consistent with the policy we took to the election”, but had not committed to the Greens to consider a climate trigger in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act. He ruled out using the safeguards mechanism to block new fossil fuel projects. Albanese welcomed the Greens’ decision that “they are prepared to vote for the legislation” even though some of their amendments were not accepted. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said it was “a good day for Australia”. “A good day therefore [for] the economy, a good day for the future,” he said. “The climate wars may not be over, but they are suddenly in retreat, under this government.” In question time, Albanese said Labor was “another step closer to delivering our mandate”, deflecting Coalition attacks about power prices by accusing them of “opposition to the cheapest form of energy, renewables” and support for “the most expensive solutions – nuclear power”. Earlier, Bandt claimed that Labor’s position on new coal and gas projects was “untenable ultimately”, citing ambition for greater action from Australia’s “closest security allies” including the US and Pacific nations. “This is round one,” he said. “There is three years of this parliament and there are a number of points coming up where we will push to stop opening coal and gas.” Bandt cited the review of the EPBC Act, which he said “needs a climate trigger”. “An environment law that allows projects to go ahead, even if it makes climate change worse and destroys the environment is an environment law with a massive hole in the middle of it.” The crossbench believed it has secured government agreement for a range of other amendments including: an objects clause in the legislation, a statutory review in five years of the act’s effectiveness, and clearer reporting obligations for the minister and Climate Change Authority. Bowen said the government had “good conversations across the parliament with people of goodwill” and accepted changes that “improve the bill” and implement Labor’s mandate. Others had “completely ruled themselves out of any discussions with the government”, he said. On Tuesday the Coalition resolved to oppose the bill, reasoning that Labor had already increased Australia’s emission reduction obligations under the Paris agreement, and the opposition parties could determine a new target closer to the next election. Independent MPs including Sophie Scamps, Kylea Tink, Kate Chaney and Allegra Spender have voiced support for the bill – but it will be the Jacqui Lambie Network and David Pocock’s votes in the Senate which Labor will need to pass it. The independent MP for Fowler, Dai Le, has indicated she would abstain in the climate bill vote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/10/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-229-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-10T14:09:59Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 229 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/10/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-229-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/10/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-229-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 229 of the invasion","bodyText":"At least 11 people have died and 64 have been wounded in a wave of Russian missile strikes across Ukraine, according to Ukrainian police. Authorities in Kyiv said eight people had died and 24 were injured in a Russian missile strike on the capital’s Shevchenkivskyi district this morning. Lviv, Kherson, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv were also among the areas targeted. Barely hours after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, denounced the bridge attack on Saturday as an “act of terrorism” that he blamed on Ukraine’s secret services, missiles slammed into the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, during morning rush hour, striking targets including a popular tourist bridge and a major road junction. According to Ukraine’s military, by mid-morning on Monday, 75 missiles had been launched, of which it claimed over 40 had been intercepted. In an update in the midst of the attack, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russia had fired dozens of missiles as well as Iranian-made kamikaze drones, adding that Russia’s main targets appeared to be energy infrastructure and civilians. He said his country was “dealing with terrorists”. Speaking outside the presidential office near where some of the missiles hit, Zelenskiy accused Russia of “deliberately choosing such a time, such goals, in order to cause as much harm as possible”, he said. Putin has threatened a “harsh response” if attacks continue against Russia. In televised remarks after the wave of attacks, Putin once again blamed Ukraine for the Kerch bridge attack, describing it as a “terrorist attack aimed at the destruction of civil critical important infrastructure of Russia”. Russia had launched long-range missile attacks against Ukraine’s energy, military and communications infrastructure today in retaliation for the bridge attack, he said. “It is simply impossible to leave crimes of this kind unanswered,” he said. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said 11 infrastructure facilities in eight regions and in the capital, Kyiv, had been damaged in the Russian strikes. The building housing the German consulate in Kyiv was hit by a Russian missile strike, according to a German foreign ministry spokesperson. Although the consulate was housed in the building, it has not been operational since February. Romania’s foreign minister, Bogdan Aurescu, said a Russian missile strike on Kyiv landed 850 metres from the Romanian embassy. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, made an immediate appeal to the west for the supply of increased air defence systems. Zelenskiy said he had agreed with German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, an urgent meeting of G7 leaders in response. Kuleba has cut short a tour of African nations to return to Kyiv. The G7 will hold a call on Tuesday. In an urgent round of diplomatic calls, Scholz, French president Emmanuel Macron, and the UK’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, all reiterated their support for Ukraine. Alexander De Croo said the bombardment of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv and of civilian targets in other Ukrainian cities on Monday was “a reprehensible act by Russia”. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, condemned the “horrific and indiscriminate” missile attacks on civilian targets. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said he was “deeply shocked” by the Russian air strikes. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said she was “shocked and appalled by the vicious attack on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. Russia once again has shown to the world what it stands for – it is terror and brutality.” Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, unequivocally labelled Monday’s actions by Russia as war crimes. President Zelenskiy said Ukraine “counts on Britain’s leadership” after a phone call with the UK prime minister, Liz Truss, on Monday. Zelenskiy’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he also spoke with his UK counterpart, James Cleverly, who assured him of Britain’s unwavering support of Ukraine. Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, is among authorities in the areas struck to appeal to residents to try to limit electric consumption to preserve supplies. The International Committee of the Red Cross has paused its operations in Ukraine for security reasons, according to a spokesperson. The BBC’s Hugo Bachega ducked for cover during a live broadcast which was interrupted as rockets rained down on Kyiv. Belarus leader, Alexander Lukashenko, said Belarus and Russia would deploy a joint military task force on the country’s western borders in response to what he called an aggravation of tension. Moldova’s foreign minister, Nicu Popescu, summoned Russia’s ambassador to explain why missiles launched from the Black Sea into Ukraine crossed Moldova’s airspace. Poland’s border guard said that the electricity has failed on Ukraine’s side of border crossings at Medyka and Korczowa, but that they are still working normally. The crossings border Ukraine’s Lviv region, where there are reported power outages after Russian strikes on critical infrastructure earlier this morning. A power line that was cut by shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been restored, according to the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). “Engineers restored external power to Zaporizhzhya NPP today, a day after the facility lost the connection to this last remaining operating power line due to shelling — enabling ZNPP to start switching off its emergency diesel generators,” the IAEA said. NEW The president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, will visit Moscow on Tuesday to meet Vladimir Putin, UAE state media reported. Mohammed “will discuss with President Putin the friendly relations between the UAE and Russia along with a number of regional and international issues and developments of common interest”, the UAE’s state-owned news agency WAM said. Vladimir Putin may meet Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, at a summit in Kazakhstan this week, the Kremlin said. Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters it was “possible” the pair could discuss a Turkish proposal to host talks between Russia and the west on Ukraine. Denmark’s Baltic Sea island of Bornholm, located near the presumed sabotage attack on Nord Stream’s gas pipelines, on Monday suffered an unexplained power outage, electricity operator Energinet said. Latvia’s prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš, has called on EU leaders to stop all tourist visas for Russians, reigniting the debate about further tightening sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s Russia. The Council of Europe awarded detained Russian opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza the Vaclav Havel human rights prize on Monday for what it called his bravery in standing up to Russia’s leaders. Russian divers are to examine the extent of the damage caused by the blast on the road-and-rail bridge. Crimea’s Russian governor, Sergei Aksyonov, told reporters that residents would manage despite the damage to the bridge. “Of course, emotions have been triggered and there is a healthy desire to seek revenge,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/17/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-175-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T11:12:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 175 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/17/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-175-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/17/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-175-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 175 of the invasion","bodyText":"Russian military leaders are likely to be “increasingly concerned” about security in Crimea after reported explosions, a British intelligence update said. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said both Russian and Ukrainian authorities admitted that an ammunition dump exploded on Tuesday near Dzhankoi in the north of the region and that a nearby railway and sub-station were also damaged. The update said Russian media also reported smoke rising near the Gvardeyskoye airbase. And while the “the cause of these incidents and the extent of the damage is not yet clear”, Russian commanders are likely to be “increasingly concerned” with security in the region that Russia annexed in 2014. In the Donetsk region at the forefront of the Russian offensive, two civilians were killed and seven others were wounded by recent Russian shelling of several towns and villages. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, confirmed the latest casualties on Telegram. The area has been the subject of heavy shelling by the Russian military in recent weeks as they try to make tactical advances in the Donbas region. A recreation centre has been destroyed and three people injured after Russian shelling in Odesa, a top official has said. Sergey Bratchuk, a representative of the Odesa military administration, said a fire broke out and nearby buildings were damaged after the attack. In a post on the Telegram messaging app he said the damage was caused by two enemy rockets. A rescue operation is continuing, he added. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, has warned residents in the western city to prepare for a tough winter. In a video posted to his social media accounts, he said: “It’s likely that we’re in for a difficult winter. It’s logical – there can’t be anything simple in a country that fights for its independence. But we have to be prepared for everything.” He added that the city’s authorities had worked on an action plan for any emergencies “that may arise as a result of an enemy attack”. There could be more attacks in the “next two or three months” similar to the strikes in Crimea, a key adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine was engaged in a counteroffensive aimed at creating “chaos within Russian forces” by striking at the invaders’ supply lines deep into occupied territories. Ukraine has hinted it was behind a series of mysterious and devastating strikes in occupied Crimea that destroyed a key railway junction used for supplying Russian troops and a military airbase. Several explosions on Tuesday appeared to have destroyed a Russian ammunition depot and an electricity substation about 125 miles (200km) from the frontline with Ukrainian forces. Russia blamed saboteurs for orchestrating the series of explosions. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet to review the grain export deal in Lviv on Thursday. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said. Ukraine’s nuclear operator reported what it called an “unprecedented” cyber-attack on its website, but said its operations had not been disrupted. “On 16 August 2022, the most powerful cyber-attack since the start of the Russian invasion occurred against Energoatom’s website,” the operator said, adding it “was attacked from Russian territory”. North Korea and the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk will develop “equally beneficial bilateral cooperation”, Denis Pushilin, the head of the separatist administration, said in a letter to Kim Jong-un, North Korean state media reported on Wednesday. The first ship to depart Ukraine under a grain export deal docked in Syria on Tuesday, according to a shipping source and satellite data. Another ship carrying the first cargo of food aid bound for Africa also left Ukraine’s ports. Russia’s defence ministry has warned Britain against a planned spy plane flight over Russian territory, saying its air force has been given orders to prevent an intrusion. The ministry said the UK sent a notice informing about a planned flight of an RC-135 reconnaissance plane along a route that partly passes over Russian territory. “We regard this action as a deliberate provocation,” the ministry said. Estonian authorities removed a Soviet-era tank from its pedestal in the eastern city of Narva, the most significant removal yet out of an estimated 200 to 400 such monuments that the government has pledged to take down by the end of the year. “No one wants to see our militant and hostile neighbour foment tensions in our home,” the prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said on Tuesday. Estonia will also this week close its border to more than 50,000 Russians with previously issued visas. Finland says it will cut the number of visas it issues to Russians to 10% of current volumes from 1 September after Russian tourists began using the country as a gateway to European holiday destinations. Finland will also join the Baltic states in jointly proposing the discontinuation of an EU visa facilitation agreement with Russia that makes it easier and cheaper for Russians to travel to and within the EU, the foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/05/putin-appears-to-admit-severe-russian-losses-in-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-05T18:09:02Z","webTitle":"Putin appears to admit severe Russian losses in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/05/putin-appears-to-admit-severe-russian-losses-in-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/05/putin-appears-to-admit-severe-russian-losses-in-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Putin appears to admit severe Russian losses in Ukraine","bodyText":"The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to concede the severity of the Kremlin’s recent military reversals in Ukraine, insisting Russia would “stabilise” the situation in four Ukrainian regions it illegally claimed as its own territory last week. Russia has suffered significant losses in two of the four regions since Friday, when Putin signed treaties to incorporate them into Russia by force, with Russian officials saying their forces were “regrouping”. “We are working on the assumption that the situation in the new territories will stabilise,” Putin told Russian teachers during a televised video call. With Ukraine pushing its advance in the east and south, Russian troops have been retreating under pressure on both fronts, confronted by fast moving and agile Ukrainian forces supplied with advanced western-supplied artillery systems. As Russian troops have retreated, they have left behind smashed towns once under occupation and, in places, mass burial sites and evidence of torture chambers. In the town of Lyman, which was retaken by Ukrainian forces on Sunday, more than 50 graves have been found, some marked with names, others with numbers, the Kyiv-based outlet Hromadske reported on Wednesday. Putin’s comments comes amid increasingly gloomy commentary from Russian war correspondents and military bloggers over the severity of the situation that has seen a large-scale withdrawal from the Kharkiv region, the loss of the strategic town of Lyman on Friday and Ukrainian advances in the Kherson region. The scale of the recent defeats was underlined by a report by the BBC’s Russian service that said an elite Russian military intelligence unit may have lost up to three-quarters of its reconnaissance manpower in Ukraine. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s southern command said it had extended its area of control by six to 12 miles in the Kherson region and the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, confirmed the recapture of a series of villages. The territory recaptured is to the south of the city of Kryvyi Rih in the direction of Nova Kakhovka as well as west along the north bank of the Dnipro river towards Kherson. “The Ukrainian army is making quite fast and powerful progress in the south of our country,” said Zelenskiy in his nightly address on Tuesday. “Dozens of settlements have already been exempted from the Russian pseudo-referendum this week alone … and this is far from a complete list.” He named eight villages in the Kherson region. Some Russian propagandists and officials blamed the losses on Nato. “We are regrouping [our forces] along the front, which means that we can gather strength and strike back,” Kirill Stremousov, the Moscow-appointed deputy head of Kherson region, told the RIA Novosti news agency. Stremousov said it was “impossible” for them to enter Kherson city. A Russian war reporter for state TV, Roman Saponkov, wrote to his Telegram followers that Russia was losing in Kherson. “Friends, I know you’re waiting for me to comment on the situation. But I really don’t know what to say to you. The retreat from the north on the right bank is a disaster.” The losses came as Putin ordered on Wednesday his government to take control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, but was met with the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company saying he was taking charge and urging workers not to sign any documents with Russia. Military experts say Russia is at its weakest point, partly because of its decision not to mobilise earlier and partly because of massive losses of troops and equipment. About 15,000 of Russia’s best-trained troops are struggling to fight off Ukrainians on the western bank of occupied Kherson, despite movements of Russian troops from the eastern front to the south, which has thinned Russian forces elsewhere. According to Jack Watling, a senior analyst at the Royal United Services Institute, Russian troops around Kherson have retreated to their second line of defence to shorten their frontline. “There’s no evidence of surrender or collapse [of Russian forces] … like we saw in Kharkiv region,” said Watling, noting the political importance for Russia of holding on to Kherson city, the only regional centre it has managed to acquire since February. But if Ukraine’s forces manage to break through Russia’s second line of defence, they will be able to cut the Russian supply lines with a wider range of cheaper artillery and trap them on the western bank of Kherson, he added. “At the moment, the bridges are being hit by Himars [rockets], which are scarce and very expensive … [if they advance further] they can afford to open up against more incidental targets,” said Watling of the bridges supplying Russian forces on Kherson’s west bank. Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at St Andrews University, added that Ukraine’s recent progress had been a product of a process, not a turning point. “For months now, Russia has been getting weaker, it has been bleeding its army on the field, it’s been losing a huge amount of equipment. On the other hand, the Ukrainians have been getting stronger; they have better-trained forces and better military equipment.” He added: “This hasn’t happened overnight, this has been the way the war has been trending but now we can say it reached the tipping point in September.” In the short term there is nothing Russia can do because they waited too long to mobilise, O’Brien said. Russia, meanwhile, has continued to attack behind Ukraine’s frontlines, a mixture of military and civilian targets. On Wednesday morning, it launched a significant drone attack on Bila Tserkva in Kyiv region and fired rockets into Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro region. But O’Brien doubted Russia had enough quality missiles to alter the situation behind the frontlines to affect the battlefield. “It’s more of a question of, can they just hold on and hope that they can get a trained and re-equipped force back in the spring, but even then there’s a question about whether they can do that,” said O’Brien. He said Russia would need to produce more equipment and properly train troops but its system of mobilisation appeared “chaotic”. Konrad Muzyka, an independent military analyst, said he had initially thought the war may last for years, but after the Kharkiv region, it could be much less. “It does not look good for [Russia] … They are not able to defend properly, let alone conduct any offensives,” said Muzyka. “This Russian leadership thinks with [new] reservists they will be able to stop Ukrainian advances, but I’m not sure. The truth is, we don’t know how big an impact it will [have] on the frontline.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/sep/01/liz-truss-oil-gas-energy-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T11:00:18Z","webTitle":"Liz Truss puts hard-right ideology above lives – and is backing oil and gas to prove it | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/01/liz-truss-oil-gas-energy-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/01/liz-truss-oil-gas-energy-climate-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Liz Truss puts hard-right ideology above lives – and is backing oil and gas to prove it","bodyText":"How best to describe wilfully vandalising the planet and threatening human life to satisfy ideological bloodlust?

If the purpose of this is to confront the looming social catastrophe of energy bills, to describe it as an exercise in futility would be generous: it takes the best part of three decades to pump fossil fuels out of the ground and put them onstream. As Russia switches off Europe’s flow of gas via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline – it implausibly cites maintenance work as the reason – the need for drastic, swift action could not be more obvious, yet our soon-to-be prime minister has nothing meaningful to offer. There are other paths. New renewable energy capacity secured by the government will cost only £48 per megawatt hour – compared with the current cost of running gas-fired power stations, which has surged to around £450 per MWh. (And, depending on the impact of action from the EU, it could rise further.) Renewables, therefore, are around nine times cheaper and far quicker to plug into our energy system. What possible reason is there not to make wind and solar the central pillars of an effective strategy to build energy independence and help stop millions being plunged into destitution? What explains this suicidal strategy? It is undoubtedly that the ideological predilections of the Tory right are prioritised above the Earth’s survival, energy independence and people’s livelihoods. Renewables are indelibly culturally associated with dangerous lefty nonsense, while gas and oil somehow represent macho British tradition. That the case for renewables is based both on pragmatic economics and incontrovertible scientific facts is irrelevant. It is hard not to conclude, too, that an addiction to waging eternal culture war is at play. Much of the behaviour of the modern right is driven by a desire to offend their opponents; like announcing they have passed wind, they want you to be aware of and disgusted by their actions. If you want to see such ideological spite in all its glory, consider the fact that onshore wind is a mere £50 per MWh, but has essentially been banned by the government. Why? Not because it’s unpopular – polling suggests that three-quarters back it, including a large majority of Tory voters. And not because another much less popular option they’ve also swung behind – expanding nuclear power stations – is cheaper. Nuclear plants are far more expensive and – toxic nuclear waste aside – still take so long to build that they would do little to address the current emergency. It gets worse: Truss has committed to change planning laws to hinder the development of solar power, trashing an energy source that costs just £55 per MWh. “Our fields shouldn’t be full of solar panels” she crows, while our streets will be filled with hungry kids and cold pensioners. This may explain, too, why David Cameron – who began his leadership by changing the Tory logo into a tree – demanded cutting the “green crap”. It was a commitment the Tories followed up on: while more than 2 million households were insulated in 2012, that plummeted to around quarter of a million a year later, and less than 100,000 in 2020. The consequence? An analysis by Carbon Brief showed that the insulation gap, along with cuts to wind and solar, will cost households an extra £150 a year – and that’s before we mention the loss of skilled jobs that mass insulation programmes support. Avoiding this looming, avoidable humanitarian catastrophe is crucial. So too is saving the planet. This week, scientists concluded that the Greenland ice cap melting will inevitably mean major rises in sea levels, threatening to overwhelm coastal areas and all those who live in them. A decisive shift to renewable energy offers hope of at least mitigating this calamity, while expanding UK drilling means pouring North Sea oil on to the inferno. The taxpayer is expected to carry a financial burden of subsidies to fossil fuel companies wthat will cost them twice over: it will cost them now in the pocket, and it will cost them a sustainable future. Britain’s direction is clear: Truss’s Britain will be governed by policies lifted from cliched Daily Mail headlines. All the bêtes noires of saloon-bar reactionaries from the past 20 years will be slaughtered, and the resulting anguish from those effete metropolitan lefties obsessed with mere trivialities such as avoiding mass impoverishment and the destruction of the planet will give the Tory faithful their kicks. While Labour’s refusal to confront the issue of utility ownership closes off the possibility of a long-term solution – and fuels the transfer of wealth from taxpayer to shareholder – at least their windfall tax to scoop away the ludicrous profits of energy giants to suppress bills offers some relief. As things stand, Truss only serves up a tray of niche hard-right poison pills that do nothing to address the three intersecting crises – living standards, energy independence and climate. And, yes, Truss may crave the disgust of those lefty do-gooders, but come winter, many of the Tories own true believers will be shivering in their homes, too.

The comparison to the former Iraqi minister who gained cult status for his outrageous lies came during a fractious prime minister’s questions, with Starmer saying Johnson was complacent about people’s “blindingly obvious” economic problems. The Labour leader said a mooted plan to let motorists get MOTs lasting two years instead of one made the ill-fated 1990s “cones hotline” look “visionary and inspirational”. He said Johnson was “only just waking up to the cost of living crisis” and had acted like an ostrich. Johnson accused Starmer of “droning on” and dismissed his call for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help bring down people’s energy bills, saying: “This guy is doomed to be a permanent spectator.” In their final public pitches before next week’s local elections, the two leaders traded blows during a session that was focused mainly on the economy. Johnson was tackled over an anonymous Tory MP’s briefing to the Mail on Sunday accusing Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, of crossing and uncrossing her legs in the House of Commons chamber to distract the prime minister. Starmer said the UK was on course to have the slowest growth and highest inflation in the G7, and he said Johnson was failing to properly manage the economy. In a series of targeted questions designed to pin responsibility for the cost of living crisis on the government, Starmer said ministers were making life worse for working people with last month’s “tax-hiking budget” and by failing to help those whose fuel bills have spiralled. “They’re the party of excess profits, we’re the party of working people,” Starmer said. He accused ministers of letting prices “get out of control”, denying it was happening and failing to do anything about it. “A vote for Labour next week is a vote for a very different set of choices,” Starmer said. He said his party would ask oil and gas companies to pay their fare share, insulate homes to get bills down and close tax avoidance schemes by scrapping non-dom status. But Johnson repeatedly branded Starmer “Captain Hindsight”, saying the cost of living crisis was affecting people around the world and insisting: “This government is tackling it.” He said the recently published energy security strategy would “undo the mistakes of the previous Labour government” by pushing for a new nuclear power station to be built every year instead of every decade. Johnson dismissed the windfall tax on offshore energy companies, saying it would “clobber the very businesses that we need to invest in energy to bring the prices down for people across this country.” The prime minister said a record number of jobs were being created and the Conservatives’ plans were better than Labour’s “by a mile”. He added: “Never forget, Labour-run Britain in 2010 – bankrupt because of what the Labour government did. They said they had no money left.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/05/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-223-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-05T13:56:12Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 224 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/05/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-223-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/05/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-223-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 224 of the invasion","bodyText":"Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed the four laws ratifying the Russian Federation’s claimed annexation of the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Russian forces do not fully control any of the four areas, and it remains unclear where Russia is attempting to set its new external border. Ukraine has made major and rapid advances this week, with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy saying in an address on Tuesday night that “dozens” of towns have been recaptured. Ukrainian forces captured the town of Dudchany on the west bank of the Dnipro River in their major advance in Kherson region, and in the east, Ukrainian forces were advancing after capturing Lyman, the main Russian bastion in the north of Donetsk province. Russia is at risk of losing control of the strategic towns critical to retaining the city of Kherson and eventually Crimea, western officials have judged, but they warned the fighting along the Dnipro river “will not be an easy rush into constrained territory”. Zelenskiy on Tuesday signed a decree formally declaring the prospect of any Ukrainian talks with Vladimir Putin “impossible”. The decree formalised comments made by Zelenskiy on Friday after the Russian president proclaimed the four occupied regions of Ukraine were to become part of Russia. Pro-Russian leaders in the occupied regions have claimed that the situation is stabilising this morning. Denis Pushilin, installed as governor in Donetsk by Russia has said “the situation on the front line in the Lyman direction is stabilising, the defence line is being strengthened”, while Kirill Stremousov, part of the occupiation administration imposed on Kherson, has been quoted saying that Russian forces were “conducting a regrouping in order to gather their strength and deliver a retaliatory blow” in the region, and that “the advance of the armed forces of Ukraine in the Kherson direction has stopped.” The UK ministry of defence has said in its daily operational briefing that “Ukraine continues to make progress in offensive operations along both the north-eastern and southern fronts. In the north-east, in Kharkiv Oblast, Ukraine has now consolidated a substantial area of territory east of the Oskil River.” Putin said in televised comments that he signed a decree making “corrections” to the partial mobilisation drive he announced 21 September. The Russian preisdent said the decree would defer conscription for additional categories of students, including those enrolled at accredited private universities and certain postgraduate students. The EU has agreed to set a price cap on Russian oil and ban trade in numerous technical and consumer goods, as part of further sanctions designed to counter Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. The latest round of sanctions, the eighth since February, were signed off by EU ambassadors on Wednesday, a week since the measures were proposed, a time scale regarded as lightning speed in Brussels. Russia’s foreign ministry has said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) will operate under the supervision of Russian agencies after the annexation declaration. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since the earliest days of the war. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-enterprise that owns the plant, has said it may restart it to ensure safety. Oleksandr Starukh, Ukraine’s governor of Zaporizhzhia, said that overnight “the enemy fired rockets at the regional centre and the outskirts of the city. Infrastructure facilities were destroyed.” Zelenskiy has posted a series of images of damaged buildings across social media from recently liberated Lyman, with the message “Our Lyman after the occupier. All basics of life have been destroyed here. They are doing so everywhere in the territories they seize. This can be stopped in one way only: liberate Ukraine, life, humanity, law and truth as soon as possible.” Russian TV journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, famous for staging an on-air protest against Russia’s war in Ukraine, confirmed she had escaped house arrest over further charges of spreading fake news, saying she had no case to answer. Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, says Washington’s decision to send more military aid to Ukraine poses a threat to Moscow’s interests and increases the risk of a military clash between Russia and the west. Russia’s foreign ministry said that it had expelled a Lithuanian diplomat. The British Prime Minister Liz Truss has said that Ukraine “will win” and that no peace deal should give away Ukrainian territory. She said “The Ukrainian people aren’t just fighting for their security but for all of our security. This is a fight for freedom and democracy around the world. We should not give in to those who want a deal which trades away Ukrainian land. They are proposing to pay in Ukrainian lives for the illusion of peace. We will stand with our Ukrainian friends, however long it takes. Ukraine can win. Ukraine must win. And Ukraine will win.” France’s junior minister for European affairs Laurence Boone has clarified the situation in which Russians fleeing the partial mobilisation for the war in Ukraine can obtain visas to stay in France, saying “We have limited conditions under which visas can be given. We will make sure dissident journalists, people who fight the regime, artists and students can still come here, and we will issue visas on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the security risks.” The UN has outlined the “unspeakable suffering and devastation” inflicted on Ukrainians. Christian Salazar Volkmann, presenting a report on rights in Ukraine to the UN human rights council in Geneva, said “disturbing accounts” were emerging of violations in detention, of both civilians and prisoners of war, while enforced disappearances and arbitrary detention had become “widespread” in territory controlled by Russia and its proxies. There were two documented cases of Ukrainian servicemen having been tortured to death, he said. About 2,000 videos, photographs and audio files of alleged war crimes have been submitted to the UN mandated international commission of inquiry (UN COI) on Ukraine. The footage was captured through an app designed to create verifiable evidence. Two women in Russia-annexed Crimea, including Miss Crimea, have been found guilty of discrediting the Russian army by singing a patriotic Ukrainian song. European Union finance ministers agreed Tuesday to integrate the EU’s support payments to Ukraine into its 2023 budget to make payments more structured and predictable. Russia’s retreat from Lyman has sparked vociferous criticism of the handling of the war on Russian state television. Vladimir Solovyov, host of a primetime talkshow on state TV channel Russia 1 and one of the Kremlin’s biggest cheerleaders, said on air on Sunday: “We need to pull it together, make unpopular, but necessary decisions and act.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/sep/21/albania-dalmatian-pelican-colony-narta-faces-threat-vlora-airport-aoe","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-21T06:30:21Z","webTitle":"Albania’s pelican colony was bouncing back.

Now it faces the threat of a new airport ","bodyText":"Half a dozen Dalmatian pelicans fly off as we approach the Narta lagoon, a marshland near Vlora in south-west Albania. It is a majestic sight – six elegantly soaring birds, with necks tilted back and wingspans almost matching that of an albatross. “They’re juveniles,” says Taulant Bino, head of the Albanian Ornithological Society (AOS). “They might start their own family in the next years.” Although Dalmatian pelicans (Pelecanus crispus) do not breed here, the lagoon serves as an important feeding site for the birds and many more species, including flamingos, gull-billed terns and Kentish plovers. Migratory birds use the lagoon as a stopover during their long journey between Africa and central and northern Europe. They are key Mediterranean wetlands, the type of habitat that covered much of the whole Albanian coast until Enver Hoxha’s dictatorial regime drained large swaths of it in the 1950s and 60s, in an attempt to eradicate malaria and develop the lowlands for agriculture. The Dalmatian pelican’s range spans much of Eurasia – from the Mediterranean in the west to the Taiwan Strait in the east – but it has experienced a decline in the 20th century. A combination of land development, drainage of marshlands, human disturbance and poaching means the bird is considered “near threatened” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This year, avian flu has killed an estimated 2,000 adult birds in Greece and Romania. In Albania, the Dalmatian pelican’s survival counts as one of the country’s biggest conservation successes. Once inhabiting its entire coastal strip, the bird came close to disappearing from the area in the 1990s. When Hoxha’s totalitarian regime ended in 1991, a state of anarchy ensued. “In those days, everyone had guns, which means everyone was a potential hunter,” says Aleksandër Trajçe, head of Protection and Preservation of Natural Environment in Albania (PPNEA). “Even just a few trigger-happy individuals with crazy ideas could cause a lot of damage.” By 2000, when Bino began working to save the birds, only 19 nests remained in Divjaka-Karavasta national park – the country’s only breeding colony, 25 miles north of Narta – down from 81 pairs in 1984. According to Trajçe, legal protection proved crucial in reversing the downward trend. “Initially, only the pine forest of Divjaka was a protected area,” he says. “In 1996, the lagoon got protected status. And in 2007, the entire area, from the Shkumbin River in the north to the Seman River in the south, was declared a national park.” Vjosa-Narta became a protected landscape in 2004. A hunting moratorium in 2014, although poorly implemented, added another layer of protection; international conservation efforts also helped. Now, from January to June each year, when pelicans breed and raise their chicks, wardens guard the nests day and night, preventing tourists, poachers and fishers from disturbing the birds. “At night, local fishermen use flashlights to catch fish, which make the pelicans sometimes abandon their nest,” says Bino. “And when we realised eggs got lost in floods, we created heightened breeding beds from sticks, branches and vegetation. The colony started bouncing back.” In 2020, 85 pelican pairs nested in Albania, the highest number since records began. Now, however, the pelicans are facing a fresh onslaught – this time from bulldozers. The Albanian government has approved the construction of an international airport at Vlora in an effort to boost the country’s tourism industry. The planned airport’s location, within the protected landscape surrounding Narta lagoon, could have devastating consequences for the birds, says Trajçe. “It will reduce the birds’ ability to move around and to feed, and, as a consequence, their potential to increase in number or expand their habitat.” The airport project will also put pressure on migration routes between Africa and northern Europe. “Albania has lagoons scattered along its coast,” says Trajçe. “Migratory birds use those to rest and feed. Building an airport right in the middle would interrupt bird movements that have been happening for thousands of years.” A consortium of three companies won the bid to build the airport – YDA Group (a Turkish conglomerate with ties to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s party), Mabetex and 2A Group. According to the consortium’s environmental impact study, the negative effects of the airport on surrounding wildlife can be easily mitigated – for example, by not working on construction during the breeding season and by rerouting flights during spring and autumn migration. But more than 40 conservation organisations, including PPNEA and AOS, have questioned this. “Different species breed at different times, which would mean for construction to be stopped for a few months,” says Trajçe. “And what about the impact during the operational phase? Are they going to stop flights during the breeding season as well? What about the migration season? It all seems highly unrealistic.” The conservation organisations say there was a lack of public consultation and a superficial assessment of alternative sites. “It might seem more expensive to build the airport elsewhere,” says Dorian Matlija, a lawyer advising the organisations, “but only if you don’t consider the damage to the environment.” In December 2020, authorities reviewed the network of protected areas in Albania and removed, among others, the site of the planned airport. The conservationists claim that, by redrawing the borders of protected parks, the government is infringing national laws. In its 2020 Albania report, the European Commission said the proposed airport “conflicts with other national laws and with international biodiversity protection conventions that Albania has ratified”. Four of the conservation organisations – PPNEA, AOS, EcoAlbania and the German-based EuroNatur – now plan to go to court over the project. “If removing land from protection goes without legal consequences, it means that the government can do that for every protected area,” says Trajçe. “What’s to stop them from building resorts in protected areas? Or a nuclear power plant? That would be the end of nature conservation.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-253-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-03T14:06:46Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 253 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-253-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/03/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-253-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 253 of the invasion","bodyText":"The UN nuclear watchdog said on Thursday it found no sign of undeclared nuclear activity at three sites in Ukraine that it inspected at Kyiv’s request, in response to Russian allegations that work was being done on a “dirty bomb”. “Our technical and scientific evaluation of the results we have so far did not show any sign of undeclared nuclear activities and materials at these three locations,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said, adding that environmental samples taken would be analysed. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, reacted strongly to the results of the nuclear inspection, saying Russia had confirmed its status as “the world’s top liar”. He said “The IAEA has checked three Ukrainian facilities in focus of Russian disinfo and found no evidence of any ‘dirty bombs’. I thank Rafael Mariano Grossi for IAEA’s excellent and prompt cooperation which helped counter Russian falsehoods. Russia has confirmed its status of the world’s top liar.” The Russian delegation resumed work at the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) that runs the Black Sea grain deal operations in Istanbul and joined vessel inspections on Thursday, the UN secretariat at the centre said. It said the queue for inspections has been significantly reduced, with currently over 120 ships waiting to move, mainly those planning an inbound voyage. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had said Wednesday that Moscow would rejoin the grain export deal brokered by the UN and Turkey with Ukraine, but that it reserved the right to withdraw if necessary. “We demanded assurances and guarantees from the Ukrainian side that nothing like this would happen again, that the humanitarian corridors would not be used militarily,” Putin said during a video meeting with his coordination council on Wednesday. Russia on Thursday urged the United Nations, which sponsored the deal, to help fulfil the parts of the deal intended to ease Russia’s food and fertiliser exports. “We still do not see any results regarding a second aspect: the removal of obstacles to the export of Russian fertilisers and grain,” the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told a news conference in Amman, Jordan. Russian agricultural exports do not fall explicitly under sanctions imposed since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February, but Moscow says they are badly hindered by the restrictions imposed on its financial, logistics and insurance sectors. A Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson said that, contrary to Russian claims, Ukraine has made no new commitments that go beyond the terms originally signed in July. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, welcomed Moscow’s humiliating U-turn and hailed “a significant diplomatic result for our country and the whole world”. “Implementation of the grain export initiative continues,” he said in his Wednesday evening address. “The Kremlin is demanding security guarantees from Ukraine. This shows both the failure of the Russian aggression and how strong we are when we remain united”. The Russian flag has been removed from the Kherson regional administration, a building located on the west bank of the city where Ukrainian forces made significant advances a few weeks ago. Russian forces moved their regional headquarters across the Dnipro river to the left bank of Kherson city, according to Ukraine’s Centre of National Resistance. One of the Russian-imposed leaders of the occupying authorities in Kherson, Kirill Stremousov, posted to Telegram encouraging further civilian “evacuations” from the city – a move that has been described by Kyiv as forced deportations. Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s Southern Command, is urging caution, saying that Russia’s unusual manoeuvres in Kherson might be a trap to lure in Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s grid operator Ukrenergo has confirmed that Russian missile attacks hit energy infrastructure in the Ukrainian regions of Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk late on Wednesday, further complicating the work of the energy system. Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of Dnipropetrovsk region described “a tense night of massive attacks” but said on Thursday morning there were no known casualties. Russian attacks in the Donetsk oblast and Kharkiv oblast have killed at least five civilians in the past day, officials said. The armed forces of Ukraine are estimating that about 730 Russian soldiers were killed yesterday alone, bringing the total to 68,900 personnel lost so far in the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzia nuclear power plant has been disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged the remaining high-voltage lines, leaving it with just diesel generators, according to the Ukrainian nuclear firm Energoatom. Olena Zelenska, the wife of Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said she hoped that Elon Musk’s tweet about a peace deal to end the war with Russia was a “chance mistake”. “He supported Ukraine from the very first day and that’s why Ukrainians really admired him,” Zelenska told the Guardian in an interview at the Web Summit in Lisbon. “So it was extremely sensitive for us to read the tweet. Let’s be honest, even the smartest person can’t say the smartest things 24 hours a day. There are mistakes. And we hope it was a chance mistake.” A small anti-British protest in Moscow greeted British ambassador Deborah Bronnert after she was summoned by Russia’s foreign ministry. Russia said in a statement that Bronnert was told “confrontational actions by the British pose the threat of an escalation and can lead to unpredictable and dangerous consequences”. The Russian foreign ministry objected to British agreements to train Ukrainian naval personnel, and accuse Britain of being involved in assisting an attack on the Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol last weekend. Hungary’s parliament will decide on when to schedule a debate on the ratification of Finland’s and Sweden’s applications to join Nato, its foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, told a press conference this morning. Switzerland has committed to providing $106m for Ukraine’s energy infrastructure recovery. Russia said Wednesday it was fully committed to preventing nuclear war, and that avoiding a clash among countries that have nuclear weapons was its highest priority. The Russian foreign ministry said it feared the five declared nuclear powers were teetering “on the brink of a direct armed conflict” and that the west must stop “encouraging provocations with weapons of mass destruction, which can lead to catastrophic consequences”. The White House has accused North Korea of covertly shipping a “significant number” of artillery shells to Russia in support of its invasion of Ukraine amid mounting evidence of shortages for key weapons systems. US National security council spokesperson John Kirby said the US believed North Korea “is covertly supplying” the ammunition to Russia and “trying to make it appear as though they are being sent to countries in the Middle East or north Africa”. Putin called for weapons used by Russia’s military to be modernised during a meeting of his coordination council on Wednesday. “Weapons must constantly, continuously improve and remain effective. To achieve this, I repeat, it is important to ensure that there is active competition between manufacturers and developers,” he said. The UN security council has overwhelmingly rejected Russia’s attempt to establish a commission to investigate its unfounded claims that Ukraine and the United States are carrying out “military biological” activities that violate the convention prohibiting the use of biological weapons. Details have been published of the damage caused to the Nord Stream gas pipeline by explosions at the end of September. Nord Stream AG said that about 250 metres (820ft) of the pipeline in the Baltic Sea was “destroyed”. Two Russian oligarchs and business partners of Roman Abramovich have been added to the UK government’s sanctions list. Alexander Abramov and Alexander Frolov, whom the UK government said were “known to be business associates” of the former Chelsea FC owner, were on Wednesday among four new Russian steel and petrochemical tycoons added to the sanctions list."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/06/russia-ukraine-war-un-to-publish-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-report-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-06T18:00:26Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukraine capturing villages near Kherson, says US; IAEA calls for security zone at Zaporizhzhia – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/06/russia-ukraine-war-un-to-publish-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-report-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/06/russia-ukraine-war-un-to-publish-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-report-live","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukraine capturing villages near Kherson, says US; IAEA calls for security zone at Zaporizhzhia – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. I’ll be back tomorrow. Here’s a quick recap of where we stand: The Ukrainian military repelled several Russian offensives in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk, the army’s general staff has said. In a situational update on Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian military also claimed the destruction of Russian targets in the Donetsk region. An adviser to the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff said he expected Kyiv to announce “great news” about its counteroffensive in the eastern Kharkiv region on Tuesday evening. The US defence department is seeing Ukrainian offensive forces in the Kherson region “continue to make some forward movement,” including retaking villages, according to a Pentagon official. The US has also seen “some offensive Russian activity … near Bakhmut”, Pentagon press secretary Air Force Brig Gen Pat Ryder said. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk oblast, has said Ukrainian troops have “gained a foothold” in the eastern region. In an update posted on Telegram, Haidai said Ukrainian forces have “advanced a little” in the Luhansk region and have repulsed Russian attacks. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. Ukraine’s forces are conducting counteroffensive actions in the east and south-east of the country, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. Writing on Telegram, Oleksiy Arestovych said Kyiv’s troops had “liberated several settlements on the western bank of the Dnieper” and that Russian forces on the right bank of the Dnieper would be in an “extremely difficult” position within a month. The Russian defence ministry is in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea to support its invasion of Ukraine, according to a newly downgraded US intelligence finding. A US official said the fact Russia was turning to North Korea demonstrated that “the Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions”. A powerful explosion in the occupied city of Enerhodar, which houses the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, has cut off water and electricity supplies, according to the local mayor. Russia’s defence ministry claimed earlier on Tuesday that Ukraine had fired 20 artillery shells on the town of Enerhodar and the area around the facility over a 24-hour period. The UN’s nuclear watchdog has called for the creation of a security zone around the Zaporizhzhia plant on the frontline of Russia’s war in Ukraine. In a long-awaited report that detailed extensive damage there, the IAEA said it was “gravely concerned” about the “unprecedented” situation at the plant and urged interim measures to prevent a nuclear disaster. Russia’s biggest natural gas pipeline to Europe will not resume pumping until Siemens Energy repairs faulty equipment, Gazprom has said. Siemens Energy said an engine oil leak at the last remaining turbine in operation at the Portovaya compressor station did not warrant keeping the pipeline closed. Russia’s foreign ministry has said the US is responsible for Europe’s gas supply crisis by pushing European leaders towards the “suicidal” step of cutting economic and energy cooperation with Moscow. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the “dominance of Washington prevailed” and that political forces playing the role of “sheep-provocateurs” were brought to power in EU countries. The Kremlin said Russia will not resume in full its gas supplies to Europe until the west lifts its sanctions against Moscow, as gas prices surged and the pound and euro slumped. Speaking to journalists on Monday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, blamed sanctions for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. “It is these sanctions imposed by the western states that have brought the situation to what we see now.” The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has blamed Europe’s energy crisis on sanctions it imposed on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine – a line taken by the Kremlin itself. European nations were “harvesting what they sowed” by imposing economic restrictions on Russia, Erdoğan added. The Kremlin has said “with much certainty” that Russia-UK relations will not improve under the leadership of Liz Truss. “Judging by statements made by Madame Truss when she was still foreign minister … one can say with much certainty that no changes for the better are expected,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has criticised Britain’s next prime minister, Liz Truss, for not being able to compromise. The UK will not strengthen its position in the international arena under her leadership, Lavrov said, while also mocking her for saying she did not know if the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was a friend or an enemy. A Russian-appointed official in the occupied city of Berdiansk in southern Ukraine has been seriously injured in a car blast, according to Moscow-installed authorities. Artem Bardin, who was appointed commandant of the Berdiansk’s occupying administration, was taken to hospital in “serious condition”, the pro-Russian mayor’s office said on Telegram, while blaming Ukraine. Ukraine’s major western allies have yet to sign up to establish a tribunal to try Vladimir Putin and his inner circle for the crime of aggression, according to Ukraine’s top officials. Andriy Smyrnov, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, said western allies are “putting their foot in the closing door on relations with Russia so that it doesn’t close completely”. The US president, Joe Biden, has decided not to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terror, the White House said. The designation of Russia as a state sponsor of terror – a label Ukraine has pushed for – could delay food exports and jeopardise deals to move goods through the Black Sea, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said. Jailed Russian opposition politician and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny’s chief of staff has said worsening prison conditions were threatening his health. In a post on his Twitter and Instagram accounts, Navalny wrote last week via his lawyers that he had been sent to a punishment cell for a third time in August in revenge for his political activity. A Russian court has sentenced the journalist Ivan Safronov to 22 years in prison on trumped-up treason charges. The sentencing of Safronov, a former defence reporter for the Kommersant and Vedomosti dailies, shocked friends and supporters who gathered in court on Monday to protest against his imprisonment. Editors at the Russian newspaper Kommersant published a front-page editorial in support of Safronov on Tuesday. Also on Monday, a court in Moscow stripped the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta of its print media licence, effectively banning the newspaper from operating inside Russia. Editor-in-chief, Dmitry Muratov, said the ruling was “a political hit job, without the slightest legal basis”. He said the paper would appeal. The same Russian court then revoked the licence of Novaya Gazeta’s sister magazine, “No” (“But”), on Tuesday. Novaya Gazeta is one of the country’s most important independent publications. Since it was established by Muratov and colleagues in 1993, it has investigated corruption inside and outside Russia, as well as the wars in Chechnya. Russia is burning excess gas because it has no capacity to store it after cutting deliveries to Europe, the EU’s energy commissioner Kadri Simson said. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Indonesia, Simson said: Our satellites are registering the leak of natural gas or them flaring the natural gas and this is very polluting. They don’t have alternative pipeline connections to other regions in the world, and their own underground gas storage is full. The US president, Joe Biden, has decided not to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terror, the White House said. Biden had said previously that Russia should not be designated a state sponsor of terrorism, a label Ukraine has pushed for. The designation of Russia as state sponsor of terror could delay food exports and jeopardise deals to move goods through the Black Sea, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said. The Ukrainian military repelled several Russian offensives in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk, the army’s general staff has said. In a situational update, the general staff said: Units of the Defence Forces of Ukraine hold their positions and prevent the enemy from advancing deeper into the territory of Ukraine. It added: Our military successfully repelled enemy attacks in the areas of Dolyna, Soledar, Novobakhmutivka, Kodema, Zaitseve, Avdiivka, Mariinka, and Lyubomirivka settlements of Donetsk region. The Ukrainian military also claimed the destruction of Russian targets in the Donetsk region. The US defence department is seeing Ukrainian offensive forces in the Kherson region “continue to make some forward movement,” including retaking villages, according to a Pentagon official. At a briefing with reporters, Pentagon press secretary Air Force Brig Gen Pat Ryder said: What we’ve seen in the Kherson region first is some continued offensive operations by the Ukrainians. They continue to make some forward movement. We are aware that they have retaken some villages. The US has also seen “some offensive Russian activity … near Bakhmut”, he added. A powerful explosion in the occupied city of Enerhodar, which houses the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, has cut off water and electricity supplies, according to the local mayor. Writing on Telegram, Dmytro Orlov said: Today at 12:20 residents of Enerhodar reported about a powerful explosion in the city. After that, the electricity and water supply disappeared simultaneously in Enerhodar. Earlier today, Russia’s defence ministry claimed Ukraine had fired 20 artillery shells on the town of Enerhodar and the area around the facility over a 24-hour period. In its daily military briefing, the Kremlin said three shells landed on the territory of the nuclear power station. It has not been possible to independently verify either side’s claims. A Russian-appointed official in the occupied city of Berdiansk in southern Ukraine has been seriously injured in a car blast, according to Moscow-installed authorities. Artem Bardin, who was appointed commandant of the Berdiansk’s occupying administration, was taken to hospital in “serious condition”, the mayor’s office said on Telegram. Bardin’s car exploded in “the very centre of Berdiansk” near the building of the civil-military administration, it said. The mayor’s office said: Today, September 6, in the very centre of Berdiansk, near the building of the Military Civil Administration, the car of the city commandant Artem Bardin was blown up. As a result of the explosion, the city commandant was hospitalised in severe condition. Doctors are providing him with necessary medical care. Although it was not immediately clear what caused the explosion, pro-Russian authorities have blamed Ukraine. The pro-Russian mayor’s office said: The terrorists of the Kyiv regime continue to try to intimidate residents of the liberated territories. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the attack. Here’s more on the report by the International Atomic Energy Agency after the UN nuclear watchdog sent a team to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant last week. The IAEA called for the establishment of a “safety and security protection zone” around the nuclear power plant, calling the current situation “untenable”. The report states: There is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means. This can be achieved by the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. The UN agency urged that shelling on site and its vicinity “should be stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant and associated facilities”. In addition to establishing a security zone around the plant, the IAEA recommended that the conditions Ukrainian staff operating the plant are working in should be improved. The report says: Ukrainian staff operating the plant under Russian military occupation are under constant high stress and pressure, especially with the limited staff available. This is not sustainable and could lead to increased human error with implications for nuclear safety. An adviser to the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff has said he expects Kyiv to announce “great news” about its counteroffensive in the eastern Kharkiv region on Tuesday evening. Serhiy Leshchenko wrote on Twitter: Tonight there is going to be a great news from President Zelenskyy on counteroffensive operation in Kharkiv region. He did not give any further details. It’s just past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk oblast, has said Ukrainian troops have “gained a foothold” in the eastern region. In an update posted on Telegram, Haidai said Ukrainian forces have “advanced a little” in the Luhansk region and have repulsed Russian attacks. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. Ukraine’s forces are conducting counteroffensive actions in the east and south-east of the country, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. Writing on Telegram, Oleksiy Arestovych said Kyiv’s troops had “liberated several settlements on the western bank of the Dnieper” and that Russian forces on the right bank of the Dnieper would be in an “extremely difficult” position within a month. The Russian defence ministry is in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea to support its invasion of Ukraine, according to a newly downgraded US intelligence finding. A US official said the fact Russia was turning to North Korea demonstrated that “the Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions”. The International Atomic Energy Agency has warned there is an “urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident” at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine. In its report, the UN nuclear watchdog said it was “gravely concerned” about the situation at the facility and that ongoing shelling near the plant “represented a constant threat to nuclear safety and security”. The backup power line at the Zaporizhzhia power plant was disconnected to extinguish a fire, officials said on Monday. However, the IAEA said the line itself was not damaged and that the backup line “will be reconnected once the fire has been extinguished”.

Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you today with all the latest news from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The team of UN nuclear experts “closely” witnessed shelling in the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant during their visit to the facility, the IAEA report says. They also first-hand observations of damage to the road surface, walls and windows of various buildings, as well as at the overpass connecting the reactor units at the plant. The report continues: The shelling could have impacted safety related structures, systems and components, and could have caused safety significant impacts, loss of lives and personnel injuries. IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, stated that “while past events had not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, they represented a constant threat to nuclear safety and security because critical safety functions could be impacted”, it says. The International Atomic Energy Agency has published its report about the nuclear safety and security situation at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine. The UN nuclear watchdog warns that there is “urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident” at the nuclear plant, adding that it was “gravely concerned” concerned about the situation at the facility. The situation in Ukraine is “unprecedented”, the report writes. It is the first time a military conflict has occurred amid the facilities of a large, established nuclear power programme. A nuclear accident can have serious impacts within the country and beyond its borders. The IAEA added: Pending the end of the conflict and re-establishment of stable conditions there is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means. This can be achieved by the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. Ukraine has urged Hasidic Jewish pilgrims travelling to the war-torn country to skip their annual pilgrimage to the city of Uman this year because of the Russian invasion. Every year, tens of thousands of pilgrims come to Uman from all around the world to visit the tomb of Rabbi Nachman for Rosh Hashana – the Jewish new year, celebrated this year between 25 and 27 September, Agence France-Presse reports. Rabbi Nachman from Breslov (1772-1810) was the founder of an ultra-orthodox movement that settled in Uman in the early 1800s. In a Facebook post, the Ukrainian embassy in Israel said: “When the echoes of the Russian enemy explosions on Ukraine don’t stop, we must take care of ourselves. “Please, avoid coming to Uman on Rosh Hashanah and pray that peace will return to Ukraine and the blessed pilgrimage will be renewed.” Plans have been made for “additional restrictions” in the city already under curfew. More than 10,000 pilgrims from around the world are expected according to regional governor Igor Taburets, who was cited by Interfax-Ukraine. Plans have been made for “additional restrictions” in the city already under curfew, including a ban on street vending and public gatherings because of the “high risk of a terrorist attack”, Taburets said. He added: We know how sly our enemy is. Any public gathering is potentially vulnerable.” Three Royal Navy warships have been shadowing a Russian Navy taskforce in waters close to the UK, PA Media reports. Type 23 frigates HMS Westminster, HMS Lancaster and HMS Richmond tracked Slava-class cruiser, Marshal Ustinov, the sister ship of the ill-fated Moskva which sunk in the Black Sea in April. They have also been keeping a watch on Udaloy-class destroyer, Vice-Admiral Kulakov and tanker Vyazma as the three ships headed home from the eastern Mediterranean after supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine since February. At the same time, patrol ship HMS Mersey has also shadowed Russian military research vessel Akademik Ioffe on its journey south through the Dover shipping lanes into the Channel. A Royal Navy spokesman said: The frigates and their helicopters used an array of cutting-edge sensors and modern naval technology to keep close watch in the Celtic Sea and through the English Channel.” HMS Westminster’s commanding officer (CO) Commander Ed Moss-Ward said: Maritime security in the sea areas around the UK is crucial to our prosperity and resilience. The Royal Navy routinely responds to escort warships in UK territorial waters and the adjacent sea areas to ensure compliance with maritime law, to deter malign activity and to protect our national interests. Escorting the Russian task group has demonstrated that the Royal Navy is committed to maintaining maritime security and to co-operating with our Nato allies.” HMS Lancaster shadowed the Russian ships from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Celtic Sea as part of Nato’s fast response task force in the Atlantic. HMS Westminster deployed from Portsmouth to intercept the Russian ships in the Celtic Sea where the Marshal Ustinov was refuelled by the tanker Vyazma while HMS Richmond kept watch in the Channel. Commander Tom Johnson, CO of HMS Lancaster, said: Working together allows Nato allies to respond to security challenges at pace and collectively deter potential aggressors. Exchange of personnel further deepens Nato cohesion and interoperability so that the alliance can swiftly and efficiently react to any threat. Lancaster’s team work exceptionally hard to ensure we are always ready to respond to any threat at a moment’s notice.” My colleague Isobel Koshiw writes: A chimpanzee that escaped Kharkiv city zoo on Monday was persuaded to return by a zoo employee who wheeled it back on a bicycle. Staff at the zoo in Ukraine’s second-biggest city were struggling to persuade Chichi, who had wandered around streets and a nearby park, to return to the zoo with them. But when it started to rain she ran to a keeper, who put a yellow jacket on her. The pair embraced before Chichi was put on the seat of a bike. Footage of the incident brought a rare moment of joy to a frontline city under daily bombardment by Russian forces. The zoo’s director, Oleksiy Hryhoriev, confirmed to Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne that the animal was safely back in the zoo. Earlier in the war, Chichi had been evacuated from the Feldman Ecopark, an outdoor zoo on frontlines in the Kharkiv region. Read the full story here. Editors at the Russian newspaper Kommersant have published a front-page editorial in support of the journalist Ivan Safronov, who was yesterday sentenced to 22 years in prison on treason charges. The open letter to Safronov, a former military correspondent for Kommersant, pays tribute to how he became “the best in his field” and states that colleagues at the newspaper were “lucky to work with you”. The letter writes that the authors “haven’t heard any public evidence of your guilt”, adding: You didn’t give up – and don’t give up now. […] We love you, we believe in you. We are waiting for you. Safronov’s sentencing on Monday shocked friends and supporters who gathered in the Russian court to protest against his imprisonment. He was tried on secret evidence, but case files revealed by Proekt showed that much of the case against him came from public data in his articles and alleged ties to foreigners that were not backed up by evidence. The actors Ben Stiller and Sean Penn have been banned from entering Russia following their outspoken support of Ukraine during the invasion. Russia’s minister of foreign affairs released a list on Monday of 25 new names that will be excluded from the country in response to “the ever-expanding personal sanctions by the … Biden administration against Russian citizens”. Stiller and Penn are both included, along with political figures such as senators Mark Kelly, Rick Scott and Kyrsten Sinema. Stiller, an ambassador for UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, visited Ukraine in June, and posted a video on Instagram in solidarity with refugees of the conflict, saying: “Nobody chooses to flee their homes. Seeking safety is a right and it needs to be upheld for every person.” Stiller also met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, telling him: “You’re my hero.” Penn has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine and Zelenskiy, having been in the country making a documentary as the Russian invasion got under way in February. Penn later made a series of TV appearances in April to call for US solidarity with Ukraine and asked for US fighter jets to be supplied to the country. He also said he had considered joining the fight against Russia. They join a longer list of more than 1,000 names of US citizens who have been sanctioned by Russia; these mostly comprise political and military figures (including President Biden and Hillary Clinton, but not Donald Trump), but also a handful of Hollywood names, including executives Jeffrey Katzenberg and Peter Cramer, film director Rob Reiner, and actor Morgan Freeman. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk oblast, has said Ukrainian troops have “gained a foothold” in the eastern region. In an update posted on Telegram, Haidai said Ukrainian forces have “advanced a little” in the Luhansk region and have repulsed Russian attacks. Haidai wrote: Luhansk Region continues to defend itself. Enemy attacks have been repulsed, there are certain positive results: our defenders have advanced a little and gained a foothold. We are waiting for the de-occupation. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. More from Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who accused the west of not honouring its promise to help Russian food exports reach global markets, according to Russian state media. Russian state-owned news agency Ria Novosti cited Lavrov as claiming that western countries had not relaxed sanctions that would allow it easier access to ship its agricultural products abroad. Russia had seen the commitment as a key part of an UN-brokered grain deal that helped end a blockade on Ukrainian grain exports from its southern ports. Russia’s foreign ministry has said the US is responsible for Europe’s gas supply crisis by pushing European leaders towards the “suicidal” step of cutting economic and energy cooperation with Moscow. Asked what needed to happen for the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline to begin pumping again, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Reuters: Listen, you are asking me questions that even children know the answer to: those who started this need to finish this. She said the US had long sought to break the energy ties between Russia and major European powers such as Germany. Political forces playing the role of “sheep-provocateurs” were brought to power in EU countries, she added. The “dominance of Washington prevailed”, Zakharova said. She added: It is absolute suicide but it seems they will have to go through this. A court in Moscow has revoked the licence of Novaya Gazeta’s sister magazine, a day after the newspaper was stripped of its print media licence and effectively banned from operating inside Russia. On Monday, the Basmanny district court revoked Novaya Gazeta of its licence after Russia’s media regulator, Roskomnadzor, accused the publication of failing to provide documents related to a change of ownership in 2006. Speaking outside court yesterday, the newspaper’s editor-in-chief and Nobel laureate Dmitry Muratov said the ruling was “a political hit job, without the slightest legal basis”. He said the paper would appeal. The same court today revoked the licence of “No” (“But”), because of its failure to appear from 2009, when it was registered, until 2022. Novaya Gazeta lawyer Yaroslav Kozheurov said: Why did Roskomnadzor go to court only after the magazine was printed? It is absolutely clear that the appeal to the court is not due to the fact that the magazine was not published, but due to the fact that the magazine started appearing. Novaya Gazeta is one of the country’s most important independent publications. Since it was established by Muratov and colleagues in 1993, it has investigated corruption inside and outside Russia, as well as the wars in Chechnya. In March, Novaya Gazeta said it would cease operations until the end of the war in Ukraine after it received several warnings from the state censor for allegedly violating the country’s “foreign agent” law. Ukraine’s major western allies have yet to sign up to establish a tribunal to try Vladimir Putin and his inner circle for the crime of aggression, wanting to leave space for future relations with Russia, according to Ukraine’s top officials. “It’s big politics. On the one hand, countries publicly condemn the aggression but on the other, they are putting their foot in the closing door on relations with Russia so that it doesn’t close completely,” said Andriy Smyrnov, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, who is leading the country’s effort to establish the international tribunal. Smyrnov said: They are attempting to keep some space for diplomatic manoeuvres. We know that agreements with Russia are not worth the paper they are written on. His claims come as the US president, Joe Biden, said on Monday that Russia should not be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, something Ukrainian officials and some US politicians had pushed for. Russia had previously said such a designation would mean Washington had crossed the point of no return. Ukrainian officials say that since April, they have been trying to convince their western allies to establish an ad hoc tribunal that would hold Russia’s senior leadership responsible for the crime of aggression for invading Ukraine. Aggression is viewed as the supreme crime under international law because without the transgression of borders during an invasion, subsequent war crimes would not have been committed. Read the full story by my colleagues, Isobel Koshiw and Patrick Wintour. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has criticised Britain’s next prime minister, Liz Truss, for not being able to compromise and said the UK will not strengthen its position in the international arena under her leadership. Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, Lavrov said the incoming prime minister tried to “defend Britain’s interests without taking into account the positions of others in any way and without any attempt to compromise”, he said. Lavrov added: I do not think that this will help Britain to maintain or strengthen its position in the international arena, which has clearly been shaken after it left the European Union. He also mocked the incoming prime minister for saying she did not know if the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was a friend or an enemy. He said: For Liz Truss ... it should be more of a priority to deal with her closest neighbours, including finally deciding whether President Macron is her friend or enemy. This question is still hanging in the air. Lavrov said the UK had tried to “compensate” for Brexit by taking “drastic steps on the world stage” and was acting “aggressively over the situation in Ukraine”. Hello everyone. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, taking over the blog from Jane Clinton to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far: Russia’s biggest natural gas pipeline to Europe will not resume pumping until Siemens Energy repairs faulty equipment, Gazprom has said. Siemens Energy said an engine oil leak at the last remaining turbine in operation at the Portovaya compressor station did not warrant keeping the pipeline closed. The Kremlin said Russia will not resume in full its gas supplies to Europe until the west lifts its sanctions against Moscow, as gas prices surged and the pound and euro slumped. Speaking to journalists on Monday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, blamed sanctions for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. “It is these sanctions imposed by the western states that have brought the situation to what we see now.” The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has blamed Europe’s energy crisis on sanctions it imposed on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine – a line taken by the Kremlin itself. European nations were “harvesting what they sowed” by imposing economic restrictions on Russia, Erdoğan added. The backup power line at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine has been disconnected to extinguish a fire, officials said on Monday. However, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the line itself was not damaged and that the backup line “will be reconnected once the fire has been extinguished”. An expert mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is set to release their findings from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a detailed report later on Tuesday. Four of the six UN mission members at the plant have left the site and the remaining two IAEA experts will stay on a permanent basis, the UN nuclear watchdog said. The Kremlin has said “with much certainty” that Russia-UK relations will not improve under the leadership of Liz Truss. “Judging by statements made by Madame Truss when she was still foreign minister … one can say with much certainty that no changes for the better are expected,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Ukraine’s forces are conducting counteroffensive actions in the east and south-east of the country, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. Writing on Telegram, Oleksiy Arestovych said Kyiv’s troops had “liberated several settlements on the western bank of the Dnieper” and that Russian forces on the right bank of the Dnieper would be in an “extremely difficult” position within a month. The Russian defence ministry is in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea to support its invasion of Ukraine, according to a newly downgraded US intelligence finding. A US official said the fact Russia was turning to North Korea demonstrated that “the Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions”. Vladimir Putin attended large-scale military exercises on Tuesday involving China and several other Russia-friendly countries. Participating countries in the military drills included several of Russia’s neighbours, as well as Syria, India and key ally China. Jailed Russian opposition politician and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny’s chief of staff has said worsening prison conditions were threatening his health. In a post on his Twitter and Instagram accounts, Navalny wrote last week via his lawyers that he had been sent to a punishment cell for a third time in August in revenge for his political activity. Ukraine’s southern offensive has prompted Kherson occupiers to “pause” a planned referendum on whether to become part of Russia. Russian state news agency Tass reported that the head of Kherson’s Russian-appointed authorities, Kirill Stremousov, said plans for a referendum on joining Russia had been “paused” because of the security situation. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has said European Union politicians are being “suicidal” over Russian energy supplies, Reuters reports. Russian president Vladimir Putin was shown smiling and joking with his defence minister as he inspected a military exercise in Russia’s far east. The “Vostok” (East) exercises also involve troops from China and India, although it was not clear if units from those countries were taking part in the exercise observed by Putin. The Zvezda military news service showed a clip of Putin seated next to defence minister Sergei Shoigu, both were wearing military combat jackets and were seen exchanging a joke as they listened to a phone call between Shoigu’s deputy and the head of the general staff, Reuters reports. The defence ministry says the four-yearly war games that began on 1 September involve only 50,000 troops, a fraction of the 300,000 they said took part in 2018. Western military analysts say they believe both figures are exaggerated. The defence ministry released a video of the naval part of the exercise, showing Russia’s Pacific Fleet practising launching Kalibr cruise missiles which it said had successfully struck a target more than 300km (185 miles) away. On Monday, Russian and Chinese combat ships practised repelling an enemy air attack using air defence artillery systems. India has sent an army contingent to the drills which it says is taking part in “joint field training exercises, combat discussions and firepower exercises”. Russia is the biggest supplier of military hardware to India. Moscow says the war games also involve military contingents and observers from Algeria, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Syria and six former Soviet republics. The Swiss government has agreed to offer financial help to the publicly owned electricity group Axpo, Agence France-Presse reports. It is the latest European energy company to require state aid after Russia’s war in Ukraine sent gas prices soaring. Axpo, which requested temporary government help last week, will have access to credit line of 4bn Swiss francs ($4.1bn) to ensure liquidity amid the energy crisis. The Federal Energy Office said: The government responded favourably to avoid putting Switzerland’s energy supply in jeopardy.” It added that Axpo was an electricity firm of “systemic importance” for the country. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has blamed Europe’s energy crisis on sanctions it imposed on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine – a line taken by the Kremlin itself. He said European nations were “harvesting what they sowed” by imposing economic restrictions on Russia, Agence France-Presse reports. Erdoğan added: Europe’s attitude towards Mr Putin, its sanctions, brought Mr Putin – willingly or not – to the point of saying: ‘If you do this, I will do that.’ He is using all his means and weapons. Natural gas, unfortunately, is one of them.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Monday blamed Russia’s halting of gas deliveries to Germany via the Nord Stream pipeline on “sanctions that were imposed against our country”. Jailed Russian opposition politician and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny’s chief of staff said worsening prison conditions were threatening his health. In a post on his Twitter and Instagram accounts, Navalny wrote last week via his lawyers that he had been sent to a punishment cell for a third time in August in revenge for his political activity. The prison service did not respond to a request for comment. Navalny’s cell is reported to be two by three metres wide with a table, chair and bed which is folded from 6am to 10pm. His chief of staff, Leonid Volkov, told Reuters: Suddenly, three weeks ago, they started to dramatically worsen his conditions, which actually poses an enormous threat to his health, because no normal person could spend a long time in that ‘special’ cell. And for Alexei, who had just survived the poisoning, it is especially dangerous.” Volkov, who keeps in touch with the opposition leader through lawyers, said that Navalny is still “mentally and physically very fit”. He added: The fact that Putin is losing (the war), and is getting less and less predictable, makes the situation more dangerous.” Navalny is serving eleven-and-a-half years in prison for parole violations, fraud and contempt of court charges, which he denies. His Anti-Corruption Foundation is preparing to turn the upcoming local elections in Moscow into an anti-war vote. Russia’s biggest natural gas pipeline to Europe will not resume pumping until Siemens Energy repairs faulty equipment, Gazprom’s deputy chief executive Vitaly Markelov has told Reuters. Gazprom said on Friday that the Nord Stream 1 pipeline would remain shut as a turbine at a compressor station had an engine oil leak, sending wholesale gas prices soaring. When asked when Nord Stream 1 would start pumping gas again, Markelov said: “You should ask Siemens. They have to repair equipment first.” Siemens Energy said an engine oil leak at the last remaining turbine in operation at the Portovaya compressor station did not warrant keeping the pipeline closed. In a written statement, Siemens Energy said: We cannot comprehend this new representation based on the information provided to us over the weekend. Therefore, until further notice, our assessment is that the finding communicated to us does not represent a technical reason for stopping operation. Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site.” Finnish state-owned energy company Fortum said it has signed a bridge financing arrangement with Finnish government investment company Solidium for €2.35bn ($2.34bn/£2.02bn) to cover collateral needs in the Nordic power commodity market. It comes after the Finnish government on Sunday unveiled plans to offer up to €10bn in guarantees to the power industry after Russia’s Gazprom shut the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, worsening Europe’s energy shortage. Fortum chief executive Markus Rauramo said in a statement: The ongoing energy crisis in Europe is caused by Russia’s decision to use energy as a weapon and it is now also severely affecting Fortum and other Nordic power producers.” The Finnish government said: The arrangement is aimed at strengthening Fortum’s liquidity reserves and thereby securing Finnish energy supply.” The first instalment of the one-year loan would be €350m and it needs to be withdrawn by 30 September for the arrangement to remain effective, Fortum said. The effective annual interest cost for the bridge financing, including arrangement and commitment fees, would be 14.2%, it added. Russia’s economy is expected to contract by 2.9% this year before returning to growth in 2023-24, according to its economy minister Maxim Reshetnikov, as quoted by the Tass news agency. In its base case scenario, Russia’s economy ministry said it expected a 0.9% GDP contraction in 2023, up from predictions of a 2.7% decline made just last month, Reuters reports. Reshetnikov said the economy would return to periods of growth on a quarterly basis from as early as the end of this year. The economy ministry also forecast 2.6% growth in 2024, down from 3.7% it had predicted in August. Reshetnikov said the economy was on course to post GDP growth in excess of 3% a year after 2024. This new forecast is a significant improvement from the predictions made just last month when the economy ministry forecast a 4.2% contraction for 2022 and a 2.7% fall in GDP in 2023. Reshetnikov said expectations had improved as the Russian economy continued to weather the fallout from western sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine better than expected. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the newswires from Kharkiv. Russian energy giant Gazprom said it will ship 42.4m cubic metres of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Tuesday, a figure unchanged from Monday, Reuters reports. Further reaction from the Kremlin on its expectations of relations with Britain under the soon-to-be new prime minister, Liz Truss. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by the state TASS agency: Judging by statements made by Madame Truss when she was still foreign minister... one can say with much certainty that no changes for the better are expected.” In his farewell speech from Downing Street in London this morning, outgoing prime minister Boris Johnson referenced the early delivery of weapons to Ukraine. PA Media reports that Johnson added that the “early supplies of weapons to the heroic Ukrainian armed forces” may “very well have helped change the course of the biggest European war of 80 years”. He praised his government for getting “this economy moving again from July last year despite all the opposition”. Johnson continued: We have and will continue to have that economic strength to give people the cash they need to get through this energy crisis that has been caused by Putin’s vicious war. … And if Putin thinks that he can succeed by blackmailing or bullying the British people, then he is utterly deluded.” UK’s defence secretary Ben Wallace will be going to Germany this week to discuss longer-term funding for Ukraine, the Ministry of Defence says. President Vladimir Putin attended large-scale military exercises on Tuesday involving China and several other Russia-friendly countries, Kremlin, spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told local news agencies. Agence France-Presse reports: Putin was meeting with defence minister Sergei Shoigu and military chief of staff Valery Gerasimov at the Sergeevski military range and could observe the final phase of the military exercises later, Peskov was quoted as saying. The military drills, called Vostok-2022, started on 1 September and are due to take place until 7 September across several training grounds in Russia’s far east and in the waters off its eastern coast. According to Moscow, more than 50,000 soldiers and more than 5,000 units of military equipment, including 140 aircraft and 60 ships, will be involved in the drills. Participating countries include several of Russia’s neighbours, as well as Syria, India and key ally China. Similar drills were last held in 2018. The latest from the UK’s Ministry of Defence: Ukraine’s offensive operations in the Kherson region continued over the weekend. On 05 September 2022, the Odesa Journal reported 27 sorties by Russian uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) on the west bank of the Dnipro, compared to an average of 50 a day throughout August. On 21 August 2022, Ukrainian forces reported shooting down three Russian Orlan-10 tactical UAVs in a single day. In recent years, Russian doctrine has given an increasingly prominent role for UAVs, particularly to spot targets for its artillery to strike. UAVs can be vulnerable to both kinetic effects – where they are directly shot down – and to electronic jamming. In the face of combat losses, it is likely that Russia is struggling to maintain stocks of UAVs, exacerbated by component shortages resulting from international sanctions. The limited availability of reconnaissance UAVs is likely degrading commanders’ tactical situational awareness and increasingly hampering Russian operations.” A senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has claimed Ukraine’s forces are conducting counteroffensive actions in the east and south-east of the country. Counteroffensive actions by the Armed Forces of Ukraine are taking place not only in the south of Ukraine, but also in the east and southeast,” Oleksiy Arestovych said on his Telegram channel late on Monday evening. Since the beginning of the operation to liberate the south of Ukraine, our military has liberated several settlements on the western bank of the Dnieper. These are subtle movements on the map. But the beginning of counteroffensive actions on different sectors of the front on our part speaks of a change in the situation as a whole.” Arestovych claimed Russian forces on the right bank of the Dnieper are in “operational encirclement”, and predicted that within a month their position will be “extremely difficult”. Gazprom has introduced some confusion around the reasons for the closure of the Nord Stream 1 natural gas pipeline. Yesterday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, told journalists that sanctions “introduced against our country by western countries including Germany and the UK” were to blame for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. “Other reasons that would cause problems with the pumping don’t exist,” Peskov was cited by the Interfax news agency as saying. But Reuters reported on Tuesday that Gazprom’s deputy chief executive officer, Vitaly Markelov, went back to the original reason for the closure – maintenance problems – when he said it would not open until Siemens Energy repaired faulty equipment. “You should ask Siemens. They have to repair equipment first,” Markelov said on the sidelines of Eastern Economic Forum in Russian Pacific port of Vladivostok, when asked about when the pipeline could start pumping gas again. The Russian defence ministry is in the process of buying millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea to support its invasion of Ukraine, according to a newly downgraded US intelligence finding. A US official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said on Monday that the fact Russia was turning to North Korea demonstrated that “the Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions”. US intelligence officials believe that the Russians could look to purchase additional North Korean military equipment in the future. The intelligence finding was first reported by the New York Times. The finding comes after the Biden administration recently confirmed that the Russian military in August took delivery of Iranian-manufactured drones for use on the battlefield in Ukraine. US president Joe Biden has said Russia should not be designated a state sponsor of terrorism, a label Ukraine has pushed for amid Russia’s ongoing invasion while Moscow has warned it would rupture US-Russian ties. Asked if Russia should be designated a state sponsor of terrorism, Biden told reporters at the White House on Monday: “No.” Some US lawmakers have also pressed for the designation. An expert mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is set to release their findings from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a detailed report later on Tuesday. Four of the six UN mission members at the plant have left the site and the remaining two IAEA experts will stay on a permanent basis, the UN nuclear watchdog said. A statement released on Monday read: Director General Grossi will on Tuesday issue a report about the nuclear safety, security and safeguards situation in Ukraine – including the findings from the mission to the ZNPP – and later the same day brief the United Nations Security Council about the mission to the plant.” Zaporizhzhia city administrative head, Oleksandr Starukh, said via his Telegram channel on Monday: Today, the IAEA mission left the Zaporizhzhya NPP, so we are currently waiting not only for a report on the current situation, but for clear decisions. The nuclear power plant and the area around it must be demilitarised as soon as possible.” Ukraine’s president President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reiterated that the conclusions of the mission should be presented on Tuesday, adding: “I hope they will be objective.” The backup power line at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine has been disconnected to extinguish a fire, officials said on Monday. Due to a fire caused by shelling, the [backup] line was disconnected, that is the last line linking the ZNPP/ZTPP hub to the power system of Ukraine,” Ukrainian operator Energoatom said. As a result, the plant’s sixth and last functioning reactor was disconnected from the grid. However the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the line itself was not damaged. “The ZNPP continues to receive the electricity it needs for safety from its sole operating reactor,” it said. The back-up line “will be re-connected once the fire has been extinguished”, the UN nuclear watchdog added. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. An expert mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is set to release their findings from the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a detailed report later today. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden has said Russia should not be designated a state sponsor of terrorism, a label Ukraine has pushed for amid Russia’s ongoing invasion while Moscow has warned it would rupture US-Russian ties. It is 7.30am in Kyiv. Here is where things stand: Ukraine’s southern offensive has prompted Kherson separatists to “pause” a planned referendum on whether to become part of Russia. Russian state news agency Tass reported that the head of Kherson’s Russian-appointed authorities, Kirill Stremousov, said plans for a referendum on joining Russia had been “paused” because of the security situation. Ukraine has repelled Russian offensives in the east as well as hindering Russian positions near Kramatorsk, a key town in eastern Donetsk region, its armed forces claimed. In a situational update, it also claimed that Ukrainian troops had successes in disrupting Russian crossings near Kherson and in using long-range artillery in Kharkiv. In a rare acknowledgment of the Ukrainian counter-offensive, Russia said it pushed back assaults in Kherson. The backup power line at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine has been disconnected to extinguish a fire, officials said on Monday. “Due to a fire caused by shelling, the [backup] line was disconnected, that is the last line linking the ZNPP/ZTPP hub to the power system of Ukraine.” As a result, the plant’s sixth and last functioning reactor was disconnected from the grid, Ukrainian operator Energoatom said. However the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the line itself was not damaged. “The ZNPP continues to receive the electricity it needs for safety from its sole operating reactor,” it said. The back-up line “will be re-connected once the fire has been extinguished”, the UN nuclear watchdog added. Four of the six UN mission members at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left the site, Energoatom, Ukraine’s state enterprise operating all four nuclear power stations in the country, has said. The remaining two IAEA experts will stay on a permanent basis, it said. The agency is drawing up a report to be released this week. Liz Truss’s imminent arrival as British prime minister has been greeted with scorn from the Kremlin and praise in Ukraine. “I wouldn’t like to say that things can change for the worse, because it’s hard to imagine anything worse,” Vladimir Putin’s chief spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said when asked if Moscow expected any shift in relations with Britain. “But unfortunately, this cannot be ruled out.” Ukrainian politicians offered an exuberant welcome. “In Liz, we Truss” tweeted Ukrainian deputy Rustem Umerov. “Mrs Truss is a solid supporter of Ukraine. Hope for a fruitful ongoing partnership between the UK and Ukraine.” President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he was “looking forward to the start of cooperation” with Truss. Ukraine has sought political backing in Brussels for the creation of a special tribunal to prosecute Russian military and political leaders for their role in the war. Several Ukrainian leaders attending a conference on war crimes accountability in the European capital on Monday argued for a court dedicated to prosecuting high-level Russian perpetrators, in addition to the International Criminal Court. Russia will not resume in full its gas supplies to Europe until the west lifts its sanctions against Moscow, the Kremlin said, as gas prices surged on Monday and the pound and euro slumped. Speaking to journalists on Monday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, blamed sanctions for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. “It is these sanctions imposed by the western states that have brought the situation to what we see now.” A Russian court has sentenced journalist Ivan Safronov to 22 years in prison on trumped-up treason charges, a record sentence that has shocked those who gathered to protest against his imprisonment. Safronov, a former defence reporter for the Kommersant and Vedomosti dailies, was tried on secret evidence. A court in Moscow also stripped the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta of its print media licence, effectively banning the newspaper from operating inside Russia. Editor-in-chief, Dmitry Muratov, said the ruling was “a political hit job, without the slightest legal basis”. He said the paper would appeal. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, approved a new foreign policy doctrine based around the concept of a “Russian World”, a notion that conservative ideologues have used to justify intervention abroad in support of Russian-speakers. The 31-page “humanitarian policy”, published on Monday, says Russia should “protect, safeguard and advance the traditions and ideals of the Russian World”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2021/oct/27/rishi-sunaks-budget-is-gambling-with-the-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-27T15:06:00Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak’s budget is gambling with the climate crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/27/rishi-sunaks-budget-is-gambling-with-the-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2021/oct/27/rishi-sunaks-budget-is-gambling-with-the-climate-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Rishi Sunak’s budget is gambling with the climate crisis","bodyText":"In failing to make any serious new government investment in the UK’s green future, Rishi Sunak has chosen to gamble that the market will deliver instead. That is a very high-stakes bet in the face of a climate emergency. Four days before the UK hosts the crucial Cop26 climate summit, the virtual absence of the climate crisis from Sunak’s budget speech was startling. The most eye-catching announcement was the halving of taxes on domestic flights, which are already far cheaper and more polluting than trains. Sunak appeared to splash the cash for public transport in the UK’s city regions. But only £1.5bn turned out to be new money. The Green Alliance estimates £7.6bn a year is needed. Meanwhile, he announced £21bn for roads and a freezing of the duty on fossil fuels used by cars for the 12th year in a row. It could have been different. “This government chooses to invest” in a high-wage, hi-tech “economy fit for a new age of optimism”, said Sunak in his budget speech. He just wasn’t talking about the low-carbon economy. The UK government set out its net zero strategy last week. “Clearly, it’s a very market-led strategy,” said Chris Stark, head of the Climate Change Committee (CCC), the government’s official advisers. “We shall see how that fares.” Cutting emissions from homes is vital, but Sunak will part-subsidise just 30,000 heat pumps a year for three years. Will that get us to the government’s 600,000 a year in just six years’ time? Not many would take that wager, with the Green Alliance estimating funding needs to be three times higher. The government’s previous flutters on energy efficiency have been also-rans. The recent green homes grant was botched, according to the Public Accounts Committee. The earlier green deal also failed, despite clear prior warnings. “We think there is a significant risk in leaving it to the market, as that has never worked anywhere in the world and is unlikely to happen in the UK,” said Stark’s predecessor way back in 2011. One big punt Sunak is taking with taxpayers’ money is on a new nuclear power station, to be seeded with “up to £1.7bn of new direct government funding”. Energy bill payers will also pay upfront for the power plant, described as “writing a blank cheque that the consumer is on the hook for” by the BBC’s business editor. But nuclear power stations have an appalling record of delays and ballooning costs. In 2017, two nuclear power plants in South Carolina, funded by energy bill payers in a similar way, were abandoned, half-built, with billions of dollars down the drain. The cut in domestic air passenger duty follows the net zero strategy having nothing to say on curbing the growth of flying or reducing the amount of meat and dairy people eat. Ignoring these areas is another gamble, making hitting climate targets “more difficult and riskier”, the CCC said. “The recent net zero strategy was seen as a big step forward, but if the chancellor really wants to get the UK on track to net zero, an extra £21bn a year in public investment is needed,” said Sam Alvis, of the Green Alliance. The government has provided about half that but says it will leverage new private investments of up to £90bn by 2030. The Labour party has pledged £280bn of green capital investment by 2030, equivalent to half the defence budget, and by far the party’s biggest spending pledge. There is always an argument to be had about the relative roles of the state and private sector in investment. Sunak railed against “reckless unfunded pledges” on Wednesday and said “governments should have limits”. But Alvis said: “The fiscally responsible approach is to invest now rather than facing huge risks to the economy and environment later.” Four days from the most important global climate summit in history, Sunak mentioned Cop26 just once in passing. On Tuesday, economist Prof Nicholas Stern said: “The move to net zero [emissions] can be the growth story of the 21st century.” Missing this economic opportunity by playing roulette with climate action is shooting ourselves in the foot. But risking the catastrophic impacts of global heating means Sunak is playing Russian roulette – we may be shooting ourselves in the head."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/30/theres-no-doubt-its-a-war-horror-of-missile-strike-on-ukrainian-convoy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-30T14:23:46Z","webTitle":"‘Deliberate war crime’: horror as Russian missile hits civilian convoy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/30/theres-no-doubt-its-a-war-horror-of-missile-strike-on-ukrainian-convoy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/30/theres-no-doubt-its-a-war-horror-of-missile-strike-on-ukrainian-convoy","fields":{"headline":"‘Deliberate war crime’: horror as Russian missile hits civilian convoy","bodyText":"In the dirt car park of a sprawling car parts market just outside the city of Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, the bodies told horrific stories of the moment a Russian missile struck a civilian convoy, killing 25 and injuring scores more. A man in late middle age was slumped inside his car, one hand holding the steering wheel. Not far away, partially covered in a sheet, another person appeared to be kneeling, collapsed next to the wheelie case they had been pulling. Two women, limbs broken and twisted, lay where it appeared they had been talking next to a car in a queue of shattered vehicles that had been waiting to form into a convoy that – in a grim irony – would have taken them into Russian-occupied territory to the south, approved to enter by Russian forces. While some had died instantly, others had managed to escape their cars and stagger a few brief steps before succumbing. Police and soldiers zipped the bodies of the dead into black bags and searched through wallets and handbags to find identification. At 7.15am on Friday, dozens of cars had gathered to wait for a routine convoy to set off for the Russian-occupied territory that begins 12 miles away. About 150 cars are allowed each day by the Russians to make the journey south heading for cities such as Mariupol and Melitopol. The cars and minivans were full of items to bring to families still in the south – bedding and children’s toys, clothes and food. Some travellers would have hoped to pick up relatives to bring them back to Ukrainian-controlled territory amid fears that Russia’s annexation of four regions in Ukraine will leave many trapped. At that moment, a Russian S-300 missile ploughed into the ground 10 metres from the cars as they waited for an escort for their journey. The blast tore through metal, shattered windscreens and blew out the windows of food kiosks and shops over a wide distance. Volodymyr Marchuk, a spokesperson for the local governor’s office, told the Guardian what had happened. “[The car parts market] is a logistic hub to allow people go into the temporarily Russian-occupied territories. The Russians only accept 150 cars a day so that’s why we created a programme where people could go there to register and get their number in the line. “At 7.15 this morning there were a large number of cars waiting for their turn to cross, mostly people who want to go to and drop off aid to relatives. Maybe pick up people who want to leave on the way back. “That was the queue they hit with an S-300 missile. There’s no doubt it is a deliberate war crime. They always say they are aiming at a military object and hit something else. But there are no military objects near that site. That’s why there’s no doubt that it’s a terrorist act.” With scores of injured removed to local hospitals, emergency workers carried on with the grim task of identification and removal of bodies. Among the dead were eight people who were travelling with drivers from Help People, a Ukrainian NGO, including a three-month-old child. The group’s founder, Alex Voronin, said they had intended to travel to Melitopol to meet family members. “We had a car and a minibus going to Melitopol. Out of that group, two survived, a nine-year-old boy and his mother, but we don’t know their condition. They were going to their family who live there. They were trying to get home and get stuff and help relatives get evacuated.” He added: “Every day there are a lot of vans going to Melitopol and Mariupol, but the rules of the Russians have been becoming more strict. There’s only one road – the green corridor, we call it.” Standing on the road near the car park, Dalina Yakushava, 48, had arrived after the explosion to see if she could confirm her place in a convoy. “This is where people are told to come and register by the authorities to join a convoy. You register online but I came to make sure my permission had been received,” she said. “I live in Mariupol. We just drove our daughter to Poland but we need to go back because my parents are there. It’s terrible but it is our home. There were a lot of cars waiting to leave this morning because no one has been able to go into the occupied areas for the past week.” On Friday, the traffic was in both directions. A short drive away along the same road towards the Russian lines, hundreds of cars queued near a Ukrainian checkpoint waiting for an escort, their occupants relieved to be crossing over. At the front of the queue, Nadya Nekustorova was playing with her 11-month-old daughter, Maria, as her husband, Dymytro, watched. “We’re coming from Melitopol,” Nadya said. “We won’t go back until it is back under Ukrainian control. My parents are staying, which is a worry, but we wanted to leave because the Russians have said they will close the crossing to men from 1 October. We realised this might be our final chance. The Russians came to ask us if we were voting in the [sham] referendum. We said no so it seemed like we should leave.” “It was a joke,” said Dymytro. “They were all just voting for themselves. The voting paper was a piece of copied A4. There were no seals or numbers to identify the vote was genuine. It was all fake. My brother has rented a flat in Zaporizhzhia so we’ll stay with him.” Further down the line of cars, Alla Votovska, 68, and her son Viktor said they had waited for four days to come to the checkpoint from a village near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. “Everyone is trying to leave,” said Viktor. “But they would only let a few cars leave from our village each day, so we had to keep coming back. Other people are trying to leave as well via the Crimea for Poland and Europe. Half of our village has left.” Suddenly the cars were moving, heading for Zaporizhzhia on a road that would take them past the dead whose convoy had not been so lucky."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/16/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-205-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-16T10:15:09Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 205 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/16/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-205-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/16/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-205-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 205 of the invasion","bodyText":"Prosecutors, police officers and journalists are heading to Izium after authorities there said they had found a mass grave containing more than 440 bodies. Some of the people had been killed by shelling and airstrikes, authorities said. Serhiy Bolvinov, the chief police investigator for Kharkiv province, said forensic investigations would be carried out on every body in the grave, which was reportedly located in woods near the city. While authorities said some had been killed by shelling and airstrikes, investigators have prepared themselves for the worst, after the discoveries of slain civilians bearing signs of torture in Bucha and other previously occupied territories. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy likened the discovery to what happened in Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, saying in his Thursday night video address: “Russia is leaving death behind it everywhere and must be held responsible. The necessary procedures have already begun there. More information – clear, verifiable information – should be available tomorrow.” Andriy Yermak, the presidential chief of staff in Ukraine, accused Russia of being “a murderer country, a state sponsor of terrorism.” Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, urged people “don’t look away” from the images emerging from liberated Ukrainian cities like Izium. She said “This is the face of Russian occupation: towns and cities turned into mass graves. Ukraine has used our military aid with skill and determination. Ukraine can win if we keep supporting them.” Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out targeted strikes in the cities of Kherson and Luhansk against local officials who have been collaborating with Moscow. At least five Himars missiles crashed into the central administration building in Kherson. Video from the scene showed smoke pouring out of the complex and debris, and the local Russian-imposed authorities said that at least one person was killed. Ukraine’s military declined to comment on the explosions. Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Kyiv’s operation command south, said Kyiv was keen to avoid “informational chaos”. “Happiness loves silence,” she remarked. On the other side of the country, in the eastern city of Luhansk, a pro-Russia prosecutor and his deputy died when their office was blown up. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear. The Kremlin news agency Itar-Tass said Sergey Gorenko, the prosecutor general for the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, died at the scene. Zelenskiy’s senior adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine was not behind Friday’s mysterious explosion. The Russian-backed separatist authority in Berdiansk has blamed Kyiv for “the double murder” of the deputy head of the military civil administration, and his wife, who headed the city’s territorial election commission for a proposed referendum on whether the region would join the Russian Federation. Iryna Vereshchuk, the minister of reintegration of temporarily occupied territories, has said Ukraine’s government has approved a draft law that will punish people for forcing Russian passports on to Ukrainian citizens. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Ukraine’s counterattack against Russian troops had been very effective, but warned nations should prepare for the long haul as this did not signal the beginning of the end of the war. He said: “We need to understand that this is not the beginning of the end of the war, we need to be prepared for the long haul.” Germany has taken the German subsidiary of the Russian oil giant Rosneft under state control, putting three refineries into a trusteeship ahead of a partial European embargo on Russian oil at the end of the year. The federal network regulator will become the temporary trust manager of Rosneft Germany and its share of refineries in Schwedt, near Berlin, in Karlsruhe and in Vohburg, Bavaria, Germany’s ministry for economic affairs announced on Friday. The European Union chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said she wanted the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to face the international criminal court over war crimes in Ukraine. “That Putin must lose this war and must face up to his actions, that is important to me,” she told the TV channel of the German news outlet Bild on Thursday. Pope Francis said it was morally legitimate for countries to provide weapons to Ukraine to help it defend itself from Russian aggression. “This is a political decision which it can be moral, morally acceptable, if it is done under conditions of morality … Self-defence is not only licit but also an expression of love for the homeland,” he said. “Someone who does not defend oneself, who does not defend something, does not love it. Those who defend [something] love it.” Vladimir Putin thanked the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, for his “balanced” approach to the Ukraine crisis and blasted Washington’s “ugly” policies, at a meeting that followed the recent setbacks for Moscow on the battlefield. Ukraine has lost nearly 15% of its grain storage capacity in the war, threatening its role as a key food supplier to the world, a report said. The US government-backed Conflict Observatory said Russians had seized 6.24m tonnes of food storage capacity, and another 2.25m tonnes of capacity in Ukrainian hands had been destroyed, Agence France-Presse reported. As a result, farmers were running out of room to store their output for shipment, which could discourage plantings for the next crop, especially winter wheat, the report said. Germany will supply Ukraine with additional armoured vehicles and rocket launch systems but will not provide the battle tanks that Kyiv has long asked for, says the German defence minister, Christine Lambrecht. She said on Thursday that Soviet-made BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles would also “very quickly” head to Ukraine from Greece. The UN nuclear watchdog’s 35-nation board of governors passed a resolution demanding Russia end its occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, Reuters reports. Thursday’s resolution was the second on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine passed by the International Atomic Energy Agency’s board. The US president, Joe Biden, announced a new $600m arms package for Ukraine, according to a White House memo sent to the state department on Thursday. Reuters reports the memo does not detail how the money will be used, but sources said it was expected to include munitions and more Himars rocket systems."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/20/erdogan-russia-iran-syria-putin-khamenei","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-20T09:50:44Z","webTitle":"Erdoğan asks Russia and Iran to back Turkey’s incursion into Syria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/20/erdogan-russia-iran-syria-putin-khamenei","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/20/erdogan-russia-iran-syria-putin-khamenei","fields":{"headline":"Erdoğan asks Russia and Iran to back Turkey’s incursion into Syria","bodyText":"The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has used trilateral talks with his Iranian and Russian counterparts in Tehran to make the case for a further Turkish incursion into north-western Syria. Erdoğan cited Kurdish forces in Tel Rifaat and Manbij, two towns in north-west Syria where Russian and Iranian forces are present, as justification for Turkey extending its zone of control in the country. “What we expect from Iran and Russia is to support Turkey in its fight against terrorist organisations,” he told a press conference following the meeting. The Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Erdoğan against a further invasion during talks at his office, stating that “a military incursion of Syria will benefit terrorists”. The visit to Tehran provided Erdoğan with an opportunity to reaffirm ties to both Tehran and Moscow, along with plentiful opportunities to court Moscow’s cooperation on key issues. Putin and Erdoğan greeted each other warmly at the start of their bilateral talks, despite a brief moment where the Turkish leader kept his counterpart waiting. The talks provided an opportunity for Erdoğan to secure Moscow’s backing for a tentative agreement to evacuate grain across the Black Sea with a control centre in Istanbul, with UN-backed talks expected to continue in Istanbul this week. “With your mediation, we have moved forward. True, not all issues have yet been resolved, but the fact that there is movement is already good,” Putin told Erdoğan. The Turkish president later referred to his counterpart as “my dear friend Putin” during a roundtable discussion on Syria. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, Turkish authorities have insisted on balancing the country’s Nato membership with its longstanding relationship with Moscow. Turkey has hosted peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, and sold Ukraine armed drones for use against Russian forces. Haluk Bayraktar, who heads the company manufacturing the TB2 drones used in Ukraine, told CNN shortly before Erdoğan arrived in Tehran that his company would never sell drones to Russia, as “we support Ukraine, its sovereignty and its resistance”. But Turkey has declined to join sanctions against Russia, stepped up its purchases of Russian oil since the invasion, and continues to push ahead with construction of a nuclear power plant by the Russian state company Rosatom, under threat due to western sanctions on Sberbank, a major backer of the project. “Russia can’t afford not to engage with Turkey. They want a relationship with Turkey as a Nato ally – that wouldn’t change even if Putin and Erdoğan step aside tomorrow,” said Hanna Notte, an analyst at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation. “But the fact they deal so efficiently and closely on issues, that you can put down to the Putin-Erdoğan rapport,” she added, saying the leaders share elements of anti-western sentiment that has fuelled a longstanding personal relationship. “They share a view of the world as multipolar, where countries outside of the west should have a say on how things are run.” Yet Erdoğan’s approach to foreign policy rests on showing that Turkey acts independently, putting its interests first. This aids his appeal to a domestic audience ahead of an election expected in the coming year, where Erdoğan faces increasing opposition. Despite previously lifting objections to Finland and Sweden joining Nato and securing the lifting of some weapons sales in the process, Erdoğan this week repeated threats to “freeze” their accession if Turkish demands aren’t met. At a Nato summit in Madrid in late June, Erdoğan’s tactics secured him a meeting with the US president, Joe Biden, who stated his support for sales of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey, despite ongoing opposition from Congress. Last week, the Turkish president leaned on Putin during a phone call in which he pressed for Russian agreement on the UN security council’s cross-border aid mechanism providing vital aid to more than 2 million Syrians in rebel-held areas in the north-west, blunting Russian threats to veto the aid renewal altogether. “There’s all this leverage building up because of Ukraine and all these crises at once; it would be surprising if Erdoğan doesn’t try to squeeze something out of this moment, as this is what he does,” said Aron Lund, of the Washington-based thinktank the Century Foundation. “Under Erdoğan, especially in the latter half of his rule, Turkey is always stirring up crises and then getting something in return for stopping them. That’s been the modus operandi all along,” said Lund. “It damages Turkey’s standing in a lot of countries. We witnessed a severe lack of appreciation for this in Congress and in the EU parliament, for example. But Erdoğan doesn’t care, or doesn’t seem to. He can show off the results to aid public opinion and he benefits domestically – plus Turkey benefits in real foreign policy terms, they do get results,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/01/ukraine-forces-encircle-thousands-of-russian-troops-in-key-city","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-01T14:42:25Z","webTitle":"Ukrainian forces perform victory dance after liberating eastern city of Lyman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/01/ukraine-forces-encircle-thousands-of-russian-troops-in-key-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/01/ukraine-forces-encircle-thousands-of-russian-troops-in-key-city","fields":{"headline":"Ukrainian forces perform victory dance after liberating eastern city of Lyman","bodyText":"Russia suffered a humiliating military defeat on Saturday when Ukrainian troops liberated the key eastern city of Lyman, with videos showing them raising a blue and yellow national flag and performing a victory dance. In a severe embarrassment for Vladimir Putin, Russia’s ministry of defence admitted its soldiers had retreated. They had been “withdrawn to more advantageous lines”, the ministry said, after their encirclement by Ukrainian forces. The debacle came hours after Putin announced on Friday that the city, which is a part of the Donetsk region, was Russia’s “for ever”. In a ceremony in the Kremlin he announced the province’s annexation, together with the territories of Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. But Putin’s high-stakes strategy appeared to be unravelling on the battlefield. Russian nationalist bloggers vented their fury at the military command in Moscow, while Chechnya’s president, Ramzan Kadyrov, published a scathing critique of its many failures. Writing on Telegram, Kadryov called on the Kremlin to consider using a “low-yield nuclear weapon” in the wake of its Lyman setback. He asked sarcastically what cities Russia might lose next, adding: “Everything would be good if it wasn’t so bad.” Earlier on Saturday Ukraine’s armed forces said they had entirely surrounded the city, trapping thousands of Russian soldiers inside. The governor of Luhansk province, Serhiy Haidai, said the besieged troops had begged on Friday to be allowed to leave Lyman. Their commanders refused, he claimed. With no way out, the Russians could either surrender, try to escape or die together, Haidai said. “A colossal grouping” of up to 5,000 enemy soldiers was facing defeat, he added. Ukrainian drone footage from Friday showed a column of vehicles heading west, together with civilian vehicles. Russian military bloggers reported that Ukrainian servicemen had entered the centre of the city, and were handing out food to residents. Shelling and small arms fire had stopped. “Whatever promises there were to send us reinforcements never materialised,” one admitted. Mobile phone footage showed Ukrainian soldiers walking calmly over a destroyed bridge near the village of Torske. Ukrainian forces also liberated several other surrounding settlements including Yampil, south of Lyman, Novoselivka, Shandrigolovo and Drobysheve. Video from Shandrigolovo showed Ukrainian soldiers pulling down the Russian tricolour. They threw it to the ground and stamped on it. The Kremlin’s debacle in Lyman followed a series of dramatic advances by Ukrainian forces. Last month they almost completely liberated the north-eastern Kharkiv region. On Saturday its governor, Oleh Synyehubov, said Russia had shelled a civilian evacuation convoy, killing 20 people. They had been fleeing from Kupiansk, a town about 3.5 miles (6 km) from the frontline. The attack appears to have happened several days ago. The victims reportedly included several children. Footage showed bodies slumped in cars and the skeletons of two passengers sitting in front seats who appear to have been incinerated. Synyehubov said Moscow was guilty of “cruelty that can’t be justified”. On Thursday Russian troops attacked another convoy waiting to enter Russian-controlled territory in Zaporizhzhia, killing 30 civilians, including two children, and wounding dozens. In recent days Ukrainian battalions pushed further into occupied territory around Lyman. On Saturday Russia’s defences crumbled. It was unclear how many Russian-armoured vehicles managed to escape. Video showed the apparent aftermath of an artillery strike, with burnt-out vehicles by the side of a forest road, personal belongings strewn in the mud and dead Russian soldiers. The rapid Ukrainian counteroffensive appears to have triggered Putin’s speech on Friday, when he announced that Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts were now irrevocably part of Russia, after so-called “referendums” last week. The Kremlin controls almost all of Luhansk and Kherson provinces, but only parts of the other two regions. The UN, the US, UK and other western nations have condemned Russia’s attempted annexation as illegal and meaningless. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said Kyiv will liberate all of its territory including Crimea. On Friday he formally applied for Ukraine to join Nato as soon as possible. The Kremlin has not commented on its stunning military rout in Lyman. Ukrainian commentators pointed out gleefully that Putin was the first invader in world history to announce the annexation of new territory at the same moment his troops were retreating from it. In Friday’s rambling and grudge-filled speech Putin denounced the west and portrayed his invasion of Ukraine as a just and necessary response to an attempt by the US and its allies to “colonise” Russia. He promised to “protect” the newly annexed lands “with all the forces at our disposal”. Zelenskiy has shrugged off Putin’s nuclear threats and made clear negotiations would only be possible with a new Russian leader. On Saturday he tweeted his thanks to President Biden, and to bipartisan legislators in Washington, for the US’s latest $12.3bn support package for Ukraine. It includes 18 additional Himars long-range artillery systems. The high-precision weapon has played a critical role in Ukraine’s recent successful offensives, in the east and in the south around the occupied city of Kherson, where the Ukrainian army is squeezing fortified Russian positions. Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it was seeking information following reports that a Russian patrol had abducted the head of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which Moscow has occupied since March. Igor Murashov disappeared on his way to work on Friday. His whereabouts are unknown. Unverified reports suggested the Russians were seeking to force Murashov to work for Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear energy agency. He and about 7,000 other Ukrainian staff at the plant are employed by Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear organisation, based in Kyiv. The plant’s six reactors are in cold storage. Rosatom experts sent from Moscow have been trying to connect the station with the Russian power grid, in order to supply energy to Crimea. “We have contacted Russian authorities and are requesting clarifications,” a IAEA spokesperson said. The sudden collapse of Russia’s forces in Lyman opens up the possibility of further Ukrainian gains. Ukrainian battalions can push north towards the town of Svatove or east to Kreminna, Haidai, the Luhansk governor, said. Beyond that are a cluster of cities which Russia seized over the summer after long pulverising battles – Sievierodonetsk, Rubizhne and Lysychansk. In its Kharkiv region offensive Ukraine’s eastern command captured dozens of armoured vehicles left behind by fleeing Russians including T-90 tanks, fuel trucks, and mortars. It was unclear how much Russian equipment had been left behind in Lyman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/19/a-guide-to-the-uk-energy-security-strategy-cost-of-living-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-19T09:00:22Z","webTitle":"A guide to the UK energy security strategy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/19/a-guide-to-the-uk-energy-security-strategy-cost-of-living-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/19/a-guide-to-the-uk-energy-security-strategy-cost-of-living-crisis","fields":{"headline":"A guide to the UK energy security strategy","bodyText":"What is the energy security strategy? Soaring energy prices are helping to create a cost-of-living crisis, with the average family’s energy bill rising by 54%. The energy price cap has been raised to £1,971 and a further increase is expected later this year, which would take the average household bill to about £2,300. The government has responded by offering a one-off £200 discount on bills from October, to be paid back over five years. The UK is not alone: energy prices are rising around the world as industries struck by Covid-19 lockdowns resume operations, and energy supplies still need to ramp up after plunging two years ago during the first lockdowns. The war in Ukraine is adding to the problem: Vladimir Putin has used his dominance over EU energy supplies (Russia supplies 40% of Europe’s gas, and 60% of Germany’s) as a weapon of war, and turned down the gas taps by a quarter before the invasion. Putin could tighten supplies still further, and in any case the EU wants to move away from Russian fossil fuels to stem the flow of money to the Kremlin war machine – Europe has paid more than €15bn (£12.6bn) for Russian gas, oil and coal since the invasion began. The UK relies less on Russian fuel, which makes up only 3% of UK gas supplies and about 8% of oil, but British consumers will be hit anyway as the price of gas is set by international markets that are badly affected by the war. Now the government is publishing a strategy to secure the UK’s energy supplies and try to dampen soaring costs for consumers and industry. What will be in it? Renewable energy will play a significant role, with the government planning to rapidly increase the goal for offshore wind generation, and relax the planning rules that have prevented onshore windfarms being built in England for most of the last decade. Nuclear power will get a boost, with the government seeking to help investors expand the UK’s reactor fleet. Keeping the UK’s existing nuclear power stations open as long as possible will help provide stability through the current crisis and beyond, but any new reactors are likely to take more than a decade to start producing power. Fossil fuels will also be a big focus for the strategy, with the government seeking to expand the UK’s supplies of gas and oil, pumping more from the North Sea and making overtures to big Middle Eastern suppliers such as Saudi Arabia. New licences for the North Sea, already under way, will be brought forward. What about fracking? The government is leaving the door open to fracking, saying that it could be allowed if health and safety conditions are met, but few in Whitehall see any real future for fracking in the UK. Fracking at scale would require the industrialisation of swathes of the UK’s landscape, would face huge local opposition, would be expensive and would take years to produce any gas. It is not a solution to the current crisis and the carbon dioxide emissions it would generate make it unsuitable for any future crisis. Could we go back to coal? Coal, the dirtiest form of electricity generation, is to be phased out in the UK by 2024. But the government is understood to have made informal contacts to the UK’s remaining coal operators – EDF, Uniper and Drax, which has converted its boilers to biomass but could feasibly return to coal – as a contingency. Whitehall sources claim this is only a question of sensibly keeping options open in case of deepening crisis, rather than overtures to a coal renaissance. What will not be in the strategy? A windfall tax on fossil fuel companies. Such a tax would have serious backing – the International Energy Agency, regarded as the gold standard on energy policy advice and not known for its radicalism, has advocated a windfall tax in the EU, with the proceeds to be used to ease energy bills for vulnerable people. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have also called for one in the UK. Unfreezing the fuel duty escalator would raise billions that could be recycled to the poorest. Petrol taxes have been kept steady since 2010, resulting in an £11bn loss to the Treasury in 2019, and fuel-guzzling SUVs now make up about half of new cars bought. Making public transport free would be a radical move to get people out of cars overnight, and slash petrol and diesel demand while leading to clearer skies, less air pollution and safer roads for walking and cycling. And a nationwide push to insulate every home to decent standards, and install heat pumps in place of gas boilers, would slash the UK’s energy bills and end the need to import fossil fuels from this year if pursued at speed. But these measures have been ruled out by the Treasury and other departments. What is happening to fossil fuel companies? Party time. They are enjoying a bonanza, with BP’s chief boasting his company was a “cash machine”, and his finance chief that he has “more money than we know what to do with”. Dangerously for the Earth’s climate, they are using this to cement their lobbying power, telling governments they should invest in expanding oil, gas and even coal. But an increasing number of political leaders are seeing the war in Ukraine as a sign that clean, domestically produced renewable energy can bolster national security. What will all of this do to net zero? The government is expected to reaffirm its commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, despite agitation from a small number of rightwing Tory backbenchers and Nigel Farage. Boris Johnson is said to be a personal champion of green issues within the cabinet, and Michael Gove, the secretary for levelling up, spoke out strongly in favour of net zero this week. Are energy prices the only factor behind the cost-of-living crisis? No, the prices of food, clothing and other goods are also rising. Inflation is affecting many countries as economies recover from the Covid-19 recession, and the war in Ukraine has added to pressures, particularly over food as Ukraine and Russia are leading grain and oil exporters. But another factor unique to the UK that is raising prices is Brexit, as imports and exports now face extra costs, paperwork, staff shortages and other barriers. But don’t expect this government to admit that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/19/joe-biden-climate-emergency","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-19T21:37:31Z","webTitle":"Biden under pressure to declare climate emergency after Manchin torpedoes bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/19/joe-biden-climate-emergency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/19/joe-biden-climate-emergency","fields":{"headline":"Biden under pressure to declare climate emergency after Manchin torpedoes bill","bodyText":"Joe Biden is under pressure to declare a national climate emergency as temperatures soar across the US and Europe. Facing political gridlock in Washington, the president could make such an announcement – which would unlock federal resources to address the crisis – as soon as this week, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday. Biden will visit a coal-turned-wind power plant in Massachusetts on Wednesday, to promote his climate action efforts. Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said Biden would announce “additional actions” to fight the climate crisis on Wednesday but ruled out the declaration of a national emergency for now. “He’s not going to just stop with the actions of tomorrow but I would not plan an announcement this week on national climate emergency,” Jean-Pierre said at the daily White House briefing. “Again, everything is on the table. It’s just not going to be this week on that decision … I don’t have a date circled on the calendar.” The president indicated last week that he would take steps to reduce carbon emissions after the West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin – a crucial swing vote in the evenly divided Senate – withdrew support for climate legislation Democrats had hoped to pass before leaving Washington for the August recess and as they face tough midterm elections in November. But the president’s ability to work around Congress remains limited and the impact of declaring a climate emergency, for all its symbolism, remains ambiguous. Lack of comprehensive action puts at risk goals to curb global heating. The Post’s report noted that some climate activists have argued that declaring an emergency would allow Biden “to halt crude oil exports, limit oil and gas drilling in federal waters, and direct agencies including the Federal Emergency Management Agency to boost renewable energy sources”. However, such measures could face legal challenges from Republicans critical of what they perceive as executive overreach. Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review magazine, tweeted in response to the report: “Yet again [the White House] advertises contempt for the rules of our constitutional republic.” The constraints were underlined last month when the supreme court effectively restricted the Environmental Protection Agency from issuing emissions rules involving matters of great “economic and political significance”. Democrats, however, are eager to see Biden take action as the planetary alarm rings ever louder: CNN reported that nearly 20% of the US population will probably see a temperature at or above 100F (37.7C) this week. Britain recorded its highest ever temperature of 104F (40C) as the heatwave gripping Europe intensified. Two Senate Democrats, Jeff Merkley and Sheldon Whitehouse, urged the president to declare a climate emergency and use the Defense Production Act – designed for use in wartime – to increase production of renewable energy products and systems including solar panels. Merkley tweeted: “[Biden] needs to go big on climate – starting by declaring a climate emergency so we can take bold action NOW on the disastrous impacts climate chaos has on our health, environment, and economy.” Whitehouse, who has called for tighter carbon regulations for vehicles and power plants and possible federal litigation against the fossil fuel industry, told reporters: “I’ve talked to the White House about going on offense and being aggressive and doing all the things that it is within the executive powers to do that have not so far been done.” The brutal contrast between political inaction and catastrophic global heating has led some to question whether America’s institutions of government are fit for purpose. David Axelrod, a former strategist for Barack Obama, tweeted: “We are fiddling as the world burns.” Biden has been trying to signal to voters that he is tackling global heating at a time when some supporters have despaired about the lack of progress. He has pledged to push forward on his own in the absence of congressional action. Jared Bernstein, a White House economic adviser, told reporters: “The president will aggressively fight to attack climate change because he knows it’s one of the reasons he’s here. And it is absolutely core to transitioning from where we are to where we need to be.” Manchin and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, had been in talks about $300bn in tax credits for industries including solar and wind power, carbon capture from power plants and nuclear power, which generates virtually emissions-free electricity. Manchin has blamed inflation for his rejection of spending on climate legislation. Activists have warned that time is running out for the US to cut emissions and encourage other countries to do the same. Scientists say inaction will lead to “irreversible” impacts such as heatwaves, floods, wildfires and a mass upheaval of displaced people. Ben King, an associate director at the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, told the AP the US is “nowhere close” to meeting goals set by Biden for reducing emissions. Biden escalated the US emissions reduction target of 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030. Under policies in place at the federal and state level, the US is on track to reach a reduction of 24% to 35%, according to the Rhodium Group."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/24/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-182-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-24T00:45:34Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 182 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/24/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-182-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/24/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-182-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 182 of the invasion","bodyText":"Russian opposition politician Yevgeny Roizman was shown being detained at his home in a video published on social media on Wednesday. Video of the arrest showed Roizman, former mayor of the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, being taken away by law enforcement officials. Roizman was seen in the video telling reporters that he was being investigated under a law against discrediting the armed forces. He said he was being arrested “basically for one phrase, ‘the invasion of Ukraine’”. Pope Francis has called for “concrete steps” to end the war in Ukraine and avert the risk of a nuclear disaster at the Zaporizhzhia power plant, reports Reuters. IAEA, the UN nuclear watchdog, said on Tuesday it would visit the Russian-occupied plant in Ukraine within days if talks to gain access succeed. Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of firing at the facility, the largest of its kind in Europe and which pro-Moscow forces took over soon after the 24 February invasion. The United Nations has called for the area to be demilitarised. A Russian-installed head of the town of Mykhailivka in the Russian-controlled part of the Zaporizhzhia region in south-eastern Ukraine was killed in a car bomb on Tuesday, an official said. Ivan Sushko was critically injured when a bomb placed under his car exploded, Zaporizhzhia region administration member Vladimir Rogov said on Telegram. Norway and Britain will jointly supply micro drones to Ukraine to aid in its war with Russia, reports Reuters. The cost of the Teledyne Flir Black Hornet drones, used for reconnaissance and target identification, will be up to 90m Norwegian crowns (£7.4m), the Norwegian defence ministry said in a statement. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told Ukrainians on Wednesday in an emotional speech to mark 31 years of independence that Ukraine was reborn when Russia invaded and would recapture annexed Crimea and occupied areas in the east. In the recorded speech aired on the six-month anniversary of Russia’s 24 February invasion, Zelenskiy said Ukraine no longer saw the war ending when there was peace, but when Kyiv was actually victorious. Former Conservative leadership contender Tom Tugendhat has disclosed he is in Kyiv as Ukraine marks 31 years since it declared independence from the Soviet Union. “Here in Kyiv we’re in shelters after being woken by the air raid siren,” the Commons foreign affairs committee chairman tweeted in response to a post by British journalist John Sweeney. He later posted a video of himself next to destroyed tanks in the centre of Kyiv and praised the commitment of Britain in helping Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Ukraine is bracing for possible Russian strikes as it marks its independence day and 31 years since the end of Soviet rule. Authorities have cancelled celebrations in Kyiv as officials warn that Russia is preparing to attack the capital. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he had information from Ukraine’s intelligence services and international partners that there was an increased threat, as the US said it believed Russia would target civilian and government infrastructure in the next few days. Ukraine’s defence ministry advised Ukrainians to be especially careful, citing the threat of missile attacks and “provocations” from Russia. Many civilians were attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack, according to an adviser to Ukraine’s president. Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” an attack may strike the centres of decision-making on Wednesday. Russia and the Putin regime “are really obsessed with dates and symbols, so it would be logical to be on the lookout and be prepared for independence day to be attacked”, said Andriy Yusov, the head of the ministry’s intelligence directorate. Zelenskiy has warned Russia of a strong response to any independence day attacks. Russia “will receive a response, a powerful response”. Zelenskiy said Ukraine will not agree to any proposal to freeze the current frontlines in order to “calm” Moscow, which controls about 22% of Ukraine including Crimea. “At the point where we are, we are not ready for a ceasefire. We explained that there will be no Minsk-3, Minsk-5, or Minsk-7. We will not play these games, we have lost part of our territories this way … it is a trap,” he said during a press conference after a summit of the Crimea Platform in Kyiv. Zelenskiy also vowed to return Crimea to Ukraine, saying it would become part of the EU along with the rest of the country. “We will return Crimea, because it is our territory. In any way we decide. We will decide it on our own, without consulting any other state. It all began with Crimea, and it will end with Crimea.” The UN nuclear watchdog said it would visit the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine “within the next few days if ongoing negotiations succeed”. The US is set to announce a fresh security assistance package for Ukraine of about $3bn (£2.5bn), officials have said, to equip it for a war of attrition and secure its medium- to long-term defence posture. The money will fund contracts for as many as three types of drones, and other weapons, ammunition and equipment that may not see the battlefront for a year or two, US officials told the Associated Press. Hundreds of people gathered in Moscow for the funeral of Darya Dugina. Dugina, daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was killed on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside Moscow.

This is after new legislation has been passed by the Russian authorities, which imposes a jail term of up to 15 years for people who intentionally spread “fake” information about Russia’s armed forces. The Metropolitan police’s war crimes team is gathering evidence in relation to alleged war crimes in Ukraine to support the international criminal court (ICC) investigation, the force said. The shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been strongly condemned by both the foreign secretary Liz Truss and defence secretary Ben Wallace. Truss called it a “completely reckless act”. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has asked government lawyers to “find literally any way” to crack down on “Slapps” – or strategic lawsuits against public participation – where the wealthy exploit lengthy and expensive legal procedures to silence journalists, critics and watchdogs. The Disasters Emergency Committee’s (DEC) Ukraine appeal has raised 55 million in its first day.The total includes “generous” donations from the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, DEC said. Priti Patel has said Ukrainians fleeing into Poland were escaping “the most atrocious set of circumstances where they are being persecuted by President Putin”. Boris Johnson is concerned for the safety of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, Downing Street has said. The prime minister has regularly spoken to the Ukrainian leader and has expressed his personal admiration of him. Former prime minister Gordon Brown criticised Russia for not making a statement regarding safety on the nuclear power station in south-eastern Ukraine it has taken control of, saying that is a “failure to respond to the pleas of the international community”. That’s it from us for today. For the latest news on Ukraine, follow our dedicated live blog: Here’s a bit more detail from Reuters about the legislation that has prompted the BBC to suspend its work in Russia: Russia’s upper house of parliament approved a draft law on Friday that would impose a jail term of up to 15 years for people who intentionally spread “fake” information about Russia’s armed forces, the TASS news agency reported. The bill will become law once President Vladimir Putin signs it, as he is widely expected to do. Moscow says it is fighting back in what it casts as an information war with the West over the conflict in Ukraine. Meanwhile The Moscow Times reports that the document was adopted unanimously. Examples of “fakes” about military operations that are punishable by up to 15 years in prison were provided to the lawmakers including the use of old photos of burned military equipment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces that have been photoshopped to have markings of the Russian military. The explanatory note to the bill also states that Ukrainian media is using footage of the devastation in the Donbas region from 2014-2015 and passing it off as crimes perpetrated by the Russian military in order to “create a global negative image of Russia as a ‘bloody aggressor’ and whip up panic in society.” The news about the BBC suspending operations in Russia comes amid a debate about the Kremlin-backed RT news channel, formerly known as Russia Today. Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has opened 27 investigations into the “due impartiality” of programmes broadcast on the channel. Meanwhile culture secretary Nadine Dorries has said RT should lose its licence and “never again” be able to broadcast “poisonous propaganda”. But Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, warned earlier this week that the BBC risked being banned in Russia if RT was shut down in the UK. Reports that BBC News services were being blocked in Russia prompted the broadcaster to issue a statement on Friday morning, saying it would “continue our efforts to make BBC News available in Russia, and across the rest of the world”. It also shared a link to an article reminding viewers that its Ukrainian and Russian language services are available on the dark web. The BBC has made its international news website available through the Tor network, a privacy-focused software used to access the dark web, in a bid to thwart censorship attempts. The Metropolitan police’s war crimes team is gathering evidence in relation to alleged war crimes in Ukraine to support the international criminal court (ICC) investigation, the force said. The team is part of counter-terrorism command and has “national responsibility for carrying out any UK enquiries into war crimes and core international crimes”. Detectives are appealing for anyone in the UK who may have direct evidence of war crimes in Ukraine from 21 November 2013 onwards to come forward, and are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have witnessed or been the victim of any war crimes in Ukraine during this period, PA News reports. Evidence given to and gathered by the war crimes team may then be shared with the international criminal court to assist with their investigation. The BBC will “temporarily suspend” the work of all its BBC News journalists and support staff in Russia. This follows the news that new legislation has been passed by the Russian authorities, which BBC director general Tim Davie said appeared to “criminalise the process of independent journalism”. The Russian parliament approved the law on Friday. It would make it a criminal offence punishable by up to 15 years in prison to spread “fake” or “false” news about the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine. It comes after the Kremlin accused the BBC of playing a “determined role in undermining the Russian stability and security”. Davie said: It leaves us no other option than to temporarily suspend the work of all BBC News journalists and their support staff within the Russian Federation while we assess the full implications of this unwelcome development. Our BBC News service in Russian will continue to operate from outside Russia. Davie said the safety of the BBC’s staff was paramount and they are are “not prepared to expose them to the risk of criminal prosecution simply for doing their jobs”. He continued: I’d like to pay tribute to all of them, for their bravery, determination and professionalism. We remain committed to making accurate, independent information available to audiences around the world, including the millions of Russians who use our news services. Our journalists in Ukraine and around the world will continue to report on the invasion of Ukraine. As the UK government seeks ways to take on Russian oligarchs with links to Vladimir Putin’s regime, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has asked government lawyers to “find literally any way” to crack down on “Slapps” – or strategic lawsuits against public participation – where the wealthy exploit lengthy and expensive legal procedures to silence journalists, critics and watchdogs. How do Slapps differ from ordinary defamation lawsuits? While Slapps generally arise out of defamation lawsuits and ostensibly have the same purpose – of protecting the claimant’s reputation – they are seen as an attempt to shut down public criticism, with the claimant often indifferent about whether they actually win the case. What is the threat posed by Slapps? The fear is that they discourage investigative reporting into rich and powerful people because of the potential costs of defending a claim, even if it has little or no merit. In a parliamentary debate on Slapps in January, David Davis, a Conservative MP and former cabinet minister, said “nefarious” actors were using the justice system “to threaten, intimidate and put the fear of God into British journalists, citizens, officials and media organisations”. He described such tactics as “lawfare”. The Foreign Policy Centre said the UK was “the most frequent country of origin” for foreign legal threats against investigative journalists. How are Slapps connected to Russian oligarchs? The use of Slapps is not confined to Russians but one of the most notorious recent examples, characterised as such by MPs as well as free speech campaigners, related to Putin’s People, a book written by the journalist Catherine Belton about the Russian leader. She and her publisher, HarperCollins, were sued over a number of matters in the book by multiple Russian billionaires, including Roman Abramovich, who owns Chelsea football club, Mikhail Fridman, the owner of Russia’s largest non-state bank, and the Russian state oil company Rosneft. All of the claims were subsequently settled or withdrawn. Abramovich ended his case after HarperCollins accepted some information concerning him was inaccurate and agreed to make revisions to the book. HarperCollins apologised and agreed to make a payment to charity in recognition of a particular error, but otherwise no damages were paid and both sides agreed to pay their own costs.

Having led applause in support of Ukraine earlier in the day, the Scottish Labour leader argued that Vladimir Putin “will not win” and insisted peace will prevail. Sarwar said: We unequivocally reject any - any - false attempts to justify Russian aggression, and we stand in solidarity with those fleeing war and those who are staying to defend their homeland. Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine is unprovoked and unjustifiable. Across the world today the message is clear - peace and democracy must prevail and we will not bend to Vladimir Putin’s imperial ambitions. We must provide more humanitarian assistance to defeat the horrors of war: hunger, destitution and need. We must further tighten the economic measures taken against Vladimir Putin’s regime and we must, once and for all, root out the free flow of Russian money and influence and the Russian disinformation campaign from our public life, across the UK and here in Scotland. The first minister of Wales has said that he regrets the ending of free coronavirus testing, but that it was inevitable after the UK government ended the programme. Mark Drakeford said he had attempted to persuade the UK government to take a “more gradual” approach to the running down of test and trace but had been rebuffed. Drakeford said: I think that is a genuine anxiety and it is why we have attempted unsuccessfully to persuade the UK government to take a more gradual approach to the rundown of testing and the infrastructure that has served us so well over the last two years, We will devote some of the testing that we have available to us through our own means in ways that will allow surveillance to continue. We continue to have conversations with the UK government about the need to ensure both that there is sufficient surveillance in place and that should it be necessary to step up the level of protection again through a more widespread testing regime, there’s a proper plan and proper capacity to be able to do that. In the end, when the UK government makes these decisions, they have a direct effect on us. We’ve had to plan within the constraints that we unavoidably face. Covid-19 infection levels have fallen in England and Northern Ireland but increased in Scotland, while the trend in Wales is “uncertain”, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS figures reveal that in England, around one in 30 people in private households are estimated to have had the virus in the week to 26 February, or 1.9 million people – down from one in 25, or 2.1 million people in the week to 19 February. For Northern Ireland the proportion of people with Covid-19 has fallen to one in 17, or 106,300 people, from one in 14, 132,700 people. But Scotland saw a slight increase week-on-week, up from one in 20, or 240,700 people, to one in 19, or 280,500. In Wales the estimate remains around one in 30, or 94,200, with the ONS describing the trend in the most recent week as “uncertain”. The Disasters Emergency Committee’s (DEC) Ukraine appeal has raised 55 million in its first day. The total includes “generous” donations from the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, DEC said. It said hundreds of thousands of members of the public donated to the humanitarian appeal within hours of its launch on Thursday. The total includes 20 million donated by the UK Government as part of its UK Aid Match scheme - the largest commitment ever made to a DEC appeal through the initiative. Saleh Saeed, the chief executive of the DEC, said: We are also very grateful for the generous support of the royal family.” We also thank the UK Government who have matched pound for pound the first 20 million donated by the public, as well as our broadcast partners and celebrities for having aired and joined the appeal, reaching millions of viewers and listeners. Giving through the DEC is the most effective way to get the right assistance to the right people. While wanting to collect clothes and other items for people in need is laudable, the things people give today may not be what people need tomorrow and aid workers say they can’t use much of what is arriving. Donating through the DEC is the most helpful way people Ben Wallace accused Russia of “playing with fire” by shelling a nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Speaking at a news conference in Copenhagen, the defence secretary added that the UK government “call upon the Russian president in the strongest possible terms to absolutely cease attacking sites” such as the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. He said: It is incredibly dangerous. It is not just dangerous for Ukraine and Russia, it is dangerous for Europe, and it is playing with fire that really is beyond anything that has to do with logic or necessity. Liz Truss, who is in Brussels to meet with her counterparts to discuss next steps in responding to Russia’s aggression, has said the meeting will be used to show “the strength of our unity in challenging Vladimir Putin”. The foreign secretary said: We are doing all we can to support the Ukrainians through defensive weapons where the UK led – we were the first European country to donate defensive weapons – and we are also going to be talking about sanctions. We have been very co-ordinated in sanctions, we have shown huge unity, it is having a big effect in Russia – but we now need to do more. We particularly need to look at the oil and gas sector, how do we reduce our dependence across Europe on Russian gas, how do we cut off the funding to Vladimir Putin’s war machine? That is what I am going to be advocating at both the G7 and the discussions with the EU. The shelling of a nuclear power plant in Ukraine by Russian troops is “a threat to European security and stability”, Liz Truss has said. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been seized by Russian military forces, according to regional authorities, after a fire sparked by overnight shelling burned for several hours at the largest facility of its kind in Europe. Speaking in Brussels, where ministers from across the West are gathering today to discuss how to respond to Russian aggression, the foreign secretary told journalists that those responsible for the “completely reckless act” must be “held to account”. Asked how concerned she is about the incident, Truss said: Well this was a completely reckless act. We’ve heard now that the fire has been extinguished, but it is extremely concerning that forces are prepared to do this. We have called for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council. This is a threat to European security and stability and we need those responsible to be held to account. Here’s more about what has happened at the nuclear plant: Priti Patel has said Ukrainians fleeing into Poland were escaping “the most atrocious set of circumstances where they are being persecuted by President Putin”. Speaking on a visit to the Polish border, the home secretary told reporters she was in the country “very much in terms of standing in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, but also with our friends here in Poland”. She said she wanted to “to see the work that they’re doing and also to see how we can support Poland much more in terms of helping those Ukrainians with links to the United Kingdom to come to Britain, and actually we’ve been discussing some of that work here today”. Patel said: We’re also launching our new family extension route today to enable Ukrainian families with links to the UK to come over to Britain. That scheme is live, that is now working, that’s up and running. We stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Ukraine but also with our dear friends here in Poland, who are working really [hard] night and day, we can all see this, under incredible circumstances. Boris Johnson is concerned for the safety of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, Downing Street has said. The prime minister has regularly spoken to the Ukrainian leader and has expressed his personal admiration of him and a spokesman for the PM was asked whether Johnson was worried about attempts reportedly made on Zelenskiy’s life. He said: Of course, everybody’s concerned for the safety and welfare of the president of Ukraine and the rest of the government, as well as the people of Ukraine who we’ve seen indiscriminately targeted over recent days. Former prime minister Gordon Brown criticised Russia for not making a statement regarding safety on the nuclear power station in south-eastern Ukraine it has taken control of, saying that is a “failure to respond to the pleas of the international community”. He told an online event organised by the Chatham House thinktank: I am surprised that this morning, now that the Russian government have taken over a second nuclear power station in Ukraine, and now are in control of it, they have not made a statement that they will not allow that nuclear station to be used to endanger and to threaten human life. It is these very instances of Russia’s failure to respond to the pleas of the international community, that make us determined that we will step up our campaign to make sure that Russia is brought to justice for what is a crime of aggression but of course could – and I support the international criminal court’s actions – be in other areas too. Boris Johnson does not want someone in Russia to assassinate Vladimir Putin, HuffPost UK reports. Republican US senator Lindsey Graham last night called for the Russian president to be killed on Twitter, asking if there was a “Brutus” in Russia. For those who don’t know Brutus, Marcus Junius Brutus was a Roman politician and the most famous of Julius Caesar’s assassins. Asked if the Johnson agreed with Graham, the prime minister’s spokesperson said: No. We stand with the Ukrainian people in demanding the immediate end to the Russian invasion. We have said before Putin must be held account in front of an international court for the horrific acts he has committed. Anatoly Antonov, the Russian ambassador to the US, said Graham’s comments, see below, were “unacceptable and outrageous”. The price of food including pork is likely to rise significantly as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a UK environment minister has warned. Victoria Prentis, the Defra minister responsible for farming, also suggested Britons may want to stop buying Russian white fish, which makes up about a third of the volume consumed in the UK. Prentis warned that British people would have to become more willing to pay premium prices for quality food produced domestically. Speaking at the launch of the Conservative Environment Network’s Green Albion essay collection, she said: “I’ve been having really important meetings with the fishing industry. Thirty per cent of our white fish, for example, is imported from Russia. Get real, guys.” The minister told the Guardian that further sanctions were being considered, which could affect the fishing industry, but suggested consumers boycott the fish. She said: “For now, do we really want to be buying Russian fish?” Prior to the invasion, Prentis had been mostly focused on the cost of living crisis as well as the shift to more environmentally-friendly farming, implementing the environmental land management schemes (Elms) which would have farmers paid subsidies for improving biodiversity and nature on their land. However, she has found herself dealing with potential supply-chain failures as a result of the war. “I am going to dial down the optimism because we are in the middle of the most extraordinary series of world events,” she said. You can read the full story here: Former prime minister Gordon Brown has called on countries to support the creation of a special tribunal to punish Vladimir Putin for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. He joined Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba at an online event organised by the Chatham House think-tank, where pleas were made for Western nations to set up a tribunal to prosecute the Russian president and his accomplices, PA Media reports. Brown said the plan to set up a new international tribunal is modelled on the actions of the nations which met in London during the Second World War to draft a resolution on Nazi war crimes, which led to the creation of the international military tribunals and the Nuremberg trials. Brown said a new international tribunal is needed as well as existing international investigations by the international criminal court. The former Labour leader said: Ukraine wants our full support to expose and punish the crime of aggression, and that can be done by setting up a special tribunal on the lines proposed in 1942. President Putin has posed a fateful challenge to the post-1945 international order. He has sought to replace the rule of law with a misuse of force. If we were to acquiesce in any way, none of us could ever take freedom or democracy for granted ever again. For all these reasons, and because of the scale of the suffering of the people of Ukraine, I believe that most people would agree that this act of aggression cannot go uninvestigated, unprosecuted or unpunished. The proposal Brown is supporting has been formulated by senior international legal experts who are demanding that the UK and other countries join Ukraine to grant jurisdiction to a dedicated criminal tribunal to investigate both the perpetrators of the crime of aggression and those complicit in that crime. Brown added: Currently the ICC can investigate crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes. As evidence mounts acts against innocent civilians including children and the use of vapour bombs, it may be that Russia can be prosecuted for these crimes. But we lack a crucial extra weapon in the legal fight against Putin. because Russia has not signed up to a separate ICC statute under which nations pledge not to commit so-called ‘crimes of aggression’. We need the special tribunal. Mr Kuleba wants us to act and I believe we must do so now. Putin must not be able to escape justice. Keir Starmer said it was clear Ukraine wanted the strongest possible response from Nato members, adding that the people of the country were “bravely” fighting back. Asked for his view of Vladimir Putin’s state of mind and the way he was acting, the Labour leader answered: Putin is a dangerous aggressor who is in breach of international law. I think he is gambling that Ukraine and our allies, the United Kingdom and Nato would not be united. He will be surprised by how united we are. Keir Starmer called for Conservative fundraiser and co-chair Ben Elliot to be sacked for his role in links between the Tories and Russian money. Speaking during a visit to Birmingham Erdington following his party’s byelection success, the Labour leader, said there was “growing concern” about the links between the Conservative Party and Russian money. He said: Ben Elliot is at the heart of that. We need to strip Russian money away from our politics, not to allow it to influence our politics. There will always be this danger if the Conservative government doesn’t go really hard on this that people will say it must be because you are reliant on Russian money that you are not going more quickly. So, it’s in everybody’s best interests that Ben Elliot steps back from his role – and I think he should actually be sacked from it. Russian elites could have their property seized and handed over to Ukrainian refugees, the deputy prime minister has suggested. Dominic Raab made the remarks as he defended the UK’s response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and the prime minister, Boris Johnson, called for an emergency UN summit after a Russian attack on a nuclear power station in Ukraine. Asked on LBC radio whether Britain could capture property assets owned by Russian oligarchs in punishment for Moscow’s invasion on Ukraine, Raab said: “If we’ve got the evidence and the legal basis, then we’ll do it.” Pressed on whether he would back using those properties to house Ukrainian refugee – a move called for by the Liberal Democrats and reportedly argued for in government by the housing secretary, Michael Gove – Raab replied: “Yes, absolutely. “We are looking at everything in the round, it is a team effort across government, from the foreign and defence secretary through to Michael Gove and, of course, the prime minister is driving this very hard.” The UK government has faced criticism for being too slow in its approach to implementing sanctions against Russian figures and linked assets. The Labour party chairwoman, Anneliese Dodds, said the UK had got to “stop dragging” its feet in clamping down on funds that have come from figures linked to Putin. Read the full story here: Keir Starmer has said Labour wants to see a rule brought in to force oligarchs to register assets over a “very, very short” period measured in days. The Labour leader said: Otherwise what will happen – it’s inevitable – is that people will remove their assets ... they will remove and sell their properties in the UK, and put the money somewhere else. This is the powerful weapon we have to support Ukraine. We’ve got to use it. I say to the government – get rid of the 18-month timeline. Bring it down to a number of days and we will vote it through on Monday. The strongest provisions, we will be united in voting through. But I don’t want to see the government slowing down here or losing the ambition to take that opportunity. Liz Truss said the UK government was doing “all we can to support the Ukrainians”. Speaking in Brussels, the foreign secretary said she was holding various meetings to show “the strength of our unity in challenging Vladimir Putin, in stopping Vladimir Putin, in Ukraine”. We’re doing all we can to support the Ukrainians through defensive weapons, where the UK led – we were the first European country to donate defensive weapons, and we’re also going to be talking about sanctions. She said sanctions were having a “big effect in Russia” but she said she was looking at how to speed up the process. We’ve sanctioned more companies than our counterparts across the world, we’ve just sanctioned two more major oligarchs last night. What I’m doing is looking how we can speed up that process to make even more progress on that front. The number one thing (that’s) important though, is that we are unified with our partners across the world in putting the toughest ever sanctions we’ve had on Russia. Asked for his view of the UK government’s efforts to sanction Russian oligarchs, Keir Starmer said the government could go “further and faster”. The Labour leader said: Where the government is taking action on sanctions, we support them. But they have got to go further and faster. We must go after every oligarch. This is the weapon we have to use and we need to use it now. I am particularly concerned about the arrangements where the government is suggesting there could be 18 months for those overseas owners to register their assets and their ownership. That gives them 18 months to remove their assets from this country, so I want to see the government move on this. Keir Starmer says it seems there is evidence of war crimes and that those responsible needed to be held to account. Asked how Nato and western governments could stop the escalating attacks on Ukraine, the Labour leader said: We need the retreat from the Russian aggression in Ukraine – it’s as simple as that. Every day we are seeing these attacks and the devastation that they are bringing about. Starmer said of Putin: From what I’ve already seen, it seems to me there is evidence of war crimes and it’s very important that all of those responsible are held to account. What’s really important now is the gathering of evidence to make sure that the most powerful case can be brought whenever it can be brought. Keir Starmer described the overnight attack on a nuclear plant in Ukraine as “deeply alarming”. Speaking during a visit to Birmingham, the Labour leader said: I think the whole world will be shocked. I think it’s very important that we unite now and renew that message that Russia must withdraw. We need a ceasefire – and we need to stop this aggression from Russia because this escalation is deeply, deeply concerning. Meanwhile, the head of the UN’s atomic watchdog said there has been no release of radioactive material at the Ukrainian nuclear plant following shelling by Russian forces. Vladimir Putin is “at risk” of ending up in prison for war crimes carried out by his Russian forces in Ukraine, the Justice Secretary said. Dominic Raab was asked on Times Radio whether he saw the conflict ending with the Russian president “imprisoned for war crimes”. The deputy prime minister said: I think it is a very real risk that he must now contemplate. Beyond his personal situation, every commander operating in Ukraine, or indeed Moscow, when they are faced with illegal orders, whether it is to target civilians or otherwise, attack illegal or unlawful sites, they now know the ICC [international criminal court] is investigating and the chief prosecutor Karim Khan is, I believe, travelling to Ukraine. They must now know that they face the very real risk of ending up in the dock of a court and, ultimately, in a prison if they follow through on those illegal, unlawful orders. The Welsh government is to provide £4m in aid to Ukraine. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, who told Sky News that Wales hoped to be “a nation of sanctuary” for Ukrainian refugees, said the aid would help people on the frontline. He told the programme: We know that cash is what is really needed here and now on the ground for people who can obtain those goods and put that money to good use - and that is why the £4m from the Welsh government will go to the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal that we launched here in Wales yesterday. He could not say how many refugees that Wales could be dealing with and that many of them might like to stay near family or friends who may live elsewhere. He said: What we would like to see through the UK government is a simple, fast, safe and legal route for those needing to seek sanctuary elsewhere in the world and in Wales to be able to come here. For those people for whom Wales could be even a temporary home, a temporary place of sanctuary, we will want to do everything we can to welcome them and to provide for them. The UK has got to “stop dragging” its feet in clamping down on funds that have come from figures linked to Vladimir Putin, the Labour party chair, Anneliese Dodds, has said. She told Sky News: I certainly would say that we have been far too soft, especially over the last 10 years, on those funds that have come from Putin-linked oligarchs and business people. She rejected the government’s claims that it has been working strongly against economic levers for Putin-linked individuals. She said: I have got to say that, for many, many years, Labour has been calling on the Conservatives to, for example, force transparency around property ownership, especially in London where we know that many of these Putin-linked oligarchs have been stashing their funds in property. We see, even with the new measures that finally have been extracted from the government now that they say they will announce on Monday, an 18-month window before they will come into action – that’s just not good enough. We need immediate action now. We can put those registers of foreign-owned property into place in 28 days, we believe we could get those running and force that transparency. We should have had it many years ago but, above all, we need it right now. We have got to act right now and we have got to stop dragging our feet as the Conservative government has been doing. Keir Starmer has tweeted his congratulations to Paulette Hamilton, Labour’s new MP for Birmingham Erdington. Hamilton won the byelection with a majority of 3,266 and is the city’s first black MP. The Labour leader said in the tweet that she had “made history”. He added: “As a dedicated community champion I know that you will bring security, prosperity and respect to the people of Erdington.” In her victory speech last night, Hamilton said: I’m truly humbled and honoured to be elected as a member of parliament. I will not take your vote for granted, I have met many of you and I have heard what you have to say and I commit to you now, I will work for you … I will be your voice in Westminster. The byelection was triggered by the sudden death in January of the Labour MP Jack Dromey, who had held the seat since 2010. If you are just catching up, here’s the full report on the byelection results from my colleague Jessica Murray: Dominic Raab said it was “doubly reprehensible” that Russian forces had continued to shell a nuclear site after Ukrainian emergency services had looked to put a fire out at Europe’s largest power station. The deputy prime minister told Sky News the Russians had inflicted a bombardment on a “very sensitive, precarious and dangerous facility” in Zaporizhzhia. He said: The fact that the Russians kept on bombarding after there was the fire and the Ukrainian emergency rescue team were trying to get to that makes it doubly reprehensible. Raab said the UN security council meeting being called for by Boris Johnson was needed to “ramp up the pressure on these appalling tactics we are seeing from the Kremlin”. The international community needs to “come down hard on Putin” after Russian forces shelled a nuclear power station in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, according to Dominic Raab. The deputy prime minister told Times Radio: It is clearly reckless, irresponsible and not only the fact they were shooting, bombarding that particular site, but when the Ukrainian emergency authorities were trying to put out the fire, the shelling continued. It must stop. We support the Ukrainians in dealing with the security situation there but also I think come down hard on Vladimir Putin. That’s why the prime minister has called for an emergency United Nations security council meeting in New York so the entire international community can address this, because of course it is a much wider threat, given the nuclear implications. It is an affront to the world at large. The UK is “at the vanguard” of imposing sanctions on Kremlin-linked money, according to the deputy prime minister, as he sought to defend the government’s actions on targeting Russian oligarchs. Dominic Raab was asked during broadcast interviews why the European Union had sanctioned more individual Russian elites than Britain. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Raab said it was a “false distinction” to make, adding: The question is not whether it is individuals or companies – it is where the money is flowing. Separately, he said: There has been a running commentary that the UK has somehow been slow – we’ve not been slow. We’ve been at the vanguard of taking action and, of course, what is really important is we act in concert with our allies, European, American and other Nato allies. For example, we have sanctioned more Russian banks than the EU, including Sberbank, which is the biggest Russian bank. We’ve made it clear and introduced measures so that three million Russian companies cannot raise loans or get listed on the UK stock market. These measures – and each country has slightly different sanctions regimes – are all aimed at tightening the noose, if you like, and starving off the finance that is going into Putin’s war machine. Here’s more on why the UK seems so slow at acting against Putin’s oligarchs: Dominic Raab said he would “absolutely” support giving over seized Russian oligarch property in the UK to Ukrainian refugees. Asked on LBC whether Britain could capture property assets owned by Russian elites in punishment for Moscow’s invasion on Ukraine, the deputy prime minister said: “Yeah, if we’ve got the evidence and the legal basis, then we’ll do it.” Pressed on whether he would back using those properties to house Ukrainian refugees – a move called for by the Liberal Democrats and reportedly argued for in government by housing secretary Michael Gove – Raab replied: Yes, absolutely. We are looking at everything in the round, it is a team effort across government, from the foreign and defence secretary through to Michael Gove and, of course, the prime minister is driving this very hard.

Crucially, the impending crisis could lead energy companies to cut their output, one of the country’s biggest gas companies has said. Businesses located along the Rhine or dependent on it to transport or receive goods are warning that they have been forced to scale back activities and reduce loads drastically – and are now on the verge of having to close some production if cargo ships are no longer able to access the river. The Rhine, which runs about 760 miles from the Swiss Alps to the North Sea, is the second largest river in central and western Europe after the Danube. The majority of nearly 200 million tons of cargo shipped on German rivers – from coal to car parts, food to chemicals – is transported on the Rhine. Its dangerously low levels recall the drought that shut it down for around six months in 2018. Cologne’s Waterway and Shipping Authority has said the “unusually low levels” for this time of year meansbarges have had to reduce their cargo “in order to be able to navigate the river”. This increases prices and reduces the speed with which goods can be transported. Of major concern, as Germany braces itself for a winter of energy rationing due to an 80% reduction in gas flows from Russia, is the knock-on effect the depletion in river traffic could have on energy output. Uniper, Germany’s biggest distributor of Russian gas, which already recently needed a multi-billion euro bailout by the German government to stop it collapsing, has cautioned of potentially “irregular performance” for the next month at Staudinger-5, its coal-fired, 510-megawatt power plant east of Frankfurt – a major tributary of the Rhine – due to interruptions to coal delivery supplies along the river. As demand for coal has increased, Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, has decided to recommission coal-fired power plants, which had previously been mothballed but are now seen as a temporary solution to help Germany wean itself off Russian gas. Industry bosses in Germany, seeking to stave off recession amid high energy prices and rampant inflation, are now paying almost as much attention to daily river levels as they are to the amount of gas flowing from Russia (20%, or 33 million cubic metres). Of more immediate concern are the levels of gas stored at almost two dozen facilities around the country, standing on Thursday at 70.39%. Low water levels usually occur much later in the year, but reflect the drought conditions affecting large parts of Europe. This week, the French energy supplier EDF said it was temporarily reducing output at its nuclear power stations on the rivers Rhône and Garonne as heatwaves restricted its ability to use river water to cool the plants. Meanwhile, in the UK the source of the River Thames was reported on Thursday to have dried up for the first time since records began due to a lack of rainfall. To take a snapshot of the situation in Germany, in Cologne, the largest city on the Rhine, areas of the river have been reduced to a mere trickle. On Thursday the overall level was 1.03 metres with experts saying there was little chance of change in the coming weeks and the level could fall even further due to lack of rainfall. According to Cologne’s city drainage operations, ships wanting to navigate the river have a total height allowance of 111 centimetres plus the water level of 103cm – in other words, just 2.14 metres beneath their keel. Any ship deeper than that was likely to get stuck, they warned, adding that captains carry the sole responsibility for the safe manoeuvre of their vessels. According to Christian Lorenz, of Ports and Freight Traffic Cologne, a lot of freight traffic had already reduced its cargo by half in order to be light enough to travel safely. “Typically a cargo ship carrying salt from Heilbronn would be carrying 2,100 tons on board, but on Monday this had to be reduced to just 900 tons due to the river level,” he told German media. To make up for the reduced capacity, companies are facing the more expensive options of either using more ships or reloading on to lorries or goods trains – but both are currently in short supply. Ships, in particular, are in demand in the Black Sea to bring grain supplies from Ukraine, now possible for the first time in months. Plans are under way for the construction of low-lying barges and ships as well as for the deepening of the Rhine, and better forecasting of water levels as a result of the 2018 crisis, but these measures are slow in being realised. The timing of the Rhine’s shrinking could hardly be worse from an economic perspective. Many of the businesses dependent on it have been racing to fix supply chains massively interrupted by the pandemic and urgently trying to replenish their stocks. Environmentalists are also raising the alarm as rising temperatures lead to a high concentration of pollutants which can be damaging to the flora, fauna and fish. Swimmers have also been warned to keep away from the river because a reduction in water levels can lead to narrower channels and stronger currents."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/commentisfree/2022/sep/25/letters-in-the-uk-far-right-works-from-within","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-25T05:00:24Z","webTitle":"In the UK, the far right works from within | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/sep/25/letters-in-the-uk-far-right-works-from-within","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/sep/25/letters-in-the-uk-far-right-works-from-within","fields":{"headline":"Letters: in the UK, the far right works from within","bodyText":"That “Sweden shows that nowhere in Europe is immune to the rise of the far right” is probably true (Editorial). It is also true, as you say, that far-right parties have not gained the significance in the UK that they have elsewhere. The first-past-the-post voting system effectively excludes the representation of small, far-right parties in parliament. More effective, in the UK, is entryism into an existing party. In recent years, the Conservative party has become the vehicle for far-right policies and politicians who promote those policies, not least: cultural intolerance; leaving the EU; the linking of racist anti-immigration politics and Europhobia; promoting a “hostile environment” for asylum seekers and attempting to deport legal asylum seekers to Rwanda; the marginalising of experts (elites); promoting nationalism with those union flags that now drape every minister’s office; attacking democracy by illegally proroguing parliament and denigrating human rights lawyers as “lefties” and “do-gooders” and restricting freedoms to protest. The new secretary of state for health and social care has been less than supportive of abortion rights. Today’s Conservative party has adopted policies and taken positions not that dissimilar to those in Sweden, Orbán’s Hungary, Duda’s Poland and Erdoğan’s Turkey. Dr Robin Richmond Bromyard, Herefordshire Thank you for Drude Dahlerup’s article on Sweden (“Sweden’s mainstream parties cravenly opened the door to anti-immigrant populists”, Comment). The previous Social Democrat-Green party-Left party coalition government, which in one form or another has governed for much of the last 60 years, lost the recent election as over the past decade its policies have been disastrous in regard to education, immigration, finance, healthcare, defence and the environment. One example is that Sweden’s death rate from Covid was double that of other Scandinavian nations. Another is that Sweden let its top-class nuclear power capabilities wither without any viable, nationally controlled alternative(s) in place. The election gave Swedes the choice between “bad” and “maybe not as bad”. I predict there will be a new election before the end of 2023. James Van Alstine Stockholm The Queen’s final gift? Like Catherine Bennett, I had already enjoyed Boris Johnson’s absence last week and his probable frustration at being absent from this historic time (“Tiring of all the pomp? Cheer up – at least Boris Johnson is not there to upstage the royals”, Comment). I found particular pleasure in imagining that the late Queen may have decided to wait for the end of the interminable Conservative leadership election and for Johnson’s formal resignation. I like to think of this as a final dutiful gift to the people of Britain. Thank you, Ma’am. Kate Blok Brighton In metric we trust Jon Ungoed-Thomas summarises well the government’s “consultation” on weights and measures: a deeply flawed questionnaire over an unnecessary, wasteful and potentially damaging proposal (“Want to axe the metric system? Say yes here”, News). Currently, customers have a legal right to be informed of the quantity and price of any product on supermarket shelves in metric units, allowing comparisons to be made. The effect of the proposal is to take away this right. Not more choice, less. Metric units have been the primary units taught in British schools since 1974; pounds/ounces are alien to most young people. You are right: the history of metrication in the UK dates from Victorian times. A firm decision to metricate was made in 1965, long before EEC/EU entry. Pretending that metric units were imposed by the EU is wrong. It is equally wrong to believe that something is desirable merely because Brexit makes it possible. Metric units are used in science, medicine, building, engineering and sport. British imperial units are in common use nowhere else in the world, not even the USA or the Commonwealth. They are complex and poorly understood. Dual units cause confusion and sometimes danger. The consultation outcome may be greeted by the government as giving it the answer it wanted. It is not, however, valid and it deserves to be thrown forcefully in the bin. Dr Peter Burke, chair, UK Metric Association, London N11 Beware tarantula tirades Andrew Rawnsley reminds us that “the author of the notorious ‘black spider’ memos to ministers has sought to pre-empt anxieties about how he will conduct himself” (“Liz Truss can’t speak for the national mood because she really doesn’t understand it”, Comment). But we have also heard about his exasperation at a leaking fountain pen (“I can’t bear this bloody thing. Every stinking time…”). There are lots of opportunities now, as Charles moves from prince to king, for tiny black spidery missives to become overwhelming tarantula tirades. I don’t see him being restrained by leaky pens. Julia Edwards Winchester Physician, heal thyself Thank you to Sian Harding for raising awareness of sex inequality in cardiac health outcomes (“Heart disease: why gender is a matter of life or death”, the New Review). However, I was concerned by the implication that this inequality is the responsibility of the patients rather than the medical personnel. In future, perhaps, her phrasing could be adjusted from “What is it about female patients that makes the male doctors treat them differently?” to “What is it about male doctors that makes them treat female patients differently?”. Also worth noting is that our behaviour does not affect how “male” or “female” we appear, but how “masculine” or “feminine”. The distinction is clear and vital: male and female refer to biological sex; masculine and feminine to the socially constructed expectations associated with our sex, referred to as gender. Women experience different typical heart attack symptoms than men due to their sex, as described in Dr Alyson McGregor’s book Sex Matters. That they are stereotyped as hysterical when they seek help is due to gender.

And, like Malik more than 30 years ago, “I was overcome by a sense of dislocation and horror”.

Gas prices are soaring globally, largely because of the resurgence of demand for fossil fuels after the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns, depleted storage and the difficulty of ramping up supply after the disruptions of the past two years. But prices have also been significantly affected by Russia’s recent decision to tighten gas supplies to Europe, which experts believe was driven by Vladimir Putin’s desire to move against Ukraine. Europe is dependent on Russia for about 40% of its natural gas supplies, and despite the expansion of renewable energy over the past two decades, that dependency is increasing as countries shift to gas, away from dirtier coal. Germany is particularly vulnerable, as it has shut down nearly all of its nuclear power stations and aims to eliminate coal by 2030. A major new gas pipeline, Gazprom’s $11bn Nord Stream 2 from Russia across the Baltic to Germany, which would heat 26m German homes, has been the focus of Germany’s diplomatic relations with Russia since it was announced in 2015. Construction on the 1,200km pipeline was completed last year, but no gas has yet flowed and its future is now in doubt as Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz dramatically halted approval for the project on Tuesday. Concerns that Russia is using its gas supplies as a weapon to achieve its political aims are well founded. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, noted that Russia’s decision to drop gas supplies to Europe by a quarter came as it was heightening tension towards Ukraine. “I hope this was only a coincidence,” he told the Guardian. Is this really another war over fossil fuels? No. Energy resources are not the focus of this threatened conflict. Vladimir Putin has a long history of territorial ambitions in former Soviet nations, which he made explicit this week, and of attempts to exert political control over Ukraine. Putin is said by supporters to be concerned over the possibility of Nato expansion, although many analysts say this is a pretext. So the Ukraine crisis is not a war over resources, but it has many implications for resource use. Russia is effectively weaponising its dominance over European gas supply for political ends. Reducing reliance on Russian gas is an urgent necessity for the EU to reach net zero emissions, and would also diminish Putin’s political leverage over the EU. It is also worth noting that in the longer term, as Europe weans itself off gas and pursues net zero emissions, the value of this political weapon will wane rapidly. Russia’s industries have never recovered from the fall of communism, and its economy is now based overwhelmingly on the export of fossil fuels, with much of the rest made up of energy-dependent mineral resources, such as iron, steel, aluminium and other metals, and some agriculture. Four in 10 roubles accruing to Russia’s federal budget pre-pandemic came from oil and gas, which made up 60% of Russian exports in 2019. Kremlin strategists are therefore keenly aware that in the longer term the global move to net zero threatens the whole basis of Russia’s economy and global influence. Why is Europe so dependent on Russian gas? Historically, much of Europe was heavily dependent on coal for power and heating. Renewable energy generation has more than doubled since 2004, and reached 22% of final energy production in 2020. However, at the same time the share generated from nuclear power has fallen, from about a third of the EU’s electricity in 1995 to about a quarter today. After the accident at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear power plant in 2011, Germany’s then chancellor Angela Merkel announced an “Energiewende” – an energy shift – that would see all of the country’s reactors shut down. This has increased Germany’s need for gas, and similar moves away from coal and towards lower emissions in other countries – including the UK, which despite North Sea gas production is a net importer of gas – have heightened the dependency. The geopolitical implications of this dependency, as well as the climate impacts, are now unignorable. Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington DC, says: “It has taken the current crisis for Germany and the EU to recognise that its co-dependence on Russian gas is a geopolitical and climate nightmare from which they must finally awake. Reducing Russian gas reliance is a huge climate and moral imperative that Europe must prioritise.” Will Russia turn off gas supplies to Europe if the EU and the UK impose sanctions? That would be a momentous move from Russia. Any further reductions of Russian gas supply to Europe would have severe consequences, for Europe but also for Russia itself. Birol said earlier this month, before sanctions were imposed: “If Russia stops the gas supply to Europe, it could have a seismic impact on European energy. [Russia] has to consider the consequences if existing oil and gas supplies to Europe are halted.” He added: “Failure to maintain [supplies] would shatter Russia’s reputation as a reliable partner and that would be a tectonic shift. Russia would be seen as a threat and that would have far-reaching consequences for European economies, but even more consequences for Russia. Europe would choose a strategy to diverge from Russia.” What impact will Russia’s actions in Ukraine have on climate diplomacy? Russia was almost invisible at the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow last November, after a surprising public commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2060. But the Kremlin has left the details of the goal vague and shown little sign of updating Russia’s emissions commitments for 2030, which are key to limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C. This is a crucial year for climate diplomacy, as the pledges from all countries in Glasgow are still inadequate for the 1.5C goal, and the UK Cop26 presidency is hoping for major progress before the next UN climate meeting in Egypt this November. Russia’s stance on Ukraine will certainly have an impact on those discussions, not least as any conflict will focus attention on the move from fossil fuels. It is also notable that Russia’s oil and gas operations are among the worst in the world for the climate. Data released this week by the IEA shows that emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas and the major component of natural gas, are 70% higher than countries had claimed. Russia makes little or no attempt to capture methane from its oil and gas drilling, and to stop its pipelines leaking, so there are huge opportunities. If Putin were serious about tackling the climate crisis, Russia could provide an invaluable service to the rest of the world by plugging these leaks – reducing methane globally by a third by 2030 could reduce temperatures by 0.2C – and at current gas prices this could be done at no net cost and could even be profitable. Should the UK be fracking more, or producing more from the North Sea, to reduce dependency on Russian gas? No. Attempts to frack in the UK started more than a decade ago, but went nowhere, in part because of protests but also because the economics of industrial fracking in a densely populated country make it impractical. Any move to restart fracking now would take many years to produce any gas, long after the current gas price crisis has been forgotten. New licences for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea are also currently under consideration by the government, and on Thursday the Committee on Climate Change will publish its advice to ministers on whether these licences can be compatible with the UK’s climate goals. However, any newly licensed fields would also take years to come into production, so would have no impact on the current crisis. Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, warns of falling for false solutions: “We know that some opponents of climate policy will try to hide the truth and instead fool the public into falsely believing that the soaring prices are due to green energy. If they are successful, they might slow down the transition to clean domestic energy.” Far more good could be done in the shorter term by insulating homes and ramping up renewable energy generation. What is the answer to the crisis? Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University in the US and an adviser to the UN secretary-general on the climate, says: “The west needs to meet Putin’s flagrant breach of international law with tough sanctions to force a change in calculus in Moscow. Putin believes he has to the largest extent sanction-proofed Russia, but Russia earns hundreds of millions of dollars a day from sales of oil and refined products, and more from sales of gas and minerals. “Weaning ourselves off these as quickly as possible is one route available to the west. In fact, Putin’s understanding of what decarbonisation would mean for Russian energy exports in the medium and long term may be a factor in the timing of Putin’s attack on Ukraine now.” Ending the use of fossil fuels is imperative, to reach net zero emissions and stave off the worst impacts of climate breakdown. But the shift will also create geopolitical tensions as the world’s massive fossil fuel exporters – Russia, Saudi Arabia and some other Middle Eastern countries, Latin American oil producers, Australia – begin to lose out economically. The crisis in Ukraine shows that some fossil fuel producers at least may not want to give up without a struggle the political leverage they gain from their resources."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/may/21/bitcoin-losing-its-cool-look-at-el-salvador","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-21T14:00:21Z","webTitle":"Crypto is starting to lose its cool – just look at El Salvador | Rowan Moore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/21/bitcoin-losing-its-cool-look-at-el-salvador","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/may/21/bitcoin-losing-its-cool-look-at-el-salvador","fields":{"headline":"Crypto is starting to lose its cool – just look at El Salvador","bodyText":"To its evangelists, bitcoin is a frictionless, empowering form of money that liberates citizens of the world from the shackles of banks and national governments. To sceptics, the cryptocurrency is a tool of kleptocrats and gangsters, environmentally monstrous in its consumption of energy, a digitally glamorised Ponzi scheme whose eventual crash will most hurt those least able to afford a loss. Confidence may or may not have been enhanced by the unveiling, by President Nayib Bukele, of images of a proposed bitcoin-shaped Bitcoin City in El Salvador, funded with a bitcoin bond, the currency’s logo embedded in the central plaza, a metropolis powered with geothermal energy from a nearby volcano. Bukele, the self-styled “coolest dictator in the world”, a former publicist who wears baseball caps back to front, has already made El Salvador the first country to adopt bitcoin as the official currency. “The plan is simple,” he said. “As the world falls into tyranny, we’ll create a haven for freedom.” Leaving aside the worrisome Pompeii vibe of the city’s location, some shine has come off the president’s vision with the news that the country’s investments in cryptocurrency have lost 45% of their value, that it scores CCC with the credit rating agency Fitch, and that the perceived risk of its bonds is up there with that of war-torn Ukraine. And Bukele’s talk of freedom doesn’t sit well with Amnesty International’s claim that his recent state of emergency has created “a perfect storm of human rights violations”. But why worry about any of this when you have shiny computer-generated images of a fantasy city to distract you? Unsecured credit line The use of constructional bluster by populist leaders – Trump’s wall, for example – is not in itself anything new. See also the island airport, garden bridge, Irish Sea bridge, 40 new hospitals and 300,000 homes a year promised but not delivered by Boris Johnson, and the nuclear power stations he has implausibly pledged to build at a rate of one a year. Last week his fondness for Potemkin infrastructure took a new twist. Rather than over-promise illusory schemes and under-deliver them, he decided to take credit for something actually built, the £19bn Elizabeth line in London, formerly known as Crossrail, whose central section opens to the public on Tuesday. “We get the big things done,” he boasted to the House of Commons, choosing to ignore the fact that the line was initiated under a Labour prime minister and a Labour mayor of London. He almost makes Nayib Bukele look credible. Behind the red wall If you want a light-hearted night out – a date, a birthday treat – then The House of Shades, a new play by Beth Steel, might not, unless you are an unusual person, be for you. It is a cross between Greek tragedy and what was once called kitchen sink drama, a story of ever-mounting misery set in a Nottinghamshire town from 1965 to 2019. It covers the collapse of manufacturing, the rise of Thatcherism, the promises of New Labour and the disillusionment that led to “red wall” seats voting Conservative in 2019. It features illegal abortion, graphically portrayed, and the effects of inflation, both newly significant. All presented at the Almeida theatre in the famously metropolitan London borough of Islington, not far from the former restaurant where Tony Blair and Gordon Brown did the 1994 deal that shaped some of the events in the play. There’s irony here to make this audience squirm. Which, along with several other not-comfortable emotions, is probably the desired effect. • Rowan Moore is the Observer’s architecture correspondent"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/jun/28/malaysian-foreign-minister-says-concerns-remain-about-aukus-pact-after-meeting-with-penny-wong","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-28T10:02:33Z","webTitle":"Malaysian foreign minister says concerns remain about Aukus pact after meeting with Penny Wong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/28/malaysian-foreign-minister-says-concerns-remain-about-aukus-pact-after-meeting-with-penny-wong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jun/28/malaysian-foreign-minister-says-concerns-remain-about-aukus-pact-after-meeting-with-penny-wong","fields":{"headline":"Malaysian foreign minister says concerns remain about Aukus pact after meeting with Penny Wong","bodyText":"Malaysia’s foreign minister, Saifuddin Abdullah, has said that his country’s concerns about the Aukus nuclear submarine pact remain unchanged, after a meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday with his Australian counterpart, Penny Wong. Saifuddin told reporters he communicated Malaysia’s ongoing concern about the security deal between Australia, the UK and the US during a “very candid” discussion with Wong on her first visit to the Malaysian capital as Australia’s foreign minister. Regional objections to Australia’s planned acquisition of nuclear-propelled submarines surfaced almost immediately after Aukus was unveiled by Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison. Saifuddin and Indonesia’s foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, pointed to the risk of a regional arms race at a time of increasing tensions in the East and South China Seas. Last November, the Morrison government deployed then foreign minister Marise Payne to Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia in an effort to smooth over tensions. Since being sworn in just over a month ago, Wong has embarked on a diplomatic offensive in the region to reset relationships disturbed by Aukus and to counter increasingly assertive regional outreach by China in the Pacific. Asked on Tuesday whether or not his negative view of Aukus had ameliorated since the unveiling of the pact last September, Malaysia’s foreign minister said: “Malaysia highly values regional peace and security of the Asean region.” “We want to maintain the South China Sea in particular and the region as a whole as a region of peace, of commerce, of prosperity. “We had a very candid discussion on Aukus just now and I thank [Australia’s] foreign minister for explaining the government’s position. Malaysia’s position remains the same. I have mentioned that to the foreign minister.” Wong said she appreciated the opportunity “to explain how we see Aukus to [Saifuddin] and to other counterparts in the visits I have made prior to this visit, which are obviously to Vietnam and to Jakarta”. In early June Wong travelled to Jakarta with Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, meeting her Indonesian counterpart during the visit. She also visited Vietnam before arriving in Malaysia for Tuesday’s meeting with Saifuddin. “It is important that we listen to concerns, we respond to them respectfully,” Wong said in Kuala Lumpur. “That’s how the new government will seek to deal with some of the issues that have been raised and we hope that over time, people’s concerns will be able to be allayed.” Wong said Labor had taken the decision to support the Aukus pact while in opposition, and she said Australia had no nuclear ambitions. “We are not a nuclear power,” she said. “There are nuclear powers in this region but Australia is not one of them.” “What we are doing is replacing an existing capability with a new capability, and that is nuclear-propelled submarines. We remain very clear that we do not seek and nor would we ever seek to have any nuclear capability on our submarines.” In an implicit reference to China’s growing assertiveness, Wong said Australia understood the region was being “reshaped economically and strategically” and countries in the region, including Malaysia and others south-east Asia were attempting to “navigate this period of change”. She said Australia’s objective was not to meet aggression with aggression, but rather bolster the rules-based order. “Australia will always operate on the basis that we have this objective: a region that is peaceful, a region that is stable, a region that is prosperous, a region in which sovereignty is respected, and importantly, a region where rules enable some predictability to state behaviour and the way in which disputes are dealt with,” Wong said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Tuesday’s meeting was cordial apart from the pre-existing differences on Aukus and the two foreign ministers pledged to work together to bolster trade and bilateral cooperation on cybersecurity. While Wong is in Asia, Albanese has begun a series of meetings with foreign counterparts in Madrid as part of the Nato summit. The focus in Europe is on rising Russian aggression, but Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Korea have been invited to Madrid as part of efforts to build an Indo-Pacific focus. As Wong attempts to reset relationships in the region, Albanese will travel to France after Madrid to execute a rapprochement with Emmanuel Macron.

Questions have also been raised about the government’s process for shortlisting Newcastle, Port Kembla in Wollongong and Brisbane for a new east coast base, given that a previous Defence review had not backed them as most-preferred sites. The South Australian independent senator Rex Patrick, a former submariner, said Scott Morrison’s announcement on Monday was “thick with political fog” with an election looming, noting the final site would not be selected until 2023. Patrick said: “Why pork barrel in one electorate when you can – for the same price – pork barrel in three?” Morrison said the government had “provisioned more than $10bn to meet the facilities and infrastructure requirements” for the transition from Australia’s existing Collins-class submarines to the nuclear-powered submarines to be acquired under the Aukus pact with the UK and the US. He said Defence had looked at 19 potential sites and narrowed them down to the three preferred locations. Defence would now discuss the plans further with state and local governments and “begin negotiations on what will be an enormous undertaking”. The moves come amid continuing uncertainty about when the first of the nuclear-powered submarines will be operating. Morrison originally estimated it would be by about 2040 but the government now insists it may be sooner. The new base – which the Coalition wants to build in either Brisbane, Newcastle or Port Kembla – would “enable the regular visiting of US and UK nuclear-powered submarines”, Morrison said in a virtual address to the Lowy Institute. However, the mayors of Newcastle and Wollongong both said they were not consulted about the decision. With both cities historically home to anti-war movements they expected considerable community opposition. Both cities have passed official resolutions to make them nuclear-free zones. There is also believed to be opposition to nuclear power, particularly where it is used to propel a weapon of war – although spent fuel rods from the Lucas Heights reactor have passed through Port Kembla on their way for processing in France. Wollongong’s lord mayor, Gordon Bradbery, an independent, said he was waiting for more detail about the proposal before he would consult the local community. “It’s not only nuclear power and nuclear-powered submarines, but it’s the location of a strategic defence asset and that would make anyone who gets this particular facility a target,” Bradbery said. “International tensions now are playing on a lot of people’s minds and there would be concerns about our city as a location for nuclear-powered submarines.” Bradbery said Wollongong city council had previously worked with Regional Development Australia to make a submission to the federal government to relocate naval activities from Garden Island in Sydney Harbour to Port Kembla, but this was for conventional submarines only. “It just disappeared into the ether at the time,” Bradbery said. “Many suggested it was pie in the sky as the navy wasn’t keen on relocating from Garden Island.” Newcastle’s Labor lord mayor, Nuatali Nelmes, said the city had no intention of giving up its nuclear-free status over a “fantasy”. “The whole deal is a fantasy,” Nelmes said. “This announcement, the Aukus decision and the absolutely hopeless way they have handled this submarine contract – we are not getting lumped with their mess. “It is also typical of the federal government to have unilateral decision making where cities like Newcastle, which have been for many decades, a nuclear-free zone, would even be considered.” But the Liberal premier of New South Wales, Dominic Perrottet, welcomed the inclusion of Port Kembla and Newcastle on the federal government’s shortlist, saying the world faced “very uncertain times”. “Defence protection for our country is paramount and we have worked very closely with the federal government to identify these sites for our state,” Perrottet told the Nine Network. A spokesperson for the Queensland Labor government said it was “yet to receive any detailed information from the commonwealth”. Study found Port Kembla ‘impractical’ A 2011 Defence report ranked potential options for a new east coast home port for submarines. The top three options were in Sydney Harbour, followed by two options in Jervis Bay, south of Sydney. “Newcastle has its strengths, but the slight edge that it has with respect to positive people factors is compromised by its isolation from any other naval infrastructure, its susceptibility to flooding, and its sometimes difficult harbour entrance,” the future submarine basing study said. Newcastle Port was sixth on the list and the Port of Brisbane was eighth. The report included the caveat that detailed costing and environmental impact analysis “may generate a different outcome”. It placed a priority on the proximity to fleet assets in Sydney. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The same 2011 Defence study said it “would be impractical” to develop a future submarine basing capability at Port Kembla, noting it was previously found to be “a small and congested harbour with little space for substantial expansion”. Patrick, a senator who obtained the 2011 report under freedom of information laws, said it had been “a pure study” completed “without political considerations”. Although that study was focused on a new base for conventionally powered submarines, Patrick said he believed the presence of the Lucas Heights reactor in Sydney and associated specialists would only strengthen the case for Sydney. Patrick accused Morrison of dangling a “carrot” for three electorates prior to the election due in May. “In some sense, it’s a toxic carrot because it will divide communities, but he’s particularly good at that,” Patrick said. In a statement, Morrison said an east coast submarine base “would enhance Australia’s strategic deterrent capability in the Pacific Ocean”. The locations were “selected on submarine basing criteria, which included access to exercise operating areas, proximity to industrial infrastructure, and significant population centres to support personnel and recruitment”. Labor demanded a “proper briefing” on the base plans. The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, who has supported the Aukus partnership, said the government had made “an announcement about there being an announcement down the track”. “You can’t actually defend the country with a media release,” Albanese said. Comment was also sought from Defence, Regional Development Australia and Brisbane city council."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/11/russia-ukraine-war-putin-live-news-missile-strikes-g7-zelenskiy-crisis-talks-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-11T20:15:57Z","webTitle":"G7 leaders warn Putin over use of nuclear weapons; Zelenskiy calls for international mission along Belarus border – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/11/russia-ukraine-war-putin-live-news-missile-strikes-g7-zelenskiy-crisis-talks-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/11/russia-ukraine-war-putin-live-news-missile-strikes-g7-zelenskiy-crisis-talks-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"G7 leaders warn Putin over use of nuclear weapons; Zelenskiy calls for international mission along Belarus border – as it happened","bodyText":"We’re closing the blog for now, but we’ll be back soon with more. For now, some key links and updates from the day: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked G7 leaders to supply more air defence systems and for an international monitoring mission on the Belarusian border. The UN and some Nato countries warned that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, described the attack, in which cruise missiles and armed drones rained down on parks, playgrounds, power stations and other civilian targets, as “a profound change in the nature of this war”. Roughly 30% of the Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been hit by Russia since Monday, officials said. The Kremlin has confirmed that President Vladimir Putin will meet his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Thursday to discuss Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has told the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency that he is “open to dialogue” on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Elon Musk denied a report that he spoke with Putin before tweeting a proposal to end the war in Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia. Belarus’ defence ministry has said the joint deployment of forces with Russia on its borders is a defensive measure. The moves were to ensure “security” along the border between Belarus and Ukraine, it claimed. A deputy head of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been kidnapped by Russian forces, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Russia’s military strikes have damaged hundreds of cultural sites around Ukraine, the AP reports. In a speech to Unesco, the Ukrainian president urged the UN cultural agency to expel Russia, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the Unesco World Heritage Committee. Zelenskiy said Ukraine was nominating the Black Sea city of Odesa to be inscribed on the agency’s World Heritage list, AP reported. He also said that 540 “objects of cultural heritage, cultural institutions and religious buildings” have been destroyed or damaged since the start of Russia’s invasion in February. He added: Why are representatives of Russia still among you? What are they doing at Unesco?” As millions in Ukraine are facing blackouts due to the Russian missile attacks on energy infrastructure, the government has urged civilians to cut their electricity use and not use domestic appliances such as ovens and washing machines, Reuters reports: Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukrainians had voluntarily cut their electricity consumption by an average of 10% on Monday after Russia’s attacks, and urged them to limit use between 5pm and 11pm local time on Tuesday. “We are united and will stand firm,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “Please don’t turn on energy-intensive appliances: electric stoves, electric kettles, power tools, heaters and air conditioners, ovens and irons, microwave ovens, coffee makers, washing machines and dishwashers.” Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, has told CNN that Russian missiles have hit roughly 30% of the country’s energy infrastructure since Monday. Halushchenko said: We send this message to our partners: we need to protect the sky. Russians they are not playing on some games on international laws. They don’t care about any kind of international agreements or conventions.” He also told CNN that this was the first time since the start of war that Russia had “dramatically targeted” Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and that Ukraine was working to reconnect quickly from other sources. Russia’s defence ministry earlier confirmed that its troops were continuing long-range air strikes on Ukraine’s military and energy infrastructure. Reports suggested that six people were injured in a second Russian strike at the Ladyzhyn thermal power plant (LTPP) in Ukraine’s Vinnytsia region. Halushchenko’s comments come after some Nato countries and the UN have warned that Russia may be committing a war crime with its ongoing attack on civilian targets. Ukrainians in Prague rallied this evening to protest Russian missile strikes, the AP reports: The protesters held blue-and-yellow crosses with the names of the cities hit by the Russian missiles. “Ukraine needs air defenses to be able to prevent the massacres of the civilian population and destruction of our cities,” Anastasiia Sihnaievska told the crowd. “We are protecting our right to live,” said Sihnaievska, who fled her town of Zhytomyr because of the Russian invasion. People chanted “Russia’s terrorist!” and “More weapons for Ukraine!” They unveiled a giant Ukrainian flag and displayed banners that read “Air defense systems for Ukraine,” “We will not forget, We will not forgive,” and “Stop bombing Ukraine.” Some photos below from the demonstration, which as the AP noted, came the same day that the presidents of Czechia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Montenegro said the missile strikes against Ukrainian civilians “constitute war crimes under international law”. The US will be watching which nations side with Russia at Wednesday’s General Assembly vote on the resolution condemning Russian annexations in eastern Ukraine, the US ambassador to the UN said today, CNN reports. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said there were roughly 70 co-sponsors of the resolution and that the vote was geared toward “defending the UN” and its charter, the network reported. She said she couldn’t predict how China, India or other nations would vote. Earlier in the week, Russia unsuccessfully pushed for a secret ballot for the vote. Forensic workers in protective gear pulled several bodies wrapped in black plastic from a mass grave in Ukraine’s liberated city of Lyman today as authorities work to assess the death toll and damage from more than four months of Russian occupation, the Associated Press reports. An AP reporter said that 10 body bags lay beside a roughly 100ft (30-metre) trench, and that authorities said 32 bodies had been exhumed so far in the city, which is in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. The head of the Donetsk region’s military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said the victims in the mass grave were Ukrainian soldiers, and that there were also 22 civilians buried in individual graves at the site, located by a cemetery on the outskirts of Lyman. This was the second burial site uncovered in Lyman so far. More background from the AP: As Ukrainian authorities entered the city, they found that many civilian residents had been killed by shelling. Others, mostly older people, had died during the Russian occupation because of a lack of food and medicine, Mark Tkachenko, communications inspector for the Kramatorsk district police of the Donetsk region, told the AP. The destruction in Lyman, a key rail and transit hub, is so widespread that large portions of the city have been completely destroyed. Ukrainian authorities are now working to restore basic infrastructure and investigate how civilians lived and died during the Russian occupation. Forensic investigators on Tuesday lifted a black plastic bag from the trench and unzipped it to reveal a decomposed body in a bloody uniform of the Ukrainian armed forces. The remains were briefly inspected by investigators, then placed in another body bag and set among several others beside the trench. Authorities said children have been found among the dead, and that most victims appeared to have died as the result of the heavy shelling that besieged the city for months. Authorities said the investigation was ongoing and that it was too soon to say whether the victims showed signs of execution or torture, the AP also reported. More from the AP reporter on the ground: It’s 9pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s where we stand: Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday. Amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets, Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range air strikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure. The leaders of the G7 have condemned Russia’s most recent missile attacks in Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms”, and vowed to stand “firmly” with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. The “indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilian populations constitute a war crime” by Russian forces, they said in a joint statement following their meeting with President Zelenskiy. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has warned leaders of the G7 nations that President Vladimir Putin still has “room for escalation”. Zelenskiy also called on G7 leaders for more air defence capabilities to stop Russia and to help Ukraine fund an air defence system after dozens of Russian attacks knocked out power facilities across the country. President Zelenskiy has accused Russia of trying to directly draw Belarus into its war in Ukraine. Zelenskiy, who joined a virtual meeting with heads of the Group of Seven nations on Tuesday, called on leaders to support an international monitoring mission on the Ukraine-Belarus border. Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, said the mobilisation of troops in Belarus poses a threat to Ukraine’s supply lines in the north of the country. Belarus’ defence ministry has said the joint deployment of forces with Russia on its borders is a defensive measure. The moves were to ensure “security” along the border between Belarus and Ukraine, it claimed. On Monday, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said he had ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what he said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and its western allies. Nato is “closely monitoring” Russia’s nuclear forces, its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said. The Russian leader’s veiled nuclear threats are “dangerous and irresponsible”, Stoltenberg said. He added that any deliberate attack against allies’ critical infrastructure “would be met with a united and determined response”. A deputy head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been kidnapped by Russian forces, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom has said. Valeriy Martynyuk was seized on Monday and is being detained in an unknown location, Energoatom said in a post on Telegram. President Vladimir Putin has told the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, that the situation around Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is “of concern”. At a meeting in St Petersburg broadcast on Russian state television, Putin told Grossi that Moscow was open to dialogue and would discuss “all issues” concerning the nuclear facility’s operations. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has called for a ceasefire in Ukraine just days ahead of a meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and President Vladimir Putin. Çavuşoğlu urged “a viable ceasefire and a just peace” based on Ukraine’s territorial integrity. Erdoğan and Putin are expected to meet on Thursday in Kazakhstan’s capital Astana to discuss Ukraine and bilateral relations, the Kremlin confirmed. Moscow would not turn down a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, at the G20 meeting next month, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Moscow was open to talks with the west on the Ukraine war but had yet to receive any “serious offers” to negotiate, Lavrov said in an interview on Russian state television. Vladimir Putin has made strategic errors in his pursuit of the war in Ukraine partly because there are so few restraints on his leadership, according to the head of the British spy agency GCHQ. Russia’s soldiers are running out of supplies and munitions and initial gains made by Moscow are being reversed, Jeremy Fleming said in a rare public address. Western diplomats are predicting that the number of countries voting to oppose the illegal annexation of parts of eastern Ukraine will have fallen from a similar vote held at the UN in March. The UN’s general assembly is due to vote this week on an EU-sponsored motion condemning the annexation of parts of eastern Ukraine off the back of sham referendums. The US is speeding up the shipment of two National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) to Ukraine, the White House said. President Joe Biden had pledged to support Kyiv’s air defences in a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday, following a wave of devastating Russian missile attacks on cities across Ukraine. The US has approved sending Ukraine a total of eight NASAMS air defences so far, with two expected to be delivered soon and six more sent over a longer time frame. Speaking to reporters, the White House’s national security council spokesperson John Kirby said: We think that we’re on track to get those first two over there in the very near future. We are certainly interested in expediting the delivery of NASAMS to Ukraine as soon as we can. A British businessman has been arrested on US charges of conspiring to violate sanctions placed on the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, according to prosecutors. Graham Bonham-Carter was arrested in the UK, and New York federal prosecutors will be seeking his extradition, Reuters reports. Bonham-Carter was also charged with wire fraud for funding US properties purchased by Deripaska and efforts to expatriate Deripaska’s artwork in the US. There was scant attempt to sugarcoat the assessment. With the trams stilled, lights going down across the city and the mobile network intermittent, arguably there was little point in doing otherwise. “We have to brace ourselves for hard times,” said Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, as he addressed local and international journalists in a building off the western Ukrainian city’s cobbled Rynov Square. Winter was coming and with it “perhaps the worst-ever period for our country”, the mayor said. For all that the missiles would continue to rain down it was the cold that the Russians believed could break the Ukrainian spirit. Stock up on fire wood, buy in heaters, insulate where you can, Sadovyi counselled. It was time for Ukrainians to resort to the “old-time methods”. We are in for hard weeks and months ahead. Four [electricity] substations in the region have been put out of operation and to bring them back into operation they need transformers that are not available. It is hard right now to predict what will happen tomorrow. We will do all we can to keep the medical facilities operating. Lviv, just 50 miles from the Polish border, has at times felt somewhat removed from Vladimir Putin’s war. Direct attacks have been few and far between. Following the initial shock over the launch of the Russian president’s “special military operation”, the bars and restaurants had swiftly rediscovered the liveliness that one would expect of an old university town. When air raid sirens would go off to warn that Russian missiles had been launched, destination unknown, the danger could be barely acknowledged at times. Spring gave way to a relatively care-free summer. The attacks of Monday and Tuesday changed all that. Read the full story here: Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine. Russia has added the US tech giant Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, to its list of “terrorists and extremist” organisations, Russian news agencies have reported. Facebook and Instagram were both banned in Russia in March for “carrying out extremist activities” and the company was accused of tolerating “Russophobia”. Meta had announced back then that the platforms would allow statements such as “death to Russian invaders” but not credible threats against civilians. A Moscow court in June rejected an appeal by Meta, whose lawyer said it was not carrying out extremist activity. The company has now been added to a list of “terrorists and extremists” by Russia’s financial monitoring agency, Rosfinmonitoring. The list concerns “organisations and individuals with regard to which there is information about their involvement in extremist activities or terrorism”. The ban does not apply to WhatsApp, which Meta also owns. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has asked G7 leaders to supply more air defence systems and for an international monitoring mission on the Belarusian border, as Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with a new wave of missile strikes on Tuesday. Zelenskiy’s comments came amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets. Warning that the Russian president “still has room for further escalation”, Zelenskiy added that the prompt supply of more air defence systems would accelerate the end of the war. “When Ukraine receives a sufficient quantity of modern and effective air defence systems, the key element of Russia’s terror, rocket strikes, will cease to work,” Zelenskiy said in a video-streamed address. Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine reported on Tuesday that Ukraine had received a delivery of the German Iris-T air defence system and the White House National Security Council spokesman, John Kirby, said the US was working to expedite the shipment of sophisticated Nasams air defences capable of engaging Russian cruise missiles that was first announced in August. While Zelenskiy had been expected to press for additional air defence systems to counter the Russian missile threat, and renewed his call for more sanctions against Moscow, his request for international monitoring of Ukraine’s border with Belarus comes amid mounting fears that Minsk is being drawn ever further into the Kremlin’s war.

The Tesla CEO was asked about the report, which was first written about by Ian Bremmer to his subscribers and later picked up by Vice. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance has been monitoring Russia’s nuclear forces and that any deliberate attack against allies’ critical infrastructure “would be met with a united and determined response”. Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday, amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets. Vladimir Putin’s veiled nuclear threats are “dangerous and irresponsible”, Stoltenberg added. He said Nato had not noticed any changes in Russia’s “posture”, but would be monitoring it. Here’s more on the report that the Tesla chief executive, Elon Musk, spoke directly to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, before tweeting his peace plan to end the war in Ukraine. According to Ian Bremmer’s mailout sent to Eurasia Group subscribers, Musk also appeared concerned about direct threats from Putin. From the Financial Times’ Max Seddon: President Vladimir Putin has told the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, that the situation around Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is “of concern”. At a meeting in St Petersburg broadcast on Russian state television, Putin told Grossi that Moscow was open to dialogue and would discuss “all issues” concerning the nuclear facility’s operations. Ahead of his meeting with the UN’s nuclear watchdog head, Putin said: We see that today there are elements of an excessively dangerous politicisation of everything connected with nuclear activity. We very much hope that, thanks to your efforts, we will be able to reduce all rhetoric and bring this area of our cooperation to normal, despite all the turbulence and complex processes that are taking place on the world stage. The Russian president said he was “happy” to discuss “all issues that are of mutual interest to us and may even cause concern to someone”: For example, as far as the situation around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is concerned. In any case, we are open to this dialogue and are glad to see you. Elon Musk spoke directly to Vladimir Putin before tweeting his peace plan to end the war in Ukraine that would have seen territory permanently handed over to Russia, according to a report. In a mailout sent to Eurasia Group subscribers, Ian Bremmer claimed Musk told him that the Russian president was “prepared to negotiate” if Crimea remained in Russian hands. Putin also reportedly insisted to the Tesla chief executive that Ukraine would have to accept permanent neutrality and recognise Russia’s annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. According to Bremmer, Musk said Putin told him these goals would be reached “no matter what”, including the possible use of nuclear weapons if Ukraine invaded Crimea. Bremmer wrote that Musk told him that “everything needed to be done to avoid that outcome”. Following the alleged conversation with Putin, Musk posted a Twitter poll with his suggestions for ending the war in Ukraine. Musk argued that to reach peace, Russia should be allowed to keep the Crimea Peninsula that it seized in 2014. He also proposed holding votes in parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia that the Kremlin says it is annexing. “Russia leaves if that is will of the people,” he said. Ukraine has received a delivery of the German Iris-T air defence system, Der Spiegel magazine reported. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, confirmed yesterday that the first of four Iris-T SLM air defence systems would be delivered within days. Lambrecht’s statement, delivered hours after Russia unleashed a massive wave of aerial strikes on cities across Ukraine on Monday, said: The renewed missile fire on Kyiv and the many other cities show how important it is to supply Ukraine with air defence systems quickly. Russia’s attacks with missiles and drones terrorise the civilian population in particular. That is why we are now providing support especially with air defence weapons. Britain’s prime minister, Liz Truss, is “firmly committed” to visiting Ukraine “as soon as possible”, Downing Street has said in the wake of Russian missile attacks on Ukrainian cities this week. Asked about what impact the renewed threat of Russian strikes on Kyiv could have on a potential visit by Truss, a No 10 spokesperson said: I couldn’t get into the security considerations around trips like that nor could I get into speculation on dates. As you’ll appreciate, the Prime Minister is firmly committed to visiting as soon as possible. The leaders of the G7 have condemned Russia’s most recent missile attacks in Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms”, and vowed to stand “firmly” with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. The “indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilian populations constitute a war crime” by Russian forces, they said in a joint statement following their meeting with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. They vowed to hold President Vladimir Putin and those responsible for the attacks on Ukraine to account. They also said they would “never recognise” Russia’s “illegal annexation” of Ukrainian territory or “the sham referenda that Russia uses to justify it”. The statement continued: No country wants peace more than Ukraine, whose people have suffered death, displacement and countless atrocities as the result of Russian aggression. Leaders “deplore deliberate Russian escalatory steps’, including the partial mobilisation of reservists and “irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, it said: We reaffirm that any use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences. It added: We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military, diplomatic and legal support and will stand firmly with Ukraine for as long as it takes. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has told leaders of the G7 nations that President Vladimir Putin still has “room for escalation” after two days of widespread strikes on cities across Ukraine. The Russian leader “is now in the final stage of his reign” and is “a threat to all of us”, Zelenskiy said during the video address to G7 leaders. He also called on G7 leaders for more air defence capabilities to stop Russia: When Ukraine receives a sufficient quantity of modern and effective air defence systems, the key element of Russia’s terror, rocket strikes, will cease to work. The Ukrainian president thanked Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for speeding up the delivery of the IRIS-T air defence system and the US president, Joe Biden, for deliveries of air defence systems. He also asked G7 leaders to help Ukraine fund an air defence system after dozens of Russian attacks knocked out power facilities across the country: I am asking you to strengthen the overall effort to help financially with the creation of an air shield for Ukraine. Millions of people will be grateful to the Group of Seven for such assistance. It’s 6.15pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday. Amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets, Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range air strikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure. The death toll from Monday’s Russian missile attacks on a swathe of Ukrainian cities has risen to 19 people, with over 100 wounded, according to figures from the Ukrainian state emergency services. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, warned on Monday of even more “severe retaliation” following Saturday’s attack on the Kerch bridge linking Russia and Crimea. An attack on the Lviv region in western Ukraine on Tuesday left parts of the city without electricity. The mayor of the city, Andriy Sadovyi, appealed to residents to keep water supplies on hand ahead of expected service interruptions following Russian strikes which appear to have hit critical power infrastructure in the region. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Russia of trying to directly draw Belarus into its war in Ukraine. Zelenskiy, who joined a virtual meeting with heads of the Group of Seven nations on Tuesday, called on leaders to support an international monitoring mission on the Ukraine-Belarus border.

He added that any deliberate attack against allies’ critical infrastructure “would be met with a united and determined response”. Six people have been injured in a second Russian strike at the Ladyzhyn thermal power plant (LTPP) in Ukraine’s Vinnytsia region, according to reports. Russia targeted Ukrainian energy infrastructure in a series of coordinated attacks across Ukraine for the second day in a row on Tuesday. A deputy head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been kidnapped by Russian forces, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom has said. Valeriy Martynyuk was seized on Monday and is being detained in an unknown location, Energoatom said in a post on Telegram.

Russia’s soldiers are running out of supplies and munitions and initial gains made by Moscow are being reversed, Jeremy Fleming said in a rare public address. Western diplomats are predicting that the number of countries voting to oppose the illegal annexation of parts of eastern Ukraine will have fallen from a similar vote held at the UN in March. The UN’s general assembly is due to vote this week on an EU-sponsored motion condemning the annexation of parts of eastern Ukraine off the back of sham referendums. Hello, Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest news from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Western diplomats are predicting that the number of countries voting to oppose the illegal annexation of parts of eastern Ukraine will have fallen from a similar vote held at the UN in March, but still expect more than 100 UN states to vote against Russia’s actions. The UN general assembly is due to vote on Wednesday or Thursday on an EU-sponsored motion condemning the annexation of parts of Eastern Ukraine off the back of sham referendums. The motion has been carefully worded to draw maximum support, stressing the need for dialogue and the inviability of national borders. But even so, many African and Gulf states are refusing to take sides. In March, in the immediate wake of the invasion, 141 countries opposed Russia’s action, 35 abstained and five supported Russia. The diplomats said Russia had been “trying very hard in Africa to frame this as a west versus the rest conflict”, adding “lots of things play into these votes that are not necessarily the question in hand”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, last week visited the foreign ministers of Ghana, Senegal and Ivory Coast on his first African tour since the Russian offensive. He is also trying to build what Ukraine admits has been previously inadequate contacts in India and China. A western diplomat said: To any straight-thinking person this is a slam dunk, but countries relationships with each other and their interdependencies are complex and very messy. But western diplomats said an “important shift” was under way amongst some powerful non-aligned countries that had shown themselves “increasingly uncomfortable” with Putin. The diplomats pointed to a Chinese official statement reaffirming the importance of national sovereignty, and the urging by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, for an end to the fighting. India, the diplomat pointed out, is dependent on Russia for oil and military equipment: They think twice about whether they can afford to trim their principles or more probably rely on countries like the UK to defend them and to allow them to operate in a slightly grey area. The sources added that they “could not see China cutting Russia adrift since it would fear that Russia might ultimately be drawn into the western orbit”. But they claim the repeated requirement of Russia to go in front of the UN General Assembly to explain why it is using its veto to then to be defeated humiliatingly is having the cumulative effect of making Russia feel diplomatically isolated. “It is a case of reducing the space for authoritarian dictators”, the source said. Russia, it was pointed out, has in recent months been thrown off the UN Human Rights Council board for UN women, and the board for Unicef, and efforts are under way to squeeze them off the UN Economic and Social Committee. Ukraine has been calling for Russia to be declared a terrorist state, a move that could have an impact on Russia’s seat as one of the permanent five on the UN Security Council, although that is extremely unlikely under the existing rules. The US is likely to say if about 100 member states in the General Assembly vote to support the EU resolution that compares favourably with the vote held in 2014 at the time of the annexation of Ukraine. • This post was amended on 18 October 2022. An earlier version said that Russia being declared a terrorist state would see it “lose its seat as one of the permanent five on the UN Security Council”. However, there is nothing in the UN charter that explicitly states this, and the wording has been amended accordingly. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has said Russia’s possible use of nuclear weapons is highly unpredictable. Speaking to reporters after the virtual G7 meeting on Russia’s invasion fo Ukraine, Kishida said: The situation does not at all allow any prediction. It requires serious, close attention. For the past 77 years, the world has continued to put a stop to using nuclear weapons. This history of not using nuclear weapons must continue further. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for an international monitoring mission on the Ukraine-Belarus border. Zelenskiy, who joined a virtual meeting with heads of the Group of Seven nations, called on leaders to support the international mission. He told G7 leaders: Russia is trying to directly draw Belarus into this war, playing a provocation that we are allegedly preparing an attack on this country. It comes after the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said he had ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what he said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and western backers. During the G7 meeting, which has now ended, Zelenskiy also called on leaders to give Ukraine enough air defence capabilities to defend itself against Russia, as well as tough new sanctions on Moscow. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance is “closely monitoring” Russia’s nuclear forces and that any deliberate attack against allies’ critical infrastructure “would be met with a united and determined response”. The Nato military alliance “is not party” to the conflict in Ukraine, Stoltenberg said during a news conference. “But our support is playing a key role,” he added. Allies remained “united in their support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and self-defence”, he said. Stoltenberg told reporters: Ukraine has the momentum and continues to make significant gains. While Russia is increasingly resorting to horrific and indiscriminate attacks on civilians and critical infrastructure. President Putin is “failing in Ukraine” and his “attempted annexations, partial mobilisation, and reckless nuclear rhetoric represent the most significant escalation since the start of the war”, he said. The Russian leader’s veiled nuclear threats are “dangerous and irresponsible”, Stoltenberg added: Russia knows that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. We are closely monitoring Russia’s nuclear forces. We have not seen any changes in Russia’s posture. But we remain vigilant. The speech was heavily trailed, but here is what Jeremy Fleming, head of the British spy agency GCHQ, had to say about Vladimir Putin and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this afternoon: Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machines spouted, it is clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefields and in cyberspace is turning the tide. Having failed in two major military strategies already. Putin’s plan has hit the courageous reality of Ukrainian defence. With little effective internal challenge, Putin’s decision making has proved flawed. Yesterday’s attacks in Kyiv and across Ukraine are another example. It is a high stakes strategy that is leading to strategic errors in judgement. Their gains are being reversed, and the costs to Russia in people and equipment are staggering. We know – and Russian military commanders know – that their supplies and ammunition are running out. Russia’s forces are exhausted. The use of prisoners as reinforcements, and now the mobilisation of tens of thousands of inexperienced conscripts, speaks of a really desperate situation. And the Russian people have started to understand all of that, too. They’re seeing just how badly Putin has misjudge the situation. They’re fleeing the draft, realising they can no longer travel, and they know their access to modern technologies and external influences will be drastically restricted. And they’re feeling the extent of the dreadful human cost of his war of choice. During her foreign ministry briefing, Russia’s Maria Zakharova has also expressed Russian displeasure with Moldova and Estonia. She said Russia was concerned at statements by Estonia’s foreign minister, Urmas Reinsalu, and was also concerned about an incident affecting Russian diplomats in Moldova. Zakharova also accused the west of hypocrisy in not criticising Ukrainian officials for statements that appear to support violence, accusing the west of “conniving at Kyiv’s impunity”. While Nato’s Jens Stoltenberg has been speaking to the media about nuclear exercises, and the GCHQ boss Jeremy Fleming has been giving his lecture, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has also been giving a briefing. The key point to emerge so far appears to be that Russia has not yet formally received a Turkish proposal to host peace talks between Moscow and western countries. The Kremlin says it has not ruled out that Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan could discuss a Turkish proposal to host peace talks when they meet on Thursday, but the foreign ministry said it is yet to hear about this through diplomatic channels. Nato’s Jen Stoltenberg has given details of Nato’s annual nuclear deterrence training exercises, which are scheduled for next week, and unlikely to ease nuclear tensions between the alliance and Russia. Stoltenberg said “This is routine training which happens every year to keep our deterrence safe, secure and effective. President Putin’s veiled nuclear threats are dangerous and irresponsible. Russia knows that a nuclear war can never be won and can never be fought.” The FT reports that the weeklong ‘Steadfast Noon’ exercise will “involve 14 Nato alliance members, and nuclear-capable aircraft alongside additional capabilities such as intelligence and refuelling planes. The weeklong exercise is to ensure that relevant personnel and equipment are prepared.” Jeremy Fleming, the head of GCHQ, is about to start speaking. RUSI is the Royal United Services Institute. The title of the lecture is “If China is the Question, What is the Answer?”, but he is expected to also address the UK’s views on Russia’s current campaign in Russia. You should be able to watch it in the video window above the live blog. It is being chaired by Shashank Joshi, defence editor of the Economist. The speech was previewed earlier by our defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh. We have got a video feed of GCHQ head Jeremy Fleming’s speech this afternoon at the top of the live. It is due to start shortly. You may have to refresh the page to get the play button to appear. The Kyiv Independent, citing a Facebook post by the operators DTEK, is reporting that six people were injured in a second strike at the Ladyzhyn thermal power plant (LTPP) in the Vinnytsia region. The post reads: Unfortunately, the LTPP has suffered a second blow from Russian terrorist troops. This happened at the moment when rescuers were working on site. There are some victims. According to preliminary information, there are six people. The victims were promptly provided medical care, they were taken to the hospital. There are no employees of the company among the injured. As a result of the shelling, the company’s energy equipment was damaged again. When the security situation will allow, workers will start with repairs. Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, has said that repairs are already underway to the glass bridge in Kyiv popular with tourists which was struck by Russian missiles yesterday. He posted to Telegram, alongside some images, saying that replacement glass had been ordered and would take three weeks. He said: Soon our renovated bridge will once again delight the residents of Kyiv and guests of the capital. Because it is now not only one of the tourist symbols of Kyiv, but also a symbol of the indomitability and stability of Ukraine. The White House has confirmed that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, joined President Joe Biden and other G7 leaders for their virtual meeting today. The call began at 13:09 GMT, the White House said. We’ll bring you more information about the G7 meeting as soon as we hear it. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has called for a ceasefire in Ukraine just days ahead of a meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and President Vladimir Putin. “Unfortunately [both sides] have quickly moved away from diplomacy” since the talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in Istanbul in March, Çavuşoğlu said in a televised interview, cited by AFP. The situation “gets worse and more complicated” as the war drags on, he said: A ceasefire must be established as soon as possible. The sooner the better. He called for a “just peace” based on Ukraine’s territorial integrity, adding: A process that will ensure Ukraine’s border and territorial integrity should start. Without a ceasefire, it is not possible to talk about those issues in a healthy way: a viable ceasefire and a just peace. Erdoğan and Putin are expected to meet on Thursday in Kazakhstan’s capital Astana to discuss Ukraine and bilateral relations, the Kremlin confirmed earlier. A deputy head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been kidnapped by Russian forces, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company Energoatom has said. Valeriy Martynyuk, a deputy director general for human resources at the nuclear plant, was seized on Monday and is being detained in an unknown location, Energoatom said in a post on Telegram. It said Russian kidnappers were “probably using methods of torture” on Martynyuk in an attempt to obtain information from the personnel files of the Zaporizhzhia staff “in order to force Ukrainian staff to work for Rosatom [the Russian state-owned nuclear power supplier] as soon as possible”. Energatom appealed to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, and the international community to “take all possible measures” for Martynyuk’s immediate release. In September, the director general of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was detained by Russia while on his way from the plant, Europe’s largest, to the town of Enerhodar. Ihor Murashov was later released, the IAEA confirmed. The bodies of 62 Ukrainian soldiers have been “returned home” following “difficult negotiations”, Ukraine’s ministry responsible for temporarily-occupied territories has said. The ministry said it had negotiated the return of the soldiers’ remains, including servicemen killed at the Olenivka prison, in a statement on social media. It said: Another transfer took place: 62 fallen heroes were returned home. Olenivka prison, in Russian-occupied Donetsk, was bombed in an attack in July that left at least 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war dead, according to both the Ukrainian and Russian authorities. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for the attack. A meeting between Group of Seven leaders and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was scheduled to begin a few moments ago at 1200 GMT. G7 leaders are expected to discuss their commitment to support Ukraine and hold President Vladimir Putin accountable for Russia’s aggression, including its recent missile strikes across Ukraine, the White House said yesterday. President Zelenskiy is scheduled to participate at the top of the meeting, where he will ask leaders to urgently supply Ukraine with air defence weapons. Speaking with reporters earlier today, the Kremlin said it had limited expectations of the G7 meeting. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: The mood of this summit is already obvious and predictable. The confrontation will continue. Belarus has said the joint deployment of forces with Russia on its borders is a defensive measure. In a statement, the Belarusian defence ministry said: The tasks of the Regional Grouping of Forces are purely defensive. All the activities currently being carried out are aimed at responding adequately to actions near our borders. The moves were to ensure “security” along the border between Belarus and Ukraine, the statement continued. It also said it would begin a military inspection today to ensure “combat readiness”: During the inspection, military units and sub-units will work out the issues of putting on combat readiness. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said on Monday he had ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what he said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and its western allies. The remarks by Lukashenko mark a potential further escalation of the war in Ukraine, possibly with a combined Russian-Belarus joint force in the north of Ukraine. Our Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth, writes that the first deaths are being reported among Russians who were mobilised late last month. The Kremlin has confirmed that President Vladimir Putin will meet his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Thursday to discuss Ukraine. The meeting will take place in Astana, Kazakhstan, the Kremlin spokesperson said. Dmitry Peskov had told reporters yesterday that it was “possible” the two leaders would discuss a Turkish proposal to host talks between Russia and the west on peace in Ukraine. The pair will meet on the sidelines of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia summit in the Kazakhstan capital. They last met in mid-September in Uzbekistan on the sidelines of a summit of the leaders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine. My colleague Peter Beaumont writes that he has seen a number of newly mobilised Russian fighters who have arrived on the frontline of the war with barely any training, including around the town of Svatove in Luhansk region. Moscow would not turn down a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, at the G20 meeting next month, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Moscow was open to talks with the west on the Ukraine war but had yet to receive any “serious offers” to negotiate, Lavrov said in an interview on Russian state television. He said US officials including the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, had said the US was willing to engage in discussions but Russia had refused. Lavrov said: This is a lie. We have not received any serious offers to make contact. He suggested Russia was willing to listen to any suggestions regarding peace talks: We have repeatedly said that we never refuse meetings. If there is a proposal, then we will consider it. Speaking about the possibility that Turkey could host talks between Russia and the west, Lavrov said Moscow would be willing to listen to any suggestions but could not say in advance whether this would lead to results. He said Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, would have the opportunity to put forward proposals to Putin when both visit Kazakhstan this week. Lavrov also claimed the US had long been involved in the war in Ukraine, which he said was “being controlled by the Anglo-Saxons”. Russia’s defence ministry has confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range air strikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure today. In a statement, it said: The purpose of the strike has been achieved. All designated facilities have been hit. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has accused Russia of committing war crimes by targeting energy facilities to create “unbearable conditions for civilians”. Kuleba wrote: These are war crimes planned well in advance and aimed at creating unbearable conditions for civilians - Russia’s deliberate strategy since months. A children’s doctor working at a cancer hospital in Kyiv was reportedly among those killed by yesterday’s wave of Russian strikes on cities across Ukraine. Oksana Leontieva was a doctor in the children’s bone marrow transplant department at the Okhmatdyt children’s cancer hospital, according to the hospital. She was on her way to work on Monday morning after dropping her son at kindergarten when a Russian missile hit the Ukrainian capital. In a statement on Facebook, the hospital described Leontieva as a “dedicated and responsible person and doctor” who was a “true professional and support for her patients and colleagues”. Anton Gerashchenko, a senior presidential adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said her five-year-old son is now an orphan, having lost his father six months ago. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Martin Belam to bring you all the latest developments on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The death toll from Monday’s Russian missile attacks on a swathe of Ukrainian cities has risen to 19 people, with over 100 wounded, according to figures from the Ukrainian state emergency services. Strikes continued on Tuesday. An attack on the Lviv region in western Ukraine on Tuesday left parts of the city without electricity. Governor Maksym Kozytskyi has said “At this moment, it is known about three explosions at two energy facilities in the Lviv region”. Mayor of the city, Andriy Sadovyi, appealed to resident to keep water supplies on hand ahead of expected service interruptions. The Ladyzhyn thermal power plant (LTPP) in the Vinnytsia region was struck on Tuesday morning. Regional head Serhiy Borzov said: “An attack was launched on the LTPP. Two Shahed-136 kamikaze drones.” There has been a lengthy air raid warning in place all morning in Kyiv, with governor Oleksiy Kuleba claiming that at least one rocket had been shot down. Valentyn Reznichenko, the governor of Dnipro, has claimed that air defence systems had shot down four missiles over the region. Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, has said that “there are still missiles in the air” and that Ukraine’s air defences continue to work. The head of GCHQ has said the UK spy agency has not seen any indicators that Russia is preparing to use a tactical nuclear weapon in or around Ukraine despite recent bellicose statements from Vladimir Putin. Jeremy Fleming, speaking on Tuesday morning, said it was one of GCHQ’s tasks to monitor whether the Kremlin was taking any of the preliminary steps needed before a tactical weapon was being made ready. Fleming is expected to say in a rare public speech delivered later on Tuesday that Putin is making strategic errors due to unconstrained power. “Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, it’s clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,” Fleming will say. “With little effective internal challenge, Putin’s decision-making has proved flawed” The deployment of a joint task-force of Russian and Belorussian troops within Belarus poses a threat to Ukraine’s supply lines in the north of the country, according to Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK. Prystaiko also said that Russia is “running out of sophisticated weapons” and using missiles like “dumb bombs”, and said that Ukraine was still making progress on the frontline but “not as spectacular as it used to be a couple weeks ago”. He said in the south “we are closing the circle” and that “there are almost 20,000 Russian soldiers there. If you manage to capture them it will be a huge blow for the whole campaign.” Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus, has called on Russian soldiers to leave the country. Belarus could face more sanctions if it gets more and more involved in the Ukraine conflict, France’s foreign affairs minister Catherine Colonna told French radio A spokesperson for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has said “We are gravely concerned that some of the attacks appear to have targeted critical civilian infrastructure … indicating that these strikes may have violated the principles on the conduct of hostilities under international humanitarian law.” Mass bombardments of Ukrainian cities by Russia constitute war crimes under international law, the presidents of the Bucharest Nine group of countries, accompanied by the presidents of North Macedonia and Montenegro, said on Tuesday. Thérèse Coffey, deputy prime minister of the UK, said Monday’s strikes showed “this is a time for other countries to continue the level of support that they’ve been showing, and where necessary to escalate their level of support directly to the Ukrainian armed forces.” The German chancellor has attempted to make reassurances that the country’s energy supply will be secure this winter. Olaf Scholz said: “I am happy to say to you today, if we all continue to adapt to the changed situation – the citizens, the companies and the politicians – then we will get safely through this winter.” Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, has called Russia a “terrorist state” at a General Assembly meeting on Monday night. Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, in turn accused Ukraine of rivalling “the most outrageous terrorist organisations” after a bridge linking Russia to the annexed Ukrainian territory of Crimea was attacked. Andriy Sadovyi, mayor of Lviv, has asked residents to store a small supply of water in anticipation that there may be outages later today following Russian strikes which appear to have hit critical power infrastructure in the region and has knocked out electricity in some parts of the city. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus, has called on Russian soldiers to leave the country. She stated that the oppositions position was: Belarus must officially withdraw from Russian war participation. Every Russian soldier must leave Belarus unconditionally. All involved in Russia’s attack from Belarus must be held accountable. Democratic Belarus and Ukraine should build an alliance against Russian aggression. Tsikhanouskaya has been in exile since Alexander Lukashenko claimed his own victory in the August 2020 election in Belarus. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv in western Ukraine, has posted an update to Telegram saying: At this moment, it is known about three explosions at two energy facilities in the Lviv region. Information about victims is yet to be received. The danger still continues. The Lviv region borders Poland, and is one of the furthest regions of Ukraine from the four areas in the east which Russia partially occupies and has claimed to “annex”. A spokesperson for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has said “We are gravely concerned that some of the attacks appear to have targeted critical civilian infrastructure … indicating that these strikes may have violated the principles on the conduct of hostilities under international humanitarian law.” Reuters reports Ravina Shamdasani told a news conference on Tuesday “We urge the Russian Federation to refrain from further escalation, and to take all feasible measures to prevent civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure.” Moscow has repeatedly denied that it targets civilians and civilian infrastructure during what it has termed its “special military operation” in Ukraine, despite the widespread evidence of damage to civilian areas and the discovery of mass graves in areas formerly occupied by invading Russian troops. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, has said on the Telegram messaging app that parts of the city are again without electricity following what he described as a “rocket attack on a critical infrastructure facility.” More details soon … Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, has just posted to Telegram to say “there are still missiles in the air” and that Ukraine’s air defences continue to work. There are reports of explosions in Lviv, which have impacted electricity supplies. The mayor of the city, Andriy Sadovyi, has posted to Telegram: “Explosions are heard in Lviv. There are problems with electricity.” The regional governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, has posted a similar message. At 12.08pm local time he wrote: “An attack on an energy facility in Lviv region. Stay in shelters. Do not spread photos, videos and rumours.” Valentyn Reznichenko, the governor of Dnipro, has posted to Telegram to claim that so far today air defence systems had shot down four missiles over the region. He told residents to stay in shelters as “the attack continues”. The region borders Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, three of the occupied areas of Ukraine that Russia has claimed to “annex”. Ukrinform is reporting that the Ladyzhyn thermal power plant (LTPP) in the Vinnytsia region was struck this morning. It quotes the regional head, Serhiy Borzov, as saying: “An attack was launched on the LTPP. Two Shahed-136 kamikaze drones.” The report says that emergency services are at the scene. The mobilisation of troops in Belarus poses a threat to Ukraine’s supply lines in the north of the country, according to Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK. He told viewers of Sky News in the UK: “The Belorussian case is difficult because they are on top of Ukraine, the north of Ukraine. The danger this is actually posing is to cut the supply lines. We are receiving everything from the west, they’re coming through these western borders.” However, he also said one factor that might be causing the Belarus leader Lukashenko to be cautious was that “some people believe he’s not mobilising people because he is not sure whether the Kalashnikov’s will be turned against him maybe”. Russia is “running out of sophisticated weapons” and using missiles like “dumb bombs”, according to Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK. Vadym Prystaiko also told viewers of Sky News that Ukraine was still making progress on the frontline but “not as spectacular as it used to be a couple weeks ago”. He said in the south “we are closing the circle” and that “there are almost 20,000 Russian soldiers there. If you manage to capture them it will be a huge blow for the whole campaign.” On diminishing weapons stockpiles, he said: “What Russians are using now is old rockets from the 1960s, the 1970s. What they’re doing, more or less, utilising some of the rockets that used to be quite sophisticated, now they are throwing them like dumb bombs. So they are running out of sophisticated equipment, that’s for sure. “But it has been research done for many years how the new wars will look like, and how fast the sides will run out of sophisticated equipment, and we’ll have to get back to all of this 1960s when they can actually fix the old tank with a hammer and just simple simple instruments.” Mass bombardments of Ukrainian cities by Russia constitute war crimes under international law, the presidents of the Bucharest Nine group of countries, accompanied by the presidents of North Macedonia and Montenegro, said on Tuesday. “We, the presidents of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia condemn the mass bombardments of Ukrainian cities recently carried out by Russia, which constitute war crimes under international law,” Reuters reports they said in a statement. Here are the quotes from head of GCHQ Jeremy Fleming’s interview with the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. PA Media quotes him saying: We believe that Russia is running short of munitions, it’s certainly running short of friends. We’ve seen, because of the declaration for mobilisation, that it’s running short of troops. So I think the answer to that is pretty clear. Russia and Russia’s commanders are worried about the state of their military machine. The word I’ve used is ‘desperate’. We can see that desperation at many levels inside Russian society and inside the Russian military machine. It certainly doesn’t imply complacency. Russia, as we’ve seen in the dreadful attacks yesterday, still has a very capable military machine. It can launch weapons, it has deep, deep stocks and expertise. And yet, it is very broadly stretched in Ukraine. Fleming was also asked about the prospect of Russia using nuclear weapons. “I would hope that we will see indicators if they started to go down that path,” he said. “But let’s be really clear about that, if they are considering that, that would be a catastrophe in the way that many people have talked about.” The German chancellor has this morning attempted to make reassurances that the country’s energy supply will be secure this winter. Speaking at an engineering conference, Reuters reports that Olaf Scholz said: “I am happy to say to you today, if we all continue to adapt to the changed situation – the citizens, the companies and the politicians – then we will get safely through this winter.” Scholz added that Germany was almost at the target of having its gas storage facilities 95% full. The head of the British spy agency GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming, is making a rare public appearance today, with a speech planned later on. He is also appearing on the BBC’s Today programme, where he has been interviewed about Russia and China. Our defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, has been listening. The Russian foreign ministry’s social channels are this morning pushing out links to a response that the foreign ministry spokesperson gave late yesterday to recent statements coming from the US. In it, Maria Zakharova says: We repeat for the US once again: the objectives we set in Ukraine will be achieved. Russia is open to diplomacy, the terms are known. The longer Washington encourages Kiev’s bellicosity, encouraging rather than preventing terrorist incursions by Ukrainian saboteurs, the more difficult the search for a diplomatic settlement will become. Official figures from Ukraine suggest that yesterday at least 19 people were killed and more than 100 civilians were wounded after Russia launched a barrage of more than 80 missiles and rockets at cities throughout Ukraine, well away from the frontline of the occupied territory which the Russian Federation claims to have “annexed”. Oleksiy Kuleba, the governor of Kyiv, has just reported in the last minutes on Telegram “another shot down rocket. We stay in the shelters.” Today’s First Edition newsletter has Archie Bland talking to Andrew Roth, the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, and to Peter Beaumont, who is in Kyiv. Here’s an extract: The vital question over the next few days, Peter said, is whether “this is a screw-you retaliatory strike or the start of something bigger and more serious”. But there are doubts over whether Russia has the stocks of missiles to maintain such an approach, as Dan Sabbagh notes in this analysis. The chief of GCHQ will say in a rare speech today that Russian forces are exhausted and their supplies of munitions are running out. “These attacks don’t make a lot of sense for the military picture on the ground,” Peter said. “Shooting up cities doesn’t advance your troops. What I think would worry Ukraine more is some change on the frontlines.” In that context, there may be more concern over the news yesterday that Russian forces will be allowed to return to Belarus, potentially stretching Ukrainian forces further on the northern border. Meanwhile, as G7 leaders meet today, with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in attendance, western leaders appear to have acknowledged the renewed urgency of the case for additional help: Germany said it would begin to deliver four long-awaited advanced air defence systems in the next few days, while Joe Biden also pledged the provision of advanced air defence systems in a call with Ukraine’s president yesterday. “Those systems aren’t infallible,” Peter said. “But you cannot have a conversation with anyone in this country, whether they’re a farmer in Kherson or a senior official, where they don’t come up.” Behind all of this is an unthinkable threat: nuclear attack. “Everybody here knows it’s a shoe that hasn’t dropped, and it overshadows life to some degree,” Peter said. “But one of the features of the last few days is that if something like what happened to the Kerch bridge doesn’t prompt that, when it was so humiliating for Putin, we may have a long way to go to get there.” You can read it in full here: Tuesday briefing – After Russia retaliates, what might happen next? The Ukrainian MP Volodymyr Ariev has told Sky News in the UK that he believed Vladimir Putin launched the wave of attacks so he could look like a strong leader at the G20 summit in Bali, rather than a weak one who had been losing ground in Ukraine. He said: We understand that it was planned in advance. Putin would like to present it like a response to the explosion on the Crimea bridge, but it hasn’t been proven who was behind that attack. But for Putin it makes no sense to find a truthful reason for escalation in Ukraine. The reason for it, for me, is pretty understandable. In one month, Putin is going to the meeting of G20 countries in Indonesia. So he would like to present himself not a weak leader, after defeats of the Russian army on conventional battlegrounds. He would like to speak to the world from a position of strength. So that’s why he changed the commander of operations against Ukraine, and his first day was an airstrike to scare Ukraine. Of course, Ukrainians were not scared. The missile attacks on Ukrainian cities yesterday were mostly well away from the front line, where Ukrainian forces had been making progress in both the Donbas to the north and towards Kherson in the south in recent weeks. Kirill Stremousov, one of the Russian-imposed leaders in occupied Kherson, has messaged on Telegram this morning to claim that pro-Russian forces have been repulsed in Kherson, as well as an attack on the key Antonovsky bridge. He also wrote: The denazification of the Ukronazis and the fascist leadership of Ukraine continues. The time has come for residents of the remaining Ukraine to see clearly and stop self-destruction for the sake of the collective West. Separately, an appeal to the Ukronazis – stop hiding behind playgrounds, you will all be condemned as war criminals. Stremousov provided no evidence to back up his claims. The Russian Federation has claimed to “annex” Kherson region after a widely-derided “referendum”, despite not being in full control of the territory. The head of the British spy agency GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming, is expected to make a rare public address later today at the Rusi thinktank, and parts of what he will say have been briefed out in advance. Dan Sabbagh reports: The GCHQ director will highlight the costs to Russia from the months of fighting, arguing that Moscow’s forces have become exhausted and its recent mobilisation of conscripts shows signs of desperation. “We know – and Russian commanders on the ground know – that their supplies and munitions are running out,” he will say. “Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, it’s clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,” Fleming will say. Focusing on the Russian president directly, Fleming is expected to say that “with little effective internal challenge, his decision-making has proved flawed” and that he has engaged in “a high-stakes strategy that is leading to strategic errors in judgment”. Fleming is also expected to speak about the future threat posed by China, according to a pre-released extract of the remarks. Read more of Dan Sabbagh’s report here: GCHQ head – Putin making strategic errors due to unconstrained power The Interfax news agency in Russia reports that there are now four ferries plying the route across the Kerch Strait between Russia and Crimea. The service runs every two hours, reports Interfax, and a return journey takes four hours. It is to replace the road and rail link of the Kerch bridge, which was hit by an explosion at the weekend causing a section to partially collapse. The Russian Federation annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine’s state emergency services have updated their count of the dead and wounded from yesterday’s attacks. In a message posted to Telegram earlier this morning, the agency said that “according to preliminary data, 19 people died, there were another 105 injured”. The service also said that over 1,000 people and 120 units were involved in extinguishing fires and emergency rescue operations yesterday. They suggest that around 300 settlements in four oblasts remains without power. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has stated on Telegram that electricity supplies have been restored to everywhere in the region, and that electricity and water supplies have been fully restored in the city of Lviv. The areas suffered outages yesterday after Russian strikes, leading to power failures that included at one point border crossings between Ukraine and Poland. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, has posted a status update for his region to the Telegram messaging app. He gave the casualty count in the last 24 hours for Mykolaiv as one woman killed. He said that yesterday air defence systems destroyed 14 cruise missiles over Mykolaiv. He also claims that between 3.30am and 5,30am local time this morning Ukrainian forces destroyed five “Shahed-136” kamikaze drones. The claims have not been independently verified. Thérèse Coffey, who is deputy prime minister of the UK, has been interviewed on Sky News this morning. She was asked what the UK could do to offer further support to Ukraine following yesterday’s wave of Russian missile strikes on cities. She called for other countries to offer support, saying: We have been continuing the support that we’ve been giving. The prime minister [Liz Truss] was foreign secretary beforehand, working in step with our defence secretary Ben Wallace and at the time prime minister Boris Johnson, and we continue to do that. So we need to make sure that the west is also resolved to making sure that Putin must fail. And the people of Ukraine succeed. Pressed on something specific the UK could offer, she continued: Well, of course, some of these operational matters, of the direct support [that] will be given will be discussed confidentially, both within government, but also with the Ukrainian president. And I know that we have always stepped up to deliver what we can. But this is a time for other countries to continue the level of support that they’ve been showing, and where necessary to escalate their level of support directly to the Ukrainian armed forces, as we have done Belarus could face more sanctions if it gets more and more involved in the Ukraine conflict, French foreign affairs minister Catherine Colonna told French radio, Reuters reports. Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko said yesterday that he had ordered troops to deploy jointly with Russian forces near Ukraine in response to what he said was a clear threat to Belarus from Kyiv and its backers.

My colleague Martin Belam will take you through the latest for the next while. Israeli-Russian billionaire Yuri Milner said on Monday he has renounced his Russian citizenship after leaving the country in 2014. Milner is the founder of internet investment firm DST Global, and made a fortune by betting on Chinese tech companies like e-commerce platforms Alibaba and JD.com. “My family and I left Russia for good in 2014, after the Russian annexation of Crimea,” Milner said in a tweet. “And this summer, we officially completed the process of renouncing our Russian citizenship.” Milner has been an Israeli citizen since 1999 and has not visited Russia since 2014, according to a fact sheet on DST Global’s website. Milner also has no assets in Russia, 97% of his personal wealth was created outside of the country and “Yuri has never met Vladimir Putin, either individually or in a group,” according to the website. Ukraine’s state emergency service has reported that the death toll from Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian cities on 10 October has risen to 19, with the number of injured rising to over 105. Hong Kong’s leader John Lee said Tuesday he will implement only United Nations sanctions – not US, UK or EU sanctions – after the US warned the territory’s status as a financial centre could be affected if it acts as a safe haven for sanctioned individuals, AP reports. Lee’s statement Tuesday came days after a luxury yacht connected to Russian tycoon Alexey Mordashov docked in the city. Mordashov, who is believed to have close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was sanctioned by the US, UK and the European Union in February after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Hong Kong authorities have said that they do not implement unilateral sanctions imposed by other governments. “We cannot do anything that has no legal basis,” Lee told reporters. “We will comply with United Nations sanctions, that is our system, that is our rule of law,” he said. A US State Department spokesperson said in a statement Monday that “the possible use of Hong Kong as a safe haven by individuals evading sanctions from multiple jurisdictions further calls into question the transparency of the business environment.” The State Department spokesperson also said the city’s reputation as a financial centre “depends on its adherence to international laws and standards.” The UK Ministry of Defence has published its daily update from Ukraine, reporting that “the Russian Ministry of Defence (MoD) announced that General Sergei Surovikin had been appointed as overall commander of its Joint Group of Forces conducting the ‘special military operation’ in Ukraine” on 8 October. “For much of its operation, Russia has likely lacked a single empowered field commander,” the MoD tweeted. “Surovikin’ s appointment likely reflects an effort by the Russian national security community to improve the delivery of the operation. However, he will likely have to contest with an increasingly factional Russian MOD which is poorly resourced to achieve the political objectives it has been set in Ukraine.” Ukraine’s Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Emine Dzheppar, reports that Russia fired at least fifteen rockets on Zaporizhzhia last night, targeting “an educational institution, a medical institution and residential buildings.” Citing the Oblast Military Administration, media outlet Ukrainska Pravda reports that that Ladyzhynska power plant in the southwestern city of Vinnytsia was shelled a short while ago by two Shahed-136 kamikaze drones. Reuters reports via RIA that Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov has warned the US and Nato against “the West’s growing involvement in the Ukrainian conflict”, saying that Moscow would respond and hope[s] that they realise the danger of uncontrolled escalation in Washington and other Western capitals”. Ukranian state news agency Ukrinform reports that 98 miners are still trapped underground following Russia’s shelling of Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian president Vlodymyr Zelensky’s home town. Power outages caused by the strikes have left 98 miners stick underground., the news agency reports, with rescuers working to release them. Almost 900 miners had been trapped in four mines following the strikes, but most have since been freed. Despite – or because of – yesterday’s missile strikes on several Ukranian cities, people in Lviv, which was among the cities targeted by Russia, went dancing last night. Wall Street Journal correspondent Matthew Luxmoore posted the below video on Twitter late on Monday night, adding that “Ukranian songs were interspersed tonight with chants of ‘Death to Enemies!’ and ‘Putin is a dick’!’” Air rid sirens are sounding this morning in Kyiv, the BBC’s Paul Adams and others report, as Ukrainians wake up after yesterday’s strikes in cities across the country, which have killed 14 people and left almost 100 injured. Further strikes were reported in Zaporizhizhia overnight. Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, has called Russia a “terrorist state” at a General Assembly meeting on Monday night. “Deliberate targeting of civilians is a war crime. By launching missile attacks on civilians, sleeping in their homes or rushing to work, children going to schools, Russia has proven once again that it is a terrorist state that must be deterred in the strongest possible ways,” he said. Russia’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, in turn accused Ukraine of rivalling ‘the most outrageous terrorist organisations’ after a bridge linking Russia to the annexed Ukrainian territory of Crimea was attacked Vladimir Putin has made strategic errors in his pursuit of the war in Ukraine partly because there are so few restraints on his leadership, the head of the British spy agency GCHQ will say in a speech on Tuesday. Russia’s soldiers are running out of supplies and munitions and initial gains made by Moscow are being reversed, Jeremy Fleming is expected to add in a rare public address. “Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, it’s clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,” Fleming will say. Focusing on the Russian president directly, Fleming is expected to say that “with little effective internal challenge, his decision-making has proved flawed” and that he has engaged in “a high-stakes strategy that is leading to strategic errors in judgment”. There are a few events and meetings planned for today, so here is a summary of what we can expect, among the unexpected: G7 leaders will hold crisis talks with Zelenskiy in attendance. The leaders are likely to discuss the global energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion, amid plans to introduce a global cap on the price of Russian oil to target Putin’s revenues. UK Prime Minister Liz Truss is expected to call for a full meeting of Nato leaders to happen in the coming days United Arab Emirates president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan will visit Moscow on Tuesday to meet Putin. Jeremy Fleming, the head of the British spy agency GCHQ will say in a speech on Tuesday that Vladimir Putin has made strategic errors in his pursuit of the war in Ukraine partly because there are so few restraints on his leadership. The UK Prime Minister, Liz Truss, is expected to call for a full meeting of Nato leaders in coming days as the G7 holds crisis talks on Tuesday following Russian strikes on Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities. Russian forces rained more than 80 missiles on cities across Ukraine on Monday, according to Kyiv, in apparent retaliation for an explosion that damaged a key bridge linking the Crimean peninsula to Russia. The G7 video call will also be attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. G7 leaders are also likely to discuss the global energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion, amid plans to introduce a global cap on the price of Russian oil to target Putin’s revenues, PA reports. Ukraine stepped up calls for western allies to provide anti-air and anti-missile systems in response to Monday’s strikes, which have so far killed 14 and injured 97. Kyiv was targeted for the first time in months, while Russia also hit civilian areas and energy infrastructure across the country, from Kharkiv in the east to Lviv near the Polish border. The death toll from Russia’s strikes on Kyiv and other cities on 10 October has risen to 14, while 97 have been injured, Ukraine’s State Emergency Services said in an update on Monday night. More than 1,300 settlements across the country were without power, the emergency service said. Many of the locations hit by cruise missiles and kamikaze drones during the morning rush hour appeared to be solely civilian sites or key pieces of infrastructure, apparently chosen to terrorise Ukrainians. Oleksandr Starukh, Governor of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, announced the attacks overnight in a post on Telegram: “The occupier attacked the regional center with rockets. Infrastructure objects became the targets of the enemy. Information about the destruction and victims is being ascertained.” Zaporizhzhia was also hit in the 10 October strikes. The Kyiv Independent reports that there have been strikes on Zaporizhzhia overnight, saying in a tweet shortly before 7am local time that, “Russian forces targeted an infrastructure site in the city of Zaporizhzhia, according to Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Oleksandr Starukh. Information on casualties and damages has not yet been reported.” The Guardian has not confirmed this independently. We will bring you more shortly. Hello and welcome to our ongoing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be taking you through the latest as it happens. If there is news you think we may have missed, let me know on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. The Kyiv Independent reports that there have been strikes on Zaporizhzhia overnight, saying in a tweet shortly before 7am local time, “Russian forces targeted an infrastructure site in the city of Zaporizhzhia, according to Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Oleksandr Starukh. Information on casualties and damages has not yet been reported.” The Guardian has not confirmed this independently. Meanwhile the death toll from Russia’s attacks on Ukraine on 10 October has risen to 14, with the number of injured rising to 97, Ukraine’s State Emergency Services said in an update on Monday night. Liz Truss is expected to call for a full meeting of Nato leaders in the coming days, as G7 leaders hold crisis talks on Tuesday, with Ukraine’s president, Vlodymyr Zelenskiy, attending, following Russian strikes on Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities. In the meantime, here are the other key recent developments: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his country was “dealing with terrorists” and accused Russia of targeting power facilities and civilians following the missile attacks. “They deliberately chose such a time, such goals, in order to cause as much harm as possible,” the Ukrainian leader said. US president Joe Biden said the US “strongly condemns” the Russian missile strikes on cities across Ukraine, which demonstrate Putin’s “utter brutality” against the Ukrainian people. In a separate statement, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the international community “has a responsibility” to make clear that Putin’s actions are “completely unacceptable”. The United Nations general assembly voted to reject Russia’s call for the 193-member body to hold a secret ballot later this week on whether to condemn Moscow’s move to annex four partially occupied regions in Ukraine. Diplomats said the vote on the resolution would likely be on Wednesday or Thursday. Australian troops could help train Ukraine’s armed forces following Russia’s “appalling” attack on Kyiv, the country’s Defence Minister, Richard Marles, said on Tuesday. Members of the Group of Seven, and Zelenskiy, will hold emergency talks on Tuesday, a German government spokesperson has confirmed. Zelenskiy confirmed he would address G7 leaders, adding that he had spoken to Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, about increasing pressure on Russia as well as aid for Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has made strategic errors in his pursuit of the war in Ukraine partly because there are so few restraints on his leadership, the head of the British spy agency GCHQ will say in a speech on Tuesday. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has been included on a list of wanted persons put together by Ukraine security officials. A statement released by Ukraine’s security service, the SBU, said Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia’s Security, was wanted under a section of the criminal code dealing with attempts to undermine Ukraine’s territorial integrity and the inviolability of its borders. Most of the Russian Security Council’s members are on the list. The International Committee of the Red Cross has confirmed its teams have paused their field work in Ukraine for security reasons. The Norwegian Refugee Council have also said that it has paused its aid operations in Ukraine until it is safe to resume. “Our aid workers are hiding from a barrage of bombs and in fear of repeated attacks,” it said. The president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, will visit Moscow on Tuesday to meet Putin, UAE state media reported. Mohamed “will discuss with President Putin the friendly relations between the UAE and Russia along with a number of regional and international issues and developments of common interest”, the UAE’s state-owned news agency WAM said. The European Union has announced it will extend a bloc-wide protection scheme for Ukrainian refugees into 2024. Ukrainians in the EU who choose to return to their country will still be able to maintain their refugee status, as long as they notify the relevant EU country of their move, according to the EU’s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/mar/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-bakhmut-offensive-slowing-says-us-thinktank-eu-leaders-gather-for-summit","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-23T19:01:03Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zelenskiy renews calls to EU for long-range weapons; Moscow says relations with west ‘worse than ever’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-bakhmut-offensive-slowing-says-us-thinktank-eu-leaders-gather-for-summit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/mar/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-bakhmut-offensive-slowing-says-us-thinktank-eu-leaders-gather-for-summit","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zelenskiy renews calls to EU for long-range weapons; Moscow says relations with west ‘worse than ever’ – as it happened","bodyText":"We’re closing this blog down now. Thanks for reading. Here’s a summary of the day’s main events: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has renewed his call for more long-range weapons from western allies, as he addressed EU leaders meeting in Brussels. Speaking to the EU summit via video link, the Ukrainian president’s account of the “devastating” scenes he had witnessed where the fighting has been fiercest was said to be emotional and to have had a big impact on the 27 EU leaders and top officials in Brussels listening to him. Russian leaders should be put on trial for the invasion of Ukraine even if they cannot be arrested and brought to court in person, Kyiv’s top prosecutor said. Gen Andriy Kostin said a planned tribunal for the crime of aggression should hold so-called trials in absentia. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia’s Putin-chaired security council, said Moscow’s relations with the west have hit an all-time low. Asked whether the threat of a nuclear conflict has eased, he said: “No, it hasn’t decreased, it has grown. Every day when they provide Ukraine with foreign weapons brings the nuclear apocalypse closer.” Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, signed legislation to make his country part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato). Last year, Finland sought to join the military alliance in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine, and legislation incorporating Nato’s founding treaties was passed in parliament in Helsinki on 1 March. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant “remains perilous” after a Russian missile strike this month disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Ukraine’s state emergency service said on Thursday that it had ended rescue attempts in Rzhyshchiv, Kyiv region, where it is now known that nine people died in a suspected Russian drone attack in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that on Wednesday shelling in the Donetsk region killed two people and injured four others, while one person was killed and two were wounded in the Kherson region. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, said: “The aggressor does not give up hope of taking Bakhmut at any cost, despite the losses in manpower and equipment.” He added that Russia was losing “considerable strength” and that “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliia and Kupiansk”, all areas that Ukraine has previously liberated from Russian occupation. The UK Ministry of Defence said that “Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres” in the Luhansk region, and that “Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River. They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node.” Any attempt to arrest Vladimir Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for the Kremlin chief would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, his ally Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday, while directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. A video is circulating on social media of the Ukrainian national flag flying from a tall mast in Crimea, a region annexed by Russia in 2014. It appears to have been filmed near the village of Hrushivka. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said on Thursday he would discuss a peace plan for Ukraine with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during an official visit to China next week. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, on Thursday spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia under a deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and called for the G7 to tighten its oil cap to squeeze Russia’s revenue more. A former New Zealand soldier who drew an online following with his dispatches from the frontline of the Ukraine war has been killed. The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand’s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. Ukraine’s military has now withdrawn its claim Russian troops had left Nova Kahkovka. The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces, in a rare retraction, said Russian troops remained in the town on the east bank of the Dnipro River. It said the initial report had been issued “as a result of incorrect use of available data” but gave no details. Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed governor of Kherson region, had denied the report. The EU has denounced Russian police raids against the Nobel prize-winning human rights group Memorial, describing them as being part of an intimidation and harassment campaign. Reuters, citing Memorial, reports that Russian security forces raided the homes of former employees of the group on Tuesday and took some of them in for questioning. Founded to document political repression in the Soviet Union, Memorial was officially banned in late 2021 after the authorities claimed it supported terrorism and extremism, charges the group called absurd. The spokesperson for the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, Peter Stano, said: The recent actions by the Russian authorities constitute yet another step in the ongoing intimidation and persecution of independent and critical voices in the Russian society. Memorial’s work in Russia has been invaluable in defence of human rights and against “attempts to manipulate the historical memory of political repression in Russia in the 20th century”, he added. The EU calls upon the Russian authorities to stop the unfounded prosecution and police harassment of Memorial and its staff – and to respect the rule of law. Tuesday’s raids were carried out after Russian investigators accused the now dissolved group of allegedly including the names of second world war-era Nazi collaborators on their historical list of victims of political terror. The raids were condemned by rights groups internationally as well as what remains of Russia’s domestic opposition, Reuters reports. We reported earlier that the Ukrainian military was claiming Russian forces had left the town of Nova Kakhovka in the southern Kherson region. Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed governor of Kherson region, has denied that. Reuters quotes him as saying on Telegram: All Russian military personnel in Nova Kakhovka, as well as in other locations on the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro remain in their place. Russian forces redeployed to the east bank of the Dnipro River last November after abandoning positions on the west bank in the face of a counteroffensive by Ukrainian troops. Russian athletes will remain barred from track and field “for the foreseeable future” because of the country’s invasion of Ukraine, the World Athletics president, Sebastian Coe, has said. The International Olympic Committee is exploring a pathway for Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutrals at next year’s Olympic Games in Paris. But it appears likely they will not be able to feature in athletics in Paris, arguably the highest-profile Olympic sport. Lord Coe told a press conference: The World Athletics Council approved to continue to exclude Russian and Belarus athletes from all World Series events for the foreseeable future due to the invasion and ongoing war in Ukraine. Russian forces have left the town of Nova Kakhovka in the southern Kherson region, the Ukrainian military’s general staff has said. Reuters quotes its evening report outlining conditions on the front lines as saying: As of 22 March 2023, all units of the occupying army that had been deployed in the town of Nova Kakhovka in Kherson region, have left the city. The town is located on the east bank of the Dnipro River, where Russian forces redeployed last November after abandoning positions on the west bank in the face of a counter-offensive by Ukrainian troops. The report said Russian troops had stolen appliances, valuables, clothing and mobile telephones from nearby houses as they departed. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, has signed legislation to make his country part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) during a ceremony on Thursday. Last year, Finland sought to join the military alliance in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine, and legislation incorporating Nato’s founding treaties was passed in parliament in Helsinki on 1 March. Hungary and Turkey, the only Nato members that have yet to ratify Finland’s membership, have both signalled they will soon do so. European Union leaders have held talks with the UN chief, António Guterres, on sanctions imposed on Russia and are also expected to endorse a plan to supply more artillery shells to Kyiv. Reuters reports that Guterres’ participation in the EU summit, where global food security was also discussed, comes days after the renewal of a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey on the safe export of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea that is seen as crucial to overcoming a global food crisis. The 27 EU leaders were also due to get an update on the war from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, via video link. Arriving for the two-day summit, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said: We need to ensure that grain exports, for example from Ukraine, can continue. The Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, spoke against any easing of sanctions on Moscow under the grain deal and called for a tighter price cap on Russian oil exports. The US has pushed back against Russian demands that western sanctions be eased before Moscow allows Ukrainian Black Sea grain exports to continue beyond mid-May, saying there are no restrictions on Russian farm products or fertilisers. Inside the EU, the issue of fertiliser exports is blocking more sanctions against Russia’s ally Belarus. The bloc says new sanctions are needed to stop Belarus from serving as a route to bypass the existing Russia trade restrictions. But Lithuania opposes what it calls “fertiliser oligarch” exemptions proposed to ensure Belarusian fertilisers continue flowing to third countries, arguing that that would weaken the sanctions regime overall, diplomats said. Proponents say such carve-outs, similar to those the EU has in place under its sanctions against Russia, are necessary to ensure food security and refute Moscow’s charge that EU measures – rather than Russia’s invasion – are driving the global crisis. Diplomats involved in preparing the summit were sceptical of any imminent breakthrough. Earlier, William met Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, at the presidential palace, where they discussed the war in Ukraine. The former’s spokesperson said: The conversation was warm and friendly, and predominantly focused on the ongoing conflict with the war in Ukraine, particularly its impact on Polish society. The Prince of Wales took the opportunity to thank the president and the Polish people who have done so much to support the people of Ukraine who’ve fled here. They discussed the importance of the need for ongoing support to Ukraine and its people. The prince said he was very much looking forward to seeing the president and first lady at the coronation. He also thanked him for attending the late queen’s funeral. William also echoed his grandmother the queen by laying a wreath at a monument dedicated to soldiers. Queen Elizabeth II and the late Duke of Edinburgh did the same during their state visit to Poland in 1996. William was greeted by a guard of honour and carried the assortment of flowers to the monument, spending around 10 minutes there before leaving. On the wreath was a note reading: “In memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice.” The Prince of Wales has praised the resilience of young Ukrainian refugees living in Poland. William, on the second day of his surprise trip to the country, visited the Hala Koszyki food hall in Warsaw to speak to those who have fled Ukraine. He joined them at tables on Thursday afternoon and heard about their experiences settling into Polish life. William told them: It must be very difficult to start an entire new life in a new country. It’s amazing how resilient you are. That shines out. He also spoke to people who have hosted refugees, and thanked them for their kindness. William was greeted by well-wishers outside the venue and given flowers. Three women held a sign thanking him for the visit. One of them, Olga Mieszejewska-Buchalik, who travelled three hours from south Poland, told reporters: I said that we really appreciated his support for our nation and Ukraine. Vonya Bultruski, 26, who spoke to the prince, told the PA news agency: I told him how much his support for refugees means, he’s a very kind man. I’m very happy to see him in Poland, it is a big moment for my country. Marta Galinska, 47, a milliner, gave William a pink felt hat she made for the Princess of Wales. Jennifer Rankin reports for the Guardian from Brussels: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has renewed his call for more long-range weapons from western allies, as he addressed EU leaders meeting in Brussels. The Ukrainian president was speaking to the EU summit via video link, from a moving train in an undisclosed location in Ukraine, where he recounted news from the frontline. On Wednesday, Zelenskiy visited frontline military positions near the besieged city of Bakhmut, where he met Ukrainian serviceman and held a moment of silence for those killed in the war. Earlier today he was in Kherson region. His account of the “devastating” scenes he had witnessed was said to be emotional and to have had a big impact on the 27 EU leaders and top officials in Brussels listening to him. On one occasion the secure line cut out, but was soon reconnected. According to an EU source, he warned European leaders of five factors that could prolong the war, including delays in the delivery of long-range missiles, lack of modern aircraft and weaknesses in western sanctions. EU leaders are now discussing the Russian invasion, where they are expected to endorse a decision to supply a million rounds of ammunition to Ukraine within the next 12 months to replenish its dwindling stocks. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, has this report from Kherson on its official Telegram channel, citing the state emergency department: Four fires broke out in the Kherson region during the day as a result of shelling by the Russian army. A warehouse was on fire in Kherson, a car and the remains of a cable caught fire in Beryslav. And in Antonivka, a private house and a non-residential building were on fire. The office of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, have issued a couple of photographs of his visit to Kherson region today. It is Zelenskiy’s second trip outside Kyiv this week, having visited the frontline city of Bakhmut yesterday. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, visited the occupied city of Mariupol on Saturday evening in his first trip to one of the areas that Russia has claimed to annex from Ukraine. Medvedev may have dismissed western claims that Russia is running out of weapons with which to continue its war on Ukraine, but Reuters is reporting that the conflict has left Moscow unable to deliver vital defence supplies it had committed to India’s military. New Delhi has been worried about just such a situation, with Moscow its largest source of defence equipment. An Indian air force statement on Thursday is the first official confirmation it has come about. The statement was made to a parliamentary committee, which published it on its website on Tuesday. An air force representative told the committee that Russia had planned a “major delivery” this year that would not take place. A spokesperson for the Russian embassy in New Delhi told Reuters: “We don’t have information which may confirm the stated.” There has been no immediate response from Rosoboronexport, which is the Russian government’s weapons export arm. The report does not mention specifics of the delivery, Reuters says. Medvedev also dismissed any suggestion of talks with western European powers as “useless” and spoke contemptuously about western politicians, claiming a “catastrophic drop in competence and elementary literacy of EU leaders”. I have no illusions that we could communicate with them again any time soon. It makes no sense to negotiate with certain countries and blocs – they only understand the language of force. Medvedev, who heads a panel coordinating weapons production, derided western claims that Moscow is running out of weapons and said Russian weapons industries had increased output. He said Russia would produce 1,500 battle tanks this year and boost production of other weapons to meet its army’s needs. His claims could not be independently verified. The most important thing now is to make it all in necessary volumes, and we are launching new factories to do that. He said that the Russian military already had good intelligence drones and loitering munitions, but acknowledged that it had yet to deploy long-range strike drones. Here’s some more detail on those comments made by Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia’s Putin-chaired Security Council, who we quoted earlier as saying that any attempt to arrest the Russian president would amount to a declaration of war. According to the Associated Press (AP), he has told reporters in Russia that Moscow’s relations with the west have hit an all-time low. Asked whether the threat of a nuclear conflict has eased, he said: No, it hasn’t decreased, it has grown. Every day when they provide Ukraine with foreign weapons brings the nuclear apocalypse closer. Medvedev also denounced the ICC’s decision to issue an arrest warrant for Putin as legally null and void, claiming the move added to a “colossal negative potential” in the already bitterly strained ties. Our relations with the west are already worse than they have ever been in history. Medvedev challenged Ukraine’s sovereignty in comments that could reflect Moscow’s plans to extend its gains. Honestly speaking, Ukraine is part of Russia. But, due to geopolitical reasons and the course of history, we had tolerated that we were living in separate quarters and had been forced to acknowledge those invented borders for a long time. The AP reports that, since Putin sent troops into Ukraine, Medvedev has emerged as one of the most hawkish Russian officials, with observers interpreting his position as an apparent attempt to curry favour with Putin. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has visited the southern region of Kherson, where he toured local infrastructure the he promised to restore after Russia’s invasion. The visit, to a region where Ukraine staged a successful counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces late last year, was his second outside Kyiv this week, Reuters reports. On Wednesday, he visited troops near the eastern frontline city of Bakhmut. On Thursday, under footage of his visit to Kherson region that was posted on Telegram, Zelenskiy wrote: I spoke with local residents about their current issues and needs. We will restore everything, we will rebuild everything. Just like with every city and village that suffered because of the occupiers. The Ukrainian counteroffensive last year pushed Russian troops out of the regional capital after months of occupation. Workers in the region are now busy restoring power and the water supply. In a separate post showing him inspecting energy infrastructure, the Ukrainian president wrote: We have to ensure full restoration and protection of our energy sector. I am grateful to everyone who works for this and returns the light to our people. Russian leaders should be put on trial for the invasion of Ukraine even if they cannot be arrested and brought to court in person, Kyiv’s top prosecutor has said. Gen Andriy Kostin said a planned tribunal for the crime of aggression should hold so-called trials in absentia. He was speaking to Reuters after meeting the international criminal court (ICC)‘s chief prosecutor in The Hague, where the court is based. Last week, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accusing him and his children’s commissioner of the war crime of deporting children from Ukraine to Russia. While the ICC can prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in Ukraine, it cannot prosecute the crime of aggression due to legal constraints. International support is growing for the creation of a special tribunal that would prosecute Russian leaders for the 13-month-old invasion itself, considered by Ukraine and western leaders to be a crime of aggression. Kostin said the special tribunal should go after “the highest political and military leadership, including Putin, for the crime of aggression”. I believe that it could be (held) in absentia, because it’s important to deliver a matter of justice for international crimes even if perpetrators are not in the dock. International courts very rarely hold trials in absentia and the ICC’s rules state specifically that an accused suspect shall be present during trial. The only recent example of an international trial in absentia was in the case of Lebanon, for which a UN-backed tribunal convicted three men for the 2005 assassination of Lebanese politician Rafik Hariri. Russia has publicly said it has brought thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia in what it presents as a humanitarian campaign to protect orphans and abandoned children in the conflict zone. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant “remains perilous” after a Russian missile strike this month disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Ukraine’s state emergency service said on Thursday that it had ended rescue attempts in Rzhyshchiv, Kyiv region, where it is now known that nine people died in a suspected Russian drone attack in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that on Wednesday shelling in the Donetsk region killed two people and injured four others, while one person was killed and two were wounded in the Kherson region. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, said: “The aggressor does not give up hope of taking Bakhmut at any cost, despite the losses in manpower and equipment.” He added that Russia was losing “considerable strength” and that “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliia and Kupiansk”, all areas that Ukraine has previously liberated from Russian occupation. The UK Ministry of Defence said that “Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres” in the Luhansk region, and that “Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River. They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node.” Any attempt to arrest President Vladimir Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for the Kremlin chief would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, his ally Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday, while directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. A video is circulating on social media of the Ukrainian national flag flying from a tall mast in Crimea, a region annexed by Russia in 2014. It appears to have been filmed near the village of Hrushivka. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said on Thursday he would discuss a peace plan for Ukraine with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during an official visit to China next week. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, on Thursday spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia under a deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and called for the G7 to tighten its oil cap to squeeze Russia’s revenue more. A former New Zealand soldier who drew an online following with his dispatches from the frontline of the Ukraine war has been killed. The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand’s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said on Thursday he would discuss a peace plan for Ukraine with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, during an official visit to China next week. “We will also talk about Ukraine where the most important thing is to be able to guarantee a stable and lasting peace,” Reuters reports Sanchez told the media in Brussels. Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, on Thursday spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia under a deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and called for the G7 to tighten its oil cap to further squeeze Russia’s revenue. “We know that Russia is earning less from the oil. We see the economic sanctions, including the oil price cap, are having am effect on the Russian economy and their ability to fuel the war machine,” Reuters reports her saying on arriving to talks among the EU’s 27 national leaders in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. “We should continue with that,” she said, adding that Estonia would agree to raise the cap again should oil prices rise. She spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia as sought by Moscow in the grain deal talks. “We shouldn’t weaken the sanctions,” she said. A video is circulating on social media, reported by Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, of the Ukrainian national flag flying from a tall mast in Crimea, a region annexed by Russia in 2014 in a move which is not widely recognised internationally. It appears to have been filmed near the village of Hrushivka. The Guardian has not independently verified the location, or the date the video was made. The air alarm which has been in force across Ukraine for much of the last two hours has ended. Any attempt to arrest President Vladimir Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for the Kremlin chief would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, his ally Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday, while directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. The ICC issued an arrest warrant on Friday, accusing Putin of the war crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. It said there were reasonable grounds to believe that Putin bore individual criminal responsibility. Reuters reports that the hawkish former president Medvedev told Russian media that the ICC, which countries including Russia, China and the US do not recognise, was a “legal nonentity” that had never done anything significant. Any attempt to detain Putin, though, would be a declaration of war, said Medvedev, who serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s security council. “Let’s imagine – obviously this [is a] situation which will never be realised – but nevertheless let us imagine that it was realised: the current head of the nuclear state went to a territory, say Germany, and was arrested,” Medvedev said. “What would that be? It would be a declaration of war on the Russian Federation,” he said in a video posted on Telegram. “And in that case, all our assets – all our missiles – would fly to the Bundestag, to the Chancellor’s office.” Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, offers this news roundup this morning on its official Telegram channel: As a result of an attack by Russian drones [yesterday] on a hostel in Rzhyshchiv, Kyiv region, nine people were killed, the state emergency service reported. Rescue operations are completed. In the middle of the night, the Russian military shelled Kramatorsk in Donetsk region: residential buildings, a boiler house and garages were damaged. On 22 March, shelling in the region killed two people and injured four others. At night, the Russian army shelled the Kherson regional cardio centre; there were no casualties. Fifty-four times during the day, the Russian Federation fired heavy artillery and “Grad missiles” in the Kherson region; one person was killed, two were wounded. The claims have not been independently verified. Donetsk and Kherson are two of the partly occupied regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, has posted to Telegram to say: “The aggressor does not give up hope of taking Bakhmut at any cost, despite the losses in manpower and equipment.” He goes on to write that the enemy is losing “considerable strength” and that “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, [Balakliia] and Kupiansk”, all areas that Ukraine has previously liberated from Russian occupation. He praised his troops for “superhuman resilience, courage and bravery” under “the continuous fire of the enemy’s artillery and aircraft”. An air alert is being declared across Ukraine.

The UK Ministry of Defence has issued its daily intelligence briefing on the situation in Ukraine. It writes: Since the start of March 2023, heavy fighting has continued in parts of the Svatove-Kremina sector of the frontline in northern Luhansk oblast. Russia has partially regained control over the immediate approaches to Kremina town, which was under immediate Ukrainian threat earlier in the year. In places, Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres. Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River. They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node. A former New Zealand soldier who drew an online following with his dispatches from the frontline of the Ukraine war has been killed in fighting there. The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand’s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. For many in New Zealand, Te Tai was the face of the country’s unofficial involvement in Ukraine’s war. He fundraised for equipment and undertook news interviews before he left New Zealand in May 2022, and documented his friendships, battles and daily life on Instagram and Facebook. A video he posted earlier this month captured a moment when he was unexpectedly reunited with a Ukrainian friend who had been held hostage for months by Russian troops, and whom Te Tai recognised when the man began to call out: “New Zealand! New Zealand!” “My brother!” Te Tai replied. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said Wednesday that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant “remains perilous” following a Russian missile strike this month that disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Since a Russian strike on March 9, the plant has relied on a single backup power line that remains “disconnected and under repair”, according to Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. “Nuclear safety at the ZNPP remains in a precarious state,” Grossi said in a statement on Wednesday. The plant’s lack of access to the grid and necessary repair work on its last emergency power line could cause a complete loss of power, making it reliant on diesel generators for the seventh time since Russia captured it a year ago, Grossi said. “I once again call for a commitment from all sides to secure nuclear safety and security protection at the plant.” The statement continues: The situation at the plant remains perilous. The IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ) team currently present at the plant was informed that restoration of the line had been planned for 5, 10 and then 13 March but had not been possible. The latest reconnection date is scheduled for 23 March. Six weeks after European leaders last gathered in Brussels, they’re meeting again for two days. The war in Ukraine is high on the agenda (though tensions between France and Germany over nuclear energy and combustion engines loom large) and UN secretary general, António Guterres, will be joining the summit for the first day. Among the items on the agenda over the next two days are, according to the council: Accountability of perpetrators Further increasing collective pressure on Russia The use of frozen assets for the reconstruction of Ukraine Support to help meet Ukraine’s military and defence needs Global food security Address high energy prices Reduce gas demand Ensure security of supply Phase out dependency on Russian fossil fuels Wording on the summit points out that the EU has “made available” €67bn (US$73bn) to Ukraine since the start of the war. That’s equivalent to about 27% of Ukraine’s total GDP for 2021, before Russia invaded. A months-long ground assault on the eastern town of Bakhmut could be stalling in the face of fierce resistance, according to US, Ukrainian and British military experts. Russian forces unleashed a wave of air strikes in the north and south of Ukraine as President Vladimir Putin bid farewell on Wednesday to Chinese leader Xi Jinping following a two day visit to Moscow by his fellow autocrat and “dear friend”. Bakhmut is the site of Europe’s deadliest infantry battle since World War Two. The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, said in its most recent update that the pace of Russian operations around Bakhmut “appears to be slowing amid Western reporting that Russian forces may be attempting to launch offensives in other directions.” The update goes on to say: Russian forces are currently increasing the tempo of their offensive operations around Avdiivka aiming to encircle the settlement, and it is possible that Russian forces are doing so at the expense of their operations around Bakhmut and the stalled offensive around Vuhledar. British military intelligence believes Russia’s assault on the town could be running out of steam. There was still a danger, however, that the Ukrainian garrison in Bakhmut could be surrounded, Britain’s defence ministry said in its intelligence update on Wednesday. Ukraine’s military General Staff agreed that Russia’s offensive potential in Bakhmut was declining. Bakhmut has become a key objective for Moscow, which sees the town as a stepping stone toward completing its conquest of the eastern Donbas region. Hello and welcome back to our continuing live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan taking you through the day’s news. Our top story this morning: Russia’s months-long ground assault on the eastern town of Bakhmut could be stalling in the face of fierce resistance, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank. In its latest update, the ISW writes, “The tempo of Russian operations around Bakhmut appears to be slowing amid Western reporting that Russian forces may be attempting to launch offensives in other directions”. And the European Council is meeting today in Brussels, where leaders will discuss the war and Europe’s continuing support for Ukraine. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres will also take part in today’s meeting. We’ll bring you the latest on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said China is watching “very carefully” to see how Washington and the world respond to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at the end of president Xi Jinping’s visit to Moscow, Blinken said that if Russia was allowed to attack Ukraine with impunity, it would “open a Pandora’s box” for would-be aggressors and lead to a “world of conflict”. He added that China has not yet crossed the line of providing lethal aid to Moscow. Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia was a “journey of friendship, cooperation and peace”, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said, as China’s president ended his three-day visit to Moscow. Wang Wenbin reiterated Beijing’s claims that it remained neutral in the Ukraine conflict and said China would “continue to play a constructive role in promoting a political settlement of the Ukrainian issue”. Vladimir Putin has no immediate plans for peace in Ukraine, so the west needs to brace itself to supply lethal aid to Kyiv for a long time to come, Nato’s secretary general has warned in an interview with the Guardian. The fierce fighting, currently centred around Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine, demonstrated Russia was willing “to just throw in thousands and thousands more troops, to take many casualties for minimal gains”, the head of Nato said. At least one person was killed and 33 wounded by a twin Russian missile strike on two residential buildings in Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine’s east, according to officials. Footage from a security camera captured the moment the strike hit, causing an explosion and a large plume of smoke to rise from two nine-storey buildings. Residential areas “where ordinary people and children live are being fired at”, said the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. At least eight people were killed overnight in a drone attack on Rzhyshchiv in the Kyiv region, regional police chief Andrii Nebytov said. The strike is reported to have hit a dormitory building and a school. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that one of the people who died was “an ambulance driver who came to the call”. Russia’s foreign ministry has warned that Moscow will not leave “unanswered” a UK plan to supply Ukraine with tank shells made with depleted uranium. “This decision will not remain without serious consequences both for Russian-British bilateral relations and at the international level,” it said on Wednesday. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Britain’s decision took the situation to new and dangerous levels. The UK foreign secretary has said there is no “nuclear escalation” in the country’s decision to supply Ukraine with shells made with depleted uranium. “They are not nuclear munitions. They are purely conventional munitions,” James Cleverly said, a day after Vladimir Putin accused the west of “beginning to use weapons with a nuclear component”. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said the risk of a nuclear conflict is at its highest level in decades. Russia was committed to keeping the world “safe and free” from the threat of nuclear war, he said, but added later that business could not continue as usual, given that Moscow was now “in a de facto state of open conflict” with Washington. Rebuilding Ukraine’s economy is now expected to cost $411bn, 2.6 times Ukraine’s expected 2022 gross domestic product, a new study by the World Bank, United Nations, European Commission and Ukraine found. Sweden’s parliament has formally approved a bill to allow the country to join Nato. Sweden and its neighbour Finland applied to join Nato in May 2022, abandoning decades of non-alignment after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The process has been held up by Turkey, which along with Hungary has yet to ratify the memberships. Zelenskiy made a surprise visit on Wednesday to Ukrainian troops near the frontline city of Bakhmut. During his visit, the president heard “reports on the operational situation and the course of hostilities on the frontline”, a statement from his office said. Zelenskiy, dressed in a dark sweatshirt and military khaki trousers, was seen handing out medals to soldiers he said were heroically defending their country’s sovereignty. There is a possibility that the Russian assault on the town of Bakhmut is losing the limited momentum it had obtained, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. This could be happening because “some Russian MoD units have been reallocated to other sectors”, it said. The Prince of Wales travelled to Warsaw as part of a surprise two-day trip to Poland to thank British and Polish troops for their efforts supporting Ukraine, as well as to learn more about how the country has cared for displaced Ukrainian refugees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-238-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-19T14:03:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 238 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-238-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/19/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-238-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 238 of the invasion","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has declared martial law in the four provinces of Ukraine where it controls territory after Russian officials warned of a looming Ukrainian assault on the key southern city of Kherson. The law, published on the Kremlin website, gives far-reaching emergency powers to the Russian-installed heads of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson provinces, which Russia recently proclaimed as annexed after sham referendums. Putin also ordered an “economic mobilisation” in eight provinces bordering Ukraine. The measures apply to the southern regions of Krasnodar, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Kursk and Rostov, which are all near Ukraine, and the territories of Crimea and Sevastopol, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. Putin said he was granting additional authority to the leaders of all Russian provinces to maintain public order and increase production in support of Moscow’s war, which is entering its eighth month. The Russian-installed leader of the occupied Ukrainian region of Kherson, said Wednesday that authorities plan a mass removal of 50-60,000 people over the next six days. Vladimir Saldo said authorities were moving civilians to the left bank of the Dnipro in order to “keep people safe” and allow the military to “act resolutely”. Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-installed deputy administrator of the Kherson region, echoed the message on Telegram late on Tuesday: “The battle for Kherson will begin in the very near future. The civilian population is advised, if possible, to leave the area of the upcoming fierce hostilities.” Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, described the Russian announcements as “a propaganda show”. He said “The Russians are trying to scare the people of Kherson with fake newsletters about the shelling of the city by our army, and also arrange a propaganda show with evacuation”. He described it as “a rather primitive tactic, given that the armed forces do not fire at Ukrainian cities – this is done exclusively by Russian terrorists”. The new commander of Moscow’s army in Ukraine described the military situation as “tense”. “The enemy continually attempts to attack the positions of Russian troops,” Sergei Surovikin said in his first televised interview since being appointed earlier this month, adding that the situation was particularly difficult around the occupied southern city of Kherson. Kyiv has recently introduced a news blackout in the south of the country, leading to speculations that it was preparing a new major offensive on Kherson. “When the Ukrainians have a news blackout it means something is going on. They have always done this before when there is a big offensive push on,” Michael Clarke, a former director general of the Royal United Services Institute, told Sky News. Several Russian missiles have been shot down over Kyiv, its mayor Vitalii Klitschko said, after loud explosions were reported in the centre of the Ukrainian capital. “Air defence shot down several Russian missiles over Kyiv. Air raid alarm is still on! Stay in shelters! Air defence continues to work,” he said. Oleksiy Kuleba, the governor of Kyiv region, indicated that “kamikaze” drones had been shot down. The head of Kryvyi Rih’s military administration, Oleksandr Vilkul, said Russia launched rocket fire overnight on an energy facility, causing “serious destruction” Ukrainian forces shot down 13 “kamikaze” drones over Mykolaiv overnight, according to the region’s governor, Vitaliy Kim. An attempt to retake control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) by boats loaded with Ukrainian special forces has been repulsed, according to one of the Russian-installed officials in occupied eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian officials are working to create mobile power points after Russia launched new strikes against the country’s energy infrastructure, President Zelenskiy said. Zelenskiy held a “strategic meeting” with senior officials today to discuss measures to “eliminate the consequences in the event of a breakdown of the energy system of Ukraine”, he said on Telegram. Ukraine has withdrawn its ambassador to Kazakhstan after a row over Petro Vrublevsky;s comments about killing Russians. Russia’s strikes on critical energy infrastructure in Ukraine are “acts of pure terror” that amount to war crimes, the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has said. The Belarus defence ministry said in a statement that it has begun summoning citizens to check their eligibility for military service, but that it is not planning mobilisation. The military registration and enlistment activities are strictly routine and are expected to be completed by the end of this year,” it said. The White House is taking “every step possible” to avoid a direct encounter between President Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Indonesia next month, according to reports. US officials are also reportedly taking measures to avoid even a hallway run-in or photo meeting between the two leaders. Finland’s main political parties have backed building a fence along parts of the country’s border with Russia, with work on a short pilot section expected to start as soon as funds have been allocated, Finnish media have reported. Israel’s defence minister has reiterated that the country will not sell weapons to Ukraine, despite a request from Kyiv for air defence supplies in the face of Russia’s growing use of Iranian-made drones. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Thursday that Russia no longer sees a need to maintain a diplomatic presence in the west, the Daily Beast reports. “There is neither point nor desire to maintain the previous presence in western states. Our people work there in conditions that can hardly be called human,” Lavrov said, according to the Russian news agency Tass. Military advisers from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were on Ukrainian soil at a Russian military base in occupied Crimea, the New York Times reports. The Iranians were reported to have been deployed to help Russian troops deal with problems with the Tehran-supplied fleet of Shahed-136 drones, rebranded as Geran-2 by the attackers. Iran has deepened its commitment to supplying arms for Russia’s assault on Ukraine by agreeing to provide a batch of medium-range missiles, as well as large numbers of cheap but effective drones, according to US and Iranian security officials. Russian airstrikes have destroyed 30% of Ukraine’s power stations since 10 October, causing massive blackouts across the country, said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday. Russian strikes on Tuesday hit a power plant in Kyiv, killing three people, as well as energy infrastructure in Kharkiv in the east and Dnipro in the south. A man sheltering in an apartment building in the southern port city Mykolaiv was also killed and the northern Ukrainian city of Zhytomyr was without water or electricity. Ukraine’s foreign minister said Tuesday he was proposing a formal cut in diplomatic ties with Tehran after a wave of Russian attacks using what Kyiv says are Iranian-made drones. Iran has denied supplying drones and Russia has denied using them. Ukrainian intelligence said 1,750 drones, each costing only £20,000 to manufacture, have been delivered. They can be fired from mobile trucks and, despite their slow speeds, are hard to detect until the last minute. Nato said Ukraine would receive anti-drone defence systems in coming days. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, said on Tuesday that member countries would “step up” and deliver more air defences to help stabilise the situation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/08/severn-estuary-tidal-energy-plan-back-on-agenda-amid-ukraine-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-08T14:31:12Z","webTitle":"Severn estuary tidal energy plan back on agenda amid Ukraine crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/08/severn-estuary-tidal-energy-plan-back-on-agenda-amid-ukraine-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/08/severn-estuary-tidal-energy-plan-back-on-agenda-amid-ukraine-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Severn estuary tidal energy plan back on agenda amid Ukraine crisis","bodyText":"A major infrastructure project harnessing the vast tidal power of the Severn estuary is back on the agenda after the UK government said the Russian invasion of Ukraine had highlighted the need to find more secure sources of energy. An independent commission was launched on Tuesday to explore using the Severn estuary, which has the second largest tidal range in the world, to create energy. Michael Gove, the UK secretary of state for levelling up, backed the commission, which comes 12 years after the government dashed ambitious plans for a 10-mile energy-generating barrage. Gove said: “Russia’s invasion has served to heighten concerns about energy security and costs. Sustainable forms of energy cannot come soon enough. The launch of an independent commission on tidal energy for the Severn is very welcome news.” The commission has been set up by the Western Gateway “powerhouse”, a coalition of politicians, business and public sector leaders and academics covering an area stretching from Swansea to Swindon and straddling the Severn, designed to rival the Northern Powerhouse and Midlands Engine. At its inaugural conference, delegates were told a Severn estuary tidal project could provide up to 7% of the UK’s energy needs. Huw Thomas, the leader of Cardiff council and one of the leaders of the project said: “We’re becoming painfully aware of the need for greater energy security.” Thomas acknowledged that concerns over possible damage to an internationally important marsh and mudflat habitat, harming wildlife had blighted previous schemes. In 2010 the UK government said there was no “strategic case” for investing in a barrage and, instead, paved the way for new nuclear power plants. But Thomas said: “The changing landscape of the climate emergency, energy insecurity, rising costs, and rapid technological improvements, indicate that many of these policy, cost and environmental barriers may no longer be as significant.” Thomas said the powerhouse was not wedded to any particular technology but he said the possibility of a barrage – which is likely to cost more than £25bn and take 10 years or more to come to fruition – or tidal lagoons would be explored. Vaughan Gething, the Welsh government’s economy minister, told the conference it was committed to helping Wales become a leading centre for emerging tidal technology. The leader of Newport city council, Jane Mudd, said: “It feels like the time is right to look at this again.” She said it was exciting that people on both sides of the estuary could work on the project. “The Severn is something that can unite us rather than divide us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/jun/05/russia-ukraine-war-latest-explosions-shake-kyiv-macron-rebuked-for-saying-russia-cant-be-humiliated-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-06T00:25:11Z","webTitle":"Putin warns that Moscow will hit new targets if the west supplies Ukraine with long-range missiles – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jun/05/russia-ukraine-war-latest-explosions-shake-kyiv-macron-rebuked-for-saying-russia-cant-be-humiliated-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/jun/05/russia-ukraine-war-latest-explosions-shake-kyiv-macron-rebuked-for-saying-russia-cant-be-humiliated-live","fields":{"headline":"Putin warns that Moscow will hit new targets if the west supplies Ukraine with long-range missiles – as it happened","bodyText":"That’s all from me, Samantha Lock, for now. Please join me a little a later when we launch our new live blog covering all the latest developments from Ukraine. Here is a comprehensive run-down of where things currently stand as of 3.30am. Russia struck Ukraine’s capital Kyiv with missiles early on Sunday for the first time in more than a month. A railway depot was hit in the eastern suburb of Dniprovsky. Five cruise missiles fired from the Caspian Sea were launched from Tu-95 bombers, one of which was intercepted, Ukraine’s air force said, in an attack that represented a change of approach on the part of Russian forces. A Russian cruise missile “flew critically low” over the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant, in the south of the country, at about 5.30am, apparently heading for Kyiv. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company Energoatom said Russian forces “still do not understand that even the smallest fragment of a missile that can hit a working power unit can cause a nuclear catastrophe and radiation leak” in a statement on Sunday. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that Moscow will hit new targets if the west supplies Ukraine with long-range missiles. “We will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting,” Putin told Rossiya state television, without specifying what those targets were. The comments were made in response to a pledge from the US went through with the delivery of Himars rocket artillery that the White House promised last week. Ukrainian forces have counterattacked and retaken half of the city of Sievierodonetsk in the east of the country, officials said. “It had been a difficult situation, the Russians controlled 70% of the city, but over the past two days they have been pushed back,” Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai told Ukrainian television. “The city is now, more or less, divided in half.” The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, also said Ukrainian forces were “successfully slowing down Russian operations” in Donbas and were making “effective local counterattacks in Sievierodonetsk”. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited his troops on Ukraine’s eastern frontlines in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as well as the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia on Sunday. A Russian general, Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov, was killed in eastern Ukraine, a Russian state media journalist said on Sunday, adding to the string of high-ranking military casualties sustained by Moscow. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s visit to Serbia has been cancelled after countries around Serbia closed their airspace to his aircraft, according to local media reports. A senior foreign ministry source told the Interfax news agency that Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro had closed their airspace to the plane that would have carried Moscow’s top diplomat to Belgrade on Monday. “Our diplomacy has yet to master teleportation,” the source said. Britain is to supply long-range rocket artillery to Ukraine, including a handful of tracked M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which can hit targets up to 80km (50 miles) away. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said the decision to ship the rocket launchers was justified because “as Russia’s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine”. Spain is also to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard battle tanks in a step up of its military support to the country, according to government sources cited by newspaper El Pais. Spain will provide essential training to the Ukrainian military in how to use the tanks, according to the reports. Nato kicked off nearly a two-week US-led naval exercise on the Baltic Sea on Sunday with more than 7,000 sailors, airmen and marines from 16 nations, including Finland and Sweden whom aspire to join the military alliance. “It is important for us, the United States, and the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,” US Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said. A Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, Moldova’s border police said on Sunday. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption. Russia’s sanctions against Gazprom Germania and its subsidiaries could cost German taxpayers and gas users an extra €5bn ($5.4bn) a year to pay for replacement gas, the Welt am Sonntag weekly reported, citing industry representatives. Spain is to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard battle tanks in a step up of its military support to the country, according to government sources cited by newspaper El Pais. Spain will also provide essential training to the Ukrainian military in how to use the tanks, according to the reports as cited by Reuters. Training would take place in Latvia, where the Spanish army has deployed 500 soldiers within the framework of Nato’s Enhanced Advanced Presence operation. A second phase of training could take place in Spain, according to the sources cited by El Pais. The paper said Spain’s defence ministry is finalising a delivery to Kyiv of low-level Shorad Aspide anti-aircraft missiles, which the Spanish army has replaced with a more advanced system. Spain has so far supplied ammunition, individual protection equipment and light weapons. Russia’s sanctions against Gazprom Germania and its subsidiaries could cost German taxpayers and gas users an extra €5bn ($5.4bn) a year to pay for replacement gas, the Welt am Sonntag weekly reported, citing industry representatives. In May, Russia decided to stop supplying Gazprom Germania, which had been the German subsidiary of Gazprom, after Berlin put the company under trustee management due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since then, the Bundesnetzagentur energy regulator, acting as trustee, has had to buy replacement gas on the market to fulfil supply contracts with German municipal utilities and regional suppliers. Welt am Sonntag reported that Economy Minister Robert Habeck estimates an extra 10m cubic meters per day are required, which would currently cost about €3.5bn a year. Further costs arise from the filling of the Rehden natural gas storage facility which Habeck ordered on Wednesday, it said. The paper also said the additional costs would be passed on to energy suppliers and end customers in the form of a gas levy from October. Nato kicked off nearly a two-week US-led naval exercise on the Baltic Sea on Sunday with more than 7,000 sailors, airmen and marines from 16 nations, including two aspiring to join the military alliance, Finland and Sweden. The annual BALTOPS naval exercise, initiated in 1972, is not held in response to any specific threat. But the military alliance said that “with both Sweden and Finland participating, Nato is seizing the chance in an unpredictable world to enhance its joint force resilience and strength” together with two Nordic aspirant nations, according to a report from the Associated Press. Finland and Sweden decided to apply to join Nato in May as a direct result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, despite repeated warnings from Moscow against joining the western military alliance. Ahead of the naval drill, which involved 45 vessels and 75 aircraft, the top US military official said in Sweden the host of the BALTOPS 22 exercise that it was particularly important for Nato to show support to the governments in Helsinki and Stockholm. It is important for us, the United States, and the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,” US Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Saturday during a news conference aboard the large amphibious warship USS Kearsarge, which was moored in central Stockholm. Milley said from Moscow’s perspective, Finland and Sweden joining Nato will be “very problematic” and leave Russia in a difficult military position as the Baltic Sea’s coastline would be almost completely encircled by Nato members, except for Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad and the Russian city of St. Petersburg and its surrounding areas. The United States has never before moved such a large warship as the 843-foot USS Kearsarge in the Swedish capital, where it sailed through narrow passages in the Stockholm archipelago, Milley said. As Nato’s close partners, Finland and Sweden have participated in the naval drill since the mid-1990s. Vice Adm. Gene Black, commander Naval Striking and Support Forces Nato and US Sixth Fleet, added: In past iterations of BALTOPS we’ve talked about meeting the challenges of tomorrow. Those challenges are upon us - in the here and now.” BALTOPS 22 is scheduled to end in the German port of Kiel on June 17. Participating nations include Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These countries will exercise a myriad of capabilities demonstrating the inherent flexibility of maritime forces. Exercise scenarios include amphibious operations, gunnery, anti-submarine, air defence, mine clearance operations, explosive ordnance disposal, unmanned underwater vehicles, and medical response, according to an official statement. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s visit to Serbia has been cancelled after countries around Serbia closed their airspace to his aircraft, according to reports. A senior foreign ministry source told the Interfax news agency that Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro had closed their airspace to the plane that would have carried Moscow’s top diplomat to Belgrade on Monday “Our diplomacy has yet to master teleportation,” the source said. Serbia, which has close cultural ties with Russia, has fended off pressure to take sides over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has not joined western sanctions against Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic agreed last month that Russia would continue supplying natural gas to Serbia, while other countries have been cut off for refusing to pay for Russian gas in roubles. Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić will address the nation on Monday night regarding the cancellation of Lavrov’s visit to Belgrade, according to local media reports. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited his troops on Ukraine’s eastern frontlines on Sunday to understand the position of Ukrainian defenders as Russia’s assault on Donbas continues. According to a release from his office, Zelenskiy visited command posts and frontline positions of Ukrainian troops in the area of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region and Lysychansk in the Luhansk region. “The president heard information on the operational situation in these parts of the front, as well as a report on the logistics of Ukrainian defenders,” the statement read. Earlier in the day, Zelenskiy visited frontline troops in the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia. Oleksandr Starukh, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region told Zelenskiy that some 60% of the region’s territory is under Russian occupation, with more than 2,700 infrastructure objects either damaged or destroyed. Humanitarian hubs have been set up in the Zaporizhzhia region to shelter residents of the temporarily occupied territories and settlements where hostilities continue. “Over the last 15 days the largest number of people have come from the Kherson region. They also come from Mariupol,” Starukh said. Zelenskiy’s office later said the president also visited a medical facility in the region and spoke with people forced to leave their homes, including from Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands after being under siege for weeks. He promised action to ensure that all displaced people would be properly rehoused. “We will truly help you tackle this issue,” the president’s office quoted him as saying. It’s 2am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: A Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, Moldova’s border police said on Sunday. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption. Russia has announced that it destroyed tanks supplied by eastern European countries in airstrikes on Kyiv. On Sunday, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said that Kyiv had been targeted by “several explosions in Darnytsky and Dniprovsky districts of city”, the first such strikes on the capital since 28 April. Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited frontline troops in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia, his office said on Sunday, a week after a similar trip to the north-eastern Kharkiv region. “I want to thank you for your great work, for your service, for protecting all of us, our state,” he said. Vladimir Putin said today that Moscow would strike at new targets if the west supplied Ukraine with long-range missiles, hours after several explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The Russian leader said long-range missile supplies being sent to Ukraine meant that “we will draw the appropriate conclusions and use our arms ... to strike targets we haven’t hit before”. A Russian general, Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov, was killed in eastern Ukraine, a Russian state media journalist said on Sunday, adding to the string of high-ranking military casualties sustained by Moscow. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister has reaffirmed the country’s need for continous military assistance from western countries in order to overcome Moscow’s military campaign. “We have already entered into a protracted war and we will need constant support,” Ganna Malyar told local media on Sunday. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, today as I hand the blog over to my colleague, Samantha Lock, in Australia. Thank you. A Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, Moldova’s border police said on Sunday. Reuters reports: Yakovenko was placed in a pretrial detention centre, a press service representative of the border police said. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption. A search of public records for wanted persons on the Interpol website for Yakovenko’s name did not produce any results on Sunday night. Ukraine and Belarus officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Yakovenko was elected to the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, from the Donetsk region, according to information on the parliament’s website. Fears have grown recently that Moldova could be drawn in to the conflict in neighbouring Ukraine, after pro-Russian separatists in a breakaway region reported a number of attacks and explosions there, which they blamed on Kyiv. Moldova, a country of around 2.6 million people wedged between Ukraine and Romania, has taken a decisive pro-Western political turn since President Maia Sandu took office at the end of 2020, defeating a Moscow-aligned incumbent. The country has an ethnic Romanian majority but a large and influential Russian-speaking minority, and close economic ties to Moscow. Russia has announced that it destroyed tanks supplied by eastern European countries in airstrikes on Kyiv. “High-precision, long-range missiles fired by the Russian Aerospace Forces on the outskirts of Kyiv destroyed T-72 tanks supplied by eastern European countries and other armoured vehicles that were in hangars,” Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. On Sunday, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said that Kyiv had been targeted by “several explosions in Darnytsky and Dniprovsky districts of city”, the first such strikes on the capital since April 28. Several cruise missiles were fired towards Kyiv by Russian TU-95 planes from the Caspian Sea, one of which was destroyed, said the Ukrainian air force. Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited frontline troops in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia, his office said on Sunday, a week after a similar trip to the north-eastern Kharkiv region. Reuters reports: “I want to thank you for your great work, for your service, for protecting all of us, our state,” the statement quoted the Ukrainian president as saying, adding that he held a minute of silence for fallen troops. Zelenskiy’s office later said the president also visited a medical facility in the region and spoke with people forced to leave their homes, including from Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands after being under siege for weeks. He promised action to ensure that all displaced people would be properly rehoused. “We will truly help you tackle this issue,” the president’s office quoted him as saying. Vladimir Putin said today that Moscow would strike at new targets if the west supplied Ukraine with long-range missiles, hours after several explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The Russian leader said long-range missile supplies being sent to Ukraine meant that “we will draw the appropriate conclusions and use our arms ... to strike targets we haven’t hit before”. He did not specify which targets he meant. Images have emerged from the Russian missile attack this morning that struck a facility working on railway cars used for grain transport. A Russian general was killed in eastern Ukraine, a Russian state media journalist said on Sunday, adding to the string of high-ranking military casualties sustained by Moscow. Reuters reports: The report, published on the Telegram messaging app by state television reporter Alexander Sladkov, did not say precisely when and where Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov was killed. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister has reaffirmed the country’s need for continous military assistance from western countries in order to overcome Moscow’s military campaign. “We have already entered into a protracted war and we will need constant support,” Ganna Malyar told local media on Sunday. “The west must understand that its help cannot be a one-time thing, but something that continues until our victory,” she said. Earlier this week, the US announced that long-range weapons were being sent to Ukraine as part of a $700m (£560m) package that includes air-surveillance radar, additional Javelin short-range anti-tank rockets, artillery ammunition and helicopters. Russia has said the new military deliveries put Washington at risk of being directly involved in the conflict with Moscow. An adviser to the mayor of Mariupol has said that the shortage of drinking water has reached a critical level. Petro Andrushenko said people had to register to get drinking water and could only get it every two days. Basic infrastructure and services like water, gas and electricity are yet to be restored to the city after the prolonged siege from Russian forces as they tried to take it over. According to CNN, Andrushenko said: “The amount of water was small before, but now it has decreased altogether. It is necessary to register in the queue ... In the future, the temperature will rise, the water level will fall, and the water will be less.” He said that water being provided is “very conditional drinking water”, which needs boiling. He added that he feared illnesses could break out in the south-eastern city because of the amount of rubbish and dead bodies buried in shallow graves. “We expect cholera [or] any viral epidemic related to the gastrointestinal tract. As a result of unsanitary conditions, this can happen. The worst thing is that such a basic thing as dysentery in the current conditions and with the dysfunctional medical system, lack of drugs, lack of laboratories and everything we are used to, lack of vaccines in Mariupol ... Even dysentery can kill tens of thousands.” Away from the conflict, but linked to the invasion, Ukraine are due to kick off against Wales shortly for the right to play at this year’s men’s football World Cup in Qatar. Their recent playoff game against Scotland, which was won by Ukraine was originally due to take place in March, but was delayed by the war. My colleague Will Unwin will be bringing you live updates with kick-off a few minutes away. Earlier today, in his weekly address from St Peter’s Square at the Vatican, Pope Francis called for “real negotiations” to end the “increasingly dangerous” war. “I renew my appeal to the leaders of nations: please do not lead humanity to destruction,” the 85-year-old said. US congress member Victoria Spartz has been on a two-day visit to Chernihiv, northern Ukraine, being pictured with the governor of the region, Viacheslav Chaus. President Vladimir Putin said Russia would strike new targets if the US started supplying Ukraine with longer-range missiles, the Russian state Tass news agency reported on Sunday. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear power operator Energoatom said a Russian cruise missile flew “critically low” on Sunday morning over an important nuclear power plant. As of this morning, 262 children have been killed and 467 injured, according to the latest figures from Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament. Control of Sievierodonetsk is split in half between Ukrainian and Russian forces, Serhiy Gaidai, governor or the Luhansk region where the eastern city is located, said on Sunday. Ukraine’s air force and the Kyiv mayor have said Russian Tu-95 strategic bombers launched missiles at Kyiv from the Caspian Sea early on Sunday and two of the Ukrainian capital’s eastern districts were rocked by explosions in an attack that targeted railway infrastructure in Kyiv. Russian strikes destroyed tanks and other armoured vehicles on the outskirts of Kyiv that had been provided to Ukraine by European countries, Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine’s gas transit system operator has said the volume of Russian gas nominations at Sudzha transit point has totalled 40.08 mcm for 6 June. Britain’s Ministry of Defence says Ukraine has counterattacked in the contested city of Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, “blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained through concentrating combat units and firepower”. France is in talks with the United Arab Emirates to replace Russian oil purchases, which will stop after the imposition of a European Union ban on Russian crude after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, said Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister. Ukrainian police on Sunday shared video showing the aftermath of Russian shelling in the city of Lysychansk, in the Luhansk region. The video shows damaged administrative buildings, residential buildings and roads. Police said the headquarters for distributing humanitarian aid had been burned to the ground. They said more than 40 people had been living permanently in the building but no information on casualties was provided. Luke Harding and Isobel Koshiw in Bakhmut have the following dispatch from Ukraine: In eastern Ukraine there was intense fighting on Sunday all across the Donbas frontline. Ukrainian forces deployed their existing Smersh multiple launcher rocket system near the city of Bakhmut. Sepia streaks were visible in the sky as rockers were fired at Russian army positions. Another - or possibly the same - Smersh system was seen on Sunday morning on the road between Slavyansk and Bakhmut. Ukrainian army sources admitted their Smersh MLRS were older than the modernised version used by Russia, and had a range of just 40kms. There was no evidence this weekend that the advanced MLRS promised by the Biden administration had reached the eastern theatre. Armoured personnel carriers, ammunition trucks and ambulances could be seen on the roads, as well as battered civilian vehicles painted in military green. There was also a spectacular 220mm 2S7 heavy artillery piece, nicknamed Godzilla. It was mounted on a long lorry.Doctors in Bakhmut’s military hospital said the battle for the Donbas had become a grinding artillery war, seven weeks after Vladimir Putin abandoned his attempt to seize Kyiv. Most of the soldiers brought in for treatment were suffering from shrapnel wounds, they said, with relatively few bullet injuries. Outgoing artillery could be heard near continuously, as well as the odd burst of unexplained gunfire. Most of the city’s 100,000 residents have fled. The city is 10km from the frontline. Denis Babenko, a pastor turned soldier, now evacuating civilians, said morale on the Ukrainian side was high. “We have soul but we don’t have the arms. They have the arms but no spirit or motivation. To win this war we need more heavy weapons.” Ukraine’s gas transit system operator has said the volume of Russian gas nominations at Sudzha transit point has totalled 40.08 mcm for 6 June. More soon... Columns of smoke rise over Kyiv after airstrikes early on Sunday. Missiles hit eastern areas of the Ukrainian capital and injured at least one person, according to the city’s mayor, Vitaly Klitschko. Russia’s defence ministry said the strikes had targeted tanks and other armoured vehicles on the outskirts of the city. Ed Vulliamy has written a column about why he is supporting Ukraine in this year’s Fifa World Cup, despite his Welsh heritage. On Sunday evening, every football fan in the world – apart from the Welsh – will be joined by many others who do not even care for the game in rooting for the national team of battered and besieged but resilient Ukraine as they face Wales for a place in the World Cup in Qatar later this year. Watching here in St Davids, Pembrokeshire, even I, with a substantial quotient of Welsh DNA, will be wearing my official Ukraine yellow football shirt with “Malinovskyi 8” on the back. You can read the article here: Dan Sabbagh reports from Kyiv that Russia launched airstrikes into Kyiv for the first time in five weeks on Sunday, claiming it had destroyed western-supplied tanks – while the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, warned more targets would be struck if weapons deliveries continued. Perhaps signalling the new approach, Putin told Rossiya state television that Russia would hit fresh targets in Ukraine if the US delivered the longer-range rockets that it had promised to Kyiv last week. If such missiles were supplied, “we will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting”, said Putin, who is believed to be closely involved in military decision-making. The Russian leader did not specify what would be struck, although logistics points would be amongst the most logical targets. Russia has been irritated by the US decision to supply Ukraine with Himars truck mounted multiple-launch rocket systems, with missiles that have a range of about 20 to 40 miles, greater than anything in Kyiv’s armoury. You can read more of the reporting below: Russia’s strike on Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, has been the first attack in over a month on the city. Ukrainian officials have said that a counterattack in the east had retaken half of the city of Sievierodonetsk. Reuters reports: Dark smoke could be seen from many miles away after the attack on two outlying districts of Kyiv. Moscow said it had hit a repair shop housing tanks sent from eastern Europe. Ukraine said Russia had carried out the strike using long-range air-launched missiles fired from heavy bombers as far away as the Caspian Sea – a weapon far more valuable than the tanks Russia claimed to have hit. At least one person was hospitalised but there were no immediate reports of deaths from the strike - a sudden reminder of war in a capital where normal life has largely returned since Russian forces were driven from its outskirts in March. “The Kremlin resorts to new insidious attacks. Today*s missile strikes at Kyiv have only one goal - kill as many as possible,” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhailo Podolyak wrote in a tweet. Ukraine’s nuclear power operator said a Russian cruise missile had flown “critically low” over the country’s second largest nuclear power plant. The attack was the first big strike on Kyiv since late April, when a missile killed a journalist. Recent weeks have seen Russia focus its destructive might mainly on frontlines in the east and south, although Moscow occasionally strikes elsewhere in what it calls a campaign to degrade Ukraine’s military infrastructure and block Western arms shipments. Matthew Cantor has spoken to Lee Zion, a journalist in Minnesota who plans to fly to Europe to help Ukrainians “in any way he can”. Lee Zion is preparing to head to Ukraine this summer. “I have gotten all my shots. I have started putting personal possessions into storage, giving other things away. I’ve adopted out two cats,” he said. “And minor things – I’m trying to learn the language. I can at least communicate some basic needs. Like ‘me want cookie,’” he said. For four years, Zion has worked seven days a week at a small-town Minnesota newspaper. But now, disgusted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he plans to fly to Europe and help the Ukrainians in any way he can. You can read more here: Maya Yang and Leonie Chao-Fong have a summary on what we know on day 102 of the invasion which you can read here: Simon Tisdall has said Nato has ensured that the Ukraine conflict will continue by not standing up to Russia. Nato’s reluctance to seize the initiative, rather than passively reacting to Russian actions, is unfathomable, too. Proposals for a no-fly zone and safe havens in western Ukraine are repeatedly rejected as too risky. So dare to try something else! Nato has the muscle and means. It could do much more to stop the systematic killing of civilians and push Russia back, as previously argued here. Left to fight alone, Zelenskiy pleads for heavy weapons but his pleas still often go unmet or responses are delayed. “We need to get serious about supplying [Ukraine’s] army so that it can do what the world is asking it to do: fight a world superpower alone on the battlefield,” says US Gen Philip Breedlove, formerly Nato commander in Europe. He’s right. You can read more here: Russian strikes destroyed tanks and other armoured vehicles on the outskirts of Kyiv that had been provided to Ukraine by European countries, Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday. The ministry’s statement came after the Ukrainian capital experienced by several explosions early on Sunday. Ukraine’s air force and the Kyiv mayor have said Russian Tu-95 strategic bombers launched missiles at Kyiv from the Caspian Sea early on Sunday and two of the Ukrainian capital’s eastern districts were rocked by explosions in an attack that targeted railway infrastructure in Kyiv. The mayor, Vitaly Klitschko said at least one person was taken to hospital; no deaths were immediately reported. Reuters reports: Dark smoke rose into the sky above the Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts where the explosions rang out. The missiles were the first to hit the capital since late April when a Radio Liberty producer was killed when a Russian missile hit the building she lived in. According to preliminary data, Russia launched missiles from Tu-95 aircraft from the Caspian Sea,” the Ukrainian air forces said in a statement. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called on the west to impose more sanctions on Russia to punish it for the strikes and to supply more weapons to Ukraine. The Kremlin resorts to new insidious attacks. Today*s missile strikes at Kyiv have only one goal: kill as many as possible,” he wrote. The mayor of the historic town of Brovary some 12 miles (12km) from Kyiv’s centre, urged people to remain inside their houses as there had been reports of the smell of soot coming from the smoke. President Vladimir Putin said Russia would strike new targets if the United States started supplying Ukraine with longer-range missiles, the TASS news agency reported on Sunday. The TASS news agency reports: Putin said that if such missiles are supplied, that Russia will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting”, in an Rossiya-1 state television channel Putin did not name the targets Russia planned to pursue if western countries began supplying Ukraine with longer-range missiles. He said the “fuss” around western weapon supplies to Ukraine was designed to drag out the conflict. Ukraine has been seeking Multiple Rocket Launch Systems (MLRS) such as the M270 and M142 HIMARS to strike troops and weapons stockpiles at the Russian forces’ rear. France is in talks with the United Arab Emirates to replace Russian oil purchases, which will stop after the imposition of a European Union ban on Russian crude following Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday. “There are discussions with the United Arab Emirates. We have to find an alternative to Russian oil,” Le Maire told Europe 1 radio. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear power operator Energoatom said a Russian cruise missile flew “critically low” on Sunday morning over a major nuclear power plant. Reuters, although they could not immediately verify the claim, reports: “It’s probable that was the missile that was fired in the direction of Kyiv,” the operator of the Pivdennoukrainska plant, also called the South Ukraine Nuclear Plant, said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Early on Sunday, several explosions rocked Kyiv. Pivdennoukrainska is Ukraine’s second largest nuclear plant located near in the Mykolaiv region, about 350 km (220 miles) south of Kyiv. As of this morning, 262 children have been killed and 467 injured, according to the latest figures from Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament. Those figures are not final, the parliament said on Telegram: Work is underway to establish them in places of active hostilities, in the temporarily occupied and liberated territories. The true number is likely significantly higher. In parts of Ukraine that are occupied or under active attack by Russia, local authorities have said it is impossible to clear bodies from the street, or count the numbers of citizens killed or injured. The parliament said 1938 schools or educational facilities had been damaged by bombing, and 182 were completely destroyed. Control of Sievierodonetsk is split in half between Ukrainian and Russian forces, Serhiy Gaidai, governor or the Luhansk region where the eastern city is located, said on Sunday. Reuters reports that Gaidai said on Ukrainian television: It had been a difficult situation, the Russians controlled 70% of the city, but over the past two days they have been pushed back.” “The city is now, more or less, divided in half.” Reuters could not immediately verify Gaidai’s claims. If you’d like a fuller report on fight for territory in Sievierodonetsk, here’s a report from our Ukraine-based correspondents: For a little more context on these strikes in Kyiv, they come after a period of relative calm in the city, after Moscow turned its military focus to the east and south. Politico’s Ukraine-based correspondent Christopher Miller said “It was eerily silent this morn, save for the birds. Then came the explosions in the distance.” He called it “the first attack on Kyiv in weeks”. An update on the explosions that shook Kyiv in the early hours of this morning - Mayor Vitali Klitschko has said that so far there have been no deaths reported. The mayor said on Telegram on Sunday morning: Friends! Regarding the morning explosions in Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts of the capital. There are currently no casualties from missile strikes on infrastructure. One victim was hospitalized. Services are still working in the affected areas This morning, Kyiv Regional Military Administration said that as well as the missiles that hit, one “enemy missile was shot down over Obukhiv district by air defense forces”. It asked residents to remain in shelters during air raids. Britain’s Ministry of Defence says Ukraine has counterattacked in the contested city of Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, “blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained through concentrating combat units and firepower”. The intelligence report backs up claims by Ukrainian officials on Saturday that their forces had recaptured parts of the city. The MoD said on Sunday morning: Over the last 24 hours, Ukrainian forces have counterattacked in the contested city of Sieverodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, likely blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained through concentrating combat units and firepower. Several explosions shook the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Sunday, mayor Vitali Klitschko said. “Several explosions in Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts of the capital,” Klitschko wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “Services are already working on site. More detailed information - later.” A Reuters witness saw smoke in the city after the explosions. Air raid sirens had gone off earlier across much of Ukraine, including in the Kyiv region Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. If you’re just waking up, or just dropping in to find the latest information, here’s a summary of the main points of the past few hours. Powerful explosions were heard early on Sunday in Kyiv, a Reuters witness said. Smoke was seen in the Ukrainian capital following the explosions. Earlier, air raid sirens were going off across much of Ukraine, including in the Kyiv region. Ukrainian forces have been managing to push back against Russian troops in fierce fighting in Sievierodonetsk despite Moscow “throwing all its power” into capturing the key eastern city, Ukrainian officials said on Saturday. In an interview aired online, the Luhansk regional governor, Sergiy Gaiday, said the Russian army has taken control over most of Sievierodonetsk, but that Ukrainian forces were still pushing them back. But the Russian army claimed some Ukrainian military units have been withdrawing from Sievierodonetsk. “Some units of the Ukrainian army, having suffered critical losses during fighting for Sievierodonetsk, are pulling out towards Lysychansk”, Sievierodonetsk’s twin city, which sits just across a river, the defence ministry said in a statement. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said Moscow’s anti-aircraft forces have shot down dozens of Ukrainian weapons and are “cracking them like nuts”, in an interview that aired on Saturday. According to Reuters, Russian news agency RIA, which first cited the comments, quoted Putin as responding to a question about US-supplied arms by saying Russia was coping easily and had already destroyed the weapons by the dozen. Kyiv has rebuked the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for saying it was important not to “humiliate Russia”. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted in response: “Calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it. Because it is Russia that humiliates itself. We all better focus on how to put Russia in its place. This will bring peace and save lives.” Western sanctions would not have an effect on Russia’s oil exports, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Lavrov also predicted a significant increase in profits from energy shipments this year, Russian news agency Tass reported. A EU decision to extend sanctions against Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko to his wife is “irrational” because she has never held Russian citizenship or resided in Russia, a representative for the couple said. The EU sanctioned Melnichenko’s wife on Friday as part of a sixth round of sanctions against Russia for waging a war against Ukraine. Negotiations with Russia will only resume after new weapons arrive from the west and Ukraine’s position is “strengthened”, said David Arakhamia, a member of Ukraine’s negotiation group with Russia. Another negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said there was no point in talks with Russia until Moscow’s forces are pushed back as far as possible towards Ukraine’s borders. Ukraine’s intelligence services are in communication with hundreds of captured Azovstal steelworks fighters and Kyiv is doing all it can to ensure their release, according to Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrskiy. Ukraine wants the fighters to be returned in a prisoner swap. However, some Russian officials have said forces could be tried or executed. The US expressed support for international investigations into war crimes committed in Ukraine, the US embassy in Kyiv announced. “Those responsible for war crimes – including direct perpetrators and those who ordered them – must face justice,” the embassy tweeted on Saturday. A famous monastery in eastern Ukraine, Svyatohirsk Lavra, caught fire after it was hit by Russian shelling. The monastery is affiliated with the Moscow Patriarchate, which is run by Putin’s ally Patriarch Kirill. There were reports that four monks were killed as a result of the attack . The Ukrainian first lady, Olena Zelenska, and other officials commemorated 261 children killed by the Russian war against Ukraine by hanging bells near St Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv. The bells symbolise the voices of killed children, Euromaidan Press reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/15/boris-johnson-david-king-uk-energy-bills-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-15T10:19:26Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson told to tackle rising energy bills to avoid ‘extreme suffering’ this winter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/15/boris-johnson-david-king-uk-energy-bills-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/15/boris-johnson-david-king-uk-energy-bills-winter","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson told to tackle rising energy bills to avoid ‘extreme suffering’ this winter","bodyText":"Boris Johnson should intervene urgently to start insulating British homes and introduce fiscal policies to reduce bills, as further delay will mean more people face “extreme suffering” this winter as energy bills soar, a former government chief scientific adviser has warned. David King said: “This could be the worst possible time for the leadership of this country to be simply sitting back. We’re waiting until what? We have an energy crisis right now and we need good leadership. We need alert leadership, leadership that is thinking about this – and that is missing.” Johnson, who has vowed to take no major decisions in his remaining time in office, attended a meeting of energy companies last week that had no conclusive outcome, and is now on his second holiday since resigning last month. King told the Guardian: “He is the prime minster. He wanted to stay on, so he must deliver as prime minister. There is no one else who can do that.” He called for higher taxes on energy companies, which he said were riding soaring energy prices since the Ukraine invasion for a bonanza, rather than investing or becoming more efficient. “They are taking bigger and bigger profits, as the prices are so high. That can only mean that they are tying their profits to the price, not the volume they are delivering,” he said. King – a former government chief scientist and UK climate envoy from 2000 to 2007, and as the government’s special representative on climate from 2013 to 2017 he was an adviser to prime ministers and foreign secretaries including Johnson – said valuable time had been wasted while the government failed to act. Waiting several more weeks for a new Conservative leader to take the reins of government would only add to the problem, he said. “There will be extreme suffering, at the lower-paid end of our society,” King warned. “We need fiscal policies that help people in the lower-paid bracket, that manage the costs of energy.” He said home insulation must also be a priority. “Insulating homes is a massive benefit to individuals and the country at large. Home insulation programmes have always been on the back burner for government for such a long time, though the benefits are enormous.” Even starting now would help people across the country with bills, he said, adding: “It’s never too late – if you start now, we could see good progress before winter.” Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, will announce new proposals on Monday for how to deal with the UK’s home insulation problem, while calling for the energy bill cap to be retained at its current £1.971, according to a report in the Observer on Sunday. King was scathing of the Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss’s emphasis on tax cuts to tackle with the cost of living crisis, though she has also hinted further support could not be ruled out. Rishi Sunak, the other leadership hopeful, proposed to cut VAT on energy bills and offer support to bill payers. “The big beneficiaries of low tax are people who can already afford higher energy prices,” he said. King also criticised the government for turning to increased production of oil and gas in the North Sea to lower energy bills, a move he said would do nothing to alleviate high gas prices and would lock in high greenhouse gas emissions for decades. “It’s completely the wrong timescale – it will take 10 or 20 years for new oil and gas projects [started now] to come online,” he warned. The Climate Crisis Advisory Group, an international coalition of scientists chaired by King, will publish a report this week arguing that governments do not need to return to fossil fuels in response to rising gas prices and energy shortages. International cooperation, expanding investment in renewable energy as well as pursuing energy efficiency through home insulation and in industries would be enough to limit the energy crisis, the report says. Interest rate rises should also be avoided as that would risk a damaging recession. “The remaining global carbon budget of around 400 gigatonnes of CO2 simply does not allow new fossil fuel expansion,” the report says. “A fossil-fuel rush is simply an unsustainable position and is a big mistake.” Critics sometimes argue that renewable energy is variable and intermittent – but King says overhauling energy grids and diversifying clean sources of power would solve this problem. “Offshore wind is very reliable, as the wind blows a very large percentage of the time from the North Sea,” he added. Hydropower in some areas could be used to store energy in dams for release when wind was low. Nuclear energy also has a part to play, in the UK and around the world, according to King. He said Germany should return to nuclear power, instead of reviving its coal-fired power stations. “I worry about the fact that the fossil fuel lobby has been amazingly powerful,” in the UK and other countries, King said. Ministers had delayed again a decision on a potential new coalmine in Cumbria, which King warned could be approved by the next prime minister on the “excuse” of energy security. In the US, important climate legislation was passed last week that will provide hundreds of billions of dollars in funding to key technologies, but owing to pressure from the fossil fuel lobby it still contains sops to gas and oil production. “The power of the fossil-fuel lobby has been such that the US has never been able to play a leading role in negotiations on the climate,” King said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/apr/20/first-thing-ukraine-repelling-intense-russian-offensive-in-east","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-20T09:38:51Z","webTitle":"Ukraine repelling intense Russian offensive in east | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/20/first-thing-ukraine-repelling-intense-russian-offensive-in-east","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/apr/20/first-thing-ukraine-repelling-intense-russian-offensive-in-east","fields":{"headline":"First Thing: Ukraine repelling intense Russian offensive in east","bodyText":"Good morning. Russia has increased the intensity of its eastern offensive but has been repeatedly repelled by Ukrainian forces, the UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said, as western governments pledged to send more artillery, and a new deadline for surrender in Mariupol approached. The MoD said late on Tuesday that shelling and strikes were increasing over the line of control in Donbas but that Russian forces continued to be hampered by logistical and technological problems. It also noted an “inability to stamp out resistance” in Mariupol as a sign of failure to achieve Moscow’s objectives. The Russian defence ministry has said it will offer the besieged port city a ceasefire today to allow Ukrainian defenders holed up in the Azovstal steelworks to lay down their arms. About 1,000 civilians are reportedly hiding in underground shelters beneath the steel plant in Mariupol, according to the city council. Most of the civilians are believed to be women with children and elderly people. How are Ukrainian troops faring in Mariupol? A commander for the Ukrainian marines in Mariupol said his forces were “maybe facing our last days, if not hours” and appealed for extraction, in a Facebook post published early this morning. What is happening with the diplomatic effort? Western nations are preparing to stage coordinated walkouts and other diplomatic snubs in protest at Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Washington. Janet Yellen, the US treasury secretary, is planning to avoid sessions attended by Russian officials. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 56 of the invasion. January 6 ‘was a coup organized by the president’, says Jamie Raskin Donald Trump attempted a coup on 6 January 2021 as he tried to salvage his doomed presidency, and that will be a central focus of forthcoming public hearings of the special House panel investigating events surrounding the insurrection at the US Capitol, the congressman Jamie Raskin has said. Raskin is a prominent Democrat on the committee and also led the House efforts when Trump was impeached for a historic second time, in 2021, accused of inciting the storming of the US Capitol by his extremist supporters who were trying to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. “This was a coup organized by the president against the vice-president and against the Congress in order to overturn the 2020 presidential election,” Raskin said in an interview with the Guardian, Reuters news agency and the Climate One radio program. Public hearings by the bipartisan special committee investigating January 6 and related actions by Trump and his White House team and other allies, chaired by the Mississippi Democrat Bennie Thompson, are expected next month. What else did Raskin say? “We’re going to tell the whole story of everything that happened. There was a violent insurrection and an attempted coup and we were saved by Mike Pence’s refusal to go along with that plan.” Texas advocates file new legal challenge to near total abortion ban Reproductive rights advocates in Texas have filed a new legal challenge to halt a near total abortion ban that has been in effect for more than half a year. Senate bill 8 bars abortion once embryonic cardiac activity is detected – typically as early as six week of pregnancy, which is before most people are aware they are pregnant – and offers no exception for rape or incest. The lawsuit, filed yesterday, asks a federal court to rule the extreme law unconstitutional. It cites public threats and legal action from anti-abortion activists against Texas abortion funds, groups that have been instrumental in helping patients travel out of state for care, arguing that this conduct has chilled their first amendment rights. “Plaintiffs urgently need this court to stop Texas’s brazen defiance of the rule of law, uphold the federal constitutional rights of pregnant Texans, and restore the ability of abortion funds and their donors, employees and volunteers to fully serve Texas abortion patients,” the federal court filing reads. Wendy Davis, a former Texas senator who famously led an 11-hour filibuster against an anti-abortion bill in 2013, said: “We are asking the courts today to stop the unconstitutional harassment of abortion funds by confirming SB 8 cannot be used to silence donors with bogus threats.” In other news … Prince Harry has said the Queen was “on great form” during their recent meeting, and he wanted to make sure she had “the right people around her”.

Miller already faces charges of harassment and disorderly conduct after an incident last month at a karaoke bar on the island. A growing number of cities and states have restricted the information that local law enforcement departments can exchange with immigration authorities. But new documents reveal that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has tapped private technology companies to skirt such sanctuary policies. Netflix lost subscribers for the first time in 10 years at the start of the year and said it expects to lose even more in the spring, sending its share price crashing again yesterday. The streaming giant’s share price initially fell close to 20% on news that it had lost 200,000 subscribers globally during the first quarter. Stat of the day: most workers at large retail and food firms get less than $15 an hour – study Some of the largest, most profitable companies in retail and food services are still paying most of their workers less than $15 an hour, and many staff still make less than $10 an hour, according to a company wage tracker developed by the Economic Policy Institute and the Shift Project.

Surovikin’s statements on Tuesday came amid repeated military setbacks for Russian forces prompting Moscow’s dependence on Iran, which is sending missiles and drones. On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that military advisers from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were on Ukrainian soil, at a Russian military base in occupied Crimea. The Iranians were reported to have been deployed to help Russian troops deal with problems with the Tehran-supplied fleet of Shahed-136 drones, rebranded as Geran-2 by the attackers. Russian forces have been trying to hold off a fierce Ukrainian counter-assault in Kherson, a region in the south of Ukraine that Moscow claimed to have annexed last month after staging a sham referendum. Surovikin admitted that the situation in Kherson was “not easy”. “Further actions and plans regarding the city of Kherson will depend on the developing military-tactical situation, which is not easy. We will act consciously, in a timely manner, without ruling out difficult decisions,” he added. The comments appeared to mark a rare acknowledgment of the difficulties facing Russian forces. But it was not immediately clear whether Surovikin, the ruthless general now in charge of the war, was hinting at a looming Russian withdrawal from Kherson or a fresh round of airstrikes. Kherson, which lies near the mouth of the Dnipro on the west bank, was one of the first cities to fall to Russia after the invasion on 24 February and is a crucial strategic and symbolic target for Ukraine’s government. Gruelling fighting has been reported in the region since the start of Ukraine’s counter-offensive at the end of the summer, with both sides suffering steep casualties. The Ukrainian army has sought to pinch off Russian supply lines to Kherson by destroying the two main road bridges across the Dnipro. Kyiv has recently introduced a news blackout in the south of the country, leading to speculations that it was preparing a new major offensive on Kherson. “When the Ukrainians have a news blackout it means something is going on. They have always done this before when there is a big offensive push on,” Michael Clarke, a former director general of the Royal United Services Institute, told Sky News. “I am guessing in the next 48-72 hours they might tell us what is happening,” he added. Shortly after Surovikin’s statements, the Russian-installed head of Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, said in a video address that people in four towns in the Kherson region were being moved, in anticipation of a “large-scale offensive”. Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-installed deputy administrator of the Kherson region, echoed the message on Telegram late on Tuesday. “The battle for Kherson will begin in the very near future. The civilian population is advised, if possible, to leave the area of the upcoming fierce hostilities,” he said. Since Surovikin’s appointment on 8 October, Moscow has unleashed a barrage of cruise missiles and “kamikaze” drones targeting Ukrainian critical infrastructure as well as the civilian population. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said that Moscow’s use of Iranian-made drones was a symbol of the Kremlin’s “military and political bankruptcy”. “The very fact of Russia’s appeal to Iran for such assistance is the Kremlin’s recognition of its military and political bankruptcy,” Zelenskiy said in his daily address on Tuesday. “For decades, they spent billions of dollars on their own military industrial complex. And in the end, they bowed down to Tehran in order to secure quite simple drones and missiles.” But, Zelenskiy added, “strategically, it will not help them anyway. It only further proves to the world that Russia is on the path of defeat and is trying to draw someone else into its accomplices in terror.” The bombing is often inaccurate and civilians have been killed in residential buildings in Kyiv and other big cities. But enough have got through to cause problems for a power grid already short of generation after the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was shut down. Nearly a third of Ukraine’s power stations have been destroyed by Russian attacks since Monday last week – prompting Nato’s secretary general to announce that new counter-drone defences would be delivered within days. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the presidential office, said energy infrastructure and power supply were targeted overnight in an eastern district of Kyiv, where two people were killed, and in the cities of Dnipro and Zhytomyr. “The situation is critical now across the country because our regions are dependent on one another … it’s necessary for the whole country to prepare for electricity, water and heating outages,” Tymoshenko told Ukrainian television. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, said member countries would “step up” and deliver more air defences to help stabilise the situation. “Nato will in the coming days deliver counter-drone systems to counter the specific threat of drones, including those from Iran,” he said. Although there are signs that Moscow is running short on guided missiles, it has acquired up to 2,400 Iranian drones, according to Ukraine, and is using them as cheaper substitutes to hit the energy targets and strike fear into civilians. Iran denies supplying the drones to Russia, while the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he did not have any information about their origin. “Russian equipment with Russian names is being used,” Peskov said. Ukraine, experts and western governments believe the Gerans are rebranded Shahed drones, identifiable by their distinctive delta wing shape and from an examination of fragments recovered from the ground. A western official, speaking on condition of anonymity in a briefing on Tuesday, said they believed Russia was “pursuing a deliberate strategy of attempting to destroy Ukraine’s electricity network”. Reuters reported that Iran had promised to provide Russia with surface-to-surface missiles, in addition to more drones, citing two senior Iranian officials and two Iranian diplomats. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, and the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, flew to Washington on Tuesday to discuss how to respond to Iran’s intervention, as officials briefed that a new air defence package for Ukraine was being prepared. Last week Germany delivered the first of four Iris-T air defence systems it had promised to supply Ukraine, but the US has been wary of strengthening Ukraine’s air force and defences for fear it would be seen as an escalation. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader in the US House of Representatives, warned on Tuesday that Congress would not “write a blank cheque to Ukraine” if his party wins next month’s midterm elections. Hours later, however, another senior Republican, Michael McCaul, said that he thought that the Ukrainians should “get what they need” – including longer-range missiles than those the Biden administration has so far been prepared to supply. Analysts say the mixed messages reflect an internal debate between traditional national security conservatives and the Trumpist wing of the party, where pro-Russian sentiment is much stronger."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/30/morning-mail-tax-cuts-to-turbocharge-inequality-parental-leave-call-sea-level-rise-locked-in","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-29T20:50:13Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: tax cuts to ‘turbocharge inequality’, parental leave call, sea level rise locked in","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/30/morning-mail-tax-cuts-to-turbocharge-inequality-parental-leave-call-sea-level-rise-locked-in","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/30/morning-mail-tax-cuts-to-turbocharge-inequality-parental-leave-call-sea-level-rise-locked-in","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: tax cuts to ‘turbocharge inequality’, parental leave call, sea level rise locked in","bodyText":"Good morning.

He warned they would “turbocharge” inequality. Unions have called for a massive expansion of paid parental leave by extending it to 52 weeks, paying parents their actual wage and including superannuation, with unions saying the move could add billions to the economy. A report released by the Australian Council of Trade Unions says halving the gap in women’s pay and participation would boost the economy by $111bn. Unions also want Labor’s childcare subsidies brought forward by six months and an expansion in gender pay gap reporting. Major sea-level rise from the melting of the Greenland ice cap is now inevitable, scientists have found, even if the fossil fuel burning that is driving the climate crisis were to end overnight. The research shows the global heating to date will cause an absolute minimum sea-level rise of 27cm (10.6in) from Greenland alone as 110tn tonnes of ice melt. With continued carbon emissions, the melting of other ice caps and thermal expansion of the ocean, a multi-metre sea-level rise appears likely.

Russian forces are concentrating most of their strength on taking the town of Bakhmut in Donetsk, according to the British ministry of defence. The price cap on Russian seaborne oil has been adopted by the G7 and Australia, after it was agreed by EU countries. Poland had held out on a lower amount than the $60 a barrel that was agreed. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would “not accept this ceiling”. Another 510 Russian troops were killed on Friday according to Ukraine, bringing the total killed since the invasion in February to 90,600. A tank and eight drones were also lost by the Russians. Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyak’s estimate seem conservative. Speaking to Ukraine’s 24 Kanal, Podolyak said they were official figures from Ukraine’s general staff. One person was killed and six were injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine on Friday. Zelenskiy aide Kyrylo Tymoshenko said one civilian was killed and four injured in the Donetsk region, one was injured in Kharkiv and another in Kherson. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnieper River. The evacuations were to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday. Russian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the country’s museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers’ organisation, PEN. The International Atomic Energy Agency hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine to create a protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the end of the year, the head of the UN atomic watchdog was quoted as saying. The nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on backup generators a number of times, Reuters reported. Ukraine has detained eight people over the theft of a mural painted by the elusive British street artist Banksy from a wall in the Kyiv suburbs, authorities said. The stencil image of a person in a nightgown and gas mask holding a fire extinguisher next to the charred remains of a window in the town of Hostomel went missing on Friday, they said. Around mid-October, almost a month after Vladimir Putin called for the partial mobilisation of Russian citizens to fight the war in Ukraine, there was a knock at the door of the Moscow flat that is registered as my official residence in the country. The family friends who reside there opened the door and were greeted by two officers from the Russian military administration, who asked them whether I was at home. They said I had not been home in more than 20 years. The mobilisation was declared by Putin on the 21 September, after half a year of strategic failures, senseless deaths and humanitarian atrocities at the hands of the Russian army in Ukraine. There are an estimated 356,520 Russian casualties to date, close to 40% of the entire Russian armed forces. The west should consider how to address Russia’s need for security guarantees if Vladimir Putin agrees to negotiations about ending the war in Ukraine, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said in remarks broadcast on Saturday. Macron said Europe needed to address Putin’s fear that “NATO comes right up to its doors” and the deployment of weapons that could threaten Russia as Europe prepares its future security architecture, Reuters reports. Russia has rejected a price cap on its oil after the Group of Seven nations plus Australia joined the EU in adopting a $60-a-barrel price cap on seaborne Russian oil. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow “will not accept this cap”, according to the RIA news agency. He said Russia would conduct a rapid analysis of the agreement and then respond. Moscow’s permanent representative to international organisations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, warned the cap’s European backers would regret their decision. “From this year, Europe will live without Russian oil,” Ulyanov tweeted. “Moscow has already made it clear that it will not supply oil to those countries that support anti-market price caps. Wait, very soon the EU will accuse Russia of using oil as a weapon.” Moldova’s deputy prime minister, Andrei Spinu, has announced an energy deal he said would reduce the risk of large-scale electricity outages. Spinu said state utilities firm Energocom would buy enough electricity from Cuciurgan, the country’s largest power station, to cover all of Moldova’s needs for December when combined with existing imports from Romania, Reuters reports. Moldova, one of Europe’s poorest countries, has suffered from widespread power outages amid a reduced flow of natural gas from Russia and Kremlin air strikes on energy infrastructure in neighbouring Ukraine. The power station, located in Transnistria, a breakaway territory loyal to Moscow, depends on Russian gas dispensed by the Moldovan government in Chișinău. The Cuciurgan station had stopped providing electricity to the rest of Moldova after Russian state energy giant cut flows by 40%. Moldova has since relied on more expensive Romanian electricity but has still suffered blackouts linked to Russian strikes on Ukraine. Spinu said the power station, which sits across the Dniester River, would receive 5.7m cubic meters of gas a day in exchange for selling electricity for $73 a megawatt per hour. “This contract is a reasonable compromise to ensure the citizens on both banks of the Dniester [have] electricity and gas,” Spinu wrote on his Telegram channel. After Britain’s National Crime Agency arrested a “wealthy Russian businessman” on suspicion of money laundering and other offences, the Russian embassy in London has demanded information from the UK’s Foreign Office on the reasons and circumstances of the detention of the unidentified businessman and the conditions in which he is being held, Russian news agencies said. Ukraine has detained eight people over the theft of a mural painted by the elusive British street artist Banksy from a wall in the Kyiv suburbs, the authorities said. The stencil image of a person in a nightgown and gas mask holding a fire extinguisher next to the charred remains of a window in the town of Hostomel went missing on Friday, they said. “A group of people tried to steal a Banksy mural. They cut out the work from the wall of a house destroyed by the Russians,” the Kyiv governor, Oleksiy Kuleba, said in a post on Telegram. He attached the image of a gaping hole in the wall where the image once stood. Moldova’s deputy prime minister, Andrei Spînu, announced an energy deal on Saturday he said would reduce the risk of “massive electricity outages” in the former Soviet republic, Reuters reports. Moldova has had widespread power outages amid Russian airstrikes on energy infrastructure in neighbouring Ukraine and a reduced flow of natural gas from Russian state energy giant Gazprom. The Ukrainian army has recaptured 13 settlements in the Luhansk region, the eastern most oblast in the country, according to the head of the regional administration, Serhiy Haidai. He said that artillery was still being fired at the villages by Russian forces. Doctors are due to visit next week and firewood is being organised for residents, Haidai posted on Telegram. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has landed in Belarus’ capital, Minsk, to meet his opposite number Viktor Khrenin. Belarus is one of Russia’s closest allies, and was used as a launchpad for the invasion in February. As it approaches 5pm in Kyiv, here’s a roundup of today’s news so far. Eighteen Ukrainian diplomatic missions in 12 countries have received bloody packages, including animal parts, in what Ukraine has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson from Ukraine’s foreign ministry, said the packages were simultaneously sent from one European country, which he could not disclose while the investigation was ongoing. Ukrainian authorities in Kherson have urged people on the east of the Dnipro River to evacuate. The governor, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said that authorities would help people to evacuate during the daytime of Saturday to Monday, according to the Kyiv Independent. More than 7,000 explosives have been removed from around Kherson, the Ukrainian state emergency service has said. Russian forces are concentrating most of their strength on taking the town of Bakhmut in Donetsk, according to the British Ministry of Defence. The price cap on Russian seabourne oil has been expanded to the G7 and Australia, after it was agreed by EU countries. Poland had held out on a lower amount than the $60 a barrel that was agreed. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would “not accept this ceiling”. Another 510 Russian troops were killed on Friday according to Ukraine, bringing the total killed since the invasion in February to 90,600. A tank and eight drones were also lost by the Russians. Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.

Russian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the country’s museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers’ organisation PEN. The Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, has called for Europe to build its own defence capabilities in the wake of the war in Ukraine, saying that without US help Europe is not resilient enough. The International Atomic Energy Agency hopes to reach an agreement with Russia and Ukraine to create a protection zone at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant by the end of the year, the head of the UN atomic watchdog was quoted as saying. The nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before Russia’s invasion, and has been forced to operate on backup generators a number of times, Reuters reported. One person was killed and six were injured in Russian attacks on Ukraine on Friday. The news was announced by deputy head of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko on Telegram. He said one civilian was killed and four injured in the Donetsk region, one was injured in Kharkiv and another in Kherson. Ukrainian authorities in Kherson have urged people on the east of the Dnipro River to evacuate. The river been the front line between Ukrainian and Russian troops in the area since Russia pulled out of the city itself. Shelling towards the city has continued since then. The governor, Yaroslav Yanushevych, said authorities would help people to evacuate during the daytime of Saturday to Monday, according to the Kyiv Independent. Russian government spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has responded to the price cap imposed by the G7 and its allies on the exportation of seabound crude oil from Russia. Peskov said the Kremlin was prepared for the price cap and was analysing it. “We will not accept this ceiling,” the Tass news agency quoted him as saying. He added that the analysis would be carried out quickly and Russia would then say how it would respond. Eighteen Ukrainian diplomatic missions in 12 countries have received bloody packages in what Ukraine has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson from Ukraine’s foreign ministry, said the packages were simultaneously sent from one European country, which he could not disclose while the investigation was ongoing. As of Friday, Ukraine said 17 embassies had been targeted, indicating that another was delivered on Saturday. A Ukrainian embassy employee in Madrid was injured on Wednesday by a letter bomb, which was addressed to Ukraine’s ambassador to Spain. A further four letter bombs were sent on Wednesday to addresses in Spain, including to a Spanish arms manufacturer that has produced rockets donated to Ukraine, as well as Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the US embassy in Madrid. A Russian businessman has been arrested in London by officers investigating potential criminal activity by oligarchs. The 58-year-old man, who has not been named, was held by the National Crime Agency (NCA) on Thursday on suspicion of offences including money laundering, conspiracy to defraud the Home Office and conspiracy to commit perjury. A 35-year-old man, who works at the residence, was arrested nearby on suspicion of money laundering and obstruction of an officer after he was seen leaving with a bag containing thousands of pounds in cash. A third man, 39, who is the former boyfriend of the businessman’s current partner, was arrested at his home in Pimlico, London, for offences including money laundering and conspiracy to defraud. They have all been bailed, according to PA Media. Graeme Biggar, director general of the NCA, said: “The NCA’s combatting kleptocracy cell, only established this year, is having significant success investigating potential criminal activity by oligarchs, the professional service providers that support and enable them and those linked to the Russian regime. “We will continue to use all the powers and tactics available to us to disrupt this threat.” The NCA said it is the latest operation carried out as part of its efforts to disrupt the activities of corrupt international business figures and their enablers. A statement said the NCA has already helped with the freezing of numerous properties, eight yachts and four aircraft. The graphic below shows the latest developments in Russia’s war in Ukraine. On Friday, it was reported that Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnipro River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday. You can read Isobel Koshiw’s report here for more in-depth reporting regarding the price cap of Russian oil. “G7 countries and Australia have agreed to cap the price of Russian seaborne oil, with the aim of reducing Moscow’s income and limiting its ability to finance its war in Ukraine. But critics, including Ukraine, say the cap of $60 a barrel is still higher than the current market price for Russian crude oil and is unlikely to affect the KremlinRussia’s war coffers. In a statement on the deal, the UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, described the country’s support for Ukraine as unwavering and said it would “continue to look for new ways to clamp down on [the Russian president, Vladimir] Putin’s funding streams wherever we can”. The cap on the price of Russian oil transported by sea is designed to affect the country’s exports worldwide, in addition to the EU-wide embargo on Russian crude oil, which comes into force on 5 December, which the UK is also adopting. Andrey Kurkov has written an opinion piece, arguing that Ukrainians enjoying the festive season and a local chess championship is an “act of defiance for our country’s future”. “While Ukraine lives in fear of the next mass bombing of its energy infrastructure by Russian missiles and Iranian drones, and constantly monitors the actions of troops located in Belarus, there are still small forms of normalcy, small forms of resistance. A blitz chess championship was recently held in Zhytomyr, a city 140km west of Kyiv and a regular target of missile attacks. “Blitz chess – because slow chess is impossible in today’s Ukraine, where everything has to be done quickly or very quickly. The games were played according to the Swiss system, and with nine rounds in which players have only three minutes a move. If in peacetime a person appreciates every hour of tranquility, during a war we appreciate every minute.” You can read the full article here: The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said that 17 Ukrainian embassies or diplomatic missions around the world have received letter bombs or packages containing animal parts, including cows eyes, in recent days. In an interview with CNN, he said: “It started with an explosion at the embassy of Ukraine in Spain,” Kuleba said. “But what followed this explosion was more weird, and I would even say sick.” A letter bomb at the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid left a staff member with minor injuries on Wednesday. Others have been sent to the Spanish prime minister, the deputy prime minister and the US embassy. Ukraine’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Oleg Nikolenko, said that embassies in Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Croatia, Italy and Austria are among those to receive the packages. When asked who he thought was behind the letters, Kuleba told CNN said: “I feel tempted to say, to name Russia straight away, because first of all you have to answer the question, who benefits? “Maybe this terror response is the Russian answer to the diplomatic horror that we created for Russia on the international arena, and this is how they try to fight back while they are losing the real diplomatic battles one after another.” Russia has denied any responsibility for the packages in Madrid. On Wednesday, its embassy in Spain said: “Any terrorist threat or act, even more so directed against a diplomatic mission, is totally reprehensible.” More details have been published about attacks on Ukraine on Friday, in an update from the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces. They said Russia continues to shell civilian infrastructure and is trying to go on the offensive in Avdiivka and Bakhmut. Russia launched five missile strikes, 27 airstrikes and 44 rocket launcher attacks on Ukrainian towns, cities and troops. The main target for Russian airstrikes was Bakhmut and Avdiivka, both in Donetsk oblast in the east of Ukraine. Kherson city has continued to be shelled since its recapture by Ukrainian troops. Two Russian missiles hit the region of Zaporizhzhia in the south-east of Ukraine overnight. The governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said they had damaged buildings near the regional capital, Zaporizhzhia, but no casualties were reported. Spain has sent its first Hawk air-defence missile system to Ukraine. The American-built Raytheon system can be used against aircraft and missiles, both of which have been used by Russia to attack Ukraine, including power stations and homes. Spain has promised to supply six units to Ukraine. Russia has said it will continue to find buyers for oil, despite a price cap for seabourne oil being set at $60 a barrel. A group of western countries, including EU nations, G7 countries and Australia have agreed the cap as they try to limit Moscow’s income and its ability to finance its ongoing war in Ukraine. In retaliation, Vladimir Putin and Kremlin officials have said that they won’t sell oil to countries that implement it. Russia’s embassy to the US on Saturday said that the policy was “reshaping” the free market, and insisted oil would continue to be sold. In a post on Telegram, it said: “Steps like these will inevitably result in increasing uncertainty and imposing higher costs for raw materials’ consumers. “Regardless of the current flirtations with the dangerous and illegitimate instrument, we are confident that Russian oil will continue to be in demand.” Ukrainian forces killed another 510 Russian troops on Friday, bringing the total number of soldiers lost by Russia since the invasion to 90,600. They also downed another eight drones and managed to take out a tank, according to statistics provided by the Ukrainian general staff of the armed forces. A total of 7,042 explosive items have been “removed and neutralised” from Kherson oblast, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service. Work to rid the area of mines and other traps has been going on since the Russian retreat from the city last month. Ukrainian emergency workers say they have surveyed almost 700ha of open territory, 60km of railway tracks and 326 households. Authorities are urging anyone who returns to Kherson or the area around it to be extremely careful. Last month, the Guardian reported that ridding Kherson of mines could take years. Here’s a bit more detail about the oil price cap instituted by the G7 and its allies. The EU had already agreed on an embargo of seaborne crude oil from Russia in a package of sanctions announced earlier this year. The G7 and Australia agreement will allow non-EU countries to continue importing seaborne Russian crude oil using western insurance and maritime services as long as they do not pay more a barrel than the agreed limit. Because the most important shipping and insurance firms are based in G7 countries, the price cap would make it very difficult for Moscow to sell its oil for a higher price. A senior US Treasury Department official told reporters on Friday that the $60 a barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil will keep global markets well supplied while “institutionalising” discounts created by the threat of such a limit. Under the terms of the deal the price cap will be reviewed in mid-January and every two months after that. It also includes a mechanism that would keep the price cap at least 5% below the market rate. Security experts from the CSIS thinktank have warned a cap at $60 is toothless since it is above the price of existing Russian oil prices of about $52 a barrel. It has been estimated that Russian oil is sold at a profit from $40-$45 a barrel, but Russia’s true extraction costs are hard to estimate. The UK Ministry of Defence has released an update on Russia’s military efforts in Ukraine. Russian forces continue to invest a large part of their overall firepower on an approximately 15km-long sector of entrenched frontline around the Donetsk oblast town of Bakhmut, the defence ministry says. In recent days, Russia has likely made small advances on the southern axis of this assault and is likely to be planning to encircle the town. Russia has prioritised Bakhmut as its main offensive effort since early August 2022. The capture of the town would have limited operational value although it would potentially allow Russia to threaten the larger urban areas of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. The statement from the ministry adds that the campaign has been disproportionately costly, relative to these possible gains. There is a realistic possibility that Bakhmut’s capture has become primarily a symbolic, political objective for Russia. The G7 and Australia have agreed to cap the price paid for Russian seaborne crude oil at $60 a barrel, hours after EU members overcame internal resistance to reach the same decision earlier in the day. The EU agreed the price after holdout Poland gave its support, paving the way for formal approval over the weekend. In a statement, the Group of Seven leading economies and Australia said the price cap would take effect on 5 December or very soon after. The price cap aims to reduce Russia’s income from selling oil, while preventing a spike in global oil prices after an EU embargo on Russian crude oil takes effect on 5 December. Poland had pushed in EU negotiations for the cap to be as low as possible in order to squeeze Russian revenues and limit Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine. The final deal includes a mechanism to keep the oil price cap at least 5% below the market rate. US officials said the deal was unprecedented and demonstrated the resolve of the coalition opposing Russia’s war. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the price cap would significantly reduce Russia’s revenues. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Jonathan Yerushalmy and I’ll be with you for the next while. The G7, EU and Australia have agreed to cap the price of Russian seaborne crude oil at $60 a barrel, in a move that could result in Russian oil output falling by 500,000 barrels a day by early 2023. The decision by the Group of Seven nations and Australia followed an earlier announcement from the EU that the bloc had overcome internal resistance to a $60 a barrel price. The G7 and Australia said in a statement the price cap would take effect on 5 December or very soon thereafter. More on this shortly. In the meantime, here are the other key recent developments: The US president, Joe Biden, said on Thursday that he was prepared to speak to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, if he was looking for a way to end the war but that Putin had not yet indicated that. Putin is open to talks on a possible settlement in Ukraine but the refusal of the United States to recognise annexed territories as Russian is hindering a search for any potential compromise, the Kremlin said. Up to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia invaded in February, according to Kyiv’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. At certain points in the war, Ukraine said that between 100 and 200 of its forces were dying a day on the battlefield, making Podolyak’s estimate seem conservative. Speaking to Ukraine’s 24 Kanal, Podolyak said they were official figures from Ukraine’s general staff. Three people were killed and seven wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson over the past 24 hours, the regional governor said. Russian-installed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said that they would start evacuating some people with reduced mobility from the Russian-occupied town of Kakhovka, on the east bank of the Dnipro River. The evacuations were set to start on Saturday, they said in a Telegram post on Friday. Russian troops in Ukraine are deliberately attacking the country’s museums, libraries and other cultural institutions, according to a report issued by the US and Ukrainian chapters of the international writers’ organisation PEN. The Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, has called for Europe to build its own defence capabilities in the wake of the war in Ukraine, saying that without US help Europe is not resilient enough.

Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, said: “Nobody is under any illusions any more. Russia’s use of its natural gas resources as an economic and political weapon shows Europe needs to act quickly to be ready to face considerable uncertainty over Russian gas supplies next winter.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted European governments, including the UK’s, to make a frantic reappraisal of their energy supplies – one that arguably should have come much sooner. The first outcome has been a fresh resolve in some countries – including from the UK business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng – to push for more renewable energy generation and energy efficiency to cut dependence on fossil fuels. Kwarteng’s intervention – “The long-term solution is obvious: gas is more expensive than renewable energy, so we need to move away from gas,” he tweeted – was unexpectedly firm, cheering green campaigners who had feared that rightwing voices in the Tory party who have sought to make scrapping the net zero target a “culture war” issue were in the ascendant. Doug Parr, the chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, said: “Kwasi Kwarteng has clocked it. Our dependence on gas is a problem, and warmer homes powered by renewables are the cheapest and quickest solution. Kwarteng must convince chancellor Rishi Sunak that we need a masterplan, and the money to get the UK off gas. We need to insulate our homes, roll out heat pumps and renewable power to rapidly address Putin’s grip on European gas markets, our sky-high energy bills, and the climate crisis unfolding before our eyes.” Germany has announced plans to ramp up energy efficiency and renewable energy, and is considering delaying the closure of its remaining nuclear power stations. France’s Emmanuel Macron called for a “renaissance” of low-carbon nuclear power to secure domestic energy supplies. In the US, Joe Biden used his state of the union speech to bang the drum again for his proposed clean energy stimulus programme. Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser now with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington, said: “The Russian invasion of Ukraine greatly increases the likelihood that the US Congress will pass huge new clean energy incentives this year because of an increased focus on energy security. Such a massive expansion of zero-emission US energy will also free up more US natural gas to flow to Europe to displace Russian gas, which has far higher fugitive emissions of methane. Together these actions would represent a significant improvement not only in global energy geopolitics, but result in major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions as well.” But as the war in Ukraine continues to rage, there is also a significant danger that – particularly if Putin goes further and cuts off gas supplies – governments could pivot the opposite way. As the IEA noted: “Other avenues are available to the EU if it wishes or needs to reduce reliance on Russian gas even more quickly … The major near-term option would involve switching away from gas consumption in the power sector via increased use of Europe’s coal-fired fleet, or by using alternative fuels such as oil within existing gas-fired power plants.” The decision may be taken by private-sector companies with coal-fired power stations that were recently closed or scheduled to close and could be brought back on stream quickly, said Richard Howard, the research director at Aurora Energy Research. “The high gas prices being seen in the market will in any case create an economic incentive for generators to shift from gas power stations towards coal,” he said. A further complication is that Europe also depends on Russia for coal. In the US, the opportunities to export gas from fracking, and coal for power stations, may also expand temptingly as fossil fuel prices rise, and to fill the gaps that open up as countries move away from Russian supplies. Then there is the question of how much consumers will stand. Petrol prices in the US, as in many places around the world, are now at the highest in a decade and still rising. Phillip Braun, a professor of finance at Northwestern University in the US, said: “American consumers need to accept that rising gas prices are a necessary cost to help the Ukrainian people in the midst of their profound crisis.” Whether consumers will continue to pay this price for democracy has not yet been tested. After years of grindingly slow progress in shifting away from coal and oil, if countries were to resume fossil fuel use under the impact of Russia’s war, it would spell disaster for attempts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. This week the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned of global devastation already under way and set to intensify if temperatures rise further, in what scientists termed “the bleakest warning yet”. Tim Crosland, the director of Plan B, a climate campaign group, said the IPCC report showed that reaching for more fossil fuels as a response to Putin would only put the world in greater peril. “There is no option of ramping up fossil fuel production as a counter to Putin,” he said. “A strategy for deescalation of the war in Ukraine can and must be integrated with a strategy for the urgent and radical reduction of carbon emissions, starting with an end to new fossil fuel supply projects, as required to limit warming to 1.5C. Separate the two logics [of climate and dealing with the war] and it’s all over.” These issues will come into sharp focus at the next UN climate meeting, Cop27, due to be held in Egypt in November. So far preparations have been unaffected, and diplomats privately note that climate negotiations have carried on through 30 years of political upheavals, including wars among UN members. But the key questions over energy policy will need to be resolved long before countries meet again on the climate. Given the time it takes to change energy systems, as the IEA made clear, governments must prepare now for what next winter will bring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/26/friday-briefing-why-recycling-plastic-may-not-be-as-good-for-the-planet-as-we-thought","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-26T05:42:23Z","webTitle":"Friday briefing: Why recycling plastic may not be as good for the planet as we thought","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/26/friday-briefing-why-recycling-plastic-may-not-be-as-good-for-the-planet-as-we-thought","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/26/friday-briefing-why-recycling-plastic-may-not-be-as-good-for-the-planet-as-we-thought","fields":{"headline":"Friday briefing: Why recycling plastic may not be as good for the planet as we thought","bodyText":"Good morning. “Reduce, reuse, recycle” is an environmentalist mantra that everyone has been able to get behind because, in the age of overconsumption, humans are producing more waste than ever before. Every year we dump 2bn tonnes of municipal solid waste on to the planet and – according to the World Bank – that number is expected to rise by 70% to 3.4bn tonnes by 2050. For years, campaigners and scientists have said that this level of waste generation is unsustainable and is detrimental to the natural environment, wildlife and humans. To ensure that less of our stuff ends up in landfills, more and more people are advocating for a circular economy. No one wants to be seen to be destroying the planet, so corporate actors are also getting on board, with many big retailers pledging to reduce single-use plastics in their products, as well as opting to use recycled materials. For most of us, the process of recycling ends when we throw the coffee cup or plastic packaging into the relevant bin. Someone comes to collect it and off it goes, leaving our conscience clear. The story does not end there, however: plastic recycling increasingly looks like a futile endeavour. Much of it still ends up in landfill, or in poorer countries where it is melted down into pellets, dumped, or burned. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to Guardian environment correspondent Damien Gayle about the secretive recycling industry and whether it actually makes a difference. That’s right after the headlines. Five big stories Politics | Leaked documents show that more than 3,000 asylum seekers could be detained and deported from the UK every month to enforce Suella Braverman’s flagship asylum bill. The news comes after figures revealed that net migration hit a record high last year at 606,000, a 24% increase on the previous year’s high of 488,000. Education | One in 10 childcare providers in England is facing closure and more than half are struggling to cover their costs, according to the government’s own research into the impact of the cost of living crisis on the sector. UK news | An 11-year-old boy was hit by a police van in Lancaster as he crossed the road, leaving him in critical condition. Lancashire police said they were attending an emergency call on Thursday night when the collision occurred with the boy. The police have voluntarily referred themselves to the Independent Office for Police Conduct to review the incident. Transport | At least 50 British Airways flights were cancelled on Thursday afternoon because of a “technical issue”, with many passengers facing the possibility of further delayed or cancelled flights at Heathrow heading into the bank holiday weekend. UK news | Armed officers arrested a man on suspicion of criminal damage and dangerous driving after a car was driven into the gates outside Downing Street. Police are not treating the incident as terrorism-related. In depth: ‘Each time we recycle plastics they become more dangerous to us and the planet’ “Waste and recycling are the dirty secrets of our consumer society,” Damien Gayle says. “The fact is everything that we consume has waste attached. We throw it in the bin or the recycling and we like to just forget about it.” But we shouldn’t, Damien says. Because, as uncomfortable as it is to think about where our used tissues and empty crisp packets go, the pile of rubbish will just continue to grow and pollute, infecting the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe. *** What happens to most plastic? Last year, world leaders, environment ministers and other representatives from 173 countries endorsed a historic UN resolution that seeks to end plastic pollution and create a legally binding global treaty by the end of 2024. At the moment, only 9% of plastics are recycled globally. In the United States that number is even lower, at just 5%. In the run up to the latest round of negotiations in this agreement, Greenpeace warned that ultimately we cannot safely recycle plastic. “What [the studies they reference] have found is that the toxic chemicals that are found in virgin plastic become more concentrated when they’re repurposed into recycled plastics for further use,” Damien explains. “Greenpeace are basically saying plastics cannot ever be regarded as compatible with a circular economy, because each time we recycle them they become more dangerous to our health and the health of the planet.” The campaign group are part of a larger chorus of voices who doubt the effectiveness of recycling as a way to deal with plastic pollution. And then there is the small issue of microplastics. One recent study found that the process of recycling plastic could be releasing huge quantities of microplastics – which can be toxic to humans and to animals – into the environment. They’re already everywhere: microplastics have been found deep in the lungs of living people, in freshly fallen snow in Antarctica and in the depths of the ocean. As one writer put it, microplastics have “moved into virtually every crevice on Earth”. Researchers say that they do not know what the long-term health implications are, but early studies are already indicating that microplastics are harmful to human bodies as many of the chemicals they contain are carcinogenic. *** Exporting the problem For years, many rich countries outsourced their recycling, shipping it overseas to be sorted out by other people. Until 2017, China was the world’s biggest importer of such material, but decided to close its borders to almost all types of waste because of concerns about contamination and pollution, effectively killing an industry worth $24bn a year. In the years that followed, poorer countries like Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand have picked up the slack, as well as Poland, India, and Turkey. For Damien, this shift represents “neo-colonialism – offloading our toxic waste on to the people who can least deal with it”. After receiving waste that was not sufficiently recyclable or which caused significant pollution, many of these countries have followed China and are drastically limiting the amount of waste they import or banning it outright. *** Is there any point to recycling? Before you put your recycling bin in, er, the recycling bin, the general consensus is that the solution is not to stop recycling altogether. While imperfect, it is the best option we have – the alternative is creating more landfill sites or incinerating more waste, which produces more carbon emissions than natural gas. Ultimately, the only real way to tackle plastic pollution – and to curb the growth of already gigantic levels of waste – is to produce less stuff. Recycle is the last R — the first two, reduce and reuse, are perhaps the key to stop humanity drowning in its own castoffs. “Greenpeace are calling for a pathway to the total elimination of the production of virgin plastic,” Damien explains. However, high profit margins mean that there is little will to create a plastic-free future. “It’s everywhere because it’s cheaper. The petrochemical sector is one of the biggest industries on the planet and it’s cheaper for them to produce virgin plastic than almost any other equivalent,” Damien says. Alternatives are more expensive for the consumer too, he adds. In a world that is moving – albeit slowly – away from fossil fuels, plastic is a key way that these companies are planning to keep the lights on for the next few decades. Producers of plastic have pushed recycling as a viable way to deal with waste – but it seems the solution may be closer to home. Says Damien on eliminating virgin plastic: “I think that’s the only logical and realistic path that we can have for us as a species to survive”.

Lucy Mangan Music Water From Your Eyes – Everything’s Crushed Rachel Brown and Nate Amos started out as nothing special. Their 2017 debut, Long Days No Dreams, covered so many modish US indie bases – bedroom synth-pop, offbeat post-punk and distorted digital noise, shoegazey textures, introverted acoustic balladry and what Americans persist in calling tweepop. An experimental, idiosyncratic sound coalesced on 2021’s Structure, but it’s on Everyone’s Crushed that it pulls into focus, if that’s the right metaphor for a cut-up, sample-heavy sound that feels wilfully chaotic and scattered.

But the International Energy Agency has identified the shock in the market caused by Russia’s invasion as a potential inflection point for investment in green energy. A report from the IEA has found that clean energy investment is significantly outpacing spending on fossil fuels, and is on track to reach $1.7tn (£1.4tn) this year, as investors turn to renewables, electric vehicles, nuclear power, grids, storage and other low-carbon technologies. At the same time, investment in coal, gas and oil will rise to just over $1tn, the IEA said. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said: “This is a dramatic shift which will have consequences for the energy markets and climate change. In my view, it’s very exciting … It may be symbolic but it is very important because it shows the tide turning.” Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday Bored at work?

The issues identified by the environment watchdog in its early assessments of the plans for the site at Bradwell-on-Sea include concerns over how China General Nuclear Group (CGN) will dispose of radioactive waste. The agency has opened a consultation calling for views on its assessment and there is likely to be strong criticism from environmentalists and local community groups who oppose the new plant. CGN is helping to build the first new nuclear power plants in the UK in a generation as a junior partner at EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C site in Somerset and at EDF’s planned plant at Sizewell C in Suffolk, both of which will use a reactor type designed by the French energy company. The Chinese state-owned company also plans to build a nuclear power plant using its own reactor design, the UK Hualong pressurised water reactor, at Bradwell. It hopes to have the design approved by UK authorities by 2022. The plans have raised concerns among those who believe that Chinese-owned companies should not be involved in the UK’s critical national infrastructure over security and surveillance concerns following the Huawei controversy. Alan McGoff, of the Environment Agency (EA), said he expects CGN to resolve the potential issues identified by the agency “over the next year or so”, but warned that the agency will accept the reactor design “only if we are satisfied that all the issues have been addressed”. The EA has been scrutinising the plans since 2017 and has also identified concerns over how CGN plans to use its operational experience “to inform and improve the design”, its plans to respond to safety and environment protection assessments, and its use of high-efficiency particulate air filters. “If the issues are not resolved or new issues are identified but not resolved, then we would consider only issuing an interim statement of design acceptability. Our aim is to complete our detailed assessment of the design in early 2022,” McGoff said. • This article was amended on 13 January 2021 to clarify the location of the nuclear site at Bradwell-on-Sea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/oct/04/surging-gas-prices-and-fuel-bills-focus-tory-minds-on-the-nuclear-option","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-04T05:00:48Z","webTitle":"Surging gas prices and fuel bills focus Tory minds on the nuclear option","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/04/surging-gas-prices-and-fuel-bills-focus-tory-minds-on-the-nuclear-option","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/oct/04/surging-gas-prices-and-fuel-bills-focus-tory-minds-on-the-nuclear-option","fields":{"headline":"Surging gas prices and fuel bills focus Tory minds on the nuclear option","bodyText":"Among the subjects preoccupying delegates at the Conservative party conference in Manchester on Monday, energy will be near the top of the list. Soaring global gas prices, a lack of windpower and surging household bills have focused minds on Britain’s energy needs – and the role of nuclear power in particular. For the past decade, Britain’s ambitions to build more nuclear power plants have been entwined with China’s. Hinkley Point C, the long-delayed and over-budget £23bn plant in Somerset that will be the first new power station in a generation, is being bankrolled with Chinese cash. China’s nuclear ambitions – at least as far as Britain is concerned – may be about to collide with a new political reality. Opponents of Chinese involvement in UK infrastructure are turning cartwheels at reports that the government is planning to eject the People’s Republic from Sizewell C – a £20bn sister to Sizewell B on the Suffolk coast, which is intended to power 6m homes. Beijing’s international nuclear ambitions have suffered a “body blow”, according to Iain Duncan Smith. The former Conservative party leader’s Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China campaigned, successfully, for the telecoms giant Huawei to be kicked out of the UK’s 5G network, after pressure from Donald Trump’s administration. “The British government has learned the hard way that we’re going to have to stand up to them,” he said. Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Sinosceptic China Research Group, hailed the “more realistic approach”. “Chinese state-owned companies shouldn’t be building nuclear power plants in Britain,” he said. “As the China Research Group has shown, Beijing’s attempts to interfere in other countries are growing and the UK should not make itself vulnerable.” The duo were reacting to suggestions, first reported in the Guardian, that officials are examining methods by which China General Nuclear (CGN), which has a 20% stake in the Sizewell C project due to be built by France’s EDF, can be removed from the equation. An announcement could come as early as this month, with taxpayers’ cash used instead. CGN was due to step up its involvement in British nuclear post-Sizewell, through a majority position in Bradwell B in Essex, intended to be a showcase for the Chinese-designed Hualong One (HPR1000) reactor. If China is forced out of a minority financial position in a plant built by French state-backed EDF, the prospect of a Chinese-controlled facility a mere 40 miles from London is surely a non-starter. Bradwell would have been a major coup, demonstrating to the world that a major economy such as the UK was open to Beijing’s proprietary nuclear technology. Duncan Smith thinks the UK’s decision could scupper the plan. “If we do this, other countries will follow suit and it will turn out to be a very big decision indicating direction of travel with China. It’s a big strategic decision.” He also has price on his side. It costs around twice as much to produce a kilowatt hour of nuclear power compared with offshore wind and solar power. But have the anti-China hawks started celebrating too soon? One industry source, who has been observing China’s nuclear ambitions for years, sees no reason to believe that CGN will bow to pressure to withdraw. Forcing China out would create a diplomatic row. “There has been a sustained effort […] to make the atmosphere so hostile that the company will just give up and go away,” the source said. “That seems a really heroic assumption.” CGN is deeply involved in the 3.2GW Hinkley project, which could yet run beyond its current £23bn budget and its 2027 completion date. “Of course it [continued Chinese investment in Hinkley] could be at risk,” said the source. “CGN is making a big contribution [to the plant] but it’s not the big flagship ‘welcome to the world’ thing that building an HPR1000 would be.” Pressure on the UK government from its own MPs, but also from abroad, seems to be behind the decision to keep China at arm’s length. Opposition from the likes of Duncan Smith and Tugendhat is one thing but American intervention is quite another. The former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo last year urged Britain to look across the Atlantic for its nuclear future, saying the US “stands ready to assist our friends in the UK with any needs they have”. The Trump administration was vocally opposed to Chinese technology incursions into the west and the Biden administration is no different. But jilting China to please America leaves Britain facing a problem. The UK nuclear fleet has a capacity of 8.9GW, about a sixth of peak demand in winter and 20% of our average needs annually. More than 7GW of that capacity – seven out of the eight existing power stations – is due to for retirement between now and 2030. Hinkley is the only project with a completion date in sight, with one reactor firing up in 2026 and the next in 2027 but it is an optimistic assumption that no delays will occur. Even if Hinkley proceeds as planned, UK nuclear capacity will still fall to 4.4GW by 2030 if nothing else is done. The upcoming Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow has reminded everyone of the UK’s commitment to decarbonise the economy entirely by 2050, while the gas price crisis has underscored the risks of relying solely on fossil fuels and renewable energy. Big nuclear power plants and their spinning turbines provide the vital inertia that is required to balance the grid and keep its frequency stable. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is keen to emphasise that nuclear is part of the solution but something needs to happen to speed up these multibillion-pound projects. At Sizewell, the government’s great hope is regulated asset base (RAB) financing, an investment structure that offers potential investors safe returns but requires legislation. A government spokesperson described it as a “credible model”, indicating moves are afoot to pursue that as a means of funding Sizewell – not to mention projects such as Wylfa, on Anglesey, which Japan’s Hitachi recently walked away from, citing funding concerns. The new financing model, used in water and power networks, could lure in American investors such as the construction giant Bechtel. If Beijing and London can find a diplomatic solution to remove CGN from UK nuclear, this funding model is a solution that could attract backers to replace the Chinese. If nuclear has a major role to play in Britain’s decarbonised future, time is of the essence. Nuclear options The UK has struggled to get nuclear projects moving in the past decade but it does have options. The first is to find investors for major new-build projects. While investors in Sizewell C are already lined up, China’s involvement is in doubt after signals that ministers are preparing to buy out its share of Bradwell B in Essex. Offering more attractive funding options could be the key to kickstarting the £20bn Wylfa project on Anglesey after Hitachi walked away last year. But the UK’s National Infrastructure Commission is cool on large-scale nuclear new projects. Advanced modular reactors (AMR), which use new coolants instead of water, are seen as a potential technological leap forward. Earlier this year, the government published a call for evidence about launching a programme to demonstrate their viability. However, even this pilot stage won’t be ready until the 2030s. There is plenty of excitement about Rolls-Royce’s plans for small modular reactors (SMRs), dubbed mini-nukes that could, in theory, be rolled out quickly and easily to boost capacity. The British engineering giant thinks it could plug them into the grid by 2030. Then there is the tantalising moonshot prospect of cracking nuclear fusion, harnessing the power of the stars to create, in theory, limitless energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/30/russia-ukraine-war-live-fresh-missile-strikes-on-zaporizhzhia-region-zelenskiy-says-russians-planning-something-in-the-south","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-30T18:45:17Z","webTitle":"Blast at Ukraine embassy in Madrid injures staff member; UK imposes fresh sanctions – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/30/russia-ukraine-war-live-fresh-missile-strikes-on-zaporizhzhia-region-zelenskiy-says-russians-planning-something-in-the-south","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/30/russia-ukraine-war-live-fresh-missile-strikes-on-zaporizhzhia-region-zelenskiy-says-russians-planning-something-in-the-south","fields":{"headline":"Blast at Ukraine embassy in Madrid injures staff member; UK imposes fresh sanctions – as it happened","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is 8.45pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s top headlines: A security officer at Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid was injured when he opened a letter bomb addressed to the ambassador on Wednesday, and Kyiv ordered a bolstering of security at all its representative offices abroad. The security officer suffered light injuries and went under his own steam to hospital for treatment, Spanish government official Mercedes Gonzalez told broadcaster Telemadrid. In the wake of the incident, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba ordered all Kyiv’s embassies abroad to “urgently” strengthen security, a ministry spokesperson said. The European Commission president has proposed a special tribunal to investigate and prosecute Russia’s crime of aggression against Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen also wants to use the proceeds of Russian funds that have been frozen under western sanctions to aid Ukraine (see 8.19 GMT). Behind each proposal, questions remain. Ukraine needs the US made Patriot missile defence systems to protect its civilian infrastructure, under heavy attack by Russia, foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said, adding he would be working with the German government on this issue. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato on Tuesday against providing Ukraine with Patriot systems, Reuters reported. The UK has announced a fresh round of sanctions against 22 Russians, including those the Foreign Office says were involved in enlisting criminals to fight in Ukraine. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said on Wednesday his department would target a new set of officials, including Denis Manturov, the deputy prime minister, who is responsible for troop equipment supplies. Ukraine’s state emergency service has said nine people have been killed in fires in the past 24 hours after breaking safety rules in an attempt to heat their homes after Russian attacks on power facilities. The number of fires had risen, it said, with Ukrainians increasingly resorting to using emergency generators, candles and gas cylinders in their homes because of power outages, Reuters reported. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has arrived in Kyiv for a three-day visit to show solidarity with the people and churches of Ukraine. Welby will meet leaders of Ukraine’s churches, refugees and internally displaced people. The EU will try to set up a court, backed by the UN, to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine, according to the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen. In a video statement, she said: “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought death, devastation and unspeakable suffering. We all remember the horrors of Bucha. It is estimated that more than 20,000 civilians and more than 100,000 Ukrainian military officers have been killed so far.” The head of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, discussed nuclear issues and Ukraine in a meeting this month with the CIA director, William Burns, the RIA news agency reported. Elizabeth Rood, the charge d’affaires at the US embassy in Moscow, previously told RIA that Burns “did not negotiate anything and he did not discuss a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine”. Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) officials found weapons and Russian cash on Wednesday after searching properties in around Kyiv linked to a pro-Russian former politician, the agency said. In a statement, the SBU said its searches of homes and offices belonging to Yevhen Murayev, who it said was “hiding from justice abroad”, and his associates were part of a criminal investigation into treason. Moscow has promoted the chief engineer of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Yuriy Chernichuk, to become its head, according to Russia’s nuclear agency Rosenergoatom. The position has been vacant since October, when Kyiv says the plant’s boss Ihor Murashov was abducted by Russian authorities. One person was killed and another wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Wednesday, the regional governor said. Yaroslav Yanushevych wrote on the Telegram messaging app that several residential buildings and medical facilities had been damaged in the city, which was liberated this month after months of Russian occupation. Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said on Telegram early on Wednesday morning that Russian strikes in the region overnight hit a gas distribution point, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no injuries or casualties. Ukraine claims to have killed another 500 Russian soldiers in the last 24 hours, bringing the total who have died in combat since 24 February to about 88,880. The general staff of the armed forces said it had taken out three more tanks and six armoured personnel carriers. Ukrainian forces have downed three Russian reconnaissance drones in the last 24 hours, according to its armed forces. In an early morning bulletin from Ukraine, the spokesperson for the general staff of the armed forces, Alexander Štupun, said Ukraine had been subjected to a number of missile attacks from planes and artillery, including on Kivsharivka in Kharkiv and Sloviansk in Donetsk. A teenager was killed in Russian shelling of a hospital in the northern Ukrainian region of Sumy, a presidential aide has said. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian forces had pounded the region with artillery and mortar bombs over the past 24 hours. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he did not believe Russian president Vladimir Putin will use nuclear weapons. He made the comment while speaking by video link at the New York Times ‘DealBook’ summit in New York City. It comes as Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said it was vital to avoid any kind of military confrontation between nuclear powers, even if it only involved conventional weapons, the TASS news agency reported. The city council in the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa has voted to remove and relocate a monument to Empress Catherine the Great of Russia that has been daubed with red paint at least twice. The statue to the city’s founder, which towers over a central square, has been vandalised repeatedly since the invasion of Ukraine that has prompted many Ukrainians to reject their country’s historical ties to Moscow, Reuters reported. Five Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian forces on Tuesday, according to a senior government official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, posted on Telegram that the five were killed in Donetsk, with 15 people also injured. The Donetsk region has continued to face shelling by Russian troops. Others were wounded in the Kharkiv, Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Russia’s defence minister has said it will focus on nuclear arms infrastructure in 2023, including facilities to accommodate new missile systems. Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the board of the department on Wednesday that it would be a priority for Russia next year. “When preparing the list of major construction facilities for 2023, special attention will be paid to construction in the interests of the strategic nuclear forces,” Shoigu was quoted by RIA news agency as saying. The head of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, Andriy Yermak, spoke to Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday morning. They discussed the US’s support for the Grain from Ukraine scheme, which is running to get grain out of the port of Odesa, and its support for Ukraine over the winter months. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has highlighted Russia’s new foreign agents act in its daily update, which it says will be used to crack down on critics and dissidents. Vladimir Putin has changed the 2012 law so that personal details including the address of designated “foreign agents” can be published, meaning they could become targets of harassment. The change will come into force on Thursday. The European Commission gave an update on Wednesday on its plans to freeze and confiscate Russian assets. Von der Leyen said: “We have blocked €300bn of the Russian Central Bank reserves and we have frozen €19bn of Russian oligarchs’ money. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the live blog for today. Thanks following along. I’ll be back in the morning with more up-to-the-minute news of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) officials found weapons and Russian cash on Wednesday after searching properties in around Kyiv linked to a pro-Russian former politician, the agency said. In a statement, the SBU said its searches of homes and offices belonging to Yevhen Murayev, who it said was “hiding from justice abroad”, and his associates were part of a criminal investigation into treason. Murayev’s political party and a television channel under his control were seen as vehicles for Kremlin interests in Ukraine before Moscow’s invasion, Reuters reported. The party, Nashi, was banned after Russian forces swept into Ukraine. He had promoted views that aligned with Russian narratives on Ukraine, including that the 2014 Maidan protests in Kyiv were a western-backed coup and the Kremlin-fuelled war in eastern Ukraine that followed was an internal conflict. Weeks before Russia’s full-scale attack on Ukraine this year, Britain’s foreign ministry said Russia was considering installing Murayev to lead a new puppet government, a claim denied both by him and by Moscow. The SBU said an independent analysis of Murayev’s public statements “testify to the presence in his actions of signs” of treason. It said the materials seized in Wednesday’s searches would be examined further. Ukraine’s state emergency service has said nine people have been killed in fires in the past 24 hours after breaking safety rules in an attempt to heat their homes after Russian attacks on power facilities. The number of fires had risen, it said, with Ukrainians increasingly resorting to using emergency generators, candles and gas cylinders in their homes because of power outages, Reuters reported. “Only in the last day there were 131 fires in Ukraine, 106 of them in the residential sector. Nine people died, eight were injured,” the emergency service said. “Generators on balconies, gas cylinders in apartments, lit candles ... Due to violations of fire safety rules, the use of uncertified products for heating and cooking, incidents of fires and explosions in high-rise and private buildings have become more frequent.” The service urged Ukrainians to take more care in their homes and to explain fire risks to children. The UK has announced a fresh round of sanctions against 22 Russians, including those the Foreign Office says were involved in enlisting criminals to fight in Ukraine. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said on Wednesday his department would target a new set of officials, including Denis Manturov, the deputy prime minister, who is responsible for troop equipment supplies. The Russian officials join more than 1,000 others, including 120 the UK has sanctioned since the invasion of Ukraine in February, including Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian prime minister, and Roman Abramovich, the former owner of Chelsea FC. Cleverly said: “The Russian regime’s decision to partially mobilise Russian citizens was a desperate attempt to overwhelm the valiant Ukrainians defending their territory. It has failed. “Today we have sanctioned individuals who have enforced this conscription, sending thousands of Russian citizens to fight in Putin’s illegal and abhorrent war. “The UK will continue to use both sanctions and military aid to support Ukraine in the defence of their independence.” Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has arrived in Kyiv for a three-day visit to show solidarity with the people and churches of Ukraine. Welby will meet leaders of Ukraine’s churches, refugees and internally displaced people. Arriving in Kyiv on Wednesday, Welby said: “The people of Ukraine have shown extraordinary courage in the face of Russia’s illegal, unjust and brutal invasion. This visit is about showing solidarity with them as they face a profoundly difficult winter. “I look forward to meeting with church leaders and local Christians in Kyiv, and learning how we can continue to support them amid the ongoing devastation, loss and destruction of this war. “I urge Christians in the Church of England and around the world to keep praying for the people of Ukraine in this Advent season – along with all people caught up in conflicts around the world – and offering our solidarity and support in every way we can.” The president of the European Commission appears to have caused some confusion on Wednesday in her speech on Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen said an estimated 100,000 Ukrainian military personnel had died as well as 20,000 civilians. Ukraine has been tight-lipped about its wartime military losses, saying figures would give Russia an advantage. The commission later apologised, saying the speech was inaccurate and the estimate had included injured as well as dead. The sentence was then removed from the transcript on the commission’s website and edited from the video of her speech. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s general staff told Ukrainian journalists that it would not comment on the figure quoted but vowed that Russia would face punishment for its actions in Ukraine. Von der Leyen also said the EU would set up a special tribunal for the “crime of aggression” – in other words Russia’s military transgressing Ukraine’s borders. The statement appears to have caught Ukraine off guard. Oleh Gavrysh, a spokesperson of Andriy Smyrnov, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, who is leading the effort to establish a tribunal, said they were “exploring” what Von der Leyen had said and needed to confirm if this tribunal would include removing the immunity of key Russian leaders, including the Russian president Vladimir Putin. If it did, said Gavrysh, then Ukraine would accept her proposal. A special tribunal for the crime of aggression has been the subject of a months-long campaign by Kyiv. It would lead to Russia’s top figures prosecuted, including Putin and the foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, and would require little investigation as the fact that the crime of aggression was committed was something overwhelmingly accepted by the UN general assembly. But states will need to back the tribunal individually as they will be responsible for enforcing any sentencing of Russia’s leaders as international criminals (even if in absentia). The European Commission president has proposed a special tribunal to investigate and prosecute Russia’s crime of aggression against Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen also wants to use the proceeds of Russian funds that have been frozen under western sanctions to aid Ukraine (see 8.19 GMT). Behind each proposal, questions remain. On the special tribunal, she said: … while continuing to support the international criminal court, we are proposing to set up a specialised court, backed by the United Nations, to investigate and prosecute Russia’s crime of aggression. The EU wants a specialised court, because Russia has not signed the ICC treaty, leaving the court without jurisdiction over “crimes of aggression”. The ICC can only judge specific war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine. EU officials are certain that Russia, a permanent member of the UN security council, will block any move to create a specialised court. Nevertheless they intend to table a resolution to the security council and when it is shot down, seek support from the general assembly of all UN members. One EU official said they expected “good enough numbers” to support the proposal. Uncertainties also surround the proposed money for Ukraine. Von der Leyen said: We have blocked €300bn of the Russian Central Bank reserves and we have frozen €19bn of Russian oligarchs’ money. In the short term, we could create, with our partners, a structure to manage these funds and invest them. We would then use the proceeds for Ukraine. But officials do not yet know much the proceeds could be worth. For legal reasons they believe they can use only the proceeds generated from managing the assets to aid Ukraine, rather than the assets themselves. Eventually the funds would have to be returned to their owners, although the commission proposes to offset the Russian central bank’s €300bn against any future reparations to Ukraine, made as the result of a peace agreement. But buy-in from other western allies is not yet clear. Both ideas will be presented to a G7 taskforce next month. Some more on that blast at the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid, Spain, now from the Reuters news agency. It reports: A security officer at Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid was injured when he opened a letter bomb addressed to the ambassador on Wednesday, and Kyiv ordered a bolstering of security at all its representative offices abroad. The security officer suffered light injuries and went under his own steam to hospital for treatment, Spanish government official Mercedes Gonzalez told broadcaster Telemadrid. In the wake of the incident, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba ordered all Kyiv’s embassies abroad to “urgently” strengthen security, a ministry spokesperson said. The minister also urged Spain to “take urgent measures to investigate the attack”, the spokesperson added. The perpetrators, he added, “will not succeed in intimidating Ukrainian diplomats or stopping their daily work on strengthening Ukraine and countering Russian aggression”. Russia invaded Ukraine nine months ago. The letter, which arrived by ordinary mail and was not scanned, caused “a very small wound on the ring finger of the right hand” of the employee after he opened it in the garden of the embassy, Gonzalez said. It was addressed to ambassador Serhii Pohoreltsev, she said. Detectives were probing the incident, aided by forensic and intelligence investigators, Spanish police said. Spain’s High Court will lead the investigation. An officer at the embassy declined to comment. Correos, the Spanish state-run postal company, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the origin of the letter. The residential area surrounding the embassy in northwestern Madrid was cordoned off and a bomb disposal unit was deployed to the scene. Reuters footage showed scores of police officers, armed with assault rifles and blocking roads with vans, in the neighbourhood around the embassy. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he did not believe Russian president Vladimir Putin will use nuclear weapons. He made the comment while speaking by video link at the New York Times ‘DealBook’ summit in New York city. It comes as Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said it was vital to avoid any kind of military confrontation between nuclear powers, even if it only involved conventional weapons, the TASS news agency reported. Lavrov also said the West was pushing Ukraine to continue fighting against Russia. “It is necessary to avoid any military clash between nuclear powers, even with the use of conventional weapons. The escalation may become uncontrollable,” TASS quoted Lavrov as saying. Putin has issued a series of thinly veiled nuclear threats during the course of the war in Ukraine, but several top officials have repeatedly denied Moscow plans to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine and have accused the West of upping the nuclear ante. The UK has imposed sanctions on another 22 Russians who it says have been behind the further mobilisation of troops in Ukraine. Among them is the Russian deputy prime minister Denis Manturov, who oversees the Russian weapons industry and is responsible for arming soldiers. Arkady Gostev, the director of the Russian prison service, is also on the list because of his support for the Wagner Group’s recruitment of inmates for the war effort. A total of 10 governors and regional heads have been hit with sanctions, including those in charge of Dagestan, Ingushetia and Kalmykia, from where a number of conscripts have been called up. Another 29 regional governors were already placed under sanctions in July for providing financial support to Russian proxy administrations in Ukraine. Others include Ella Pamfilova and Andrey Burov, who helped organised referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine, which Vladimir Putin used as a basis to annex the regions in September. Those under sanctions are subject to asset freezes, travel bans and transport sanctions. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said: The Russian regime’s decision to partially mobilise Russian citizens was a desperate attempt to overwhelm the valiant Ukrainians defending their territory. It has failed. Today we have sanctioned individuals who have enforced this conscription, sending thousands of Russian citizens to fight in Putin’s illegal and abhorrent war. The UK will continue to use both sanctions and military aid to support Ukraine in the defence of their independence. The full list of those hit with sanctions by the British government can be found here. Nine people have died in fires in Ukraine over the last 24 hours, according to the authorities, as Russian attacks on power infrastructure has caused people to resort to using emergency generators and gas cylinders. Ukraine’s state emergency services said there had been more than 130 fires in the last day. It said eight people had been injured. The blackouts have led to a surge in accidents “due to the violation of fire safety rules”, the service said. The number of fires and explosions in high-rise and private houses has increased, Agency France-Presse reports. In a press conference on Wednesday, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, described Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure as “barbaric”. “Over the past several weeks, Russia has bombed out more than a third of Ukraine’s energy system, plunging millions in the cold,” Blinken said after a meeting with Nato counterparts in Bucharest. As we are less than three weeks from Christmas, the sight of trees being erected in city squares around the world is commonplace. It will be no different in Kyiv despite the ongoing conflict. The city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said a 12-metre artificial tree would go up as a “symbolic Christmas tree of indomitability”. The tree in Sofia Square will be decorated with “energy-saving” garlands that will be powered by a generator, he said in a Telegram post. After Christmas, the generator will be donated to the military. There will also be phone charging points set up nearby. Atop the festive structure will be Ukraine’s coat of arms, and around its base will be flags of countries that have helped Ukraine. Germany has said it will have trained 5,000 Ukrainian soldiers by the summer of 2023. The defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, also told the Berlin security conference that Germany understood the importance of supplying weapons to Ukraine, and working with others to support the government in Kyiv. A teenager was killed in Russian shelling of a hospital in the northern Ukrainian region of Sumy, a presidential aide has said. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian forces had pounded the region with artillery and mortar bombs over the past 24 hours. Russian forces pulled back from northern Ukraine weeks after its invasion but have continued shelling some areas, Ukrainian officials have said. Spanish police said an employee at the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid was injured on Wednesday in an explosion that occurred while he was handling a letter. The staff member received light injuries and went to hospital under his own steam, police said. Detectives are investigating the incident, aided by forensic and intelligence investigators. Ukraine’s embassy to Spain was not immediately reachable, Reuters reported. The area surrounding the embassy has been cordoned off, the state broadcaster TVE reported. Vladimir Putin has focused his “fire and ire” on Ukraine’s civilian population, bombing more than a third of Ukraine’s energy system – water and electricity supply – in a strategy that will not work, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Wednesday. “These are President Putin’s new targets. He’s hitting them hard,” Blinken said after a Nato meeting in Bucharest. “His strategy has not, and will not, work.” Ukraine needs the US made Patriot missile defence systems to protect its civilian infrastructure, under heavy attack by Russia, foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said, adding he would be working with the German government on this issue. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato on Tuesday against providing Ukraine with Patriot systems, Reuters reported. Kuleba also said Ukraine would eventually become a member of Nato, saying that didn’t mean nothing could be done now in that respect. “The discussions on Ukraine’s Nato application should begin,” he said during a press conference after a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Bucharest. The city council in the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa has voted to remove and relocate a monument to Empress Catherine the Great of Russia that has been daubed with red paint at least twice. The statue to the city’s founder, which towers over a central square, has been vandalised repeatedly since the invasion of Ukraine that has prompted many Ukrainians to reject their country’s historical ties to Moscow, Reuters reported. The city council announced the decision to remove the statue on its website on Wednesday. Local lawmakers had also voted to remove and relocate a monument to an 18th-century Russian general, Alexander Suvorov. A slim majority of Odesa residents had already voted – in an online poll organised by city authorities – to remove the statue to Catherine the Great, who was empress of Russia from 1762 to 1796. Several petitions had also been submitted to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy calling for the statue to be removed, but only local authorities were legally empowered to make the decision. One person was killed and another wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Wednesday, the regional governor said. Yaroslav Yanushevych wrote on the Telegram messaging app that several residential buildings and medical facilities had been damaged in the city, which was liberated this month after months of Russian occupation. The head of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, discussed nuclear issues and Ukraine in a meeting this month with the CIA director, William Burns, the RIA news agency reported. Elizabeth Rood, the charge d’affaires at the US embassy in Moscow, previously told RIA that Burns “did not negotiate anything and he did not discuss a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine”. Alexei Kudrin has become the latest high-profile Russian government official to leave their post since the invasion. Kudrin, who was head of the audit committee and previously served as finance minister and deputy prime minister, is expected to take up a role at a Russian tech firm Yandex. Yandex has announced a review of its governance. The time in Kyiv is 1.20pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s top stories so far: The EU will try to set up a court, backed by the UN, to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine, according to the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen. In a video statement, she said: “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought death, devastation and unspeakable suffering. We all remember the horrors of Bucha. It is estimated that more than 20,000 civilians and more than 100,000 Ukrainian military officers have been killed so far.” Moscow has promoted the chief engineer of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Yuriy Chernichuk, to become its head, according to Russia’s nuclear agency Rosenergoatom. The position has been vacant since October, when Kyiv says the plant’s boss Ihor Murashov was abducted by Russian authorities. Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said on Telegram early on Wednesday morning that Russian strikes in the region overnight hit a gas distribution point, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no injuries or casualties. Ukraine claims to have killed another 500 Russian soldiers in the last 24 hours, bringing the total who have died in combat since 24 February to about 88,880. The general staff of the armed forces said it had taken out three more tanks and six armoured personnel carriers. Ukrainian forces have downed three Russian reconnaissance drones in the last 24 hours, according to its armed forces. In an early morning bulletin from Ukraine, the spokesperson for the general staff of the armed forces, Alexander Štupun, said Ukraine had been subjected to a number of missile attacks from planes and artillery, including on Kivsharivka in Kharkiv and Sloviansk in Donetsk. Five Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian forces on Tuesday, according to a senior government official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, posted on Telegram that the five were killed in Donetsk, with 15 people also injured. The Donetsk region has continued to face shelling by Russian troops. Others were wounded in the Kharkiv, Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Russia’s defence minister has said it will focus on nuclear arms infrastructure in 2023, including facilities to accommodate new missile systems. Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the board of the department on Wednesday that it would be a priority for Russia next year. “When preparing the list of major construction facilities for 2023, special attention will be paid to construction in the interests of the strategic nuclear forces,” Shoigu was quoted by RIA news agency as saying. The head of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, Andriy Yermak, spoke to Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday morning. They discussed the US’s support for the Grain from Ukraine scheme, which is running to get grain out of the port of Odesa, and its support for Ukraine over the winter months. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has highlighted Russia’s new foreign agents act in its daily update, which it says will be used to crack down on critics and dissidents. Vladimir Putin has changed the 2012 law so that personal details including the address of designated “foreign agents” can be published, meaning they could become targets of harassment. The change will come into force on Thursday. The European Commission gave an update on Wednesday on its plans to freeze and confiscate Russian assets. Von der Leyen said: “We have blocked €300bn of the Russian Central Bank reserves and we have frozen €19bn of Russian oligarchs’ money.” Nato doubled down on Tuesday on its commitment to one day include Ukraine, a pledge that some officials and analysts believe helped prompt Russia’s invasion this year. The world’s largest security alliance also pledged to send more aid to Ukrainian forces locked in battle with Russian troops. Ukraine’s supplies of spare parts for its battered electricity grid are running out amid sustained Russian bombing. European companies are being asked to urgently donate surplus kit to help the country get through the winter. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato against providing Ukraine with Patriot missile defence systems and called the alliance a “criminal entity”. “If, as [Nato secretary general Jens] Stoltenberg hinted, Nato were to supply the Ukrainian fanatics with Patriot systems along with Nato personnel, they would immediately become a legitimate target of our armed forces,” Medvedev wrote on Telegram. Hello, I’m Tom Ambrose, taking over from my colleague Harry Taylor. Moscow has promoted the chief engineer of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Yuriy Chernichuk, to become its head, according to Russia’s nuclear agency Rosenergoatom. The position has been vacant since October, when Kyiv says the plant’s boss Ihor Murashov was abducted by Russian authorities. The nuclear power plant, Europe’s biggest and in the east of Ukraine, has been occupied by Russian forces since March. It has not been producing electricity since September but is still run by its Ukrainian staff to keep it safe. Moscow said in October it was putting the plant under control of Russia’s nuclear authorities, Reuters reports, a move Kyiv says is illegal. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear power operator Energoatom said in May that Russia had forbidden Chernichuk from leaving the city of Enerhodar, where the plant is based, holding him and other staff as “hostages”. The six-reactor plant has since come under repeated shelling, drawing condemnation from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has called for a safety zone around it, a proposal so far resisted by Moscow. Russia and Ukraine each blame the other for the shelling at the plant, located on a Russian-held bank of the Dnipro River across from Ukrainian-held territory. Kyiv also accuses Moscow of hiding military equipment at the plant, which Russia denies. Five Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian forces on Tuesday, according to a senior government official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, posted on Telegram that the five were all killed in Donetsk, with 15 people also injured. The Donetsk region has continued to face shelling by Russian troops. Others were wounded in the Kharkiv, Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Russia’s defence minister has said it will focus on nuclear arms infrastructure in 2023, including facilities to accommodate new missile systems. Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the board of the department on Wednesday that it would be a priority for Russia next year. “When preparing the list of major construction facilities for 2023, special attention will be paid to construction in the interests of the strategic nuclear forces,” Shoigu was quoted by RIA news agency as saying. On Monday, Russia postponed talks with the US on nuclear weapons, saying they would be rescheduled but not giving any reasons for the delay. The Start treaty will expire in 2026. Shiogu said 300,000 reservists, including volunteers, were trained in two months after Vladimir Putin’s partial mobilisation order was given, Russian news agency Tass reports. The defence minister said more than 100 training camps were used in Russia and Belarus. The head of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, Andriy Yermak, spoke to Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Wednesday morning. They discussed the US’s support for the Grain from Ukraine scheme, which is running to get grain out of the port of Odesa, and its support for Ukraine over the winter months. According to the Interfax news agency, a spokesperson said: “Yermak informed the interlocutor about the operational situation at the front, as well as about the possible steps Russia is preparing to continue terror against the civilian population of Ukraine. “The parties discussed providing support to our state to ensure the passage of the winter period.” The UK is to sign a new digital trade agreement with Ukraine that will give the country access to Britain’s financial services industry. Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, will sign the agreement with the UK’s trade secretary, Kemi Badenoch, on Wednesday. Officials say the deal – based on a similar agreement earlier this year between the UK and Singapore – will support digital commerce through the facilitation of cross-border data flows. Digital trade is considered to be particularly important in the current conflict with Russia, PA Media reports, with the fighting and damage to infrastructure making physical trade more difficult. The agreement also allows for greater cooperation between the UK and Ukraine on cybersecurity and emerging technologies. Badenoch said: “The landmark digital trade deal agreed today between our two countries paves the way for a new era of modern trade between us. This agreement will mean our businesses and governments can collaborate even more and ensure Ukrainians have access to essential goods and services [that] digital trade opens up.” The EU will try to set up a court, backed by the UN, to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine, according to the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen. In a video statement, she said: “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought death, devastation and unspeakable suffering. We all remember the horrors of Bucha. It is estimated that more than 20,000 civilians and more than 100,000 Ukrainian military officers have been killed so far. “Russia must pay for its horrific crimes, including for its crime of aggression against a sovereign state. This is why, while continuing to support the international criminal court, we are proposing to set up a specialised court backed by the United Nations to investigate and prosecute Russia’s crime of aggression. “We are ready to start working with the international community to get the broadest international support possible for this specialised court. “Russia must also pay financially for the devastation that it has caused. The damage suffered by Ukraine is estimated at €600bn. Russia and its oligarchs have to compensate Ukraine for its damage and for the costs for rebuilding the country.” She proposes that the EU could seize Russian money in Europe, invest it, and use it to finance the rebuilding (see 8.02am). “Russia’s horrific crimes will not go unpunished,” she said. Russia has denied targeting civilians and said it has not committed war crimes, despite evidence of a massacre in Bucha. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said more than 400 war crimes were committed in Kherson during the occupation of the city. The European Commission gave an update on Wednesday on its plans to freeze and confiscate Russian assets. “We have blocked €300bn of the Russian Central Bank reserves and we have frozen €19bn of Russian oligarchs’ money,” said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU’s executive. She said that in the short term the EU and its partners could manage the funds and invest them. The proceeds would go to Ukraine so that ultimately they would compensate for damage caused to the country, Reuters reports. “We will work on an international agreement with our partners to make this possible. And together, we can find legal ways to get to it,” she said. An interesting story here, as the BBC has been given details of calls made to a hotline set up for Russian soldiers to surrender. The “I Want to Live” scheme was started in September by Ukraine, and gives Russian troops a way to give themselves up to Ukrainian forces. It includes a hotline and a messaging app. Officials in Kyiv have told the BBC they have had 3,500 inquiries from personnel, some on the frontline and some in Russia before deployment, and their families. Svitlana, not her real name, is one of the call handlers who speaks to them. “First of all, we hear a voice, mainly male. It’s often part-desperate, part-frustrated, because they don’t fully understand how the hotline works, or whether it’s just a set up. “There’s also curiosity because many call not to surrender but to find out how they could if needed. It’s different every time.” Recordings provided to the broadcaster include soldiers asking what to do when Ukrainian troops arrive. “Do I drop to my knees, or what? What do I do, how do I surrender?” one asked. Another said: “I am from Moscow. I haven’t received a conscription ticket yet, but there were attempts to give it to me. Do you have any advice as to what I should do? I won’t kill Ukrainians. I would like to save my life.” Ukraine claims to have killed another 500 Russian soldiers in the last 24 hours, bringing the total who have died in combat since 24 February to about 88,880. The general staff of the armed forces said it had taken out three more tanks, and another six armoured personnel carriers. The casualty figures published by Ukraine are disputed by Russia, which says its death toll from the war is much lower. Ukrainian forces have downed three Russian reconnaissance drones in the last 24 hours, according to its armed forces. In an early morning bulletin from Ukraine, the spokesperson for the general staff of the armed forces, Alexander Štupun, said Ukraine had been subjected to a number of missile attacks from planes and artillery, including on Kivsharivka in Kharkiv and Sloviansk in Donetsk. Both are in Ukraine’s east. “The threat of missile strikes by Russian invaders on energy system facilities and critical infrastructure throughout Ukraine remains,” he continued. Štupun said attacks from Russian jets had caused fires in Kizomis, a small town on the outskirts of Kherson near the Dnipro River estuary. Artillery shelling continues on Kherson city itself, according to the update. He added that in response Ukrainian planes had launched 15 strikes on Russian positions and equipment, and two air attacks on anti-aircraft missile systems. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has highlighted Russia’s new foreign agents act in its daily update, which the MoD says will be used to crack down on critics and dissidents. Vladimir Putin has changed the existing 2012 law to mean that the personal details, including the address, of designated “foreign agents” can be published – meaning they could become targets of harassment. It will come into force on Thursday. Previously it was limited to people who the Kremlin alleged had received financial support from abroad. However, it will now extend to those the government perceives as under the “influence or pressure” of foreign actors. The MoD said: “The Kremlin is likely acting pre-emptively to prevent greater domestic dissent as the conflict remains unresolved and increasingly impacts Russians’ everyday lives.” In his late-night update, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wrote on Telegram: “Despite extremely big Russian losses, the occupiers are still trying to advance in the Donetsk region, gain a foothold in the Luhansk region, move in the Kharkiv region, they are planning something in the south. “But we are holding out and – most importantly – do not allow the enemy to fulfil their intentions.” Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said on Telegram early on Wednesday morning that Russian strikes in the region overnight hit a gas distribution point, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no injuries or casualties. “In one of the settlements of the Zaporizhzhia district, a gas distribution point was damaged as a result of a rocket (probably S-300) hit, resulting in a fire. It was quickly eliminated, but three streets remained without gas. Fortunately, people were not hurt,” he wrote. Hi, this is the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan. Oleksandr Starukh, the head of the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said on Telegram a short while ago that Russian strikes overnight hit a gas distribution point, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no injuries or casualties. In his late-night update, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wrote on Telegram: “Despite extremely big Russian losses, the occupiers are still trying to advance in the Donetsk region, gain a foothold in the Luhansk region, move in the Kharkiv region, they are planning something in the south. “But we are holding out and – most importantly – do not allow the enemy to fulfil their intentions.” Meanwhile, Nato leaders will meet for a second day of talks in Romania on Wednesday, after vowing more help for Ukraine to restore power and heat knocked out by strikes as Russia attacks on multiple fronts. Here are the other key recent developments: Nato doubled down on Tuesday on its commitment to one day include Ukraine, a pledge that some officials and analysts believe helped prompt Russia’s invasion this year. The world’s largest security alliance also pledged to send more aid to Ukrainian forces locked in battle with Russian troops. Ukraine’s supplies of spare parts for its battered electricity grid are running out amid sustained Russian bombing. European companies are being asked to urgently donate surplus kit to help the country get through the winter, after the latest step in Russian bombings targeting power plants and substations resulted in power cuts lasting 48 hours or more across the country. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato against providing Ukraine with Patriot missile defence systems and called the alliance a “criminal entity”. “If, as [Nato secretary general Jens] Stoltenberg hinted, Nato were to supply the Ukrainian fanatics with Patriot systems along with Nato personnel, they would immediately become a legitimate target of our armed forces,” Medvedev wrote on Telegram. Ukrainian forces struck a power plant in multiple attacks on Russia’s Kursk region on Tuesday, causing some electricity outages, the local governor said. “In total, there were about 11 launches. A power plant was hit,” Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region, said on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility and made no immediate comment. Ukraine’s state energy operator, Ukrenegro, has said it is still struggling to restore full power nearly a week after Russian strikes damaged energy facilities across the country. The power deficit was running at 30% as of 11am local time on Tuesday, Ukrenegro said in a statement, a slight rise from the previous day. The jailed Belarusian senior opposition leader Maria Kolesnikava has been taken to intensive care in the city of Gomel, according to reports. Belarusian opposition politician Viktor Babariko posted to Telegram that Kolesnikova, one of the most prominent opponents of President Alexander Lukashenko, was taken to hospital on Monday for unknown reasons. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said Moscow had been left with “no other choice” but to cancel nuclear weapons talks with the US, state-run news agencies reported. He said it was unlikely any meeting would take place this year. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, accused the US of “the highest level of toxicity and hostility” and of “a pathological desire to harm our country”. China’s president, Xi Jinping, has said Beijing is ready to “forge a closer partnership” with Moscow to “maintain international energy security”. “China is willing to work with Russia to forge a closer energy partnership, promote clean and green energy development and jointly maintain international energy security and the stability of industry supply chains,” Xi was cited by state-owned broadcaster CCTV as writing. Ukraine has detained a deputy head of newly liberated Kherson’s city council on suspicion of aiding and abetting Russian occupation forces, Ukraine’s state prosecutor has said. The official, who was not named, cooperated with the occupation authorities and helped with the functioning of public services under the Russians, according to the prosecutor. European Union countries are inching towards a deal this week on a price cap on Russian oil, a way to adjust the cap in future, and on linking it to a package of new sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, diplomats said on Tuesday. The deadline for a deal is 5 December because that is when the EU’s own full embargo on purchases of Russian seaborne oil, agreed at the end of May, kicks in. The G7 group has agreed to set up a network to coordinate investigations into war crimes, as part of a push to prosecute suspected atrocities in Ukraine. In a joint declaration, G7 justice ministers said member countries would ensure there is a central national contact point in each state for the prosecution of international crimes. Pope Francis has sparked fury in Russia over an interview in which he suggested that Chechen and Buryat members of its armed forces showed more cruelty in Ukraine than ethnic Russian soldiers. He said soldiers from Buryatia, where Buddhism is a major religion, and the Muslim-majority Chechnya republic, were “the cruellest” while fighting in Ukraine. Germany’s justice minister, Marco Buschmann, said his country contributed to the outbreak of war by “adhering” to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline despite Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. Buschmann also said Russian missile strikes on energy infrastructure constituted a “terrible war crime”, adding that he was “certain that at the end, we will see war crimes cases at the international criminal court against senior Russian leadership too”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/30/ukraine-claims-counteroffensive-south-russia-explained","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-30T07:13:24Z","webTitle":"Ukraine claims counteroffensive in the south – explained ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/30/ukraine-claims-counteroffensive-south-russia-explained","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/30/ukraine-claims-counteroffensive-south-russia-explained","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine claims counteroffensive in the south – explained ","bodyText":"How did Ukrainian officials frame the attack in Kherson? At a briefing reported on Monday afternoon, Nataliya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, said an offensive in Kherson, the only regional capital Russia has been able to secure since the war began, was under way. Her comments came after video circulated that apparently showed a soldier from the Russian-run self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk saying Ukrainian forces had broken through. The Guardian’s Isobel Koshiw in Kyiv reported comments echoing Humenyuk’s last night from Oleksiy Arestovych, a senior adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy himself did not refer to the attack specifically in his nightly address. But the Ukrainian president said: “The occupiers should know: we will oust them to the border. To our border, the line of which has not changed.” Other Ukrainian officials echoed those claims. Sergiy Khlan, a local deputy and adviser to Kherson’s regional governor, said it was “the beginning of the end of the occupation of Kherson region” and “a prepared, well-balanced start of a counteroffensive”. How do they say it has gone so far? Arestovych said Ukrainian troops were attacking Russian defences along the frontline and claimed they had broken through in several places. He also said ferries on the west bank of the Dnieper River, which are being used to supply Russian forces in the territory, were being shelled. The BBC reported officials in Kyiv claiming that US-supplied Himars rocket systems had been used to destroy three bridges across the Dnieper as well as temporary bridges created by Russian forces. The BBC also said a Ukrainian operational group in the region claimed a Russian-backed regiment had left its positions and Russian paratroopers had fled. Ukrainian officials declined to give details of the attack, citing operational security. But their claims could not be independently corroborated. While witnesses reported blasts in the cities of Kherson and Nova Kakhovka, the extent and success of Ukrainian operations are yet to be confirmed. The Financial Times reported remarks from John Kirby, a US national security spokesperson, who said Ukraine’s actions had “already had an impact on Russia’s military capabilities” because Moscow had been forced to divert resources to the region from the east of the country. This at-a-glance piece gives a wider picture of the situation in Ukraine this morning, including news of a team of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors en route to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, where Kyiv claims Russian occupiers are violating nuclear safety protocols. What does Russia say? Russia’s state-owned news agency Ria cited the defence ministry in Moscow as acknowledging that Ukrainian troops attempted an offensive in the southern Mykolaiv and Kherson regions. A senior official in Nova Kakhovka told Ria that civilians had been ordered to take refuge in bomb shelters. The Russian defence ministry said Ukrainian forces had sustained significant casualties and claimed the “enemy’s offensive attempt failed miserably”. The FT reported that Sergei Aksyonov, the Moscow-appointed governor of Crimea, said on Telegram that the claimed counterattack was “the latest fake [news] from Ukrainian propaganda” and said Ukraine’s forces were “taking extremely severe losses”. Again, it is not yet possible to verify these claims, and Russia routinely inflates the scale of Ukrainian losses in its updates. Recently, western and Ukrainian intelligence have noted a buildup of Russian troops and equipment in the region, potentially suggesting Russia was preparing its own offensive. What are the prospects of success? Humenyuk told reporters that Russian forces were strong in the region – and that even though morale was low among their ranks, “it was too early to relax”. In comments on his Telegram account reported by the Guardian’s Samantha Lock on the live blog, Arestovych characterised the action as “a planned slow operation to grind the enemy” and said: “This process will not be very fast, but will end with the installation of the Ukrainian flag over all the settlements of Ukraine.” Ukraine’s ability to conduct its claimed counteroffensive has been greatly enhanced by the provision of weapons by the west, and Russian positions in the region have been under artillery barrage for weeks and cut off from their supply lines. But it is too early to say whether those successes will translate to victory on the ground. A US official quoted by the New York Times said the Pentagon “remained cautious about whether Ukraine’s current military capabilities were sufficient to make significant gains”. Why is an attack in Kherson significant? Kherson has huge symbolic and practical significance as the only regional capital to have been secured by the Russian invaders – and if Ukraine can entirely cut off enemy forces on the western bank of the Dnieper, they will have a realistic prospect of success. That would disrupt Russian attempts to proceed with a sham referendum designed to give credibility to Moscow’s claims that residents of Kherson and other parts of southern Ukraine wish to be part of Russia. For more on how that prospect is viewed by citizens in Kherson, read this piece by Shaun Walker and Pjotr Sauer from earlier this month, in which one interviewee says: “No one thought about [a referendum] before the war. Now it will be a referendum at gunpoint.” There has been a growing sense that if Kyiv is to retake the city, it must do so as a matter of urgency: changing weather – including rain that will make the countryside muddy and far harder for ground troops to traverse – in the autumn means there is a powerful incentive to launch a counteroffensive now. There are also fears European support could fade as the impact of high energy prices begins to take hold. Success in any operation to take Kherson could break a long period of deadlock – and persuade western allies that it is worth continuing to provide the arms and funding that Ukraine needs. But if an attack fails, Ukrainian morale would be undermined, and Russia’s plans to bring the south of the country under its full control would be reinforced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/dec/14/ministers-would-be-wise-to-play-for-time-before-ordering-sizewell-c","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-12-14T19:56:05Z","webTitle":"Ministers would be wise to play for time before ordering Sizewell C | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/dec/14/ministers-would-be-wise-to-play-for-time-before-ordering-sizewell-c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/dec/14/ministers-would-be-wise-to-play-for-time-before-ordering-sizewell-c","fields":{"headline":"Ministers would be wise to play for time before ordering Sizewell C","bodyText":"This is the government’s problem as it reopens talks on a proposed nuclear power station at Sizewell C in Suffolk: it is contemplating ordering a replica of Hinkley Point C before the Somerset original has produced a single megawatt of electricity. That is not a small point. Developer EDF’s pre-Hinkley version of its European pressurised reactor at Flamanville in Normandy is about a decade behind schedule. What’s more, EDF wants UK taxpayers or bill payers to bear more of the construction risks at Sizewell, a less-than-compelling offer when you remember that Flamanville is also €9bn (£8.2bn) over budget. Progress with construction at Hinkley is said to be smoother, even if costs have gone up, but one would prefer to see the thing humming before committing another £20bn. Actual production of electricity won’t happen at Hinkley until 2025 at the earliest and, arguably, the government needs to get a move on with meeting its low-carbon ambitions well before then – or so, the nuclear lobby will inevitably say. Ministers, though, should resist the temptation to make a quick decision. Remember the advice of the Infrastructure Commission in its last assessment of energy needs: a renewables-based system is the best bet and only one new big nuclear plant needs to be commissioned before 2025. That would seem to create space to string out the negotiations with EDF; however hard the French state-backed firm may press for speed. A slow pace would also allow Rolls-Royce to work on its plans for small modular reactors. If these smaller-scale units can turned into a financially competitive alternative to mega-plants of the Hinkley/Sizewell variety, the nuclear outlook would change radically. The Sizewell proposal comes with other problems, including local opposition, the suitability of the site and the still-unclear status of co-financing by China (surely impossible in the current political climate). In short, Sizewell should be viewed only as a last resort. AstraZeneca boss’s record suggests Alexion takeover will pay off The market has spoken on AstraZeneca’s plan to pay $39bn (£29bn) to buy the US biotech group Alexion Pharmaceuticals and, well, it’s not clear what it thinks. A 5.7% fall in AstraZeneca’s share price obviously doesn’t signal wild enthusiasm. But nor can one say it implies a definitive thumbs-down: in a deal of this size, and with two-thirds of the purchase price being paid in shares, an initial wobble is not unusual. There is work for the chief executive, Pascal Soriot, to do to convince his shareholders, one might say. The problem doesn’t seem to be the financial aspects of the deal, where Soriot could point to Alexion’s cash-generative qualities and the likelihood of a short-term boost to AstraZeneca’s earnings, despite offering a 45% takeover premium. Rather, the challenge is explaining the strategic thinking. Alexion is big in rare diseases, which AstraZeneca’s isn’t. On that score, though, Soriot can do little more than ask investors to accept his assessment that Alexion’s pipeline of new molecules is promising and that access to new technology could be useful within AstraZeneca’s existing immunology portfolio. That’s a “trust me” argument, which is not ideal. But AstraZeneca has been transformed on Soriot’s watch by backing the right science at the right moment, sometimes striking out in new directions. The long-term perspective on the share price is a trebling since 2012. That’s a very decent record: one suspects investors will come round in the end. BDO at least did its U-turn on furlough money quickly The 260 partners of BDO seem to have grasped that, if you’re going to perform an embarrassing U-turn, do so quickly. Last Thursday, they said they’d weighed the “moral debate” and thought it fine to keep £4m-worth of furlough receipts from the government – yes, even as they paid themselves an average of £518,000 per head, a grand total of £137m. At the weekend, they capitulated, “recognising the public mood”, and said they’ll send a cheque to HM Revenue &amp; Customs pronto. At a push, one might say it is easier for the directors of Tesco et al to return money to the Treasury, since they’re handling shareholders’ money, rather than their own. But let’s not make excuses for BDO’s original stupidity. The government, when dishing out contracts for public sector work, is supposed to be trying to encourage second-tier firms such as BDO. High-profile own goals just give ministers an excuse to play safe and prefer the big four monopolists. • This article was amended on 15 December 2020.

Here’s where things stand: Satellite imagery has emerged of the recently discovered mass grave site near Izium. The images, released by Maxar Technologies, show the “Forest Cemetery” entrance from March to August of this year. Activists from environmental group Greenpeace on Saturday blocked a shipment of Russian gas from unloading at a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in northern Finland, the terminal owner and Greenpeace said. The activists demanded Helsinki stop importing Russian gas after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. The EU presidency on Saturday called for the establishment of an international tribunal for war crimes after new mass graves were found in Ukraine. “In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent,” said Jan Lipavsky, foreign minister of the Czech Republic which holds the European Union’s rotating presidency. The Security Service of Ukraine said that Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSU) officers tortured residents in Kupiansk, a city in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. The Kyiv Independent reports that when FSU officers were in then-occupied Kupiansk, they tortured residents and threatened to send them to minefields and kill their families. Satellite imagery has emerged of the recently discovered mass grave site near Izium. The images, released by Maxar Technologies, show the “Forest Cemetery” entrance from March to August of this year. Hundreds of hastily buried bodies were discovered two days ago, including those of children and Ukrainian soldiers, after Izium was liberated from Russian forces. Activists from the environmental group Greenpeace on Saturday blocked a shipment of Russian gas from unloading at a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in northern Finland, the terminal owner and Greenpeace said. The activists demanded Helsinki stop importing Russian gas after Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. “The shipment contained liquefied natural gas coming from Russia,” Olga Vaisanen, a spokesperson for Gasum, the Finnish company that imported the blocked gas, told Agence France-Presse. Mika Kolehmainen, the director for the terminal’s operator, Manga LNG, said the action took place around 7am (0400 GMT) at Tornio port. The operator said the activists climbed the loading arms that allow for the transfer of material and there were two Greenpeace ships outside the terminal’s area, close to the Swedish border. “It’s completely unacceptable that Russian gas is still allowed to flow in Finland, more than six months after Putin launched his invasion,” a Greenpeace activist, Olli Tiainen, said in a statement. “The Finnish government and Prime Minister Sanna Marin must ban all fossil fuel imports from Russia immediately,” he added. There are currently no EU or Swedish sanctions on gas imports from Russia, only on oil and coal. In May, Russia cut gas deliveries by pipeline to Finland, claiming there were issues with payments, but deliveries by sea continue. The EU presidency on Saturday called for the establishment of an international tribunal for war crimes after new mass graves were found in Ukraine. In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent,” said Jan Lipavský, foreign minister of the Czech Republic, which holds the European Union’s rotating presidency. “We must not overlook it. We stand for the punishment of all war criminals,” he said on Twitter. “I call for the speedy establishment of a special international tribunal that will prosecute the crime of aggression.” The appeal follows the discovery by Ukrainian authorities of around 450 graves outside the formerly Russian-occupied city of Izium, with most of the bodies showing signs of torture. Among the bodies that were exhumed today, 99 percent showed signs of violent death,” Oleg Synegubov, head of Kharkiv regional administration, said. “There are several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one person is buried with a rope around his neck,” he added. The Security Service of Ukraine said that Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSU) officers tortured residents in Kupiansk, a city in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. The Kyiv Independent reports that when FSU officers were in then-occupied Kupiansk, they tortured residents and threatened to send them to minefields and kill their families. For 40 minutes, they had been using a stun gun on me, then they shot at me with either an airgun or a gas gun, I don’t know – I was in a bag,” the Kyiv Independent reported one victim saying. Hi everyone, I’m Maya Yang and I’ll be taking over the blog next with the latest updates. Stay tuned. Hundreds of people gathered in Kyiv to say farewell to beloved Ukrainian ballet dancer Oleksandr Shapoval, who was killed in fighting in eastern Ukraine. Some dropped to their knees and others clapped as soldiers carried his casket draped in a Ukrainian flag into the National Kyiv Opera. Relatives, colleagues, soldiers and fans came holding flowers walking past photos of the artist on stage and on the frontlines, AFP reports. Shapoval’s two teenage daughters were in the crowd. Shapoval, 47, had been a ballet dancer with the Kyiv Opera since 1994. He retired and started teaching dance in 2021, before volunteering to help defend his country on 25 February, the day after Russia’s invasion. After Russian troops withdrew from Kyiv, Shapoval fought in the eastern industrial Donbas region. He died in mortar shelling near Mayorsk, in the Donetsk region, on 12 September. Ukrainian authorities exhumed more corpses from a burial site by a cemetery in the town of Izium where officials say hundreds are buried in territory recaptured from Russian forces. Up to 30 emergency service officers carefully dug up bodies at the wooded burial site in Izium using shovels. Police experts and investigators documented the findings on camera and inspected the bodies. Some bodies found so far have been of Ukrainian soldiers while others were civilians, Reuters reports. Some more details on the situation at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, from Reuters. Even though the six reactors have been shut down, the fuel in them still needs cooling to avoid a potentially catastrophic meltdown. That means the plant needs electricity to pump water through the core of the reactors. The power supply at Zaporizhzhia has been a source of major concern after the last main line went down and then three backup lines that can connect it to a nearby coal-fired power plant were also disconnected. That prompted the plant to go into so-called “island mode” where its last operating reactor provided it with power, though that mode is not sustainable. A backup power line was reconnected a week ago, enabling that reactor to shut down, too. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling at the site of Zaporizhzhia that has damaged buildings and caused the disconnection of power lines. One of the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant’s four main power lines has been repaired and has resumed supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid two weeks after it went down, the UN nuclear watchdog said. “With the main line’s reconnection yesterday afternoon, the three backup power lines are again being held in reserve,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said. “The three other main external 750kv (kilovolt) power lines that were lost earlier during the conflict remain down.” It is just after 6pm in Kyiv. Here is what you might have missed: The Czech Republic, who currently hold the EU presidency, have called for a “special international tribunal” after a mass grave was discovered in Izium, a town in north-eastern Ukraine. More than 440 bodies have been discovered by Ukrainian officials, with some found with their hands tied behind their backs. In a series of tweets on Saturday, Jan Lipavský, the Czech Republic’s minister of foreign affairs said: “Russia left behind mass graves of hundreds of shot and tortured people in the Izyum area. In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent. We must not overlook it. We stand for the punishment of all war criminals. #StandwithUkraine. I call for the speedy establishment of a special international tribunal that will prosecute the crime of aggression.” Russia is likely to stubbornly defend the Luhansk oblast in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region amid Kyiv’s counteroffensive, but it is unclear if Moscow’s forces have “sufficient reserves or adequate morale” to withstand another concerted Ukrainian assault, the UK Ministry of Defence says. Its latest intelligence briefing says: “Any substantial loss of territory in Luhansk will unambiguously undermine Russia’s strategy.” The assessment comes after Ukrainian forces recently recaptured more than 6,000 sq km of territory including the city of Izium, long regarded as the gateway to the Donbas. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, has reported today that two civilians were killed on Friday after Russian shelling in the cities of Bakhmut and Sviatohirsk. In an update on the operational situation, Kyrylenklo added that overnight in the region “passed relatively calmly” and there was only “isolated” shelling on the front line. The governor of Kharkiv oblast, Oleh Synyehubov, has said an 11-year-old girl was killed in a Russian rocket attack in the city of Chuhuiv, in the eastern Ukrainian region. Synyehubov said the rockets also caused damage to “critical infrastructure, the private sector, an enterprise, and a gas station”. Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine despite Kyiv’s latest counteroffensive and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces target facilities in Russia. Associated Press reported that the Russian president said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. Speaking to reporters on Friday after attending a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Putin said: “We aren’t in a rush.” Joe Biden has warned Vladimir Putin not to use chemical or tactical nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine. The US president was asked in an interview with CBS News what he would say to Putin if he was considering using the weapons. Biden said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II.” Ukraine’s foreign minister has renewed criticism of Germany for failing to send tanks to help fight Russian forces, saying the new weapons pledged by Berlin were “not what we need most”. Berlin announced on Thursday it would send Kyiv more multiple rocket launchers and “Dingo” armoured troop-carriers as Ukraine’s troops carry out a counteroffensive against Moscow’s forces. But Agence France-Presse reported the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, as saying Germany’s decisions were a “mystery” and that there was a “weapon wall” in Berlin that the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, had to tear down. Mexico will present a peace plan for Ukraine to the United Nations general assembly next week, president Andrés Manuel López Obrador says. Agence France-Presse reports that the proposal is for Pope Francis, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to form a dialogue and peace committee. United Nations member states have voted to make an exception to allow Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address next week’s general assembly by video, despite Russian opposition. Of the 193 member states, 101 voted on Friday in favour of allowing the Ukrainian president to “present a pre-recorded statement” instead of in-person as usually required. Seven members voted against the proposal, including Russia. Nineteen states abstained. Virtually all the exhumed bodies in Izium had signs of violent death, Ukraine’s regional administration chief said of the mass burial site discovered after Kyiv’s forces recaptured the east Ukrainian town. Exhumers had uncovered several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one “with a rope around his neck”, Oleg Synegubov, head of Kharkiv regional administration, said on Friday. “Among the bodies that were exhumed today, 99% showed signs of violent death,” he said on social media. The European Union was “deeply shocked” at the mass graves discovered by Ukrainian officials in Izium, said the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell. “We condemn these atrocities in the strongest possible terms.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, also condemned what he described as the “atrocities” committed in Izium, joining growing outrage in western countries over the burial site. Ukrainian armed forces have hit four areas held by Russian troops, according to the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces. The military also targeted an unloading station, it said, in turn preventing Russian forces from deploying additional reserves. Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out targeted strikes in the cities of Kherson and Luhansk against top local officials who have been collaborating with Moscow. At least five Himars missiles crashed into the central administration building in Kherson, which Russian troops have occupied since March after arriving from Crimea. Video from the scene showed smoke pouring out of the complex. In the eastern city of Luhansk, a pro-Russian prosecutor died with his deputy when their office was blown up. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s senior adviser, Mikhailo Podolyak, said Ukraine was not behind the blast. Further south, the Russian-backed separatist authority in Berdiansk also blamed Kyiv for the “double murder” of a deputy head of the military civil administration and his wife, who headed the city’s territorial election commission for the referendum. The United States department of defence has announced it is providing an additional $600m in military assistance to Ukraine to meet the country’s “critical security and defence needs”. In total, the Biden administration has committed about $15.8bn in security aid to Ukraine – $15.1bn since the beginning of Russia’s invasion in February. The Czech Republic, who currently hold the EU presidency, have called for a “special international tribunal” after a mass grave was discovered in Izium, a town in north-eastern Ukraine. More than 440 bodies have been discovered by Ukrainian officials, with some found with their hands tied behind their backs. Volodymyr Zelenskiy invoked the names of other Ukrainian cities where authorities said retreating Russian troops left behind mass graves of civilians, Associated Press reported. “Bucha, Mariupol, now, unfortunately, Izium,” Ukraine’s president said. “Russia leaves death everywhere. And it must be held accountable for it.” In a series of tweets on Saturday, Jan Lipavský, the Czech Republic’s minister of foreign affairs said: Russia left behind mass graves of hundreds of shot and tortured people in the Izyum area. In the 21st century, such attacks against the civilian population are unthinkable and abhorrent. We must not overlook it. We stand for the punishment of all war criminals. #StandwithUkraine I call for the speedy establishment of a special international tribunal that will prosecute the crime of aggression. One person was killed and two more injured today after Ukrainian shelling of a village in Russia. The alleged attack occurred in the city of Belgorod, not far from the border with Ukraine, the TASS news agency cited local authorities as saying. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports. An honour guard fired a three-gun salute toward cloudy skies as friends and comrades-in-arms gathered in Kyiv to bid farewell to a Russian woman who was killed while fighting on Ukraine’s side in the war with her native country, Associated Press reports. Olga Simonova, 34, was remembered for her courage and kindness at a funeral in the Ukrainian capital on Friday. Simonova’s coffin was draped in the blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag, with a cuddly toy lion on top. Her nom de guerre was “Simba”, the name of the main character in the Disney cartoon The Lion King. Born in the Russian city of Chelyabinsk, Simonova said she started feeling uncomfortable about her native country after reading about Russia’s war in Chechnya and its actions in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, and Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Filled with doubts that she “would ever be able to raise the flag of my country, my homeland” again, Simonova travelled to Ukraine to join the conflict in the Donbas on the Ukrainian side, first as a volunteer fighter, then as a paramedic and ultimately as an enlisted member of the armed forces. Friends and colleagues said Simonova, who was unmarried and had no children, had recently redeployed from the east to the southern Kherson region, where Ukraine has launched a counteroffensive against Russian forces. They said she died on 13 September, after her vehicle hit a landmine. The governor of Kharkiv oblast, Oleh Synyehubov, has said an 11-year-old girl was killed in a Russian rocket attack in the city of Chuhuiv, in the eastern Ukrainian region. Synyehubov said the rockets also caused damage to “critical infrastructure, the private sector, an enterprise, and a gas station”. He said on Telegram: An innocent child died from Russian terror. Unfortunately, the 11-year-old girl, who was hospitalised in Chuguyev, died from her injuries. Another woman was injured after the attacks on Chuguiev; the condition of the victim is average. The report could not be independently verified. Ukrainian forces have continued to cross the key Oskil River in the Kharkiv region as they try to press on in a counteroffensive targeting Russian-occupied territory, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. The institute said in today’s report that satellite imagery it examined suggested that Ukrainian forces have crossed over to the east bank of the Oskil in Kupiansk, placing artillery there. The river, which flows south from Russia into Ukraine, had been a natural break in the newly emerged frontlines since Ukraine launched its push about a week ago, reports Associated Press. The institute said: Russian forces are likely too weak to prevent further Ukrainian advances along the entire Oskil River if Ukrainian forces choose to resume offensive operations. President Zelenskiy’s senior adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, has responded to reports that Mexico will present a peace plan for Ukraine to the United Nations general assembly next week. Directing his tweet at Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Podolyak said: “Peacemakers” who use war as a topic for their own PR are causing only surprise. @lopezobrador_, is your plan to keep millions under occupation, increase the number of mass burials and give Russia time to renew reserves before the next offensive? Then your “plan” is a plan. Agence France-Presse reports that the proposal to be put forward by Mexico is for Pope Francis, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to form a dialogue and peace committee. Russia’s defence ministry today said that its forces have launched strikes on several parts of Ukraine. It also accused Kyiv of carrying out shelling near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Reuters reports. Russian forces conducted their strikes in the Kherson, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Donetsk regions, according to the ministry. It said that Ukrainian forces had carried out an unsuccessful offensive near Pravdyne in Kherson. The radiation situation at Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, remains normal, according to the ministry. It said two incidents of Ukrainian shelling were recorded near the plant on Saturday. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry denied that Ukrainian forces had carried out shelling near the facility. Both Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of shelling the nuclear power plant. The UN International Atomic Energy Agency passed a resolution on Thursday demanding that Russia end its occupation of the plant. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, has reported today that two civilians were killed on Friday after Russian shelling in the cities of Bakhmut and Sviatohirsk. In an update on the operational situation, Kyrylenklo added that overnight in the region “passed relatively calmly” and there was only “isolated” shelling on the front line. On the Telegram, he said: On September 16, the Russians killed 2 civilians of Donetsk region: in Sviatohirsk and Bakhmut. Another 11 people were injured. Currently, it is impossible to establish the exact number of victims in Mariupol and Volnovas. It was not possible to independently verify the report. Our report on US president, Joe Biden’s, first meeting with the family members of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan: Joe Biden, met with family members of WNBA star Brittney Griner and another American detained in Russia, Paul Whelan, on Friday, the first face-to-face encounter that the president has had with the relatives. In a statement after the meetings, which were held separately, White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said Biden stressed to the families his “continued commitment to working through all available avenues to bring Brittney and Paul home safely”. “He asked after the well-being of Elizabeth and Cherelle and their respective families during this painful time,” Jean-Pierre said. “The president appreciated the opportunity to learn more about Brittney and Paul from those who love them most, and acknowledged that every minute they are being held is a minute too long.” Read more: Joe Biden meets with families of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan It is just after 1pm in Kyiv. This is what you might have missed: Russia is likely to stubbornly defend the Luhansk oblast in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region amid Kyiv’s counteroffensive, but it is unclear if Moscow’s forces have “sufficient reserves or adequate morale” to withstand another concerted Ukrainian assault, the UK Ministry of Defence says. Its latest intelligence briefing says: “Any substantial loss of territory in Luhansk will unambiguously undermine Russia’s strategy.” The assessment comes after Ukrainian forces recently recaptured more than 6,000 sq km of territory including the city of Izium, long regarded as the gateway to the Donbas. Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine despite Kyiv’s latest counteroffensive and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces target facilities in Russia. Associated Press reported that the Russian president said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. Speaking to reporters on Friday after attending a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Putin said: “We aren’t in a rush.” Joe Biden has warned Vladimir Putin not to use chemical or tactical nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine. The US president was asked in an interview with CBS News what he would say to Putin if he was considering using the weapons. Biden said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II.” Ukraine’s foreign minister has renewed criticism of Germany for failing to send tanks to help fight Russian forces, saying the new weapons pledged by Berlin were “not what we need most”. Berlin announced on Thursday it would send Kyiv more multiple rocket launchers and “Dingo” armoured troop-carriers as Ukraine’s troops carry out a counteroffensive against Moscow’s forces. But Agence France-Presse reported the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, as saying Germany’s decisions were a “mystery” and that there was a “weapon wall” in Berlin that the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, had to tear down. Mexico will present a peace plan for Ukraine to the United Nations general assembly next week, president Andrés Manuel López Obrador says. Agence France-Presse reports that the proposal is for Pope Francis, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to form a dialogue and peace committee. United Nations member states have voted to make an exception to allow Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address next week’s general assembly by video, despite Russian opposition. Of the 193 member states, 101 voted on Friday in favour of allowing the Ukrainian president to “present a pre-recorded statement” instead of in-person as usually required. Seven members voted against the proposal, including Russia. Nineteen states abstained. Virtually all the exhumed bodies in Izium had signs of violent death, Ukraine’s regional administration chief said of the mass burial site discovered after Kyiv’s forces recaptured the east Ukrainian town. Exhumers had uncovered several bodies with their hands tied behind their backs, and one “with a rope around his neck”, Oleg Synegubov, head of Kharkiv regional administration, said on Friday. “Among the bodies that were exhumed today, 99% showed signs of violent death,” he said on social media. The European Union was “deeply shocked” at the mass graves discovered by Ukrainian officials in Izium, said the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell. “We condemn these atrocities in the strongest possible terms.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, also condemned what he described as the “atrocities” committed in Izium, joining growing outrage in western countries over the burial site. Ukrainian armed forces have hit four areas held by Russian troops, according to the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces. The military also targeted an unloading station, it said, in turn preventing Russian forces from deploying additional reserves. Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out targeted strikes in the cities of Kherson and Luhansk against top local officials who have been collaborating with Moscow. At least five Himars missiles crashed into the central administration building in Kherson, which Russian troops have occupied since March after arriving from Crimea. Video from the scene showed smoke pouring out of the complex. In the eastern city of Luhansk, a pro-Russian prosecutor died with his deputy when their office was blown up. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s senior adviser, Mikhailo Podolyak, said Ukraine was not behind the blast. Further south, the Russian-backed separatist authority in Berdiansk also blamed Kyiv for the “double murder” of a deputy head of the military civil administration and his wife, who headed the city’s territorial election commission for the referendum. In the southern oblast of Zaporizhzhia there were also reports on Friday of a “powerful explosion” in the Russian-occupied Melitopol, said Ivan Fedorov, mayor of Melitopol. “I hope the Russian fascists have suffered losses, among their personnel and equipment,” he said. “Awaiting good news from the armed forces of Ukraine.” The United States department of defence has announced it is providing an additional $600m in military assistance to Ukraine to meet the country’s “critical security and defence needs”. In total, the Biden administration has committed about $15.8bn in security aid to Ukraine – $15.1bn since the beginning of Russia’s invasion in February. Switzerland on Friday aligned itself with the European Union in suspending a 2009 agreement easing rules for Russian citizens to enter the country. “The suspension of the agreement does not mean a general visa freeze for Russians but rather they will need to use the ordinary visa procedure to enter Switzerland,” the country’s federal council said in a statement. The EU took a similar step earlier, suspending a visa facilitation deal with Russia but stopping short of a wider visa ban in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine’s ministry of defence has given its latest update on Russia’s total combat losses since the war started in February this year. The figures show that Vladimir Putin’s military forces have lost 54,250 troops, 2,202 tanks, and 4,701 armoured combat vehicles. Ukrainian forces have also downed 251 military jets, 216 helicopters and 911 drones. The figures could not be independently verified. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus, writes for us that she lost a rigged election in Belarus – only the west can help us win freedom from Russia: Peat bogs span almost 15% of my home country of Belarus. But, in recent times, citizens have grown wary of these dense, acidic wetlands. Their decaying vegetative matter is a valuable source of fuel and, after decades of being gradually drained and stripped away, the drying marshes that remain pose a significant fire risk. Smouldering underground fires can burn for months unseen before bursting out into the open and wreaking devastation. Much like these underground peat fires that grow shielded from view, democracy in Belarus is currently burning and President Alexander Lukashenko’s corrupt, despotic regime is the decaying marshland, tinder-dry and ripe for destruction. Read more here: I lost a rigged election in Belarus – only the west can help us win freedom from Russia President Zelenskiy’s senior adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, has urged European countries to provide Ukraine with “modern and effective” missile defence systems. His tweet comes after Vladimir Putin warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces target facilities in Russia. Our colleague Dan Sabbagh writes that Ukraine depends on morale and Russia on mercenaries. It could decide the war: The Ukrainian video begins with the Dunkirk beach scene from the film Atonement, the soldiers’ stirring rendition of Dear Lord and Father of Mankind. Until it transitions to several hundred Ukrainian troops, singing the country’s national anthem in the open air, ahead of last week’s successful Kharkiv offensive. Life may be trying to imitate art, but in this case there is no clearer demonstration of Ukrainian national morale as the war heads towards the end of its seventh month. The unprovoked attack by their larger neighbour has unleashed a patriotic mobilisation that is having a transformational effect on the battlefield. Read more of Dan Sabbagh’s analysis here: Ukraine depends on morale and Russia on mercenaries. It could decide the war In case you missed it on Friday, Ukrainian authorities say they have found a mass burial site of more than 440 bodies in the eastern city of Izium that was recaptured from Russian forces. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has likened the discovery to what had happened in Bucha, saying: “Russia leaves death everywhere, and must be responsible for it.” Russia has repeatedly denied it targets civilians or has committed war crimes Joe Biden has warned Vladimir Putin not to use chemical or tactical nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine. The US president was asked in an interview with CBS News what he would say to Putin if he was considering using the weapons. Biden said: Don’t. Don’t. Don’t. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II. The US president refused to elaborate on what the US would do if Putin did take things that far. He added: They’ll become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been. And depending on the extent of what they do will determine what response would occur. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday he had spoken to Nike Inc and thanked the US sport manufacturer for making what he called the “right decision” to pull out of Russia. “This is an example of how business can play a significant role in protecting humanity and freedom,” Reuters reported the Ukrainian president as saying in his nightly video address. If a state chooses the path of terror, it is the duty of every self-respecting company to distance itself from such a state. Nike told Reuters in June that it was making a full exit from Russia. Ukraine’s foreign minister has renewed criticism of Germany for failing to send tanks to help fight Russian forces, saying the new weapons pledged by Berlin were “not what we need most”. Berlin announced on Thursday it would send Kyiv more multiple rocket launchers and “Dingo” armoured troop-carriers as Ukraine’s troops carry out a counteroffensive against Moscow’s forces. But Agence France-Presse reported the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, as saying Germany’s decisions were a “mystery” and that there was a “weapon wall” in Berlin that the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, had to tear down. Kuleba said in an interview with German newspaper the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, published online: We ask for Leopard tanks and Marder [armoured vehicles] and Germany supplies armoured vehicles of the Dingo type We are grateful for them. But that is not what we need most in combat ... What is the problem? Why can’t we get what we need, and what Germany has? Germany has sent a raft of different armaments to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February but has so far refused to transfer Leopards and Marders, despite repeated requests from Kyiv. Russia is likely to stubbornly defend the Luhansk oblast in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region amid Kyiv’s counteroffensive, but it is unclear if Moscow’s forces have “sufficient reserves or adequate morale” to withstand another concerted Ukrainian assault, the UK ministry of defence says. Its latest intelligence briefing says: Any substantial loss of territory in Luhansk will unambiguously undermine Russia’s strategy. The assessment comes after Ukrainian forces recently recaptured more than 6,000 sq km of territory including the city of Izium, long regarded as the gateway to the Donbas.

Agence France-Presse reports that the proposal is for Pope Francis, the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to form a dialogue and peace committee. Lopez Obrador said in a speech marking Mexican Independence Day: It’s a matter of urgently seeking an agreement to stop the war in Ukraine. The peacemaking mission should immediately seek a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine and the start of direct talks with Ukranian president Zelensky and Russian president Putin. Lopez Obrador, whose country is a non-permanent member of the UN security council, criticised the UN for being “inactive” in the face of the conflict. He said his foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, would present the proposal to the UN general assembly in New York, which will be addressed by about 150 heads of state and government. Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue his attack on Ukraine despite Kyiv’s latest counteroffensive and warned that Moscow could ramp up its strikes on the country’s vital infrastructure if Ukrainian forces target facilities in Russia. Associated Press reported that the Russian president said the “liberation” of Ukraine’s entire eastern Donbas region remained Russia’s main military goal and that he saw no need to revise it. Speaking to reporters on Friday after attending a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Putin said: We aren’t in a rush. The Russian leader added that Moscow has only deployed volunteer soldiers to fight in Ukraine. Russia pulled back its forces from large swaths of north-eastern Ukraine last week after a swift Ukrainian counteroffensive. In his first comment on the Ukrainian advance, Putin said: “Let’s see how it develops and how it ends.” He said Ukraine had tried to strike civilian infrastructure in Russia and “we so far have responded with restraint, but just yet””. If the situation develops this way, our response will be more serious. “Just recently, the Russian armed forces have delivered a couple of impactful strikes,” he said, in an apparent reference to Russian attacks earlier this week on power plants in northern Ukraine and a dam in the south. Let’s consider those as warning strikes. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. These are the latest developments as it approaches 9.30am in Kyiv. United Nations member states have voted to make an exception to allow Volodymyr Zelenskiy to address next week’s general assembly by video, despite Russian opposition.

Putin said he invaded Ukraine because the west wanted to break up Russia. He grinned when asked about Ukraine’s recent military success, saying: “Let’s see how it develops, how it ends up.” Putin said nothing had changed with the ultimate goal of Moscow’s “special military operation” in Ukraine, which was to capture the Donbas. The United States department of defence has announced it is providing an additional $600m in military assistance to Ukraine to meet the country’s “critical security and defence needs”.

Here’s where we stand: The US is expected to announce an additional military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn (£2.5bn), according to reports. The new package will be announced on Wednesday, the day the war in Ukraine hits the six-month mark, US officials were cited as saying. It would be the largest such assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war. Many civilians are attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack on the country’s independence day, according to an adviser to Ukraine’s president. Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” that an attack may strike the centres of decision-making in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday. The US has issued a security alert warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. The warning is the first specific security alert the US embassy in Kyiv has issued in recent months and comes after a ban by the Ukrainian government on celebrations in the capital to mark Wednesday’s anniversary of independence from Soviet rule because of fears of attack. The head of Ukraine’s security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, said he expects Russia’s security services to stage a series of terrorist attacks in Russian cities, resulting in large numbers of civilian casualties. Danilov said that the murder on Saturday of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was the first in what he expects to be a number of attacks. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed a “powerful response” in the event of a Russian attack on Kyiv on or around independence day on Wednesday. There was a daily threat of Russian attacks and Ukrainian intelligence was working with foreign intelligence, Zelenskiy said in a joint news conference with the visiting Polish president, Andrzej Duda. Ukraine’s president said the country will not agree to any proposal to freeze the current frontlines in its conflict with Russia in order to “calm” Moscow, which now controls about 22% of Ukraine including Crimea. Speaking at a news conference in Kyiv today, Zelenskiy urged the world not to show fatigue with the war, saying this would pose a big threat to the whole world. Zelenskiy also promised to bring “freedom to Ukraine and citizens in Crimea” and vowed that the Ukrainian flag will fly “where it’s supposed to be” in all occupied parts of Ukraine. The Ukrainian president said Kyiv would restore Ukrainian rule over the Russia-annexed region. “It started in Crimea and it will end in Crimea,” he told an international conference on Crimea. Boris Johnson has urged world leaders not to allow Vladimir Putin to repeat the annexation of Crimea in other parts of Ukraine. Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform summit. Hundreds of people gathered in Moscow for the funeral of Darya Dugina, the daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist ideologues. Dugina, daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was murdered on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside Moscow. Russia’s FSB security service has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of ordering her killing, which Kyiv denies. Russian tourists may be banned from entering Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland if the EU does not enact a bloc-wide ban, according to Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. Russians should not be allowed to enter the EU while their country “is undertaking genocide”, Landsbergis told reporters in Vilnius. It comes after the US rebuffed Ukraine’s demand for a blanket visa ban on Russians. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has demanded a halt to “nuclear sabre-rattling”, saying the world is at a “maximum moment of danger” and all countries with nuclear weapons must make a commitment to “no first-use”. The UN chief described the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, as critical. Shelling and fighting in the area continues. The war in Ukraine has pushed people to “a critical breaking point” with “devastating” knock-on effects that will only grow as the conflict drags on, the Red Cross has warned. Soaring inflation and shortages of essential products like fuel and food in Ukraine and neighbouring countries have left people struggling to afford basic supplies, with the situation becoming more desperate as the weather chills in the weeks ahead. Kyiv has accused Moscow of having organised illegal mass adoptions of Ukrainian children after transferring them from occupied territories to Russia. “More than 1,000 children from Mariupol,” were “illegally transferred to outsiders in Tyumen, Irkutsk, Kemerovo and Altai Krai” in Siberia, a statement by Ukraine’s foreign ministry read. The UN has said it is “very concerned” about plans by Russian-backed authorities to hold trials for captured Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol. Pro-Russian officials appear to be installing metal cages in a hall in Mariupol as part of plans to establish what they were calling an “international tribunal”, a UN rights office spokesperson said, adding that such a process could itself amount to a war crime. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thanks for reading. Here’s some more detail on the US military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn, which would be the single largest assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war. The package will use funds from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, appropriated by the US congress, to allow the Biden administration to procure weapons from industry rather than taking weapons from existing US weapons stocks, Reuters reports. The new weapons do not appear to include types of arms that had not been provided previously to the Ukrainian military, according to a US official. The amount and mix of weapons could change before the formal announcement, expected to take place tomorrow, the official added. Kyiv has accused Moscow of having organised illegal mass adoptions of Ukrainian children after transferring them from occupied territories to Russia. Since the beginning of the war, Kyiv has been accusing Moscow of “deporting” Ukrainians, saying Ukrainians from occupied territories have been forced to go to Russia rather than other regions of Ukraine. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said in a statement: The Russian Federation continues to abduct children from the territory of Ukraine and arrange their illegal adoption by Russian citizens. “More than 1,000 children from Mariupol,” a southern Ukrainian city occupied by Russian troops, “were illegally transferred to outsiders in Tyumen, Irkutsk, Kemerovo and Altai Krai” in Siberia, the statement read. Read the full story here. The US is expected to announce an additional military aid package for Ukraine of about $3bn (£2.5bn), according to reports. Associated Press cites US officials as saying that the new package will be announced on Wednesday, the day the war in Ukraine hits the six-month mark. The $3bn weapons assistance package would be the largest such assistance package that the US has provided for Ukraine since the start of the war. The money will be used to train and equip Ukrainian forces to fight for years to come, as well as fund contracts for drones, weapons and other equipment that may not see the battlefront for a year or two, the sources said. Unlike most previous aid packages, the new funding will be aimed at helping Ukraine secure its future defence needs, according to officials familiar with the matter. Earlier packages focused on Ukraine’s more immediate needs for weapons and ammunition. The new package is intended to reassure Ukrainian officials that the US is committed to maintaining its support, regardless of the day-to-day back and forth of the conflict, the officials said. The war in Ukraine has pushed people to “a critical breaking point” with “devastating” knock-on effects that will only grow as the conflict drags on, the Red Cross has warned. The organisation said that “even if the conflict were to end tomorrow, it will take years to repair the damage to cities and homes and the impact on families”, AFP reports. Soaring inflation and shortages of essential products like fuel and food in Ukraine and neighbouring countries have left people struggling to afford basic supplies, with the situation becoming more desperate as the weather chills in the weeks ahead. Maksym Dotsenko, head of the Ukrainian Red Cross, said in a virtual press briefing: It will be the hardest winter. The war, now six months old, has stretched the entire humanitarian system and could lead to lasting impacts on the ability of organisations to tackle emergencies worldwide, the Red Cross added. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine will not agree to any proposal to freeze the current frontlines in its conflict with Russia in order to “calm” Moscow, which now controls about 22% of Ukraine including Crimea. Speaking at a news conference in Kyiv today, the Ukrainian president urged the world not to show fatigue with the war, saying this would pose a big threat to the whole world. Zelenskiy told reporters: We’ll get back Crimea by any means we deem right, without consulting other countries. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said Vladimir Putin is betting the bloc’s response to his invasion of Ukraine will fracture as soaring prices hit European voters’ wallets. Russia’s president sees “the weariness of the Europeans and the reluctance of their citizens to bear the consequences of support for Ukraine”, Borrell said in an interview with AFP. “We will have to endure, spread the costs within the EU,” Borrell said. He added: We must give Ukraine support that goes beyond supplying weapons. Faced with someone who refuses to stop the war, we must be able to resist. Keeping the 27 member states united was a task to be carried out “day by day”, Borrell told the news agency. He also said: The member states are masters of their foreign policy. We must ensure that their interests reach a common point. We are always in compromise mode. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said the country expects to receive up to $16bn (£13.5bn) of financial support from its international partners by the end of this year to help it deal with Russia’s invasion. In a statement, Shmyhal said Ukraine had managed to maintain its financial stability thanks to external assistance, which had already accounted for $14bn. More than 40% of the Ukrainian government’s spending so far this year – more than $11.5bn (£9.7bn) – had been allocated to military needs, he added. Hundreds of people have lined up in Moscow to pay tributes to Darya Dugina, the murdered daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist thinkers, hailing her as a martyr whose death must be avenged with victory in the war in Ukraine. Dugina, the daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was killed on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside the capital. Moscow has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of masterminding her killing, a claim Kyiv has denied. Her father, Dugin, 60, who for decades pushed for the creation of a new Russian state that would annex the territory of countries including Ukraine, told mourners his daughter “died for the people, died for Russia”. “The huge price we have to pay can only be justified by the highest achievement, our victory,” a visibly emotional Dugin said. She lived for the sake of victory, and she died for the sake of victory. Our Russian victory, our truth, our Orthodox faith, our state. A large black and white portrait of Dugina, 30, who was reportedly close to her father and worked as a nationalist media commentator, hung on a wall behind her coffin.

The warning is the first specific security alert the US embassy in Kyiv has issued in recent months and comes after a ban by the Ukrainian government on celebrations in the capital to mark Wednesday’s anniversary of independence from Soviet rule because of fears of attack. The mayor of Dnipro, Borys Filatov, has said Russian rockets are falling on homes in the city and urged residents to stay under cover. Dnipro is located in south-central Ukraine and has been subjected to Russian long-range missile attacks during the war. The head of Ukraine’s security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, said he expects Russia’s security services to stage a series of terrorist attacks in Russian cities, resulting in large numbers of civilian casualties. Danilov said that the murder on Saturday of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was the first in what he expects to be a number of attacks.

Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform summit. Russian forces are likely to have started to move barges to construct a floating bridge over the Dnipro River near the Antonivsky bridge, a British intelligence update said. The bridge in Kherson has been targeted repeatedly by Ukrainian forces with missile strikes as it is a key supply route for Russia in the south of the country. If Russia completes the improvised bridge, it will almost certainly increase the capacity of the crossing point compared with the ferry, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) believes. Russian tourists may be banned from entering Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland if the EU does not enact a bloc-wide ban, according to Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. Russians should not be allowed to enter the EU while their country “is undertaking genocide”, Landsbergis told reporters in Vilnius.

Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau has announced fresh sanctions against 62 individuals accused of backing Vladimir Putin’s regime and his invasion of Ukraine. The sanctioned individuals include high-ranking Russian government officials, their family members, and senior officials of currently sanctioned defence sector entities, a statement by the Canadian government said. A total of 33 cargo ships carrying around 719,549 tonnes of foodstuffs have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said. A further 18 vessels were loading or waiting for permission to leave Ukrainian ports, the ministry added. Three Black Sea ports were unblocked under the deal signed on 22 July by Moscow and Kyiv. Monthly payments to UK hosts of Ukrainian refugees should double to help them to provide housing for more than six months amid the cost of living crisis, the minister responsible has said. Councils have warned that homelessness could rise if refugees’ initial six-month placements with hosts end without alternative options in place. Good afternoon from London. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you with all the latest from Ukraine. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. Boris Johnson has urged world leaders not to allow Vladimir Putin to repeat the annexation of Crimea in other parts of Ukraine. Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform summit. Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau has announced fresh sanctions against 62 individuals accused of backing Vladimir Putin’s regime and his invasion of Ukraine. The sanctioned individuals include “high-ranking Russian government officials, including Russian federal governors and regional heads, their family members, and senior officials of currently sanctioned defence sector entities”, a statement by the Canadian government said. In addition, the government has imposed sanctions on the Russian defence firm Avtomatika, which makes drones and electronic voting machines. Monthly payments to UK hosts of Ukrainian refugees should double to help them to provide housing for more than six months amid the cost of living crisis, the minister responsible has said. About 25,000 offers of accommodation from hosts under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have been taken up so far, with an average of three Ukrainians living in each home, Richard Harrington said. Six months after the Russian invasion, the government is asking existing hosts to allow Ukrainians to stay for longer than the minimum period of half a year, while also appealing for new sponsors. The move comes amid soaring living costs, with energy bills expected to rise by 80% going into winter, rocketing inflation and rising interest rates. Councils have also warned that homelessness could rise if refugees’ initial six-month placements with hosts end without alternative options in place.

Britain will continue to support Ukraine with military, humanitarian, economic and diplomatic support until Russia “ends this hideous war and withdraws its forces from the entirety of Ukraine”, Johnson said in a remote address to the international Crimea Platform conference. The PM called on allies to continue to support Ukraine until Russian forces withdrew from the “entirety” of its territory. Johnson said: Putin is planning to do to other parts of Ukraine - indeed all of Ukraine – what he has done to Crimea. The Russian leader was preparing “more annexations and more sham referendums”, he added. Russia’s annexation of Crimea “or any other Ukrainian territory” must never be recognised, Johnson urged. Scouts in the UK have been praised for setting adults an example on how to welcome refugees after they made hundreds of messages of support for Ukrainian families fleeing the war. “You are so brave and I hope you like it here,” wrote one scout in a decorated card. Another said: “REMEMBER YOU ARE LOVED.” Among other messages were: “Let us take you to safety” and “You should try fish and chips.” The messages from scouts aged 12-15 were made to mark six months since the start of Russia’s invasion. They will be shared with recently settled Ukrainian families in the UK in welcome packs from Save the Children. Meg Briody, the head of child and youth participation at Save the Children, said the messages showed the best side of the UK’s attitudes towards refugees. Children and young people are once again setting an example in showing that the UK can be a welcoming place for refugees. Read the full story by my colleague Matthew Weaver here. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has promised to bring “freedom to Ukraine and citizens in Crimea” and vowed that the Ukrainian flag will fly “where it’s supposed to be” in all occupied parts of Ukraine. In a speech to open an international conference on Crimea, the Ukrainian president said Kyiv would restore Ukrainian rule over the Russia-annexed region. Zelenskiy said: To overcome terror, it is necessary to gain victory in the fight against Russian aggression. It is necessary to liberate Crimea. This will be the resuscitation of world law and order. Therefore, we need to free Crimea from occupation as well. It started in Crimea and it will end in Crimea. In a separate speech today to mark Ukraine’s national flag day and on the eve of the country’s independence day, Zelenskiy pledged that the Ukrainian flag will fly “where it’s supposed to be” in all occupied parts of Ukraine. He said: The blue and yellow flag will flutter again at its home, where it’s supposed to be by right, in all temporarily occupied cities and villages of Ukraine. Ukraine’s president also spoke in a joint news conference with visiting Polish president, Andrzej Duda, where he was asked about the possibility of a Russian missile strike on Kyiv on or around independence day on Wednesday. There was a daily threat of Russian attacks and Ukrainian intelligence was working with foreign intelligence, Zelenskiy replied. The response to an attack on the Ukrainian capital would be the same for any Ukrainian city that comes under attack from Russia, he added. Zelenskiy said: If they hit us, they will receive a response, a powerful response. I want to say that each day this response will grow, it will get stronger and stronger. Germany has recorded almost a million refugees from Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February, the country’s interior ministry said. A total of 967,546 people fleeing the war have entered Germany at least temporarily, the ministry said in a statement. Of those who have left Ukraine for Germany, 36% are children. Among the adults, three in four are women and around 8% are over the age of 64. Almost 155,000 Ukrainian pupils have been enrolled at German schools, according to the conference of state education ministers in Berlin. The UN has said it is “very concerned” about plans by Russian-backed authorities to hold trials for captured Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol, saying that such a process could itself amount to a war crime. Pro-Russian officials appear to be installing metal cages in a hall in Mariupol as part of plans to establish what they were calling an “international tribunal”, according to Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the UN rights office. She said: We are very concerned about the manner in which this is being done. There are pictures in the media of cages being built in Mariupol’s philharmonic hall, really massive cages and apparently the idea is to restrain the prisoners. She added: This is not acceptable, this is humiliating. Willfully depriving a prisoner of war to the right to a fair trial amounts to a war crime by Russia, she said, adding that Ukrainian PoWs were entitled to protection under the Geneva conventions. Last week, Ukrainian military intelligence said Russian forces were allegedly planning to display captured Ukrainian soldiers in iron cages during a “show trial” in Mariupol on the country’s independence day. The captured fighters who will reportedly be displayed in the cages in Mariupol’s philharmonic hall are those who were captured while defending the formerly-besieged Azovstal steel plant. Russian tourists may be banned from entering Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland if the EU does not enact a bloc-wide ban, according to Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged the EU to introduce a travel ban on Russian tourists, arguing that the “most important sanction” was to “close the borders, because the Russians are taking away someone else’s land”. The Ukrainian president’s call has been backed by several EU leaders including the Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, and her Estonian counterpart, Kaja Kallas. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland all share a border with Russia. Russians should not be allowed to enter the EU while their country “is undertaking genocide”, Landsbergis told reporters in Vilnius today. He said: I have talked to ministers from all these countries … I don’t see many differences politically. On Monday, the US rebuffed Ukraine’s demand for a blanket visa ban on Russians, saying the Biden administration had already imposed visa restrictions for Kremlin officials but that its focus would be on identifying those involved in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and holding them accountable. A US state department spokesperson said: The US wouldn’t want to close off pathways to refuge and safety for Russia’s dissidents or others who are vulnerable to human rights abuses. An adviser to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said many civilians are attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack on the country’s independence day tomorrow. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” that an attack may strike the centres of decision-making in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday. Rodnyansky said: People are reacting to the news. They are trying to ensure they have contingency plans, they don’t want to spend too much time near the centre near the buildings of our government. He added: There is a risk Russia will try to strike exactly at that time to compensate for their inability to have any success on the battlefield, to have any success in subduing Ukraine and basically all the failures they have run up over the last six months. Rodnyansky’s comments came after the US warned Russia may “step up” efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. Ukraine’s defence ministry has advised Ukrainians to be especially careful on independence day, citing the threat of missile attacks and “provocations” from Russia. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The head of Ukraine’s security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, said he expects Russia’s security services to stage a series of terrorist attacks in Russian cities, resulting in large numbers of civilian casualties. Danilov said that the murder on Saturday of Darya Dugina, the daughter of Russian ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was the first in what he expects to be a number of attacks. He also said support for the war in Russia is falling and the Kremlin needs to introduce general mobilisation. The time is just after 1pm in Ukraine. Here is what you might have missed: Hundreds of people gathered in Moscow for the funeral of Darya Dugina, the slain daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist ideologues. Dugina, daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was murdered on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside Moscow. Russia’s FSB security service has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of ordering her killing, which Kyiv denies. Dnipro mayor Borys Filatov has said that Russian rockets are falling on homes and urged Ukrainians in the city to stay under cover. In a post on his Facebook page, he said: “Pls stay under cover. There are already facts of rockets falling on private houses. Details to come later. We are waiting for official information from the Military Administration.” Russian forces are likely to have started to move barges to construct a floating bridge over the Dnipro River near the Antonivsky bridge, a British intelligence update said. The bridge in Kherson has been targeted repeatedly by Ukrainian forces with missile strikes as it is a key supply route for Russia in the south of the country. If Russia completes the improvised bridge, it will almost certainly increase the capacity of the crossing point compared with the ferry, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) believes. A total of 33 cargo ships carrying around 719,549 tonnes of foodstuffs have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said. Ukraine‘s grain exports slumped after Russia invaded the country on 24 February and blockaded its Black Sea ports. Three Black Sea ports were unblocked under the deal signed on 22 July by Moscow and Kyiv. Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk reported that 825 people have been evacuated from the Kharkiv region in north-east Ukraine. In a message on her Telegram channel, she said: A successful humanitarian operation: 825 people were evacuated from the uncontrolled part of Kharkiv region today, 238 of them were children. Poland’s president Andrzej Duda has arrived in Kyiv for talks with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The duo will engage in talks on the current wartime situation in Ukraine, economic and humanitarian support and bilateral cooperation, according to Duda’s official Twitter channel. The US state department has issued a security alert warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. A security alert issued by the US embassy in Kyiv on Tuesday reads: “The department of state has information that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days.” Ukrainian sources are reporting Russian forces struck a boiler plant in Ukraine’s southern city of Mariupol. Adviser to the city’s mayor, Petro Andryushchenko, reported that Russian forces struck the city’s boiler facility in a Telegram post early this morning. Monthly payments to British sponsors of Ukrainian refugees should double to help them carry on hosting for longer than six months while the cost of living spirals, the minister responsible has said. The price of achieving fire parity and destroying Russian army logistics is “less than a Russian oligarch’s yacht”, a senior adviser to the Ukrainian president has said. Russia has accused Ukraine’s intelligence services of carrying out the murder of Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue. Russia’s FSB security service published information and a video it said showed a Ukrainian woman from the country’s Azov regiment was responsible for the murder. The Guardian reports the claim lacks credibility. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has demanded a halt to “nuclear sabre-rattling”, saying the world is at a “maximum moment of danger” and all countries with nuclear weapons must make a commitment to “no first-use”. The UN chief described the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, as critical. Shelling and fighting in the area continues. Moscow has requested a UN security council meeting be held on Tuesday to discuss the Zaporizhzhia plant, Russian state-owned news agency RIA reported, citing deputy ambassador to the UN Dmitry Polyanskiy. Ukrainian soldiers who were taken prisoner after the battle for Mariupol have accused Russian forces of torture during their captivity. The soldiers, who were from the Azov regiment and released as part of a prisoner exchange, told reporters they saw soldiers that were beaten until their bones were broken. “Some had needles inserted into their wounds, some were tortured with water,” said Vladyslav Zhaivoronok, who lost a leg. “They undressed us, forced to squat while we are naked. If any of the boys raised their heads, they began to beat them immediately,” added Denys Chepurko. Hundreds of people gathered in Moscow for the funeral of Darya Dugina, the slain daughter of one of Russia’s most prominent nationalist ideologues. Dugina, daughter of ultra-nationalist Alexander Dugin, was murdered on Saturday in a car bomb attack outside Moscow. Russia’s FSB security service has accused Ukrainian intelligence agencies of ordering her killing, something Kyiv denies. Senior politicians, fellow nationalists and friends filed past Dugina’s dark wooden casket in a hall at Moscow’s TV centre on Tuesday morning to say goodbye, lay flowers, and convey their condolences to her parents who were sitting nearby. A large black and white photograph of Dugina, 30, who worked as a journalist and nationalist media commentator, hung on a black wall behind her casket as sombre music played, Reuters reports. Her father, Dugin, 60, who has for years advocated the creation of a new Russian empire that would absorb the territory of countries such as Ukraine, told mourners his daughter had died for Russia. A visibly distressed Dugin said: If her tragic death has touched someone, she would have asked them to defend sacred (Russian) Orthodoxy, the people and the Fatherland. She died for Russia, in the motherland and on the frontline which is not in Ukraine but here. Dnipro mayor Borys Filatov has said that rockets are falling on homes and urged Ukrainians in the city to stay under cover. In a post on his Facebook page he said: Pls stay under cover. There are already facts of rockets falling on private houses. Details to come later. We are waiting for official information from the Military Administration. Dnipro is located in south-central Ukraine and has been subjected to Russian long-range missile attacks during the war. Porsches, Bentleys and other luxury cars with Russian licence plates are filling up the parking garage at Helsinki’s airport as Finland becomes an important transit country for Russian tourists flying to Europe, reports AFP. The European Union shut its airspace to Russian planes after Moscow invaded Ukraine, forcing anyone who wants to travel to Europe to drive across the border or take a circuitous route using non-Western airlines. A quick stroll through the carpark at the Helsinki airport revealed dozens if not hundreds of high-end cars with Russian plates, including a new Mercedes-Benz S-class sedan and Porsche 911 Turbo S. Finnish foreign minister Pekka Haavisto told AFP that the Nordic nation has become a “transit country” for Russian tourists. Finland said last week it would limit Russian tourist visas to 10% of current volumes as of 1 September due to rising discontent over Russian tourism amid the war in Ukraine. But Russians continue to enter Finland with visas issued by other EU countries in the Schengen borderless travel area for their journeys. Schengen rules do not allow Finland to close the border to specific nationalities, Haavisto said. Such sanctions can only be decided jointly by the EU. The European Commission acknowledged last week that discussions were under way to see if a “coordinated approach” on Russian visas could be reached. EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has paid tribute to Ukrainians for “giving their lives to protect the values” on which the European bloc is built. To commemorate the Europe-wide Day of Remembrance for the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes today, she said in a statement: On 23 August, we honour the memory of the victims of totalitarian and authoritarian regimes, in Europe and beyond. Today, on the 83rd anniversary of the signature of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, this date carries a special significance. This year, Putin brought the horrors of war back to Europe, along with the reminder that peace cannot be taken for granted. The painful memory of the past is not just a distant recollection, but has found an echo in Russia’s illegal and unjustified war against Ukraine. We are inspired by the courage of those who then stood up to injustice, and we express our respect and support for the many men and women who are forced to do it again today. Ukrainian people are giving their lives to protect the values on which our Union is built. Today more than ever, we stand united against the Russian state-controlled propaganda that distorts history, spreads conspiracy and punishes those who oppose it. We will continue with determination our work to counter disinformation. And we will ensure that those who stood against totalitarianism will not be forgotten. Russian forces are likely to have started to move barges to construct a floating bridge over the Dnipro River near the Antonivsky bridge, a British intelligence update said. The bridge in Kherson has been targeted repeatedly by Ukrainian forces with missile strikes as it is a key supply route for Russia in the south of the country. For several weeks, Russian forces and local civilians have relied on a ferry crossing of the waterway, the update said. If Russia completes the improvised bridge, it will almost certainly increase the capacity of the crossing point compared with the ferry, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) believes. The update added that the floating bridge would likely still be vulnerable to Ukrainian assaults. A total of 33 cargo ships carrying around 719,549 tonnes of foodstuffs have left Ukraine under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to unblock Ukrainian sea ports, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said. The Joint Coordination Centre in Turkey, which monitors implementation of the agreement, put the total amount of grain and foodstuffs exported from three Ukrainian Black Sea ports since the deal was reached at 721,449 tonnes. Ukraine‘s grain exports slumped after Russia invaded the country on 24 February and blockaded its Black Sea ports, driving up global food prices and prompting fears of shortages in Africa and the Middle East, reports Reuters. Three Black Sea ports were unblocked under the deal signed on 22 July by Moscow and Kyiv. In addition to the vessels that have already left Ukraine, the agriculture ministry said a further 18 were loading or waiting for permission to leave Ukrainian ports. The ministry said Ukrainian grain exports could reach 4m tonnes in August, compared with 3m tonnes in July. Isobel Koshiw reports: The US state department has issued a security alert warning that Russia is “stepping up” efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. The warning, issued on Tuesday, is the first specific security alert issued by the US embassy in Kyiv in recent months. It does not say what places it believes Russia plans to target, but advised US citizens to leave Ukraine if safe to do so. The alert comes a day before Ukraine marks 31 years as an independent state. On 24 August 1991, Ukraine’s parliament voted to separate from the Soviet Union. The day will also mark six months since Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Some restaurants in Kyiv have been closing early this week because of the perceived increased threat.

In a message on her Telegram channel, she said: A successful humanitarian operation: 825 people were evacuated from the uncontrolled part of Kharkiv region today, 238 of them were children. We thank the head of Kharkiv OVA Oleg Sinegubov for organizing the process, as well as volunteer organizations for their dedication and help. Poland’s president Andrzej Duda has arrived in Kyiv for talks with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The duo will engage in talks on the current wartime situation in Ukraine, economic and humanitarian support and bilateral cooperation, according to Duda’s official Twitter channel. Pawel Szrot told reporters: The visit will include a meeting with President (Volodymyr) Zelenskiy and talks on military support and defence of Ukraine in the economic, humanitarian and political sense,” Pawel Szrot told reporters. The presidents will discuss the political support Poland could offer to convince other countries to keep helping Ukraine. Duda has met Zelenskiy five times this year, including on three visits he has made to Ukraine since the start of the invasion in February this year. Exports of key Ukrainian agricultural commodities have fallen by almost half since the start of the Russian invasion earlier this year compared with the same period in 2021, data from the agriculture ministry showed late on Monday. Ukrainian seaports have been blocked since the Russian invasion started in late February, leaving a vast amount of crops either unharvested or destroyed, reports Reuters. Agricultural exports between 24 February and 15 August this year fell to 10m tonnes from around 19.5m in the same period last year, the ministry data showed. The 2022 grain harvest in Ukraine is forecast to fall to around 50m tonnes from a record 86m tonnes in 2021. At the end of July, three Ukrainian Black Sea ports were unblocked under a deal between Moscow and Kyiv, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. But even with the ports opened, Ukraine‘s agricultural exports are significantly lower than before the conflict, when Ukraine exported up to 6m tonnes of grain a month. It is 9am in Ukraine.

The sole bridge across the strategic Dnieper River in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson was reportedly hit by US-supplied high-precision Himars rockets injuring 15 people, a source told Russia’s Interfax news agency. The bridge is a key crossing for Russian military transport in the region. Three villages in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region were battered by Russian artillery and multiple rocket launchers on Monday. Soledar, Zaytseve and Bilohorivka near the city of Bakhmut were struck, killing at least two civilians, Ukrainian authorities said. Nearly 9,000 Ukrainian military personnel have been killed in the war with Russia, the head of Ukraine’s armed forces, general Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said on Monday. The office of the UN high commissioner for human rights said on Monday 5,587 civilians had been killed and 7,890 wounded between 24 February and 21 August, mainly from artillery, rocket and missile attacks. The price of achieving fire parity and destroying Russian army logistics is “less than a Russian oligarch’s yacht”, a senior advisor to the Ukrainian president has said. Mykhailo Podolyak suggested that 50 US-supplied Himars long-range weapons systems, at the cost of about $200m, would be needed to “completely change the course of this war”. Moscow has requested a UN security council meeting be held later today to discuss the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Russian state-owned news agency RIA reported, citing deputy ambassador to the UN Dmitry Polyanskiy. The nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, has been taken over by Russian troops and has come under repeated shelling in recent weeks, raising fears of a nuclear disaster. It is unclear whether the meeting will be going ahead. Monthly payments to British sponsors of Ukrainian refugees should double to help them carry on hosting for longer than six months while the cost of living spirals, the minister responsible has said. Around 25,000 offers of accommodation from hosts under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have been taken up so far, with an average of three Ukrainians living in each home, PA Media cited Lord Richard Harrington as saying. Lord Harrington said he has been lobbying the Treasury “very hard” to double the £350-a-month “thank you” payment for sponsors who house refugees for longer than half a year – the minimum period expected of hosts. He told PA Media: The costs … they’re paying maybe a big chunk of rent themselves, the mortgage payments have gone up and everything, and I think it’s perfectly reasonable, in my view, to increase the amount that we’re paying them.” More than 115,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the UK under its visa schemes, according to the latest government figures, including around 81,700 refugees under the sponsorship scheme. Around 4,000-5,000 people are arriving each week, Lord Harrington added. Ukrainian sources are reporting Russian forces struck a boiler plant in Ukraine’s southern city of Mariupol. Adviser to the city’s mayor, Petro Andryushchenko, reported that Russian forces struck the city’s boiler facility in a Telegram post early this morning. “The Russians made an explosion again. Loud that the whole city could hear. Just blowing up the boiler room. Instead of preparing the city for winter and building boiler houses, the occupiers destroy even the remains …” Unconfirmed video footage purportedly showing the moment the facility was struck has circulated online. The UN’s secretary-general, António Guterres, has demanded a halt to “nuclear sabre-rattling”, saying the world is at a “maximum moment of danger” and all countries with nuclear weapons must make a commitment to “no first-use”. The UN chief described the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, as critical. Shelling and fighting in the area continues. In a statement released after ambassadors met at the UN security council on Monday, Guterres stressed: Nuclear saber-rattling must stop … come to the negotiating table to ease tensions and end the nuclear arms race, once and for all.” At this moment of “maximum danger for our world”, the secretary-general emphasised that “humanity’s future is in our hands”, insisting that division be replaced with dialogue and diplomacy, to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”. He argued that negotiation, compromise, and accountability are required for the future, attesting that as it represents the nations of the world, the UN is “humanity’s best hope to build a better, more peaceful tomorrow”. The US state department has issued a security alert warning that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days. A security alert issued by the US embassy in Kyiv on Tuesday reads: The department of state has information that Russia is stepping up efforts to launch strikes against Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities in the coming days.” The US intelligence community on Monday declassified a finding that determined that Russia would increasingly target Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, according to a US official familiar with the intelligence. The official was not authorised to comment publicly about the finding and spoke on the condition of anonymity, the Associated Press reported. The alert also urged US citizens still in Ukraine to depart the country immediately. “If you hear a loud explosion or if sirens are activated, immediately seek cover,” the state department said. “If in a home or a building, go to the lowest level of the structure with the fewest exterior walls, windows, and openings; close any doors and sit near an interior wall, away from any windows or openings.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines.

The EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, also said he opposes a complete ban on visas for Russians. The German chancellor says he is working fast to find alternatives to Russian gas. Olaf Scholz said he aims to extricate Germany from its dependence on Russian gas and pursue new energy supplies. Scholz met Canada’s prime minster, Justin Trudeau, in Montreal on Monday. The two leaders are set to sign a deal for Canada to supply clean hydrogen to Germany. Ukraine has restored a rail link to neighbouring Moldova which could carry 10m tonnes of freight a year, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. The 22km (12 mile) line runs from western Ukraine to Moldova. Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksander Kubrakov, said the link would provide an alternative route from the Black Sea port of Odesa. Ukraine’s agricultural exports are likely to rise to about 4m tonnes in August, from 3m tonnes in July, a deputy chair of the Ukrainian agrarian council said. The uptick is due to a UN-brokered deal that unblocked Ukrainian seaports. Europe faces fresh disruption to energy supplies due to damage to a pipeline system bringing oil from Kazakhstan through Russia that was reported by the pipeline operator on Monday. Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) said exports from two of its three mooring points at a Black Sea terminal had been suspended. A senior Russian diplomat has ruled out a diplomatic solution to ending the war in Ukraine. Gennady Gatilov, Russia’s permanent representative to the UN in Geneva, told the Financial Times that there would be no direct talks between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, adding that Moscow expects a prolonged conflict."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/dec/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-north-korea-denies-supplying-russias-wagner-group-with-weapons-air-raid-sirens-sound-in-mykolaiv","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-23T18:45:17Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Russia accused of demolishing Mariupol theatre ‘to hide war crimes’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/dec/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-north-korea-denies-supplying-russias-wagner-group-with-weapons-air-raid-sirens-sound-in-mykolaiv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/dec/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-north-korea-denies-supplying-russias-wagner-group-with-weapons-air-raid-sirens-sound-in-mykolaiv","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Russia accused of demolishing Mariupol theatre ‘to hide war crimes’ – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s nearly 9pm in Kyiv. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Here’s where things stand: President Vladimir Putin has ordered his country’s defence industry chiefs to ensure the Russian army gets all the weapons, equipment and military hardware it needs “in the shortest possible timeframes” to fight in Ukraine. Putin’s remarks came just days after he pledged to give his army anything it asks for in a meeting with Russia’s top military officials. Russian forces have started demolishing a theatre in occupied Mariupol in southern Ukraine that was the site of a deadly airstrike believed to have killed hundreds of civilians, according to an aide to the city’s exiled Ukrainian mayor. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, said the move was an “attempt to hide forever the evidence of the deliberate killing of Ukrainians by Russians”. Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, warned the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high” and compared US-Russia relations to an “ice age” in comments reported by the Russian state-owned Tass news agency. The Kremlin on Thursday accused the US of fighting a proxy war against Russia, after Washington boosted military support for Ukraine and hosted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the White House and Congress. Russian forces shelled the recently liberated Kherson region more than 60 times on Thursday, according to the head of the region’s military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych. Two civilians were killed by Russian shelling on the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine Friday morning, according to the regional prosecutor’s office. Two people were injured after a car bomb exploded in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol in south-eastern Ukraine, according to a local pro-Moscow official. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia province, described the incident as a “terrorist attack” carried out by “militants of the Kyiv regime” to the Russian state media. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, wrote on Telegram that eyewitnesses reported a car was “blown up”. The Kremlin has claimed that Russia has made significant progress towards “demilitarising” Ukraine – one of the initial goals of Russia’s invasion 10 months ago. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, was asked during a briefing about comments by President Vladimir Putin that Ukraine’s military-industrial complex “if not completely reset to zero, is getting there fast”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted a video on Friday saying he was back at work in Kyiv after his landmark visit to Washington this week. “I am in my office. We are working toward victory,” he said in the video posted to his Telegram channel. Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to the White House confirmed that Ukraine and the US are “strategic partners” for the first time in history, the Ukrainian leader’s most senior adviser has said. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainan president’s office, told the Guardian that the trip on Wednesday had cemented Zelenskiy’s bond with the US president, Joe Biden – and with senior US Republicans. North Korea’s foreign ministry denied a media report it had supplied munitions to Russia, calling it “groundless,” and denounced the US for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, North Korea’s official KCNA news agency reported. The White House yesterday said the Wagner Group took delivery of an arms shipment from North Korea to help bolster Russian forces in Ukraine, a sign of the group’s expanding role in the war. The Canadian government said Pyongyang’s transaction with the Wagner Group “clearly violates international law and UN security council resolutions”. The top Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said on Friday that shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, had “almost stopped”. Speaking on Russian state television, governor Yevgeny Balitsky said Russian troops would not leave the nuclear plant, and that it would never return to Ukrainian control. A Russian opposition politician has filed a legal challenge over President Vladimir Putin’s use of the word “war” to describe the conflict in Ukraine. Putin on Thursday publicly acknowledged the situation as a “war” for the first time since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February, after 10 months of calling his campaign a “special military operation”. Ukraine plans to open new embassies in 10 African countries, its president has announced, with the aim of increasing Kyiv’s presence in Africa and strengthening trade ties. There are also plans to develop a “Ukraine-Africa trade house” with offices in the capitals of “the most promising countries” on the African continent, Zelenskiy added. Here’s more from Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who was speaking earlier at a conference of Ukrainian ambassadors in Kyiv. Zelenskiy described his visit to the US as “a very important benchmark, as a set bar” at the meeting, adding: I do not have the opportunity to make foreign visits – I simply do not have it, because there’s no time. President Vladimir Putin has ordered his country’s defence industry chiefs to ensure the Russian army gets all the weapons, equipment and military hardware it needs “in the shortest possible timeframes” to fight in Ukraine. The Russian leader was speaking at the start of the meeting with defence industry officials gathered from across the country in the city of Tula, a centre for Russian arms manufacturing. Putin said: The most important key task of our military-industrial complex is to provide our units and frontline forces with everything they need: weapons, equipment, ammunition, and gear in the necessary quantities and of the right quality in the shortest possible timeframes. It’s also important to perfect and significantly improve the technical characteristics of weapons and equipment for our fighters based on the combat experience we have gained. He added that he was looking forward to their “proposals on addressing the problems that are inevitable in this large piece of work and how we will move forward and make sure there are fewer of them”. Putin’s remarks came just days after he pledged to give his army anything it asks for in a meeting with Russia’s top military officials. Speaking in Moscow at the closing session of the expanded board of the ministry of defence on Wednesday, he said there were no “funding restrictions” for the military. He added: The country, the government will give everything that the army asks for. Everything. Russia is expected to dramatically increase its spending on the military in the next two years, as Putin signals that he is preparing for a prolonged and costly war with Ukraine. Earlier this month, he said the conflict could turn into a “long-term process”, and the Kremlin shows no intention of climbing down from its maximalist goals of regime change in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to the White House confirmed that Ukraine and the US are “strategic partners” for the first time in history, the Ukrainian leader’s most senior adviser has said in an interview on his return home. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainan president’s office, told the Guardian that the trip on Wednesday had cemented Zelenskiy’s bond with the US president, Joe Biden – and with senior US Republicans, despite “dirty” comments made by the Fox News host Tucker Carlson. The summit and press conference between the two leaders this week demonstrated “how deeply in personal attitude President Biden feels everything which is connected to Ukraine”, Yermak said, and that the US was “a real leader of the free world and democracy”. Yermak’s emphasis on the personal links forged by the surprise visit, the first time Zelenskiy had been outside Ukraine since the start of the war, comes despite a failure to immediately obtain the US Abrams tanks, F-16 fighter jets and long-range army tactical missile system ATACMS that Ukraine has said it needs to defeat Russia. But it demonstrates a belief in Kyiv that Ukraine must emphasise the moral dimension of its fight against the invading Russian army and its faith in its relationship with the US to unlock more and more of the military aid it badly needs as the war heads towards its first anniversary in February. Yermak, who was by Zelenskiy’s side during the trip, said: It’s [the] first time in history that Ukraine and [the] United States are close as strategic partners. There is a very warm, very friendly relationship, [a] personal relationship between [the] two presidents. As well as the meeting with Biden, Yermak highlighted meetings Zelenskiy had with US congressional leaders, including those with senior Republicans Mitch McConnell, the senate minority leader, and Kevin McCarthy, the leading candidate to become House speaker next month. Read the full story here: Ukraine plans to open new embassies in 10 African countries, its president has announced, with the aim of increasing Kyiv’s presence in Africa and strengthening trade ties. Speaking at a conference of Ukrainian ambassadors, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: We are already rebooting relations with dozens of African countries. Next year, we have to strengthen them. Ten countries have already been designated in Africa where new embassies of Ukraine will be opened. There are also plans to develop a “Ukraine-Africa trade house” with offices in the capitals of “the most promising countries” on the African continent, he added. Zelenskiy continued: In addition to the existing representation of Ukraine in 10 African countries, together with new embassies and trading houses, we should achieve representation in 30 countries of the African continent. Like many Ukrainian refugees, Yuliia Kashperenko will spend Christmas away from home this year. She feels upset at the thought of being away from her family and friends in Ukraine, but comforted to know she will spend the holiday with her host and their children in south London. Kashperenko, 25, arrived the UK in October, leaving her parents behind in the Kyiv region. “With this family, I feel like I’m with my family,” she says. I realise it’s better to stay here. I’m in a safe place with good people. The Ukrainian government advised refugees not to go home over Christmas, because of fears the country’s energy infrastructure would not be able to deal with the demand, meaning many will spend the holiday apart from loved ones. Ukrainians traditionally celebrate Christmas on 7 January, according to the Julian calendar, but after Russia’s invasion the country’s Orthodox church is allowing its congregations to observe the 25 December date instead, in a move toward the west. Kashperenko, who worked in the media and as a copywriter in Ukraine, arrived in London after applying to the Homes for Ukraine scheme. She fled because she was worried about attacks on the capital and being forced to survive the winter without power. “I understood that Russia was going to destroy cities and energy systems,” she says. Read the full story here: Ukraine’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has called for Iran, North Korea and Belarus to be held accountable for their alleged involvement in Russia’s war in Ukraine. Podolyak’s tweet came a day after the White House accused North Korea of supplying arms to the private Russian mercenary firm the Wagner Group to help bolster Moscow’s troops in Ukraine. Kyiv has accused Tehran of supplying thousands of its drones to Moscow, which used them in deadly attacks on cities such as Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia. After initially denying the presence of Iranian drones in Ukraine, the Tehran government has admitted that it had supplied a “small number” of the unmanned aircraft to Russia months before Vladimir Putin launched an all-out invasion of Ukraine in February. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has previously allowed the Kremlin to use his country as a platform to send tens of thousands of Russian troops into Ukraine, while Russian war jets have taken off from Belarusian bases. But Lukashenko has not joined the war directly or sent his own troops into the fight. Russian forces have started demolishing a theatre in occupied Mariupol in southern Ukraine that was the site of a deadly airstrike believed to have killed hundreds of civilians, according to an aide to the city’s exiled Ukrainian mayor. Petro Andryushchenko accused the occupying authorities of attempting to cover up the Russian bombing of the theatre, which was being used as an air raid shelter when it was hit on 16 March. An investigation by Amnesty International into the Mariupol theatre strike concluded that Russian forces committed a war crime by deliberately targeting the building despite knowing hundreds of civilians were sheltering there. Video posted on social media appears to show diggers demolishing the last remaining walls of the theatre. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, said the move was an “attempt to hide forever the evidence of the deliberate killing of Ukrainians by Russians”. The Russian occupying authorities were planning to leave the front of the theatre intact and destroy the rest of the structure, to build a new theatre “on the bones of Mariupol’s people”, Andryushchenko said. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, warned the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high” and compared US-Russia relations to an “ice age” in comments reported by the Russian state-owned Tass news agency.

Putin on Thursday publicly acknowledged the situation as a “war” for the first time since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February, after 10 months of calling his campaign a “special military operation”. The Canadian government has condemned reports that North Korea has supplied battlefield missiles and rockets to the Wagner Group, a private Russian mercenary company, for use in Ukraine. The White House yesterday said the Wagner Group took delivery of an arms shipment from North Korea to help bolster Russian forces in Ukraine, a sign of the group’s expanding role in the war. Pyongyang’s transaction with the Wagner Group “clearly violates international law and UN security council resolutions”, Canada’s foreign ministry said. Mélanie Joly, Canada’s foreign minister, said in a statement: We will continue to work with international partners to address these developments and respond to further arms deliveries should they take place. The Wagner group’s owner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, denied the White House’s accusation as “gossip and speculation”. North Korea’s foreign ministry also denied it had supplied munitions to Russia but did not make any mention of Wagner. If one battle more than any other has defined the brutality of Russia’s war in Ukraine, it is the three-month siege of Mariupol’s steelworks this spring, and the harrowing experience of its last defenders. Holed up in Azovstal, one of Europe’s largest metal-producing plants, hundreds of outnumbered, outgunned, wounded and emaciated Ukrainian soldiers, and more than 1,000 civilians, resisted one of Moscow’s fiercest military attacks for more than 80 days. “No one came out of there unchanged,” says Oksana, an Azovstal employee who asked not to give her full name. They were one person when they went in, and another person when they came out. Soon after the Russian invasion in late February, Mariupol was one of the first major cities to be encircled. Viewed as a key Kremlin objective, the city was the scene of a siege that the Red Cross has defined as “apocalyptic”. The outskirts of the city became the site of a mass grave, and the bodies of many more men, women and children were either dumped in the streets or remain buried beneath the rubble. Ukrainian authorities estimate that 22,000 people died during the fighting. Some survivors took refuge in the Azovstal steelworks, an industrial site covering an area of about four square miles, including a network of underground tunnels. With the civilians were about 3,000 soldiers, many of whom were members of the notorious Azov brigade, which, at its inception in 2014, included far-right volunteers, some with neo-Nazi affiliations. In recent years the brigade has been fully integrated into the Ukrainian military, but for President Vladimir Putin it was the perfect propaganda opportunity to convince the public that his narrative about the “nazification” of Ukraine was true, and that his army would hunt them down like rats. Never would Putin have imagined that the last defenders of Mariupol would defy his plan for so long. Cut off from the world and low on food, the defenders of Azovstal were holed up in the tunnels of the steelworks for over two months while the Russians launched rockets and incendiary bombs at the site.

Canada condemned what it said were North Korean arms deliveries to Russia, saying Pyongyang’s transaction with the private military company the Wagner Group “clearly violates international law and UN security council resolutions”. “We will continue to work with international partners to address these developments and respond to further arms deliveries should they take place,” the Canadian foreign affairs minister, Mélanie Joly, said in a statement. North Korea’s foreign ministry, in a statement, has denied that it has supplied munitions to Russia but did not make any mention of Wagner, Reuters reported. Two civilians have been killed by Russian shelling on the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine this morning, according to the regional prosecutor’s office. In a post on Telegram, it said: According to the investigation, in the morning of December 23, two local residents of the city of Kherson were killed in another shelling by Russian military personnel. Residential buildings and critical infrastructure were damaged. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, said Russian shelling of the Korabelnyi district in Kherson killed one person. The victim, a male, “sustained fatal mine blast injuries”, Tymoshenko wrote on Telegram. A Russian opposition politician has filed a legal challenge over President Vladimir Putin’s use of the word “war” to describe the conflict in Ukraine. Putin yesterday publicly acknowledged the situation as a “war” for the first time since he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February, after 10 months of calling his campaign a “special military operation”. In March, Putin formally signed a law that would impose harsh jail terms for people who intentionally spread “fake” information about Russia’s armed forces, including calling the war by its name. But the Russian leader said at a news conference on Thursday: Our goal is not to spin this flywheel of a military conflict, but, on the contrary, to end this war. This is what we are striving for. Nikita Yuferev, an opposition councillor in St Petersburg, has asked prosecutors to investigate Putin for using the word “war”, and accused the president of breaking his own law. In an open letter, he asked the prosecutor general and interior minister to “hold (Putin) responsible under the law for spreading fake news about the actions of the Russian army”. He told Reuters that he knew his legal challenge would go nowhere, but he had filed it to expose the “mendacity” of the system. Yuferev said: It’s important for me to do this to draw attention to the contradiction and the injustice of these laws that he (Putin) adopts and signs but which he himself doesn’t observe. I think the more we talk about this, the more people will doubt his honesty, his infallibility, and the less support he will have. Two people were injured after a car bomb exploded in the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol in south-eastern Ukraine, according to a local pro-Moscow official. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia province, told the state-owned Tass news agency: The blast occurred in front of the entrance to Gorky Park. A car exploded. The causes and circumstances are being investigated. He described the incident as a “terrorist attack” carried out by “militants of the Kyiv regime” to the Russian state-owned news agency Ria Novosti. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, wrote on Telegram that eyewitnesses reported a car was “blown up”. It has not been possible to independently verify these claims. Russian forces shelled the recently liberated Kherson region more than 60 times on Thursday, killing one person and injuring two others, according to the head of the region’s military administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych. Moscow’s troops “shelled the territory of Kherson region 61 times. The invaders attacked peaceful settlements of the region with artillery, MLRS, mortars and tanks”, Yanushevych wrote in an update on Facebook. About half the strikes hit Kherson city, striking residential blocks, educational institutions and private houses, he said. A kindergarten was also impacted, he added. The Kremlin has claimed that Russia has made significant progress towards “demilitarising” Ukraine – one of the initial goals of Russia’s invasion 10 months ago. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, was asked during a briefing about comments by President Vladimir Putin that Ukraine’s military-industrial complex “if not completely reset to zero, is getting there fast”. Peskov told reporters: It can be stated that there is significant progress towards demilitarisation. The Russian president said yesterday that “all armed conflicts end through negotiations” – implying that Ukraine would ultimately be forced to cede territory in exchange for peace. He also dismissed US supplies of Patriot missiles to Ukraine as old and said Russia’s missile systems would be able to shoot it down. Putin said: The Patriot air defence is outdated. An antidote will always be found … Russia will knock down the Patriot system. The Netherlands will provide Ukraine with up to €2.5bn (£2.2bn) in aid in 2023, the Dutch government has announced. The money is earmarked for military assistance, work to recover critical infrastructure and to help investigations into possible war crimes, it said. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, vowed that his country would provide assistance “as long as Russia continues its war against Ukraine”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, confirmed he had spoken with Rutte and thanked him for the €2.5bn aid. Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, has been quoted by the state-owned Tass news agency as saying that the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high”. Antonov was quoted comparing the state of US-Russia relations to an “ice age” and that it was hard to say when talks between the two sides could resume. Washington needed time “to realise the futility of its policy towards Moscow”, Antonov told the Russian state-run news agency. He said: Strictly speaking, today it is difficult to say when this dialogue - a dialogue on strategic stability - can be resumed. We did not freeze it, we did not declare a proxy war against the US, we did not throw the entire NATO military-industrial machinery into Ukrainian territory to fight the Russian Federation. The Kremlin yesterday accused the US of fighting a proxy war against Russia after Washington boosted military support for Ukraine and hosted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the White house and Congress. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday that the latest US support package – which includes the highly-sought after Patriot missile defence system – was “not conducive to a speedy settlement”. As part of the US support package, Ukrainian troops will learn how to use the Patriot surface-to-air missile battery systems in Germany, and it will be several months before they can deploy it on the battlefield. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again, taking over the live blog from Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest news from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. The time in Kyiv is nearly 1pm. Here is a round-up of the main news stories of the day so far: North Korea’s foreign ministry denied a media report it supplied munitions to Russia, calling it “groundless,” and denounced the United States for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, North Korea’s official KCNA news agency reported on Friday. Japan’s Tokyo Shimbun reported earlier that North Korea had shipped munitions, including artillery shells, to Russia via train through their border last month and that additional shipments were expected in the coming weeks. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, posted a video on Friday saying he was back at work in Kyiv after his landmark visit to Washington this week. “I am in my office. We are working toward victory,” he said in the video posted to his Telegram channel. A senior Russian diplomat has said talks on security guarantees for Russia cannot take place while Nato instructors and “mercenaries” remain in Ukraine, and while western arms supplies to the country continue. In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency TASS, Alexander Darchiev, head of the Russian foreign ministry’s North America department, said talks would be premature “until the flood of weapons and financing for the [Ukrainian president Volodymyr] Zelenskiy regime stops, American and Nato servicemen/mercenaries/instructors are withdrawn”. Russia’s ambassador to the United States said on Friday that the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high”, Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported. TASS cited Anatoly Antonov as saying that it was hard to say when talks on strategic dialogue between the two sides could resume, but that talks on prisoner swaps had been “effective” and would continue. The top Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said on Friday that shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, had “almost stopped”. Speaking on Russian state television, governor Yevgeny Balitsky said Russian troops would not leave the nuclear plant, and that it would never return to Ukrainian control. Australia’s financial intelligence agency has warned Russian paramilitary groups are soliciting cryptocurrency donations to buy weapons and that Australians have donated to terrorist organisations overseas. Senior executives at Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) also said cryptocurrency has become a “standard part of the money-laundering tool kit” for organised crime groups in Australia. Air raid sirens were sounding shortly before 7am in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, the regional governor Vitalli Kim indicated on Telegram, in a series of posts saying, “Air alarm”. Kherson governor Yaroslav Yanushevych also posted an air raid alarm, but shortly afterwards said that the alert was over. The White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. The US is imposing fresh sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities over Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. Six of the entities targeted in the latest sanctions were designated for operating or having operated in both the defence and related material sector and the marine sector of the Russian economy, the US state department said on Thursday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the Patriot air defence the US was supplying to Ukraine was an old weapons system that Russia would be able to “knock down”. “The Patriot air defence is an outdated system,” Putin told reporters in Moscow, adding that Russia’s S-300 system outperformed it. A Russian-installed official in a part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region controlled by Russian forces was killed on Thursday in a car bomb attack, according to the pro-Moscow local administration. Andrei Shtepa, the pro-Russian head of the village of Lyubimovka in the Kherson region, reportedly died after a car blew up, it said, blaming “Ukrainian terrorists”. The report has not been able to be independently verified. German authorities said they arrested an employee of the country’s foreign intelligence service on suspicion of treason for allegedly passing information to Russia. The suspect, a German citizen identified only as Carsten L, was arrested in Berlin on Wednesday, federal prosecutors said in a statement. It comes just days after Austria said it had identified a 39-year-old Greek citizen it suspected of spying for Russia. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for the time being. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s ambassador to the United States said on Friday that the risk of a clash between the US and Russia was “high”, Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported. TASS cited Anatoly Antonov as saying that it was hard to say when talks on strategic dialogue between the two sides could resume, but that talks on prisoner swaps had been “effective” and would continue. The top Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said on Friday that shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, had “almost stopped”. Speaking on Russian state television, governor Yevgeny Balitsky said Russian troops would not leave the nuclear plant, and that it would never return to Ukrainian control. A destroyed building in Bakhmut, eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, posted a video on Friday saying he was back at work in Kyiv after his landmark visit to Washington this week. “I am in my office. We are working toward victory,” he said in the video posted to his Telegram channel. In early 2022, the Ukrainian photojournalist Evgeny Maloletka was covering violence in Kazakhstan when his attention turned back home: there were several reports signalling that Russia was preparing an invasion. He didn’t have to think twice: he knew he had to be back in his home country. By mid-January, he was already working on assignment for the Associated Press in the city of Kharkiv and the Donbas region, in eastern Ukraine, where there was a growing tension among Russian proxies. Maloletka was based in Kharkiv, 25 miles from some of the tens of thousands of Russian troops massed at the border, as diplomatic efforts to find a solution continued. When Maloletka and the AP team estimated that the invasion was imminent, they moved to the city of Mariupol, in south-east Ukraine. They thought that if war broke out, Mariupol would be key because it was a strategic seaport. They were not wrong. South Korea’s foreign ministry said on Friday it condemns North Korea’s arms shipment to a private Russian military company, the Wagner Group, adding it supports the United States’ push to raise the issue at the UN security council. The White House said on Thursday North Korea has completed an initial arms delivery to the Wagner Group to help bolster Russian forces in Ukraine. A senior Russian diplomat has said that talks on security guarantees for Russia cannot take place while Nato instructors and “mercenaries” remain in Ukraine, and while western arms supplies to the country continue. In an interview with the Russian state-owned news agency Tass, Alexander Darchiev, head of the Russian foreign ministry’s North America department, said talks would be premature “until the flood of weapons and financing for the [Ukrainian president Volodymyr] Zelenskiy regime stops, American and Nato servicemen/mercenaries/instructors are withdrawn”. Russia typically refers to foreign volunteers fighting with the Ukrainian army as “mercenaries”, and has convicted captured foreign fighters of acting as such, Reuters reports. Australia’s financial intelligence agency has warned Russian paramilitary groups are soliciting cryptocurrency donations to buy weapons and that Australians have donated to terrorist organisations overseas. Senior executives at Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) also said cryptocurrency has become a “standard part of the money-laundering tool kit” for organised crime groups in Australia. The agency’s deputy chief executive and head of intelligence, John Moss, said crypto was no longer considered a “niche option” for criminal activity and had become more mainstream. “We are now seeing more traditional money laundering being displaced into cryptocurrency, particularly to send money offshore,” he said. Moss said Russian groups have been soliciting digital currency donations on social media to buy weapons, drones and armour for the conflict in Ukraine: Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s surprise visit to Washington – the Ukrainian president’s first overseas trip since the Russian invasion 300 days ago – started with a secretive train ride to Poland late on Tuesday. The next morning he arrived in the southern Polish city of Przemysl, where he was spotted at the train station, according to footage from private broadcaster TVN, along with the US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, who accompanied him. Zelenskiy’s visit had been planned for days and organised in secret because of concerns about his safety, but details were tweeted on Tuesday by a reporter from US-based newsletter Punchbowl News. In Poland, Zelenskiy boarded a US government plane which landed at about noon EST on Wednesday at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland near Washington. He traveled by motorcade to Blair House, the presidential guest house along Pennsylvania Avenue, and after freshening up from his trip went to the nearby White House, where he was greeted by President Joe Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden. The air raid warning for Mykolaiv has ended, local governor Vitalii Kim has said on Telegram. Back to North Korea: According to the White House, Wagner took delivery of infantry rockets and missiles from North Korea, though Wagner owner Yevgeny Prigozhin denied the assertion as “gossip and speculation”, Reuters reports. “The DPRK remains unchanged in its principled stand on the issue of ‘arms transaction’ between the DPRK and Russia which has never happened,” the North Korean spokesperson said, adding it is the US that’s “bringing bloodshed and destruction to Ukraine by providing it with various kinds of lethal weapons”. DPRK are the initials of the North’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Air raid sirens were sounding shortly before 7am in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, the regional governor Vitalli Kim indicated on Telegram, in a series of posts saying, “Air alarm”. Kherson governor Yaroslav Yanushevych also posted an air raid alarm, but shortly afterwards said that the alert was over. North Korea’s foreign ministry denied a media report it supplied munitions to Russia, calling it “groundless,” and denounced the United States for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, the North’s official KCNA news agency reported on Friday. Japan’s Tokyo Shimbun reported earlier that North Korea had shipped munitions, including artillery shells, to Russia via train through their border last month and that additional shipments were expected in the coming weeks. “The Japanese media’s false report that the DPRK offered munitions to Russia is the most absurd red herring, which is not worth any comment or interpretation,” a ministry spokesperson said in a statement carried by the KCNA. The White House said on Thursday the North has completed an initial arms delivery to a private Russian military company, the Wagner Group, to help bolster Russian forces in Ukraine. The North Korean foreign ministry statement did not make any mention of Wagner, Reuters reports. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments for the next few hours. It is 7.30 in Kyiv. Our top stories this morning: North Korea’s foreign ministry denied a media report it supplied munitions to Russia, calling it “groundless,” and denounced the United States for providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, the North’s official KCNA news agency reported on Friday. And in Mykolaiv, in southern Ukraine, air raid sirens sounded early this morning, according to the region’s mayor, Vitalii Kim on Telegram. More on these stories shortly. Here are the other key recent developments: The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he was returning to Ukraine “with good results” after his visit to Washington. In his first video message after meeting with Joe Biden and addressing the US Congress, Zelenskiy thanked the president “for his help, his international leadership and his determination to win”. Zelenskiy gave a defiant address to the joint session of Congress on Wednesday, saying Washington’s continued support was key to ultimate victory. His trip to the US – his first since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – came amid concern that the incoming Republican leadership of the House of Representatives might oppose proposals for an additional $45bn in weapons and other assistance next year. The White House announced a further $1.85bn in aid including, for the first time, Patriot air defence missiles to protect Ukraine’s infrastructure, already crippled by Russian attacks. The US is imposing fresh sanctions on 10 Russian naval entities over Russian operations against Ukrainian ports, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. Six of the entities targeted in the latest sanctions were designated for operating or having operated in both the defence and related material sector and the marine sector of the Russian economy, the US state department said on Thursday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the Patriot air defence the US was supplying to Ukraine was an old weapons system that Russia would be able to “knock down”. “The Patriot air defence is an outdated system,” Putin told reporters in Moscow, adding that Russia’s S-300 system outperformed it. Answering a question on the possibility to end the war with Ukraine through diplomatic means, Putin said that “all armed conflicts end through negotiations”. The Kremlin said the US supply of Patriot missile systems to Kyiv would not contribute to settling the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and would not prevent Moscow from achieving its goals. A Russian-installed official in a part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region controlled by Russian forces was killed on Thursday in a car bomb attack, according to the pro-Moscow local administration. Andrei Shtepa, the pro-Russian head of the village of Lyubimovka in the Kherson region, reportedly died after a car blew up, it said, blaming “Ukrainian terrorists”. The report has not been able to be independently verified. German authorities said they arrested an employee of the country’s foreign intelligence service on suspicion of treason for allegedly passing information to Russia. The suspect, a German citizen identified only as Carsten L, was arrested in Berlin on Wednesday, federal prosecutors said in a statement. It comes just days after Austria said it had identified a 39-year-old Greek citizen it suspected of spying for Russia. Vladimir Putin called Israel’s prime minister-designate, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Thursday to congratulate him on forming a government and to discuss the situation in Ukraine, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office. Netanyahu told Putin “he hopes a way will be found quickly to end the war [with Ukraine] and the suffering caused by it”, it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/nov/12/autumn-statement-which-tax-rises-and-spending-cuts-are-most-likely","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-12T06:00:33Z","webTitle":"Autumn statement: which tax rises and spending cuts are most likely?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/12/autumn-statement-which-tax-rises-and-spending-cuts-are-most-likely","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/nov/12/autumn-statement-which-tax-rises-and-spending-cuts-are-most-likely","fields":{"headline":"Autumn statement: which tax rises and spending cuts are most likely?","bodyText":"When he was chancellor, Rishi Sunak’s Treasury would routinely leak many elements of his budgets in advance, and there has been a similar wealth of informed speculation about how, as prime minister, he can fill the estimated £60bn gap in the UK’s public finances in next week’s autumn statement. With much fiscal misery expected, there is a benefit for Sunak and his chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, in floating possible options to gauge the reaction – and it is likely that some ideas mentioned in newspapers never make the cut. But here are some of the ideas on the table, in terms of tax rises and spending cuts, and the likelihood of them being implemented. Stealth tax increases Perhaps the easiest tax rise a government can make: fail to upgrade tax band thresholds in line with inflation, or at all, and the extra receipts could run into the billions. The most likely are income tax thresholds, which will bring the greatest extra income. Among the levies forecast to be subject to “fiscal drag”, as it is also known, are inheritance tax, capital gains tax and dividend tax relief. Political impact: Would not be popular with low-tax Tories, but after the implosion of Liz Truss’s fiscal plan there is more tolerance than normal for such ideas. Fiscal impact: There is big money at stake. While a freeze in the inheritance tax “nil-rate band” from 2025-26 to 2027-28, would raise an additional £500m, the Treasury would gain £30bn from high inflation should Hunt extend a freeze on income tax bands. Likelihood: 4/5 Cuts to capital spending One of the temptations in cancelling or trimming big projects is that you can write billions off the government balance sheet with a few taps of the keyboard. Furthermore, you are getting rid of something that does not yet exist, and so could be easily forgotten by voters. Projects reportedly in the Treasury’s crosshairs include the Sizewell C nuclear power station and elements of HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail. Political impact: Potentially toxic, especially among MPs whose areas are affected, who will argue that long-term growth and productivity will be hurt by such cuts. Fiscal impact: Tempting though it may be when tens of billions of pounds can be saved, delaying or cancelling big infrastructure projects, especially if they reduce the UK’s reliance on fossil fuels, will be a big blow to the future productivity and competitiveness of the British economy. Likelihood of some cuts: 4/5. Of scrapping a major project: 2/5 Real-terms cuts to benefits or pensions With working-age benefits in Great Britain costing nearly £88bn a year, and spending on pensions and pension-age benefits being north of £110bn, the savings are obvious if either or both are uprated by, say, 5% rather than the current inflation level of nearer 10%. While broadly similar in approach to a stealth tax rise, it would be much more noticeable and controversial. Political impact: Tricky, which is why there has been much speculation that Hunt will increase both by inflation. But the savings cannot be ignored. Fiscal impact: For pensions, limiting the annual increase to the rise in earnings would save £6bn in each of the next two financial years, while working-age benefits would be £7bn lower than if they were linked to rises in inflation. Likelihood: 2/5 Some sort of increase to the top rate of tax Weeks after Kwasi Kwarteng announced the abolition of the 45p top rate of income tax in Truss’s ill-starred mini-budget, there is talk that the rate could now rise – though a much more likely outcome is a lowering of the current £150,000 point at which people start to pay the top rate, potentially by a significant sum. Political impact: Kwarteng and Truss hailed the abolition of the 45p rate as removing a tax on aspiration, and some Tory MPs will deeply dislike such a move by Hunt. But as Truss found out, cutting taxes for the rich is not vastly popular elsewhere. Fiscal impact: There are only modest gains for the Treasury from dragging more people into the 45p rate of tax. When the annual receipts from all taxpayers above £150,000 is about £2bn a year, shifting the threshold will raise only hundreds of millions of pounds. Likelihood of a lower threshold: 3/5 Expanded windfall tax Between campaigning to become prime minister and beginning her brief time in No 10, Truss changed her mind on Sunak’s windfall tax for energy firms, which she had initially condemned as a disincentive to invest. The version implemented under Sunak had significant opt-outs for new investments in fossil fuels, meaning Shell paid nothing despite £26bn in profits. Alok Sharma, the Cop26 president, is among those who have called for a revised version. Political impact: Sunak has, like Truss, warned against a Labour-style windfall tax as a drag on enterprise. Much like Truss, if he does make a U-turn then it is likely to be quite popular, beyond some Tory MPs. But it doesn’t feel very Sunak-like. Fiscal impact: There is no evidence that energy firms will cut investment if they are forced to give up some of their windfall gains. A broader tax on the industry with fewer opt-outs could see receipts increase from £5bn to £10bn. Likelihood: 2/5 Delaying the cap in social care This was, however imperfect in outcome, one of the flagship policies of Boris Johnson, and was due to come into force in October 2023. Some reports say Sunak wants to delay this for two years, and possibly permanently, saving up to £2bn a year. This would, however, mark yet another failure to get to grips with one of the UK’s most pressing chronic policy problems. Political impact: Likely to cause a storm among Tory voters and thus MPs, given that the cap’s ambition of preventing older people from needing to sell their homes to pay for care disproportionately helps people in better-off areas. Fiscal impact: Proposals for a now scrapped rise of 1.25 percentage points in national insurance contributions were to pay for increased health spending and more cash for social care, with a cap on care costs. NHS funding is secure, but social care looks like losing out again, even though older and disabled people will find themselves in hospital for longer than they need, increasing NHS bills. Likelihood: 3/5 Changes to non-domiciled tax status While entirely abolishing the ability of people with overseas tax jurisdiction to avoid paying UK taxes on their income – something enjoyed by Sunak’s wife for a period – seems unlikely, there is speculation about fairly significant changes, such as cutting the permitted duration from 15 to five years, potentially raising £1.6bn a year. Political impact: Not likely to worry voters, but it could alarm plenty of non-dom Tory donors, which is a demographic the party very much does not want to fall out with. Fiscal impact: Some workers brought in from abroad claim non-dom status. They fill vacant, low-paid posts but deny the exchequer tax receipts. The difficulties separating the good non-dom from the bad has usually scuppered changes. Likelihood: 2/5 Increases to council tax Not directly a Treasury tax rise, as this would be done by local authorities. But with grants to councils set to be frozen, one idea being considered is allowing council tax to go up by 3% or more without a referendum, as is needed currently. Political impact: This would be unpopular, but as with much of George Osborne’s 2010-era austerity, outsourcing the pain to councils is tempting for the Treasury. Fiscal impact: With councils claiming they face a £15bn shortfall going into the budget from Osborne’s austerity measures, being told again they can only recoup their losses from higher council tax bills would cripple many services. Likelihood: 3/5 • This article was amended on 17 November 2022 to remove an unsubstantiated reference to “many of the nurses brought in from abroad” claiming non-dom status."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/06/putin-rubbing-hands-with-glee-after-eu-votes-to-class-gas-and-nuclear-as-green","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-06T12:31:49Z","webTitle":"‘Putin rubbing hands with glee’ after EU votes to class gas and nuclear as green","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/06/putin-rubbing-hands-with-glee-after-eu-votes-to-class-gas-and-nuclear-as-green","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/06/putin-rubbing-hands-with-glee-after-eu-votes-to-class-gas-and-nuclear-as-green","fields":{"headline":"‘Putin rubbing hands with glee’ after EU votes to class gas and nuclear as green","bodyText":"The European parliament has backed plans to label gas and nuclear energy as “green”, rejecting appeals from prominent Ukrainians and climate activists that the proposals are a gift to Vladimir Putin. One senior MEP said the vote was a “dark day for the climate”, while experts said the EU had set a dangerous precedent for countries to follow. The row began late last year with the leak of long-awaited details on the EU’s green investment guidebook, intended to help investors channel billions to the clean power transition. The European Commission decided some gas and nuclear projects could be included in the EU taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic activities, subject to certain conditions. Under the plans, gas can be classed as a sustainable investment if “the same energy capacity cannot be generated with renewable sources” and plans are in place to switch to renewables or “low-carbon gases”. Nuclear power can be called green if a project promises to deal with radioactive waste. The plan could only be stopped by a majority of EU member states or members of the European parliament. With most EU governments in favour, attention turned to the European parliament, but on Wednesday MEPs failed to muster a blocking majority. Only 282 MEPs voted in favour of an amendment against the inclusion of gas and nuclear, falling short of the 353 votes needed to overturn the decision. Bas Eickhout, the vice-president of the European parliament’s environment committee, said it was “dark day for the climate and energy transition”. The veteran Dutch MEP, who led the parliament in intra-EU negotiations on the taxonomy regulation, said the EU was “sending a disastrous signal to investors and the rest of the world” that it recognised fossil gas and nuclear as sustainable investments. “By clearing the way for this delegated act, the EU will have unreliable and greenwashed conditions for green investments in the energy sector,” he said. Svitlana Krakovska, a Ukrainian climate scientist and member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said: “I am in shock. Russia’s war against Ukraine is a war paid for by climate-heating fossil fuels and the European parliament just voted to boost billions of funding to fossil gas from Russia. How in the world is that in line with Europe’s stance to protect our planet and stand with Ukraine?” Johanne Schroeten, a policy adviser at the E3G climate thinktank, said: “Vested interests seem to have gotten the upper hand. The EU has now set a dangerous precedent of low ambition for other countries and jurisdictions to follow.” The deal came after the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, promised Emmanuel Macron that France could have the green seal of approval for nuclear projects, which prompted gas-consuming countries to demand a similar concession. Campaigners are now vowing legal action. WWF said that with its fellow NGO Client Earth it would “explore all potential avenues for further action to stop this greenwashing and protect the credibility of the whole EU taxonomy”. Two anti-nuclear states, Austria and Luxembourg, have already announced they will take the commission to the European court of justice. But the proposals have powerful backers. Romania’s president, Klaus Iohannis, tweeted that he welcomed the “positive results”, adding: “I am glad that Romania’s constant efforts on considering gas and nuclear as part of progressive decarbonisation were reflected in the EP’s final decision.” The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through so-called delegated acts – secondary legislation intended for technical issues. Critics are now asking how such highly controversial plans could be passed through a form of lawmaking with few hurdles and less scrutiny. Activist fears were fuelled when Russia’s energy minister, Nikolai Shulginov, said the EU’s green taxonomy offered “a range of opportunities”. Speaking to the Energy Intelligence website before his country’s invasion of Ukraine, he said the inclusion of natural gas in the green taxonomy was evidence that the EU had realised it had made “a slight mistake” on the green transition. Since the invasion, the EU executive has set out plans to phase out Russian gas, but member states have not fixed a deadline to stop gas imports, unlike Russian oil and coal. The Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun tweeted: “Putin is rubbing his hands with glee today,” adding that the MEPs who had voted for or abstained on the inclusion of gas and nuclear in thegreen taxonomy had handed the Russian president “huge gifts”. She said: “I thank the brave 278 MEPs who objected. It wasn’t enough, but we won’t stop fighting.” • This article was amended on 6 July 2022 to clarify that while some prominent Ukrainian politicians came out against the EU vote on the green taxonomy, this was not the position of the state of Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/28/putin-is-trapped-and-desperate-will-his-friends-in-the-west-rescue-him-russia-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-28T09:00:24Z","webTitle":"Putin is trapped and desperate.

Will his friends in the west rescue him?","bodyText":"‘The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.” So wrote American author Henry David Thoreau in 1854. It’s a fate that is rapidly overtaking Vladimir Putin as he struggles to escape the disastrous trap he set for himself in Ukraine. Russia’s president keeps understandably schtum about his “special military operation”. But indefinite stalemate is not what he expected. He didn’t expect car bombs in Moscow and humiliating attacks on fortress Crimea, either. Least of all did Putin anticipate 80,000 Russian soldiers dead or wounded. Dying with them is his Peter the Great pipe dream of a “greater Russia”. Extinct already is his reputation as anything other than a killer and a crook. An endless military quagmire is not a scenario Putin can afford as slow-burn western sanctions corrode his economy and his military’s manpower and materiel are steadily depleted. So what are his options? He could declare a specious victory, claim the Nato “threat” is neutralised and propose a settlement recognising Russia’s annexation of occupied areas. But he surely knows Kyiv will never willingly accept such terms. He could gamble on a huge battlefield escalation, for example, using Belarus to open a second front north of Kyiv – the region he failed to overrun in February. But it’s uncertain his generals have the capability or the stomach. He certainly dare not retreat. So as pressure on him grows to produce a breakthrough, Putin may well decide his best option is to raise the cost of the war to Ukraine’s backers – and undermine Kyiv’s resistance that way. In fact, he has already begun. It’s telling that British, French and German leaders all proclaimed long-term support for Ukraine last week. They know Putin is betting they will buckle. The context is rising anxiety over Europe’s energy and cost of living crises, largely caused by the invasion and Kremlin cuts to gas supplies. The winter fallout from this coldest of cold wars could prove paralysing. Yet Putin may just be getting started. He has many means by which to undermine western unity and staying power. Europe is littered with easily exploited potential flashpoints and geopolitical faultlines bequeathed from Soviet times. Likewise, Russia has surprising numbers of allies and sympathisers scattered across a politically fractured European landscape. So will Putin’s friends in the west help rescue the beast from the east? Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko is already in Putin’s pocket. Moscow ensured the dictator survived after his theft of the 2020 presidential election provoked nationwide protests. Lukashenko will do as he’s told. Inside the EU, Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, is seen as Putin’s Trojan horse. Like many on Europe’s far right, Orbán admires his intolerant nationalist ideology and shares his racist, homophobic outlook. He has repeatedly obstructed EU sanctions. Last month he cut a unilateral gas deal with the Kremlin. Orbán plainly cannot be trusted. The collapse in June of Bulgaria’s reformist government and subsequent talk of repairing relations with Moscow fuels concern that Putin is gaining leverage to divide the EU. Italy has plenty of Putin fans, too. Leaders of two far-right parties that are expected to join a ruling coalition after next month’s elections have enjoyed close ties with Moscow over the years. Matteo Salvini’s League formed an alliance with Putin’s United Russia in 2017. Silvio Berlusconi of Forza Italia is a personal friend. Italy’s ousted prime minister Mario Draghi took a tough line on Ukraine. That may change. Other European far-right (and far-left) insurgent and populist parties identify to varying degrees with Putinist ideology and conservative social values. They echo his hostility to the EU. A definitive European Council on Foreign Relations study in 2016 listed Germany’s Alternative for Germany, France’s Front National (now National Rally), Austria’s Freedom party and Belgium’s Vlaams Belang as “pro-Russian”. Ukip made the cut, too. “The parties … help legitimise the Kremlin’s policies and amplify Russian disinformation. At times they can shift Europe’s domestic debates in Russia’s favour,” the study said. In Putinworld, such channels of influence are potent weapons. Putin can also rely on mainstream non-EU politicians such as Aleksandar Vučić, Serbia’s president, for a sympathetic hearing. Vučić has been dubbed “little Putin” by opponents. Serbia has profound historical, Slavic and religious ties to Russia, plus a shared distrust of Nato. The alliance’s 1999 bombing of Belgrade is not forgotten. The EU and UK fear the volatile western Balkans are a critical pressure point Putin could use to stir up old conflicts and distract attention from Ukraine. Kosovo, where ethnic Serb agitation is building again, is a case in point. Vučić last week threatened international peacekeepers with intervention. “We will save our people from persecution and pogroms if Nato doesn’t want to do it,” he said. Bosnian Serb leaders tied to Moscow also threaten new ruptures in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bosnia has echoed Serbia’s rejection of “hysterical” western sanctions. In March, pro-Putin Bosnian Serb “Night Wolves” bikers cheered the invasion. Partitioned Moldova and Georgia, with divided populations and Russian troops on their soil, are also potential flashpoints. Another is Kaliningrad, where Putin deployed hypersonic missiles this month to intimidate the Nato neighbours. Estonia, in particular, with its ethnic Russian minority, appears a target. Putin’s efforts to spread fear and instability, disruption and economic pain – making countries think twice about opposing Russia – extend beyond Europe. His vetoes have left the UN security council frozen in time. Now he and China’s Xi Jinping look set to turn November’s important post-pandemic G20 summit in Bali into a crude west-versus-the-rest showdown over Ukraine. No matter that Russia’s whole argument is based on a lie. Putin’s reckless brinkmanship at Ukraine’s occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant suggests he’ll risk almost anything to win. Quietly desperate, he grows more dangerous by the day. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The bill – the Inflation Reduction Act – was virtually dead in the water before a last-minute turnaround by the conservative West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin saw it suddenly revived. It then endured another round of political horse-trading as it navigated the choppy waters of a 50-50 split Senate. But, being carried by a tie-breaking vote from Biden’s vice-president, Kamala Harris, it emerged mostly intact. And, after a vote in the House later this week, it is set to land on Biden’s Oval Office desk. Here is what’s in it and what it means: Overview The estimated $740bn package is full of Democratic priorities. Those include capping prescription drug costs at $2,000 out of pocket for seniors, helping Americans pay for private health insurance, and what Democrats are calling the most substantial investment in history to fight the climate crisis: $375bn over the decade. Almost half the money raised, $300bn, will go toward paying down federal deficits. It’s paid for largely with new corporate taxes, including a 15% minimum tax on big corporations to ensure they don’t skip paying any taxes at all, as well as projected federal savings from lower Medicare drug costs. It’s not at all clear the 755-page bill will substantially ease inflationary pressures, though millions of Americans are expected to see some relief in healthcare and other costs. What does it mean for Biden? For Biden, the bill’s passage delivers a much-needed domestic win at a time when his popularity has sunk and key midterm elections loom in November. Though the bill has been stripped of much of his original ambitious program, it remains a major achievement. Biden can now go to the polls and portray himself as a president able to get things done even in the difficult political circumstances of a deeply divided country. Climate crisis The bill would invest nearly $375bn over the decade in climate-fighting strategies, including investments in renewable energy production and tax rebates for consumers to buy new or used electric vehicles. It’s broken down to include $60bn for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and $30bn for a production tax credit for wind and solar, seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country’s dependence on fossil fuels. The bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as ExxonMobil have invested millions of dollars to advance. The bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters. A late addition pushed by Senator Kyrsten Sinema and other Democrats in Arizona, Nevada and Colorado would designate $4bn to combat a mega-drought in the west, including conservation efforts in the Colorado river basin, on which nearly 40 million Americans rely for drinking water. For consumers, there are tax breaks as incentives to go green. One is a 10-year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar. There are tax breaks for buying electric vehicles, including a $4,000 tax credit for purchase of used electric vehicles and $7,500 for new ones. In all, Democrats believe the strategy could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030, and “would represent the single biggest climate investment in US history, by far”. Prescription drug costs Launching a long-sought goal, the bill would allow the Medicare program to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, saving the federal government $288bn over the 10-year budget window. Those new revenues would be put back into lower costs for seniors on medications, including a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies. Seniors would also have insulin prices capped at $35 a dose. A provision to extend that price cap on insulin to Americans with private health insurances was out of line with Senate budget rules and Republicans stripped it from the final bill. Health insurance The bill would extend the subsidies provided during the pandemic to help some Americans who buy health insurance on their own. Under earlier pandemic relief, the extra help was set to expire this year. But the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years, lowering insurance premiums for people who are buying their own healthcare policies. How is it paid for? The biggest revenue-raiser in the bill is a new 15% minimum tax on corporations that earn more than $1bn in annual profits. The new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than $258bn over the decade. The revenue would have been higher, but Sinema insisted on one change to the 15% corporate minimum, allowing a depreciation deduction used by manufacturing industries. That shaves about $55bn off the total revenue. To win over Sinema, Democrats dropped plans to close a tax loophole long enjoyed by wealthier Americans – so-called carried interest, which under current law taxes wealthy hedge fund managers and others at a 20% rate. Money is also raised by boosting the IRS to go after tax cheats. The bill proposes an $80bn investment in taxpayer services, enforcement and modernization, which is projected to raise $203bn in new revenue – a net gain of $124bn over the decade.

He repeated warnings that Russia was preparing for strikes in the Donbas region and Kharkiv. In a video address late on Friday, he said Russian troops in the north of the country were slowly pulling back. Zelenskiy also said that Russia was trying to conscript troops from Crimea, but said that being drafted to fight in Ukraine was “guaranteed death for many young guys”. He warned their families: “We don’t need more dead people here. Save your children so they do not become villains. Don’t send them.” Ukraine exchanged 86 members of their armed forces with Russia today, according to senior Ukrainian officials. Russia says Ukrainian helicopters attacked an oil storage facility in Belgorod, Russia, about 16 miles from the border and close to Kharkiv, destroying fuel tanks. Ukrainian officials have denied their forces were involved. The UK Ministry of Defence says the destruction of oil tanks at a depot in the Russian city of Belgorod means probable loss of fuel and ammunition supplies to invading forces. It will likely add more strain to Russia’s already stretched logistic chains. Supplies to Russian forces encircling Kharkhiv may be particularly affected. The US department of defense will provide an additional $300 million in security assistance to Ukraine, to include laser-guided rocket systems, drones, and commercial satellite imagery services. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, earlier spoke with Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kulebo today and discussed “ways the US allies and partners are helping Ukraine defend against Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified war”, Blinken said. The US State Department said Washington will continue to provide support to Ukraine and won’t push the country to make concessions in negotiations with Russia following a report that said Britain was concerned the US, France and Germany will push Ukraine to “settle” in a peace deal. The US military has cancelled plans to test an intercontinental ballistic missile in an effort to reduce tensions with Russia. Zelenskiy also said more than 3,000 people had been led to safety from the besieged city of Mariupol. More than 6,000 in total had been rescued from Mariupol, Donetsk, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had been unable to reach the city but will try again to evacuate civilians on Saturday. The Hollywood actor Sean Penn has called for a billionaire to come forward and buy two squadrons of F-15 or F-16 aircraft for Ukraine in an unlikely attempt to tip the scales against the Russian invaders in the five-week-old war. European governments have more time to figure out how they are going to act on Russia’s demand to pay for Russia gas in rubles after the Kremlin said today that it would not immediately halt gas supplies Around 200 Ukrainian national guard members have likely been taken prisoner by the Russian troops as they withdrew from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the mayor of Slavutych, Yuri Fomichev, said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/apr/01/post-your-questions-for-devo","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-01T16:08:47Z","webTitle":"Post your questions for Devo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/01/post-your-questions-for-devo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/apr/01/post-your-questions-for-devo","fields":{"headline":"Post your questions for Devo","bodyText":"In their boiler suits and stepped hats, looking like employees of a particularly whimsical nuclear power facility, Devo have one of the most distinctive looks in pop – and some of the most distinctive songs. Nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year, they will be joining us to answer your questions. Formed in Ohio in the early 1970s around two sets of brothers – Mark and Bob Mothersbaugh, and Gerald and Bob Casale – the group had been galvanised into action by the horror of the 1970 Kent State massacre of student protesters: “We were pissed off, and we wanted to take the energy that comes from that anger and channel it,” said early member Bob Lewis. What emerged was a band whose absurdist humour and theatricality poked fun at a conformist America that was, per their name, devolving rather than improving. Playing confrontational gigs and making odd, ambitious music videos, they were a cult curiosity until the patronage of David Bowie and Iggy Pop helped them get signed to Warner Bros, with Brian Eno producing their 1978 debut album Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! Their twitchy, tautly funky cover of the Rolling Stones’ (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction was even more pent-up than the original, and a performance of it on Saturday Night Live sent them nationwide. Songs such as Jocko Homo and their cover of Johnny Rivers’ Secret Agent Man further grew their popularity, but they truly went overground – without sacrificing any of their surreality – with 1980 single Whip It, a blend of synth-pop and surf-rock which reached the US Top 20. It was the Devo project in glorious miniature: satirising America’s violence, emotional repression and brutal cult of productivity via joyous pop music. The accompanying album Freedom of Choice went platinum and the follow-up New Traditionalists – for which the band all adopted JFK’s hairdo – was a hit. They also appeared in Neil Young’s film oddity Human Highway, though some flop albums and waning popularity later in the decade led them to split in 1991. Frontman Mark Mothersbaugh’s sparky sense of humour helped him segue into music for children’s shows such as Rugrats, then film scores for Wes Anderson (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou), and even dipped into the Marvel universe with his score for Thor: Ragnarok (featuring such orchestral works as Devil’s Anus). Devo re-formed for concerts in 1996 and have frequently toured in the years since, and released one further album, 2010’s Something for Everybody. In May, the band are hoping it’s third time lucky after two previous nominations for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Mark Mothersbaugh and founding bassist Gerald Casale – who have strongly condemned Putin’s actions in Ukraine and are donating next month’s Devo royalties to humanitarian charities working in the country – are joining us to answer your questions about their madcap career. Post them in the comments below, and we’ll publish their answers in the 15 April edition of our Film &amp; Music section, plus online."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/07/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-287-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-07T00:08:31Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 287 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-287-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/07/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-287-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 287 of the invasion","bodyText":"President Vladimir Putin has said Russia will “defend ourselves with all the means at our disposal” and warned that the threat of nuclear war is “on the rise”. In an address to his human rights council, Russia’s leader said his army’s “special military operation” in Ukraine could be a “long process”, but he saw no need to mobilise additional soldiers at this point. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Russia is attempting to “freeze” the fighting in Ukraine over the winter to prepare its forces for a renewed assault early next year. Stoltenberg urged Nato allies to continue sending weapons to Kyiv over the winter, adding that the conditions for a peaceful settlement to the war are “not there now”. Oleksandr Starukh, the Zaporizhzhia regional governor, said on Telegram that Russia launched drone and missile strikes on two villages overnight, injuring a 15-year-old girl and two other people. The Guardian has not been able to verify the reports independently. A road accident in the temporarily occupied eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk has left 16 people dead and several injured, according to a Russian-backed official and state media. The accident involved a minibus and a truck, whose passengers included soldiers, and took place between Torez and Shakhtarsk, emergency services told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Shelling by Ukrainian forces killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk on Tuesday, according to the Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin. The head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council, Maria Pirogova. Dmytro Zhyvytsky, the governor of Sumy region on the Russian border, said several people were wounded when Russian forces fired 226 shells on seven communities during the day. A drone attack set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. The drone attack came a day after Ukraine appeared to launch attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. For Kyiv the strike represented an unprecedented operation to disrupt the Kremlin strategy of trying to cripple the Ukrainian electrical grid to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe in a country on the verge of winter. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said 31 “suspicious packages” had been sent to Ukrainian missions in 15 countries. In the past week, Ukraine says its embassies and consultants across Europe have received “bloody” packages, some containing animal eyes, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, has called on the country’s western allies to boycott Russian culture. Writing in the Guardian, Tkachenko argues that a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war would be “pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion”. The Kremlin said Vladimir Putin met senior officials on Tuesday to discuss “domestic security”, and Russia was taking “necessary” measures to fend off more Ukrainian attacks. One of the attacks struck the key Engels airfield in the Saratov region, where Russia keeps some of its strategic nuclear bombers. The Kremlin has said a US military aid spending bill providing $800m to Ukraine approved by lawmakers on Tuesday was “provocation towards our country”. The Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500m over President Joe Biden’s request earlier this year. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said it had not “enabled” Ukraine to carry out strikes inside Russia, after a spate of drone attacks on military-linked facilities deep within Russian territory. Kyiv did not directly claim responsibility but neither did it criticise the action, which killed three people and damaged long-range bombers and a fuel depot, according to reports from Russia. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by Blinken about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”. Britain has ordered “several thousand” NLAW anti-tank weapons to replace the 7,000 donated to Ukraine in the past year. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said the NLAWs played “a decisive role” in pushing back the Russian invasion, but Labour has complained that the deal took nearly 10 months to sign and the replacements will take three years to make. Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. Mykhailo Podolyak also told the Guardian that Russian forces had run short of their first batch of Iranian drones – and only had enough of their own cruise missiles in their stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukraine. Belarus plans to move military equipment and security forces on Wednesday and Thursday in what it says are checks on its response to possible acts of terrorism, the state Belta news agency reported. “During this period, it is planned to move military equipment and personnel of the national security forces,” the news agency cited the country’s security council as saying. Poland is preparing to deploy the German Patriot air defence system on its territory, after Berlin refused to place the system in Ukraine, Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Blaszczak, said on Twitter. Germany last month offered Poland the Patriot system to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed and killed two people in Poland. Europe is likely to scrape through this winter without cutting off gas customers despite reduced Russian supplies, but even adjusting to colder homes and paying more may not be enough in coming years, analysts have told AFP. Russia’s progressive reduction of gas supplies to Europe via pipeline triggered a bidding war for liquefied natural gas (LNG), sending prices sharply higher. At least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks of the war in Ukraine, according to a report by the UN’s human rights office. Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visited troops close to frontlines in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday. Addressing service personnel later in the presidential palace in Kyiv, Zelenskiy said he had spent the day with troops in Donbas, theatre of the heaviest battles, and in Kharkiv region, where Ukrainians have retaken swaths of territory from Russian forces. Russian and Ukrainian authorities confirmed the exchange of 120 people in a prisoner swap. According to the Russian defence ministry, 60 servicemen were returned from “Kyiv-controlled territory”. Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, Andrii Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, said. Ukraine’s health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts. In a statement, the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, told the Guardian he had been unable to leave Donetsk after spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine because he did not have any identity papers. Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds. Earlier Viktor Orbán’s government was accused of “holding hostage” funds for Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungary confirmed on Tuesday that it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage in separate disputes over Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2022/sep/07/ukraine-launches-surprise-counterattack-kharkiv-region-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-08T00:47:10Z","webTitle":"Ukraine launches surprise counterattack in Kharkiv region","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/07/ukraine-launches-surprise-counterattack-kharkiv-region-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2022/sep/07/ukraine-launches-surprise-counterattack-kharkiv-region-russia","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine launches surprise counterattack in Kharkiv region","bodyText":"Ukraine has launched a surprise counterattack in the north-east Kharkiv region, stretching Russian forces who are also facing Ukrainian attacks in the south. An official representing the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces “encircled” Balakliia, an eastern town of 27,000 people situated between Kharkiv and Russian-occupied Izium. “Today, the Ukrainian armed forces, after prolonged artillery preparation … began an attack on Balakliia,” Daniil Bezsonov said on Telegram. “At this time, Balakliia is in operative encirclement and within the firing range of Ukrainian artillery. All approaches are cut off by fire,” he said, adding that a successful Ukrainian offensive would threaten Russian forces in Izium, a strategically important town that Russia has been using for its own offensive in eastern Ukraine. Unverified footage circulating on social media on Wednesday showed what looked like a Ukrainian soldier posing in front of an entrance sign for Balakliia. Analysts have said that the initial target of the offensive could be the city of Kupyansk, a key road hub for Russian supplies heading south from the border into eastern Ukraine. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has remained guarded about the military counter-offensive in the east while Ukraine’s army has yet to comment on the alleged new battle plan. Without giving details, Zelenskiy reported “good news” from the Kharkiv region east of Kyiv, implying some settlements had been recaptured from Russian forces but adding that “now is not the right time to name those settlements where the Ukrainian flag has returned”. In a Wednesday evening address, Zelenskiy cited “the extremely successful hits in areas where the occupiers are concentrated”, and thanked Ukrainian artillery troops for what he said were successful strikes against Moscow’s forces in the south. One of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s advisers, Oleksiy Arestovych, said on Tuesday night that “lightning-fast changes are taking place” in the Kharkiv region, in parallel to the southern offensive in the Kherson region announced by Ukraine’s military last week. In Washington, a senior Pentagon official said that Ukrainian forces are making “slow but meaningful progress” on the battlefield. “We’ll see how things pan out,” said under secretary of defense for policy Colin Kahl. “But I certainly think things are going better on the Ukrainian side right now in the south than is true on the Russian side.” The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based thinktank, reported on Wednesday that Ukrainian forces probably captured Verbivka (less than 2 miles north-west of Balakliia) on Tuesday, citing geo-locatable images posted by Ukrainian soldiers. Without specifying any locations, the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, told Ukrainian television on Wednesday that a “counterattack is under way and … our forces are enjoying some success. Let’s leave it at that”. Ukraine’s military did give some confirmation of the alleged offensive on Wednesday, claiming Ukraine’s army shot down a Russian military Sukhoi Su-25 aircraft near Volokhiv Yar, a town about 12 miles from Balakliia. Ukraine for a long time spoke openly of its intent to launch a large-scale southern offensive in the Kherson region, forcing Russia to transfer some of its most elite units from the east to Kherson. According to the ISW, this has opened up opportunities for Ukraine to launch attacks near Kharkiv. “Russia’s deployment of forces from Kharkiv and eastern Ukraine to Ukraine’s south is likely enabling Ukrainian counterattacks of opportunity,” the thinktank wrote late on Tuesday. Rob Lee, a military analyst at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said the Ukrainian attack indicated that Russian forces near Kharkiv were stretched. “Russia doesn’t have strong reserves in this area that could be sent quickly to plug gaps and reinforce key towns. Ukraine may have a numerical and armour superiority here.” The Russian government and its defence ministry have not commented on Ukraine’s alleged offensives. Speaking at an economic forum in the far-eastern Russian city of Vladivostok on Wednesday, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said Russia had not lost anything as a result of its military campaign in Ukraine. A number of prominent pro-Kremlin bloggers volleyed criticism at the Russian authorities after Ukraine’s latest offensive. Igor Girkin, a Russian ultra-nationalist and former military leader for the Russian-backed republics in eastern Ukraine, said the outskirts of Balakliia were defended by poorly equipped mobilised forces from the Donbas region who “didn’t know how to use available heavy weapons”. He added that Ukraine also took control of the settlement of Volokhiv Yar overnight. Aleksandr Kots, a pro-Kremlin war blogger, on Wednesday denounced the Russian authorities for hiding “bad news”. “We need to start doing something about the system where our leadership doesn’t like to talk about bad news and their subordinates don’t want to upset their bosses,” he said. Ukraine’s offensive in Kharkiv came as Andrei Turchak, head of Russia’s ruling party, proposed to hold referendums on joining Russia in occupied territories on 4 November, when Russia celebrates its National Unity day. “It would be right and symbolic to hold referendums on this very day,” Turchak wrote on his Telegram channel, the most concrete sign yet that Russia is planning to go ahead with annexing Ukrainian territories. Also on Wednesday, a new report by the London-based Centre for Information Resilience’s Eyes on Russia said it was highly likely that Russian forces shelled the Russian-occupied Enerhodar, the satellite town of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The centre’s investigators also verified previously published footage of a rocket firing from next to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – controlled by Russia – as well as images of Russian equipment at the plant. After Russian forces took control of Enerhodar and the nuclear plant in March, the two sides have traded blame over the shelling in both areas. Ukraine has said Russia is carrying out false-flag operations to blame Ukrainian forces, while Russia has said the attacks are carried out by Ukraine. The centre’s investigators geo-located footage showing the impact of shelling in front of a building in Enerhodar. The footage showed a larger quantity of dirt on the left side of the crater, indicating that the shell came from the right side of the camera, stated the report. The investigators then traced the potential trajectory of the rocket and concluded that it was launched from the southern side of the Dnieper river in Zaporizhzhia region, an area under Russian control since February."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/08/bank-of-england-to-lend-uk-energy-companies-as-much-as-40bn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-08T17:41:50Z","webTitle":"Bank of England to lend UK energy companies as much as £40bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/08/bank-of-england-to-lend-uk-energy-companies-as-much-as-40bn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/08/bank-of-england-to-lend-uk-energy-companies-as-much-as-40bn","fields":{"headline":"Bank of England to lend UK energy companies as much as £40bn","bodyText":"The Bank of England will lend UK energy companies as much as £40bn to deal with soaring market prices amid fears of another wave of energy company collapses. Prime minister Liz Truss, on her third day in office, said she wanted to make sure energy companies have the cash they need to buy energy if prices jump. Reports this week said British Gas owner Centrica was in talks with banks to secure extra cash as Vladimir Putin continues to choke off Europe’s supply of gas. The bailout fund for energy companies was announced alongside a suspension of the energy price cap, which Truss replaced with an “energy price guarantee” to freeze household energy bills for two years. The government will also offer “equivalent support” for six months for businesses – most of whom have not received any financial aid to address the energy crisis prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Companies who use the Bank of England’s energy markets financing scheme will have to sign up to a “wider set of conditions”, the Treasury said. During the coronavirus pandemic support schemes some companies were banned from paying dividends after receiving loans. Amid warnings energy markets were facing a “Lehman” moment, when a liquidity crunch precipitated the global banking crisis, the government said the scheme would provide “last resort” financing. The money will essentially guarantee that energy suppliers can pay for any power they commit to buying in the wholesale markets, as well as letting them insure themselves to protect against price rises. Surging prices have prompted ballooning calls for collateral for energy trades, forcing even the largest suppliers to turn to their banks to increase their overdrafts. The governments of Sweden and Finland stepped in with similar measures at the weekend, with the Finnish economy minister saying: “This has had the ingredients for a kind of a Lehman Brothers of energy industry.” Since the start of the energy crisis more than 30 suppliers have collapsed. That has left energy customers concentrated with bigger firms, whose collapse would probably cost the taxpayer billions of pounds. Some analysts believe that the largest collapse so far, of Bulb, could cost more than £4bn. Officials are scrambling to draw up details of the scheme, but the government on Thursday said it may only be able to reveal a start date by the end of October. It is understood that further details of the scheme will be published next week. Tim Speed, an energy specialist at law firm, Shakespeare Martineau said: “A £40bn liquidity fund provides some comfort for energy suppliers, but the support needs to start with immediate effect to stabilise the market. Further supplier casualties will end up costing consumers more.” In an indication of the hurried design of Truss’s plan, the government said it would also not be able to provide details until next week of how financial support will be delivered to households or businesses. Nevertheless, business leaders welcomed the scale of the ambition displayed in a package estimated to cost as much as £100bn for the first year alone. Rain Newtown-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, the UK’s largest business lobby group, welcomed “bold and decisive action” that will “limit some of the damaging hardship faced by families this winter and for the wider economy”. “Big spending now needs big plans to recapture sustainable economic growth,” she added. As well as support measures over the next few months, Truss also promised to rewrite the rules governing how customers buy electricity and gas – throwing the future of regulator Ofgem into doubt. Those policies included: A review of the UK’s energy regulation that promises to deliver “fundamental reforms to the structure and regulation” An energy supply taskforce, led by Madelaine McTernan, who currently heads the government’s vaccines taskforce, that will seek to agree long-term contracts for energy supply at steady prices A review of the UK’s 2050 net zero target to ensure it is “not placing undue burdens on businesses or consumers” McTernan, a banker who held senior roles at Credit Suisse and Lehman Brothers before entering government in 2017, will also look to strike better deals with solar, wind and nuclear power generators, who have seen their incomes rise because the price of electricity is pegged to the price of gas. Truss announced the government would be adopting an industry proposal to replace current contracts for renewable energy with a contracts for difference regime, which caps returns and should deliver a lower fixed price, over a longer term. Economists said the package was likely to soften the impact of the long recession forecast for the UK as the energy crisis caused inflation to soar. The plan is expected to match – and in many cases exceed – the actions of other countries facing similar predicaments. It was reported on Thursday that Germany plans to give discounts to households and businesses on a certain amount of power in its €65bn plan. Martin McTague, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the promise of bills support for the first time during the crisis was “a huge relief for millions of small businesses”. However, he said Truss offered “not enough information, yet, for them to plan”. McTague also cautioned against a “cliff-edge after six months” if, as planned, the government withdraws support for companies. The government should have a “broad, realistic and fair” definition of which sectors are “vulnerable”, he said. The business support is expected to focus on subsidies for wholesale gas prices. The government has promised to keep prices lower for all businesses for six months, and will consider how to cut back support to certain sectors in a review in three months’ time. Households will see costs frozen at an average of £2,500 a year, a measure that is expected to support consumer spending. The government said it would also help reduce inflation, curbing the headline rate – which reached 10.1% in July – by four or five percentage points. Chris O’Shea, chief executive of Centrica, the largest UK domestic energy supplier, said it was a “bold customer support package” that “will bring immediate relief to hard pressed households”. Paul Dales of Capital Economics, a consultancy, said the package would “reduce inflation and limit the size of the recession”, but that it would also lead to higher interest rates and higher government debt. Energy companies called for the government to reduce the use of fossil fuels. Michael Lewis, chief executive of supplier E.ON UK, said the UK needed to make more “cheap, clean electricity” and “reduce our fossil fuel use”. However, he said he was “disappointed not to see a greater commitment to energy efficiency as a long-term solution to the current crisis, and as the foundation stone of that cleaner, greener future.” Keith Anderson, chief executive of ScottishPower, called for “a three-pronged attack to tackle the issue at source by weaning the country off fossil fuels, doubling down on cheap, clean renewables and, importantly, decoupling electricity prices from gas.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/04/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-162-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-04T01:38:41Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 162 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/04/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-162-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/04/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-162-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 162 of the invasion","bodyText":"Eight people have been killed and four have been wounded in Russian artillery shelling in the eastern Ukrainian town of Toretsk in Donetsk region on Thursday, the regional governor said. The shelling hit a public transport stop where people had gathered, the governor for the area, Pavlo Kyrylenko, wrote on Telegram. Three children were among the wounded, he said. The UN is conducting a fact-finding mission in response to requests from both Russia and Ukraine after 53 Ukrainian prisoners of war were killed in an explosion at a barracks in separatist-controlled Olenivka. The warring nations have accused each other of carrying out the attack. Ukraine claims it was a special operation plotted in advance by the Kremlin, and carried out by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group. Russia’s defence ministry, however, claims the Ukrainian military used US-supplied rockets to strike the prison. A US official accused Moscow of preparing to plant fake evidence to make it look like the recent mass killing of Ukrainian prisoners in an attack on a Russian-controlled prison was caused by Ukraine. Kyiv and Moscow have traded blame over the strikes on the prison in Kremlin-controlled Olenivka, in eastern Ukraine, which Russia said took place overnight on 29 July. Amnesty International has said the Ukrainian army is endangering the life of civilians by basing themselves in residential areas, in a report rejected by Ukrainian government representatives as placing blame on it for Russia’s invasion. The human rights group’s researchers found that Ukrainian forces were using some schools and hospitals as bases, firing near houses and sometimes living in residential flats. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, accused Amnesty of “distorting the real picture”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, wants to talk directly to China’s leader, Xi Jinping, in the hope China can use its influence with Russia to bring the war to an end. According to a report in the South China Morning Post Zelenskiy said: “It’s a very powerful state. It’s a powerful economy. So (it) can politically, economically influence Russia. And China is [also a] permanent member of the UN security council.” So far, China has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion and its president, Xi Jinping, told Putin it would support Russia’s “sovereignty and security”. A Moscow court has convicted the US basketball player Brittney Griner on drug charges, sentencing her to nine years in prison and a 1m rouble fine in a politically charged verdict that could lead to a prisoner swap with the United States. Griner, a basketball talent who played in Russia during off-seasons from the Phoenix Mercury, was arrested for cannabis possession in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport in February. The US Senate has ratified Finland and Sweden’s accession to Nato, voting 95-1 in support. The US is the 23rd member state to ratify what would be the most significant expansion of the 30-member alliance since the 1990s as it responds to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “This historic vote sends an important signal of the sustained, bipartisan US commitment to Nato, and to ensuring our alliance is prepared to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow,” the president, Joe Biden, said in a statement. All 30 Nato members must ratify the accession before Finland and Sweden can become members. Ukraine is pulling out its 40 peacekeepers from the Nato-led mission in Kosovo, which totals 3,800 members, according to Ukraine news. In March, Zelenskiy issued a decree for all missions to return to Ukraine to support the war. A Russian official in Ukraine has claimed Ukrainian forces are using western arms to attack the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Europe’s largest nuclear plant is now controlled by Russian forces and being used as a military base, according to Reuters. However, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Ukrainian forces are not firing against Russian forces “lest there be a terrible accident involving the nuclear plant”. Reuters was unable to verify battlefield accounts from either side of the war. The first shipment of grain to leave Ukraine under a deal to ease Russia’s naval blockade has reached Turkey. The Sierra Leone-registered ship Razoni set sail from Odesa port for Lebanon on Monday under an accord brokered by Turkey and the UN. The ship has been inspected by members of the joint coordination centre, and is now expected to move through the Bosphorus Strait “shortly”. The Ukrainian president has dismissed the importance of the first grain export shipment from his country since Russia invaded, saying it was carrying a fraction of the crop Kyiv must sell to help salvage its shattered economy. In downbeat comments, Zelenskiy, via video to students in Australia on Wednesday, said more time was needed to see whether other grain shipments would follow. The Kremlin said on Thursday that the Turkish-brokered deal to unblock Ukraine’s grain exports from the Black Sea was not a “one-off mechanism”, and that it hoped it would continue to work effectively. The deal, which allows for Ukrainian grain to be shipped to world markets via Turkey, must be renewed every 120 days by agreement of the parties. The first shipment of Ukrainian grain to the UK since the war began is expected to arrive in 10 days, western officials said. Millions of tonnes of grain have been stuck in Ukraine since Russia invaded just over six months ago. Nato members are working closely with defence companies to ensure Ukraine gets more supplies of weapons and equipment to be prepared for the long haul in its war with Russia, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Thursday. Stoltenberg told Reuters in an interview: “We are providing a lot of support but we need to do even more and be prepared for the long haul.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-286-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-06T00:14:12Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 286 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-286-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-286-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 286 of the invasion","bodyText":"Russia and Ukraine said they had exchanged 60 prisoners of war on each side in the latest of a series of such swaps. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the returned soldiers included dozens who had held out in the besieged Azovstal steelworks in city of Mariupol. Russia’s defence ministry said the freed Russian soldiers would be flown to Moscow to receive medical care and psychological support. A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. Shelling by Ukrainian forces killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city on Tuesday, according to the Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexei Kulemzin. The head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling had killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council, Maria Pirogova. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. At least four people were killed on Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, amid Russian strikes during which 60 of 70 missiles were shot down. The strikes targeted Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, the air force said. Energy workers had already begun work on restoring power, said Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. Officials said airstrikes destroyed homes in the south, knocked out power in the north and killed at least two people. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukrainian drones attacked two airbases at Ryazan and Saratov in south-central Russia, killing three servicemen and wounding four, with two aircraft damaged. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for what would represent the deepest strikes inside the Russian heartland since Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Russian and Ukrainian authorities confirmed the exchange of 120 people in a prisoner swap on Tuesday. According to the Russian defence ministry, 60 servicemen were returned from “Kyiv-controlled territory”. Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, said Andrii Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, said. The Kremlins spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”. A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said that Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, as a result of diplomatic pressure and Iran’s own internal political turmoil. Mikhailo Podolyak told the Guardian that Russian forces currently had enough of its own cruise missiles in its stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure like the salvo fired on Monday. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, told the Guardian he had been unable to leave Donetsk after spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine because he did not have any identity papers. Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds. Earlier Viktor Orbán’s government was accused of “holding hostage” funds for Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungary confirmed on Tuesday that it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage in separate disputes over Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds. Ukrainian embassies have received more “bloody packages”, according to its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had been targeted with packages soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. The Russian state-owned bank VTB said it was hit by an “unprecedented cyber-attack from abroad”, which it said was the largest cyber-attack in its history. In a statement, it said it was repelling the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, and that an analysis indicated it was a “planned and large-scale” attack. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. Canadian-made parts were found in “kamikaze” Iranian drones used by Russia to attack Ukraine, according to an investigative project from the NGO Statewatch. It said components from 30 European and American companies, including antenna parts from Tallysman Wireless, a Canadian manufacturer, were used in Shahed 136 drones. The White House has said the latest Russian strikes against Ukraine are a reminder of Vladimir Putin’s brutality. John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, also told reporters that an oil price cap would not have any long-term impact on global oil prices, Reuters reported. Moldovan police on Monday found fragments of a missile in a northern region near the border with Ukraine, state information portal Prima Sursa quoted the police as saying after Russia carried out missile strikes. Russia’s recent mobilisation increased its military threat in Ukraine, with better-trained soldiers arriving at the frontline, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces said. But Russia was using a lot of old equipment because it had no other way of replenishing supplies, and the Russians had made only slow progress around Bakhmut, one of the main battle zones in eastern Ukraine, Reuters reported. Vladimir Putin has driven across the Kerch Bridge linking Russia and the Crimean peninsula that was damaged by a truck bomb in October. The Russian president spoke to workers and a senior government official, Reuters reported. India gave a list of its products to Moscow for access to Russian markets, foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said, as his country seeks to narrow a growing trade deficit with Russia at a time when Moscow faces acute shortages of some crucial materials after western sanctions. The Kremlin has warned the new western price cap on Russian oil will destabilise global energy markets, but claimed it would not affect its invasion of Ukraine. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was preparing its response to the move by the G7 and allies. The Chinese foreign ministry has said it will continue energy cooperation with Russia after the G7, EU and Australia imposed the price cap. China, which said it would continue on the basis of respect and mutual benefit, has increased its purchases of Russia’s Urals oil blends this year. Olaf Scholz has warned the west to avoid creating a new cold war by dividing the world into blocs. Writing in an opinion piece for Foreign Affairs magazine, the German chancellor called for every effort to be made to build new partnerships."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/20/eu-urges-member-states-to-slash-gas-use-by-15","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-20T13:24:53Z","webTitle":"EU urges member states to slash gas use by 15% to counter ‘Russian blackmail’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/20/eu-urges-member-states-to-slash-gas-use-by-15","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jul/20/eu-urges-member-states-to-slash-gas-use-by-15","fields":{"headline":"EU urges member states to slash gas use by 15% to counter ‘Russian blackmail’","bodyText":"The European Union’s executive body has urged member states to slash their gas consumption by 15%, as it warned that a complete shutdown of Russian supplies was “likely”. The EU has been scrambling to wean itself off Russian gas since the invasion of Ukraine, but is alarmed about a potential energy crisis this winter. In response to EU support for Kyiv, the Kremlin has already stopped or reduced gas supplies to a dozen EU member states and is expected to send lower volumes of gas to Germany when the Nord Stream 1 pipeline reopens on Thursday after scheduled maintenance works. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the Kremlin had kept gas storage as low as possible before the invasion and gone on to cut supplies. “Russia is blackmailing us, Russia is using energy as a weapon,” she told reporters. “It is a likely scenario that there is a full cut-off of Russian gas and that would hit the whole European Union. A gas crisis in the single market, our economic powerhouse, will affect every single member state.” Presenting the commission’s winter plan on Wednesday, she proposed that between 1 August to 31 March 2023 there should be a voluntary reduction in gas use to 15% below the average for that period over the past five years. Under the proposals, if there is a drastic reduction or complete shutdown of Russian gas, Brussels could declare an EU-wide emergency and introduce legally binding reduction targets. While emergency measures would fall on industry, EU governments are being asked to step up campaigns encouraging consumers to save energy, by turning down thermostats, shortening showers and not leaving appliances on standby. Frans Timmermans, the EU’s top official in charge of the European Green Deal, said consumers would remain protected, but could also do their bit. “Do we have to have air conditioning set at 20 degrees?” he asked. “[The temperature] could be higher, couldn’t it? Of course it might reduce a bit of our comfort, but it might also reduce a lot of our consumption.” The targets have to be agreed by EU member states, which are responsible for choosing their own energy mix. The call for mandatory gas savings could trigger a backlash from countries less exposed to Russian gas, which may blame other member states for building up a dangerous dependency. One senior EU diplomat suggested that Germany, which imported 50% of its gas from Russia before the war, could face some tough questions from countries that recall Berlin’s strictures on debt during the eurozone crisis. “So we have to pay for your past mistakes. Now remind me what you said about debt in the past,” the diplomat said, describing how the debate might play out, rather than expressing their country’s stance. EU energy ministers are to discuss the plan next Tuesday, but the Netherlands and Denmark have already signalled they might not be ready to agree the targets, because their parliaments need time to scrutinise the law. Before the invasion of Ukraine, Russia supplied 40% of EU gas, but flows are sharply down. Russia has halted supply to the Baltic states, Poland, Bulgaria and Finland, and reduced flows to Germany, Italy, Austria, Denmark, Slovakia and the Netherlands. Since mid-June 2022, during a period of scheduled maintenance, flows through Nord Stream 1 have fallen by 60%. Vladimir Putin suggested on Wednesday that the pipeline’s capacity could be reduced. The Russian president claimed there was a problem with pumping units. Sources in Moscow told Reuters on Tuesday that Nord Stream 1 was expected to resume operations on time, although at less than its capacity of about 160m cubic metres a day. Under a worst-case scenario of a sharp cut in Russian supplies during a cold winter, the EU economy could shrink by 1.5%, the commission estimates. It argues that early action to save energy combined with a milder winter could limit the economic hit to a 0.4% average reduction in GDP across the 27-country bloc. The International Monetary Fund, however, has made a bleaker forecast, suggesting the hardest-hit countries could see a GDP fall of 6%. Under the latest plan, member states are encouraged to look at switching to alternative fuels, even delaying the decision to phase out coal or nuclear power, although clean energy is prioritised. Social Democrat MEPs urged the EU to introduce a windfall tax on energy companies. “It would be extremely unfair if we make the most vulnerable among us, including low-income households and elderly persons, tighten their belts while energy companies with skyrocketing profits pay little or no share of the burden,” said Mohammed Chahim, a Dutch MEP. The EU has already pledged to end dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 2027 at the latest, with a ban on 90% of Russian oil imports due to be complete by the end of the year. Since the invasion, the EU has ramped up supplies of liquified natural gas and pipeline gas from countries such as Norway, the US and the UK. It has also been criticised by human rights groups for an agreement signed this week with Azerbaijan to boost gas supplies via the southern gas corridor, a 2,200-mile (3,500km) pipeline connecting the EU via Turkey, Georgia and the resource-rich Caspian Sea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/07/nuclear-apocalypse-was-postponed-in-1968-now-its-back-on-the-agenda-hiroshima-npt","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-07T06:00:37Z","webTitle":"Nuclear apocalypse was postponed in 1968.

Now it’s back on the agenda","bodyText":"A crucial event for the future of international peace and security – and global sanity – got under way at UN headquarters in New York last week, though, given the lack of political and media attention, you might be forgiven for not noticing. The review conference of the landmark 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty (NPT) involves 191 state party signatories. Few international agreements enjoy such near universal support. Nuclear-armed Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea are shameful hold-outs. Simply put, the NPT is about preventing nuclear war by encouraging disarmament, halting proliferation and promoting peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology. Up to now, at least, it’s helped stop another nuclear catastrophe. “Another” is the operative word. The 77th anniversary of the first such catastrophe was commemorated on 6 August at Hiroshima, where an estimated 140,000 civilians died, or were condemned to an agonising death, on one day in 1945. To put that in perspective, roughly 10,000 civilians have died in Ukraine in just under six months. Western public opinion, lulled by the end of the cold war, seems to have lost sight of the immeasurable horror of atomic warfare. There are no Greenham Commons nowadays, even though new missile deployments proliferate. If recent events puncture that complacency, it won’t be wholly bad. UN secretary-general António Guterres raised the alarm last week when opening the NPT conference. “Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,” he warned. “We have been extraordinarily lucky so far. But luck is not a strategy. Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict.” Russia illustrates Guterres’s point in terrifying fashion. Having previously seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, in southern Ukraine, it is using it as a fortress from which to fire artillery with impunity. The UN nuclear watchdog says a disaster is in the making. Launching his invasion, Vladimir Putin placed Russia’s nuclear forces on alert and issued a crude threat. Any western attempt to interfere, he said, “will lead to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history”. Whether bluffing or not, Putin’s nuclear blackmail has undoubtedly deterred direct US and Nato intervention in Ukraine and so prolonged the war. Now there’s concern that China may adopt similar tactics over Taiwan. Anti-nuclear campaigners say NPT pledges must be honoured and strengthened, and most countries agree. But the treaty is in trouble all the same. In practice, all five recognised nuclear weapons states – the US, Russia, China, France and Britain – are breaking their Article VI treaty commitment to pursue disarmament “in good faith”, thereby setting an execrable example. Instead, a multilateral nuclear arms race is gathering pace, unrestrained in the case of the US and Russia by bilateral cold war arms control treaties discarded by Putin and Donald Trump, and propelled in the case of China by neo-imperial ambition. “All of the nuclear-armed states are increasing or upgrading their arsenals and most are sharpening nuclear rhetoric and the role nuclear weapons play in their military strategies,” the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said in its authoritative annual report. The US and Russia, while claiming to support further nuclear arms reduction, still maintain 3,708 and 4,477 nukes respectively. China has 350, France 290 and Britain 225. Beijing’s arsenal is predicted to more than double in the next decade. And it’s not only about Armageddon. Growing stockpiles of so-called tactical or battlefield weapons and new hypersonic missiles are making “limited” nuclear warfare more likely. Hypocrisy and double-talk are not confined to the big players. Like Israel, India and Pakistan, Britain and France are modernising their arsenals. President Emmanuel Macron, in true Napoleonic style, wants to extend France’s nuclear shield to cover all of Europe. In a joint statement last week, Britain, France and the US described the NPT as “irreplaceable” and “vital”. They said they were making “enduring efforts” to fulfil their Article VI obligations. Last year, however, Boris Johnson’s government relaxed Britain’s no-first-use doctrine to allow a UK nuclear response to a non-nuclear attack. Ministers also raised the cap on the Trident warhead stockpile and reduced publicly available information. “Both decisions have led many to question the government’s commitment to disarmament,” a House of Commons research paper noted wryly. Even as it extolled the virtues of collaboration, the joint statement castigated Russia for its “irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and reckless attacks endangering nuclear reactors”. It went on: “We condemn those who would use or threaten to use nuclear weapons for military coercion, intimidation, and blackmail.” Quite right. But such criticism sits uneasily alongside strictures by Stephen Lovegrove, UK national security adviser, who has warned that a “rapid escalation to strategic conflict”, meaning nuclear war, could too easily result from the current shouting match between the west and Russia and China. To make matters worse, North Korea’s rogue regime is expected to conduct a geopolitically (and physically) destabilising underground nuclear test soon. But there are glimmers of hope, too. Last-ditch negotiations to curb Iran’s nuclear programme have resumed. Plus 86 countries have now signed the symbolic, nonetheless important, 2021 Nuclear Weapon Ban treaty. Why, as appears the case, is the world teetering ever more precariously on the brink of renewed nuclear catastrophe? There are many factors. Increased insecurity, rising nationalism, weak and stupid leaders, vested commercial interests. Yet as much as anything, the reawakened spectre of nuclear annihilation is the product of a defining 21st-century phenomenon: the increasingly anarchic refusal of states to uphold international law and the UN-underwritten, post-1945 global order. They just won’t stick to the rules, even as they stick it to each other."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2021/jan/25/national-grid-electricity-ofgem-energy-networks","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-01-25T17:41:50Z","webTitle":"National Grid should lose role as electricity system operator, says Ofgem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jan/25/national-grid-electricity-ofgem-energy-networks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/jan/25/national-grid-electricity-ofgem-energy-networks","fields":{"headline":"National Grid should lose role as electricity system operator, says Ofgem","bodyText":"National Grid could lose its role of keeping Britain’s lights on after the energy regulator called for a new and independent electricity system operator to help steer the UK towards its climate targets. Ofgem has called for National Grid to be stripped of its role after 30 years balancing the electricity grid because the energy company also owns energy networks. The regulator warned this could create a conflict of interest in the future as the UK’s networks play a larger role in helping to keep the lights on. National Grid has already legally separated the electricity system operator business from the FTSE 100 group but Ofgem’s proposal would lead to all ties being severed and a new independent system operator put in its place. Jonathan Brearley, the chief executive of Ofgem, said: “The energy system needs to go undergo the biggest transformation in over a century to meet Britain’s ambitious climate goals.” “Imagine you have 10m electric cars on the system, and lots of renewable energy. You could manage this in two ways. One way is to build a much bigger and higher capacity network. Equally you could have a smarter and more efficient system that begins to shift the times that those different cars charge, which could be a lot cheaper overall for customers. Asking a company which builds networks to make that kind of trade-off is the sort of thing we’re concerned about in the future,” he said. “Ofgem is recommending the creation of an independent body to help deliver the fundamental changes in how we use energy,” Brearley said. The new operator could provide independent recommendations to the government and Ofgem on gas and electricity network investment proposals to help move the UK towards a net zero carbon electricity grid at the lowest possible cost, according to the regulator. This could help to save consumers between £400m and £4.8bn between 2022 and 2050. An independent operator could also take on wider planning responsibilities for new infrastructure, for example the design and construction of an offshore grid connecting offshore windfarms to the UK, Ofgem added. Alistair Cromwell, the acting chief executive of Citizens Advice, said a separate body to run the electricity and gas systems “should give consumers more confidence that the advice given, and decisions taken, will be in their interests”. “This should lead to lower bills and an efficient transition to net zero. But the new independent system operator - as advocated by Ofgem - needs to have the right structure, responsibilities and capabilities to enable it to make the best decisions for all of us,” Cromwell said. The structure and ownership of an independent system operator would be decided by the government in consultation with National Grid. The FTSE 100 energy company would be entitled to some financial compensation if it is stripped of the business, which is considered a very small part of the group. Equity analysts at Barclays have estimated the value of the National Grid electricity system operator at £300m, or less than 1% of the group’s market value. Ofgem believes the cost of compensating National Grid for the business would be outweighed by the long-term financial benefit to energy bill payers. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business and energy secretary, said the government welcomed Ofgem’s contribution to the debate over the future of the energy system and would “consider its recommendations thoroughly”. National Grid said in a statement that it was working closely with the government, regulator and the industry to explore the future of the energy system operator, and added that a “potential divestment” of its role was “an important part of that discussion”. “Significant further work is needed to determine the detail of that structure,” the company said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-ukraine-invites-un-nuclear-inspectors-after-discredited-dirty-bomb-claim","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-25T17:58:56Z","webTitle":"Ukraine fears Russia planning false flag attack amid Kremlin’s ‘dirty bomb’ claims – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-ukraine-invites-un-nuclear-inspectors-after-discredited-dirty-bomb-claim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-ukraine-invites-un-nuclear-inspectors-after-discredited-dirty-bomb-claim","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine fears Russia planning false flag attack amid Kremlin’s ‘dirty bomb’ claims – as it happened","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is 9pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s top stories: Ukraine has said that persistent Russian claims that Kyiv plans to detonate a dirty bomb made it look as though Moscow itself planned to conduct a false-flag operation, and that Ukraine has never had any plans to develop a dirty bomb. Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told a news conference that experts from the UN nuclear watchdog would soon be arriving in Ukraine and receive full access, and he called on Moscow to demonstrate the same transparency as Ukraine, Reuters reported. The Donetsk oblast was hit hard in the past day, with at least 15 Russian strikes killing seven civilians and injuring three more. The Ukrainian national police said the strikes also destroyed 19 residential buildings and one power line. Further south, a car explosion near the office of Russian propaganda channel ZaTV in Russia-occupied Melitopol has injured at least five people, including company employees, authorities said. While investigators are still looking into the blast, Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed occupied Zaporizhia oblast official, has purportedly told Russian state media that the car explosion near the office of Russian propaganda channel ZaTv in Russian-occupied Melitopol was a terrorist attack stemming from an “improvised explosive device”. Police rescued an eight-year-old boy whose parents were killed in Russian shell strikes in Bakhmut, it has been reported. Iuliia Mendel, a former spokesperson for the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Bohdan’s mother was seven months pregnant when she died “in the street”, along with his father. Ukrainian authorities are now estimating that Russian forces have lost nearly 68,420 personnel since the start of the invasion. Refugees who fled in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine should stay abroad this winter due to blackouts created by Moscow’s bombardment of critical energy infrastructure, a Ukrainian minister has said. In an interview broadcast on Ukrainian national television on Tuesday, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk told Ukrainians currently sheltering abroad that they should wait until spring before returning to Ukraine. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said Russian assets and those of Russian oligarchs present a “huge pot of gold” that should be used for Ukraine’s reconstruction. “We must make sure that the offender pays for reconstruction. Russia should pay Ukraine war damages, war reparations,” Morawiecki said on Tuesday at a conference in Berlin working to build international support to finance Ukraine’s postwar rehabilitation. Russian president Vladimir Putin has addressed a new coordination council designed to boost support for an invasion now in its ninth month, Reuters reported. Putin set up the new council last week as he imposed martial law in four partly-occupied regions of Ukraine that he has declared part of Russia, where his forces have suffered several defeats by a resurgent Ukrainian army. The US Congressional Progressive Caucus withdrew a letter to the White House urging a negotiated settlement to the war in Ukraine, chair Pramila Jayapal confirmed. “The Congressional Progressive Caucus hereby withdraws its recent letter to the White House regarding Ukraine,” Jayapal said in a statement. Moscow was generally supportive of the idea of creating a secure zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s ambassador to international institutions in Vienna, told the TASS news agency on Tuesday. The European Commission urged European Union countries and companies to donate more money and equipment to support the energy sector in Ukraine, over a third of which has been destroyed by Russian missile and drone strikes. “What is at stake is the protection and wellbeing of thousands and tens of thousands of households, vulnerable people, children and elderly before this coming winter,” EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson said.

The US Congressional Progressive Caucus withdrew a letter to the White House urging a negotiated settlement to the war in Ukraine, chair Pramila Jayapal confirmed. “The Congressional Progressive Caucus hereby withdraws its recent letter to the White House regarding Ukraine,” Jayapal said in a statement. She added: “The letter was drafted several months ago, but unfortunately was released by staff without vetting.” Refugees who fled in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine should stay abroad this winter due to blackouts created by Moscow’s bombardment of critical energy infrastructure, a Ukrainian minister has said. In an interview broadcast on Ukrainian national television on Tuesday, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk told Ukrainians currently sheltering abroad that they should wait until spring before returning to Ukraine. “I wanted to ask [them] not to return. We need to survive the winter,” she said. The European Commission urged European Union countries and companies to donate more money and equipment to support the energy sector in Ukraine, over a third of which has been destroyed by Russian missile and drone strikes. “What is at stake is the protection and wellbeing of thousands and tens of thousands of households, vulnerable people, children and elderly before this coming winter,” EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson said. Speaking after a meeting of energy ministers in Luxembourg, she said Ukrainian transformers, circuit breakers and power lines had been destroyed, causing outages. “It is urgent,” she told reporters. Russian president Vladimir Putin has addressed a new coordination council designed to boost support for an invasion now in its ninth month, Reuters reported. Putin set up the new council last week as he imposed martial law in four partly-occupied regions of Ukraine that he has declared part of Russia, where his forces have suffered several defeats by a resurgent Ukrainian army. His comments and those of some of the council members amounted to a tacit acknowledgement that Russia was not fully prepared for the resistance it has met in Ukraine, whose capital Kyiv it failed to seize at the outset of the war in February. Putin said increased coordination of government institutions and regions was necessary to manage the government’s work to produce more equipment for its forces and provide them with better medical and logistical support, though he did not explain in detail how this would work. “I have discussed many times with many of you the issues related to the need to update all the work to improve administrative procedures,” Putin told the council, made up of members of the government and regional leaders, in televised remarks. “Administrative reform is impossible without broader coordination between all departments: the economic bloc, the security bloc, the regions.” Police rescued an eight-year-old boy whose parents were killed in Russian shell strikes in Bakhmut, it has been reported. Iuliia Mendel, a former spokesperson for the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Bohdan’s mother was seven months pregnant when she died “in the street”, along with his father. She tweeted: The boy was alone in the area, which is almost impossible to reach #StandWithUkraine Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said Russian assets and those of Russian oligarchs present a “huge pot of gold” that should be used for Ukraine’s reconstruction. “We must make sure that the offender pays for reconstruction. Russia should pay Ukraine war damages, war reparations,” Morawiecki said on Tuesday at a conference in Berlin working to build international support to finance Ukraine’s postwar rehabilitation. He also said Europe had been “to some extent, a paper tiger” and was much stronger than Russia. Ukraine has said that persistent Russian claims that Kyiv plans to detonate a dirty bomb made it look as though Moscow itself planned to conduct a false-flag operation, and that Ukraine has never had any plans to develop a dirty bomb. Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told a news conference that experts from the UN nuclear watchdog would soon be arriving in Ukraine and receive full access, and he called on Moscow to demonstrate the same transparency as Ukraine, Reuters reported. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that the country needs to speed up decision-making in relation to the military campaign in Ukraine. Speaking at the first meeting of a new coordination council to manage the Russian government’s work on the home front, Putin said increased coordination of government structures and regions was necessary, Reuters reported. John Hudson, a journalist with the Washington Post, has obtained the letter Russia sent to the UN security council on Ukrainian “dirty bombs”. He says it is “way out there”, highlighting how it includes scenarios about how Ukraine would produce a “dirty bomb” using its existing nuclear power plants. He also writes: The claims in the letter, which U.S. and Western officials call preposterous, say the Ukrainian government would detonate the dirty bomb and describe the subsequent explosion as the result of a Russian tactical nuclear weapon. Russian forces have been hitting the Donetsk oblast hard recently, taking aim in particular at the strategically placed towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka in Ukraine’s industrial heartland of Donbas. In the last day, seven civilians were killed and three wounded amid five strikes on eight settlements. Here’s a look at the aftermath, as citizens stay behind to pick up the pieces, or evacuate in hopes of finding safety: A man who entered Norway as a Brazilian citizen is being held for four weeks under suspicion of being a Russian spy, according to a Norwegian broadcaster. Norwegian public broadcaster NRK is reporting that the country’s domestic security agency detained the man in the Arctic city of Tromø, according to the Associated Press. The man had been based at the Arctic University of Norway as “a Brazilian researcher” and would be expelled from the country, “because we believe he represents a threat to fundamental national interests”, Norwegian police security service deputy chief Hedvig Moe told NRK. The security service “is concerned that he may have acquired a network and information about Norway’s policy in the northern region”, Moe said. “Even if this network or the information bit by bit is not a threat to the security of the kingdom, we are worried that the information could be misused by Russia.” In a statement, Arctic University of Norway administrator Jørgen Fossland said the person in question was “a guest lecturer” at the school. The lecturer was apprehended Monday on his way to his job, NRK said. His attorney, Thomas Hansen, told the VG newspaper the man denies any wrongdoing. Moscow was generally supportive of the idea of creating a secure zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s ambassador to international institutions in Vienna, told the TASS news agency on Tuesday. Reuters is reporting that Ulyanov had responded to long-standing calls by the International Atomic Energy Agency to de-escalate the conflict near the plant. “The essence (of the IAEA proposal) in a nutshell is that you cannot shoot from the territory of the nuclear station and you cannot shoot at the station. Quite a reasonable idea, which we generally support. The question, as always, is in the details,” TASS quoted Ulyanov as saying. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been a place of contention for months now, with both sides accusing the other of launching attacks on it. Any sort of accident or mishap at the plant – Europe’s largest nuclear facility – would have widespread environmental consequences for the surrounding areas for years to come. A Russian court today rejected an appeal by US basketball star Brittney Griner against her nine-year prison sentence. The two-time Olympic gold medallist has been in Russian custody since she was arrested on 17 February at a Moscow airport. Russian authorities said they found vape cartridges in her possession that contained cannabis oil, which is banned in Russia. She was sentenced on 4 August to nine years in a penal colony. Her family has decried her detention as politically motivated, with many of her supporters raising concerns for her safety, in regards to her race and sexuality. Griner is married to a woman. The US has characterised Griner’s arrest and subsequent sentencing as a “wrongful detention”. “President Biden has been clear that Brittney should be released immediately,” Jake Sullivan, national security advisor, said today. Sullivan called today’s rejected appeal “another sham judicial proceeding”. A broken window of a damaged residential building following a shelling in the town of Bakhmut, Donetsk region. The president of Ukraine has said he is “ready to continue strengthening the strategic partnership” with the UK as Rishi Sunak said the “terrible war … must be seen successfully to its conclusion”. Speaking outside No 10 Downing Street, the new UK prime minister referenced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine twice, saying: “Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilised energy markets and supply chains the world over.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he hoped Sunak would “overcome all the challenges facing British society and the whole world today”. In a tweet after Sunak’s first speech as prime minister, Zelenskiy said: Congratulations to Rishi Sunak on taking office as Prime Minister! I wish you to successfully overcome all the challenges facing British society and the whole world today. I’m ready to continue strengthening the strategic partnership together! Russia’s defence ministry claims its forces have repelled Ukrainian attacks in the southern Kherson region and eastern Luhansk region of Ukraine. Russian-installed officials in Kherson are evacuating tens of thousands of civilians eastwards across the Dnipro river, facing a Ukrainian counteroffensive that has already seen Kyiv retake swathes of land seized by Russian forces in the first days of the war. Reuters was unable to verify battlefield reports. Alleged recordings of the head of a major Ukrainian aircraft manufacturer accused of aiding the Russian military – saying he “completely understands” why a Russian missile was fired at his factory – have been released by Kyiv’s security services after his arrest at the weekend. Vyacheslav Boguslaev, the president of Motor Sich, has been charged with treason after a raid at the weekend on his home in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia. The manufacturing heavyweight is suspected of selling engines – before and after the invasion – for Russian attack helicopters that have been used extensively against Ukrainian troops. The release of the alleged recordings have served as a reminder of the historic ties between veteran figures in the two countries’ arms industries and Ukraine’s internal battle to root out collaborators. Answering questions from journalists at a Kyiv courthouse about whether or not he had contracts with companies that work with the Russia military, Boguslaev said he was not “in the loop” and that Motor Sich produced some of the “best helicopters”. A lawyer for Boguslaev said his client had poor hearing and had not yet listened to the recordings released by Ukraine’s security services . The lawyer added that Boguslaev would explain his position during the trial. A judge ordered for Boguslaev to be held for two months without the possibility of bail. Firefighters work at the site of a car bomb explosion outside a building housing a local TV station in Melitopol, Zaporizhzhia oblast. The Donetsk oblast was hit hard in the past day, with at least 15 Russian strikes killing seven civilians and injuring three more. The Ukrainian national police said the strikes also destroyed 19 residential buildings and one power line. Further south, a car explosion near the office of Russian propaganda channel ZaTV in Russia-occupied Melitopol has injured at least five people, including company employees, authorities said. While investigators are still looking into the blast, Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed occupied Zaporizhia oblast official, has purportedly told Russian state media that the car explosion near the office of Russian propaganda channel ZaTv in Russian-occupied Melitopol was a terrorist attack stemming from an “improvised explosive device”. He wrote on Telegram that the power of the explosion was the equivalent of 2 kilograms of TNT. Amid air raid sirens, Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, arrived in Kyiv for his first trip to Ukraine since Russia invaded. His surprise visit comes six months after the Ukrainian government snubbed the Social Democrat’s offer of a visit over his past role in brokering closer economic ties between Germany and Russia. Meanwhile, in Berlin, European leaders convened for a conference on Ukraine’s reconstruction. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the conference in a video address that more than a third of the country’s energy sector has been destroyed by rockets and Iranian drones. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, spoke strongly about the need to aid Ukraine in its reconstruction, especially as it pertains to the country’s ascension into the European Union. Ukrainian authorities are now estimating that Russian forces have lost nearly 68,420 personnel since the start of the invasion. A look at the impact of the Russian invasion on food prices: Seven civilians were killed and three wounded amid 15 Russian strikes on eight settlements in the Donetsk oblast in the past day, authorities said. The Associated Press is reporting that the attacks came as Russian forces pressed their offensive on the strategically placed towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka in Ukraine’s industrial heartland of Donbas. Ukrainian national police said the strikes destroyed 19 residential buildings and one power line. The surprise visit by the German president to Kyiv on Tuesday comes six months after the Ukrainian government snubbed the Social Democrat’s offer of a visit over his past role in brokering closer economic ties between Germany and Russia. Only last week, Steinmeier had aborted a trip to Kyiv due to security concerns, which led to the former foreign minister being criticised as cowardly by opposition parties in Germany. “I am looking forward to my meeting with [Ukrainian] President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv,” he said, according to a confirmation sent by his spokesperson. Before meeting Zelenskiy, Steinmeier will visit a town in the north of the country near the Belarusian border, which Ukraine says has been liberated from Russian troops but left with its infrastructure destroyed. Steinmeier will provide aid to the municipality for its energy infrastructure, he said. “My message to Ukrainians: you can count on Germany”, Steinmeier said. The German president has shown contrition since the start of the war in Ukraine. “My sticking to [the Baltic Sea pipeline project] Nord Stream 2, that was definitely a mistake,” he said in Berlin on 4 April. “We held on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in, and of which our partners warned us.” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, spoke strongly about the need to aid Ukraine in its reconstruction, especially as it pertains to the country’s ascension into the European Union. Meanwhile, while German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is in Ukraine for his first trip since the Russian invasion, European leaders are convening in Berlin for a conference on Ukraine’s reconstruction. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the conference in a video address that more than a third of the country’s energy sector has been destroyed by rockets and Iranian drones, Reuters is reporting. But despite Ukraine’s great need for funds to rebuild, Kyiv has not received a cent of the $17bn rapid recovery funds that the European Commission and World Bank determined that Ukraine would need for the first stage of recovery. Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is in Kyiv for his first trip to Ukraine since Russia invaded and Moscow has since escalated with unsubstantiated warnings of a “dirty bomb”. He touched down in Kyiv as air raid sirens began to sound around the capital. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed occupied Zaporizhia oblast official, has purportedly told Russian state media that the car explosion near the office of Russian propaganda channel ZaTv in Russian-occupied Melitopol was a terrorist attack stemming from an “improvised explosive device”. He wrote on Telegram that the power of the explosion was the equivalent of 2kg of TNT. A car explosion near the office of ZaTV in Russian-occupied Melitopol has injured at least five people – including some company employees, officials said. ZaTv is a Russian propaganda channel that began broadcasting to the occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia oblast on 1 August. It’s unclear yet if the blast was an accident or deliberate, or if anyone is taking responsibility for the incident. No one told the 108 female Ukrainian prisoners of war, why, after five months in the most notorious jail in occupied Ukraine, their Russian captors were leading them to a bridge in the small south-west village of Kam’yans’ke. But when they saw their own soldiers, heard their own language being spoken, and realised that they were to be taking part in a prisoner exchange, they could not hold back their emotions, said 25-year-old Alina Panina, one of the Ukrainian soldiers. “They shouted glory to Ukraine. Some girls began to sing the national anthem of Ukraine,” Panina said. “Some girls could no longer hold back tears and cried. They fell to their knees on the ground.” Panina spoke exclusively to the Guardian’s Daniel Boffey. Read more of her extraordinary account here: As of today, Ukrainian authorities are estimating that Russian forces have lost approximately 68,420 personnel since the start of the invasion. If you’re just joining us, here is a quick recap of where things stand: Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has told western counterparts that the war in Ukraine is heading for an “uncontrolled escalation” amid evidence that the Kremlin is weighing how to respond to yet another anticipated battlefield defeat around the key southern city of Kherson. Russia’s grip on the city of Kherson appears increasingly fragile. Russian forces seemed to be preparing to withdraw from the east bank of the Dnieper River, ordering a fresh evacuation of civilians and laying the ground for the potential loss of the city of Kherson itself. All civilians were ordered to evacuate immediately over the weekend in the face of the advancing Ukrainian counteroffensive. All men remaining in Kherson have been invited to join a newly formed local militia. In a notice on Telegram, the occupation authorities said men had the “opportunity” to join territorial defence units if they chose to remain in Kherson of their own free will. Compelling civilians to serve in the armed forces of an occupying power is defined as a breach of the Geneva conventions. Russia is bringing new military units into Kherson as it prepares to defend the city in the face of the advancing Ukrainian counteroffensive, the head of Ukraine’s defence intelligence directorate has said. Kyrylo Budanov also said Russia would slow Ukrainian troops’ advance in the south by only about two weeks if it blows up the Kakhovka hyrdoelectric dam near Kherson. The UK Ministry of Defence reports that there have been at least 23 verified losses of Russia’s Ka-52 Hokum attack helicopter in Ukraine since the invasion. This represents over 25% of the Russian air force’s in-service fleet of 90 Ka-52s, and nearly half of Russia’s total helicopter losses in Ukraine, according to British intelligence. The US is considering sending older Hawk air defence equipment from storage to Ukraine to help it defend against Russian drone and cruise missile attacks, two US officials told Reuters. Ukraine and the US denounced suggestions from Russia that Ukraine was preparing to use a “dirty bomb” as dangerous lies. “If Russia calls and says that Ukraine is allegedly preparing something, it means one thing: Russia has already prepared all this,” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a video address. The White House national security council also rejected Shoigu’s claims. “The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation,” a statement said. The UN nuclear watchdog is preparing to send inspectors in the coming days to two Ukrainian sites after Kyiv requested an expert mission be sent to disprove Russian claims that Ukraine plans to use a “dirty bomb”. The US has had no indications that Russia has decided to use a nuclear, biological or chemical weapon, a US military official has said. The US believes Russia is “keeping lines of communication open” after Moscow requested a call between US defence secretary Lloyd Austin and Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu on Sunday, the official added. National leaders, development experts and CEOs will gather in Berlin today for a conference on what its hosts say must be a Marshall plan to rebuild Ukraine after Russia’s invasion. The conference, hosted by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and the European Commission, will not involve concrete pledges of cash towards the estimated $750bn reconstruction cost. German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier arrived in Ukraine for a surprise visit on Tuesday morning. Steinmeier will meet with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. It is his first trip to the country since Russia invaded on 24 February, according to German broadcaster NTV. The World Bank says it has disbursed an additional $500m to help Ukraine meet urgent spending needs created by the war. The financing by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the bank’s main lending arm, was supported by $500m in loan guarantees from Britain that were announced on 30 September, the bank said on Monday. There have been at least 23 verified losses of Russia’s Ka-52 Hokum attack helicopter in Ukraine since the invasion, the UK Ministry of Defence reports. This represents over 25% of the Russian air force’s in-service fleet of 90 Ka-52s, and nearly half of Russia’s total helicopter losses in Ukraine, according to British intelligence. The ministry believes the Russian attack helicopters have probably suffered particular attrition from Ukrainian man-portable air defence systems (Manpads), while the helicopters frequently operate with less consistent top-cover from combat jets than they would expect under Russia military doctrine. “Russia is still failing to maintain adequate air superiority in order to reliably carry out effective fixed-wing close air support near the frontline, and its artillery ammunition is running low,” the latest intelligence report reads. Russian commanders are also likely increasingly resorting to conducting high-risk attack helicopter missions as one of the few options available to provide close support for troops in combat. The US is considering sending older Hawk air defence equipment from storage to Ukraine to help it defend against Russian drone and cruise missile attacks, two US officials told Reuters. The Hawk interceptor missiles would be an upgrade to the Stinger missile systems – a smaller, shorter range air defence system – that the US has already sent to blunt Russia’s invasion. The Biden administration would use the presidential drawdown authority (PDA) to transfer the Hawk equipment, which is based on Vietnam-era technology but has been upgraded several times. The Hawk system is the predecessor to Patriot missile defence system made by Raytheon Technologies, which remains off the table for Ukraine, US officials told Reuters. The US would likely initially send interceptor missiles for the Hawk system to Ukraine because it was unclear if enough US launchers were in good repair, one US official told Reuters. The US systems have been in storage for decades. The World Bank says it has disbursed an additional $500m to help Ukraine meet urgent spending needs created by the war. The financing by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the bank’s main lending arm, was supported by $500m in loan guarantees from Britain that were announced on 30 September, the bank said on Monday. World Bank group president David Malpass said in a statement: The Russian invasion continues to cause massive destruction of Ukraine’s infrastructure – including water, sanitation, and electricity networks - just as winter is approaching, further endangering Ukrainian people. The new portion of financing disbursed today will be used to maintain essential government services. We stand firmly to support the Ukrainian people as they face this unparalleled crisis.” The Kremlin alleges that Ukraine is preparing to detonate a dirty bomb in order to blame it on Russia and force an escalation to the war. Western countries have dismissed that claim as “transparently false”. So what is a dirty bomb? “Dirty bombs” have long been feared as a potential weapon of terrorists, because their main objective is to sow panic, confusion and anxiety by hurling radioactive dust and smoke into the atmosphere. Although no dirty bomb attack has ever been recorded, two failed attempts to detonate such a device were reported in the southern Russian province of Chechnya more than two decades ago. Technically known as radiological dispersion devices, dirty bombs are relatively primitive, imprecise weapons. They are much easier and cheaper to build than a nuclear device and also far less dangerous. Dirty bombs use conventional explosives, such as dynamite, placed alongside radioactive material, which is then flung outward by the force of the blast. The amount of radioactive material dispersed, while dangerous, is not necessarily lethal. Read the full explainer below: Russia has doubled down on its claim that Kyiv is preparing to use a “dirty bomb” in Ukraine, saying it would bring the issue to the UN security council on Tuesday. Moscow sent a letter on its claims about Kyiv to the United Nations late on Monday, and diplomats said it planned to raise the issue with the security council at a closed meeting the following day. “We will regard the use of the dirty bomb by the Kyiv regime as an act of nuclear terrorism,” Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia wrote UN secretary general Antonio Guterres and the security council in the letter, seen by Reuters. “We urge the western countries to exert their influence on the regime in Kiev to abandon its dangerous plans threatening international peace and security,” he wrote. “We call on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to do everything in his power to prevent this heinous crime from happening.” The foreign ministers of France, Britain and the United States have rejected Moscow’s allegations as “transparently false” and reiterated their support for Ukraine. “The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation,” they said in a joint statement. The UN nuclear watchdog is preparing to send inspectors in the coming days to two Ukrainian sites at Kyiv’s request, in an apparent reaction to the Russian “dirty bomb” claims. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said both sites were already subject to its inspections and one was inspected a month ago. IAEA director general Rafael Grossi said in a statement on Monday: The IAEA inspected one of these locations one month ago and all our findings were consistent with Ukraine’s safeguards declarations. No undeclared nuclear activities or material were found there. The IAEA is preparing to visit the locations in the coming days. The purpose of the safeguards visits is to detect any possible undeclared nuclear activities and material.” Russia’s state news agency RIA had earlier identified what it said were the two sites involved in the operation - the Eastern Mineral Enrichment Plant in central Dnipropetrovsk region and the Institute for Nuclear Research in Kyiv. The IAEA statement did not name the facilities it would inspect. German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier has reportedly arrived in Ukraine for a surprise visit today. It is his first trip to the country since Russia invaded on 24 February, according to German broadcaster NTV. Steinmeier arrived in the capital, Kyiv, by train in the morning and will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in the course of the day, according to the broadcaster. Steinmeier’s spokesperson, Cerstin Gammelin, shared an image of the president arriving in Kyiv early this morning. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. Russia plans to raise its accusation that Ukraine is planning a “dirty bomb” attack at the UN security council later today, diplomats have said. Britain, France and the US have all rejected Russia’s warning about a “dirty bomb”. Meanwhile the UN nuclear watchdog is preparing to send inspectors in the coming days to two Ukrainian sites at Kyiv’s request, in order to discredit Russia’s unfounded claims. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said both sites were already subject to its inspections and one was inspected a month ago. Here are all the latest lines you may have missed: Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has told western counterparts that the war in Ukraine is heading for an “uncontrolled escalation” amid evidence that the Kremlin is weighing how to respond to yet another anticipated battlefield defeat around the key southern city of Kherson.

The US believes Russia is “keeping lines of communication open” after Moscow requested a call between US defence secretary Lloyd Austin and Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu on Sunday, the official added. The United Nations has said urgent steps are needed to relieve a backlog of more than 150 ships involved in a deal that allows Ukraine to export grain from ports in the Black Sea. Ukraine said Russian inspections that have been creating “significant” delays for the export of Ukrainian food products were “politically motivated” and a cause for concern. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Israel to join the fight against Russia and repeated an appeal for Israeli air defence systems. Israel has condemned Russia’s invasion but has limited its assistance to deliveries of humanitarian aid and defensive equipment. Most recently it offered to help Ukrainians develop air attack alerts for civilians. Zelenskiy said that was not enough and asked that Israeli leaders reconsider sending air defences as well. Ukraine’s special operations forces said that Iranian drone instructors have been spotted in Belarus. According to special operations forces, Iran’s Islamic revolutionary guard corps are training Russian forces in Belarus and coordinating the launches of Iranian-made drones. A pro-Kremlin television presenter has been accused of inciting genocide after calling for Ukrainian children to be “drowned” and “burned” alive during an interview on the state-funded RT channel. Anton Krasovsky, the chief of Russian-language broadcasting for the channel formerly called Russia Today, was suspended from RT, and the head of Russia’s powerful investigative committee said it would review his remarks as part of a potential criminal investigation. US basketball star Brittney Griner “does not expect miracles” at her appeal hearing on Tuesday, her lawyers said in a statement. The two-time Olympic gold medallist is appealing against a nine-year Russian jail term for drug possession and smuggling. Her lawyers said she would take part in Tuesday’s hearing by video link from the detention centre where she has been held, and that they expected a verdict the same day. National leaders, development experts and CEOs will gather in Berlin on Tuesday for a conference on what its hosts say must be a Marshall plan to rebuild Ukraine after Russia’s invasion.

While Saudi Arabia announced it would open its airspace to flights from Israel, making Biden the first US president to fly directly from Tel Aviv to the kingdom, expectations of further gains during his visit remained low. The US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told journalists onboard Air Force One not to expect any bilateral announcements in response to American demands that Saudi Arabia pump more oil to calm global energy markets after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Saudi Arabia is keen to prove its independence from US interests as it increasingly courts Russia and China. “From the start, my aim was to reorient – but not rupture – relations with a country that’s been a strategic partner for 80 years,” Biden wrote in the Washington Post prior to his visit, sidestepping his pledge on the campaign trail to make Saudi Arabia “a pariah”, and the later release of a US intelligence report stating that Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, “approved” an operation to capture and murder the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. “It’s a completely different Saudi Arabia, one that in many ways has modernised and opened up a bit, but is also seeing greater crackdowns – and the Biden administration is brutally aware of all this,” said Dina Esfandiary of the NGO Crisis Group. Biden’s visit means carefully stage-managing relations with Prince Mohammed, the Kingdom’s powerful de facto ruler, who observers say has the upper hand as Biden courts his goodwill at a time of rising global oil prices mounting a challenge to his presidency domestically. The two shared a fist bump on Biden’s arrival, although the president later warmly shook hands with the king, Salman bin Abdulaziz. At the start of the president’s Middle East trip, officials said he would avoid close contact such as shaking hands as a precaution against Covid. The US president is under intense pressure to repair the fragile relationship between two nations, one that traditionally relied on the kingdom liberally supplying oil to the global market in exchange for the US’s backing in areas of security and defence. This has increasingly shifted in recent years, exacerbated as the relationship between Biden and Prince Mohammed has soured and Saudi Arabia looks to Russia and China to diversify its interests. “The message from Saudi is you can’t tell us what to do, we’ll help you as far as it suits us but we won’t go against our own interests,” said Esfandiary. Cinzia Bianco, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, agreed. “The Saudi leadership has learned to do without seeking validation from the United States, and Bin Salman in particular – he’s learned to survive and maybe even thrive within the region and to some degree internationally, without getting validation from the US administration,” she said. Khashoggi’s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, said that, with the visit to Saudi Arabia, Biden was reneging on previous promises to prioritise human rights. “It’s a very huge backing down actually,” Cengiz told the Associated Press. “It’s heartbreaking and disappointing. And Biden will lose his moral authority by putting oil and expediency over principles and values.” Saudi Arabia’s recent cooperation with Russia has included an agreement for Rosatom, a Russian state company, to build a nuclear power plant in the kingdom, as well as signing an agreement last year to “explore ways to develop military to strengthen the military and defence cooperation” between the two countries according to the deputy defence minister, Prince Khalid bin Salman. China is historically the largest importer of Saudi Arabian oil, while the kingdom has bought Chinese arms including drones and fighter aircraft. Last November, US intelligence agencies concluded that Saudi Arabia is manufacturing its own ballistic missiles with the help of China, according to satellite imagery. Bianco stressed that the US administration saw Biden’s visit as a vital opportunity to intervene and warm relations before Saudi Arabia moves ahead with Chinese and Russian deals that largely remain in their infancy. “The US administration sees an opportunity to undo all of that or take a step back and create some space,” she said. “There’s a lot on paper rather than in reality, and there’s still space for the administration to try to create some distance between Saudi Arabia, Russia and China.” Yet as Biden landed in Jeddah to discuss how to increase the global supply of oil in order to bring down prices, doubts persisted as to whether he would fly home with anything to show for his visit at all. Shortly before his arrival, Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia had more than doubled its imports of Russian oil in order to free up more of its own crude for export, shunning demands for sanctions from the west while increasing profit margins amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Maybe the US administration had good intentions when it began setting up this trip, but ultimately it’s making them look bad – they’re losing the public relations war,” said Esfandiary. “It’s not clear that they’re going to make any gains, my sense is that everyone will walk away disappointed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/sep/16/as-dark-clouds-build-across-the-indo-pacific-australia-hopes-the-aukus-pact-will-bolster-security-and-confidence","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-16T03:23:57Z","webTitle":"As dark clouds build across the Indo-Pacific, Australia hopes the Aukus pact will bolster security and confidence | John Blaxland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/16/as-dark-clouds-build-across-the-indo-pacific-australia-hopes-the-aukus-pact-will-bolster-security-and-confidence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/16/as-dark-clouds-build-across-the-indo-pacific-australia-hopes-the-aukus-pact-will-bolster-security-and-confidence","fields":{"headline":"As dark clouds build across the Indo-Pacific, Australia hopes the Aukus pact will bolster security and confidence","bodyText":"A new trilateral security arrangement announced by US president Joe Biden will see Australia’s security ties with the United States and United Kingdom deepen, echoing the strong wartime bonds of the past, but with 21st century technology at its heart. In addition to covering shared technology, industrial bases and supply lines, core to this is the agreement for US and UK support to Australia through the supply of nuclear submarine propulsion technology – a move that effectively sidelines the delay-plagued submarine program centred on the French Naval group’s bespoke design. Ironically, some of the delays relate to France’s difficulty in converting a nuclear submarine design into a conventionally powered one. They would be unimpressed, I imagine. The choice reflects the heightened gravity of the great power contestational challenge which has put the security issues of the Indo-Pacific in stark relief. The US remains the world’s most powerful nation but China is fast catching up, with nuclear submarines being manufactured in southern China at an unprecedented rate. Post-Brexit Britain, eager to burnish its US security ties and bolster its “Global Britain” image, and looking for growing trade links in the region, is more enthused with Australia links than it has been for over half a century – when it walked away from the empire and joined the European Union’s precursor organisation in 1973. Australia and the UK had worked together in the 1950s on atomic weapons testing at Maralinga and Montebello Island, helping the UK step up to become a nuclear power. Australia was sidelined in the 1957 negotiations for the US-UK nuclear power sharing arrangement. Still, Australia explored the nuclear option for power generation with prime minister John Gorton actively involved in laying the foundations for a nuclear power station at the mouth of Jervis Bay, south of Sydney. The footings are now rusting and overgrown but point to the seriousness with which the Australian government treated the issue in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Today Australia has one of the world’s largest repositories of uranium, but won’t use it or store it for others – despite happily exporting it to them and living on the most stable habitable continent with the most sparsely populated country on earth. The nuclear propulsion agreement portends a significant push to nuclear for power generation more broadly. Replacement submarines have featured in several recent defence white papers going back for more than a decade, notably the 2009 one which featured submarines on the cover. Back then, Kevin Rudd as ALP prime minister mandated Australia should increase its holdings from six to 12 submarines, but they would be conventionally, not nuclear, powered. Nuclear power was seen as something politically unpalatable for the ALP and difficult to sustain because of the limited nuclear skills set in Australia and the questionable willingness of the United States to support Australia to sustain such a capability. Indeed, US and UK ally, Canada, had considered acquiring nuclear propulsion submarines in the late cold war years but faced strong UK and US resistance to the idea. That seemed to be a pointer for Australia too. Australian strategic and defence policy has long struggled to reconcile the dialectic which has manifested as the contrasting fear of abandonment and fear of entrapment. Ever since 1942, when Australia last faced an existential crisis, Australian governments have looked to shore up ties with their “great and power friends”. For the last half century that has been principally with the US, but now the UK seems eager to return. How much the UK can commit in this space is still up for debate, mindful of its considerable challenges with an adventurist Russia under Putin and a squabbling Europe at their end of the Eurasian land mass. Conversely, pundits have long considered the risk of entrapment – of being drawn into a conflict in the Indo-Pacific not of our making. The government seems convinced that increased self-reliance comes through increased reliance – on US and UK nuclear propulsion technology, industrial bases and supply lines. Hopefully that’s the right call, but it comes with risks. This month we remember the 70th anniversary of the signing of the Anzus treaty – an alliance arrangement that avoided providing a direct security guarantee, promising instead “to consult” in the face of threats to the parties in the Pacific. This Aukus tripartite pact takes the Anzus security agreement to a new level. Being integrally connected with the US and UK through this new arrangement appears to be intended in part at least to bolster our confidence in not being abandoned. Conversely, as dark clouds build across the Indo-Pacific, the hope is that increased deterrence will bolster security, sending a message, particularly to Beijing, that force can and would be met. But the alternate view is that this bolstered investment in trilateral ties risks entrapment. US president Teddy Roosevelt once suggested it was best to “speak softly and carry a big stick”. In recent times, Australia has tended to speak loudly and carry a small stick. This move will certainly help to make the Australian stick a bit bigger. Hopefully, in doing so Australia will become more adept at speaking softly too. • John Blaxland is professor of international security and intelligence studies at the ANU’s strategic and defence studies centre"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/07/thursday-briefing-upset-at-sunak-wifes-tax-status","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-07T05:22:46Z","webTitle":"Thursday briefing: Upset at Sunak wife’s tax status","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/thursday-briefing-upset-at-sunak-wifes-tax-status","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/07/thursday-briefing-upset-at-sunak-wifes-tax-status","fields":{"headline":"Thursday briefing: Upset at Sunak wife’s tax status","bodyText":"Top story: millionaire Akshata Murthy has non-domicile status Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the stories you need to know about today. Rishi Sunak’s multimillionaire wife claims non-domicile status, it has emerged, which allows her to save millions of pounds in tax on dividends collected from her family’s IT business empire. Akshata Murthy, who receives about £11.5m in annual dividends from her stake in the Indian IT services company Infosys, declares non-dom status, a scheme that allows people to avoid tax on foreign earnings. Murthy, the daughter of Infosys’s billionaire founder, owns a 0.93% stake in the tech firm worth approximately £690m. Tulip Siddiq, the shadow economic secretary to the treasury, said Sunak should explain how much tax his family saved while “he was putting taxes up for millions of working families”. The non-domicile status is legal and can be used to avoid paying UK tax on income from overseas rents and bank interest as well as foreign dividends. The Treasury declined to comment. A spokesperson for Murthy said India did not allow dual citizenship, “so, according to British law, Ms Murthy is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income.” More than one in 10 residents of some of London’s wealthiest neighbourhoods have claimed “non-dom” status at some point, meaning they paid no tax on their offshore income. The number of people who had ever claimed non-dom status in the UK rose from 162,000 in 2001 to 238,000 in 2018. And a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies says the top 0.1% of earners in the UK have annual incomes in excess of £500,000, showing the effect of “unfair” tax rates available to business owners. More than 50,000 people in the top income bracket account for 6% of all earnings. * * * Ukraine latest – Volodymyr Zelenskiy says new sanctions by the west against Russia do not go far enough and will be seen by invading forces as a “permission to attack”, as fears of an assault on the east of the country intensify and civilians still there were urged to leave “while the opportunity still exists”. The deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said the authorities would “not be able to help” residents who stayed behind once large-scale fighting erupted.

The strategy will enrage environmentalists, who say the government’s plans are in defiance of its own net zero targets and neglect alternative measures that experts say would provide much quicker relief from high energy bills. The main points include increasing nuclear capacity from 7 gigawatts to 24GW, raising the offshore wind target to 50GW (from 11GW today), solar growing five times from 14GW to 70GW by 2035, and an “impartial” review into whether fracking is safe. * * * Cancer concern – More patients are diagnosed with cancer in A&amp;E in Britain than in other comparable high-income countries. A major study in the Lancet Oncology journal found more than a third of patients in England, Scotland and Wales discover they have the disease only once they are in hospital. People who end up in A&amp;E, sometimes after multiple trips to their GP, are less likely to survive the disease, particularly if they have stomach, bowel, liver, pancreatic, lung or ovarian cancer. * * * Conversion row – About 50 Tory MPs could force the government to toughen up its ban on conversion practices by backing a move to extend the protections to transgender people. Campaigners fighting to outlaw the controversial exercise said “the battle is definitely still on” and remained confident that No 10 would either be swayed or defeated in the remaining months. The PM said yesterday that he does not “think that biological males should be competing in female sporting events”. * * * The Swift imperium – Latin teachers are being encouraged to use Taylor Swift’s lyrics, Disney songs, Minecraft and fan fiction to help make the ancient language of Virgil and Cicero more accessible.

In recent days, Russia has ordered civilians out of Kherson in anticipation of a Ukrainian assault to recapture the city, the only regional capital Moscow has seized since its invasion in February. Ukraine’s Russian-occupied city of Kherson was cut off from water and electricity supplies on Sunday after an airstrike and damage to the Kakhovka dam, local officials said. “In Kherson and a number of other areas in the region, there is temporarily no electricity or water supply,” the city’s Moscow-installed administration said on Telegram. Russia accused Ukraine of an act of “sabotage”. Ukraine’s military said Russia was urging residents of Kherson to evacuate as soon as possible, sending them warning messages on their phones on Sunday. Russia was “occupying and evacuating” Kherson simultaneously, trying to convince Ukrainians its force are leaving when in fact they are digging in, Nataliya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern forces, told state television. The Kremlin-installed administration in Kherson already has expelled tens of thousands of civilians from the city. Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vučić has said he expects the battle of Kherson to be the defining battle of the war. Russian state-owned news agency Tass quoted him saying: “We have a difficult time ahead of us, next winter will be even more difficult than this one, because we are facing the Battle of Stalingrad, the decisive battle in the war in Ukraine, the battle for Kherson, in which both sides use thousands of tanks, aircraft, artillery. The west thinks that in this way it will be able to destroy Russia, Russia believes that in this way it will be able to protect what it took at the beginning of the war and bring the war to an end. This will create additional problems everywhere.” Russia’s defence ministry took the unusual step of denying reports by Russian military bloggers that a naval infantry unit had lost hundreds of men in a fruitless offensive in eastern Ukraine, the state-owned RIA news agency said. It said the ministry had rejected the bloggers’ assertions that the 155th marine brigade of the Pacific Fleet had suffered “high, pointless losses in people and equipment”. Ukraine continues to brace for fresh Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure. Russia “is concentrating forces and means for a possible repetition of massive attacks on our infrastructure, primarily energy”, said Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. Ukraine faced a 32% deficit in projected power supply on Monday, said Sergei Kovalenko, CEO of Yasno, a major supplier of energy to the capital. “This is a lot, and it’s force majeure,” he said. About 500 power generators were being sent to Ukraine by 17 EU countries as 4.5m Ukrainians were left without power. Planned blackouts are scheduled to hit seven regions of Ukraine throughout Monday, according to Ukraine’s state-run energy company. The regions include the city of Kyiv, and the regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv and Poltava. Kyiv’s mayor urged residents to prepare for a worst-case scenario by making emergency plans to leave the city and stay with friends or family. Vitali Klitschko urged residents to “consider everything” including loss of power and water. “If you have extended family or friends outside Kyiv, where there is autonomous water supply, an oven, heating, please keep in mind the possibility of staying there for a certain amount of time.” Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, echoed Klitschko’s words about evacuating Kyiv’s residents, saying “I hope it won’t come to this, and we’re still trying to renew all electric facilities, generating stations, the transformations, all of it. If it comes to it, we’ll have to move them back to west west of Ukraine, Lviv and all the places closer to the European Union. That’s a huge number of people to be located but Ukrainian winters can become quite harsh. We have to think how we do it.” Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, one of Ukraine’s westernmost regions, has announced preparation measures for receiving more refugees and internally displaced people into his region, and appealed for help with the provision of diesel generators and financial aid for medical supplies. Ukraine has received its first delivery of Nasams and Apside air defence systems, the country’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, announced Monday. “We will continue to shoot down the enemy targets attacking us. Thank you to our partners: Norway, Spain and the US,” Reznikov wrote on Twitter. Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti reported Monday that President Vladimir Putin will make a decision on whether to attend the next G20 summit in person by the end of the week. Zelenskiy has said he will not attend if Putin does. The summit in Bali is due to begin Tuesday 15 November. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the media on his daily call on Monday that while Russia remains “open” to talks, it is unable to negotiate with Kyiv due to its refusal to hold talks with Russia. The head of Ukraine’s Byzantine-rite Catholic Church, Sviatoslav Shevchuk, met Pope Francis at the Vatican on Monday and said there can be no dialogue with Russia as long as Moscow considered the neighbour it invaded a colony to be subjugated. The Orthodox church of Ukraine has said worshippers can celebrate Christmas on 25 December, a move away from the traditional date of 7 January directed against pro-Putin head of Russian Orthodox church. The Kyiv Independent is reporting that “farmers’ warehouses, a cultural site, and private houses” were damaged in Zaporizhzhia region by Russian strikes, and according to local governor Pavlo Kyrylenko Russian forces have killed one civilian in Bakhmut and wounded five civilians elsewhere in the Donetsk region. An internal rift over the supply of deadly drones to Russia for use in Ukraine has opened up in Iran, with a prominent conservative cleric and newspaper editor saying Russia is the clear aggressor in the war and the supply should stop. A former Iranian ambassador to Moscow has also hinted the foreign ministry may have been kept in the dark both by the Kremlin and the Iranian military. Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK has told Sky News in London that the new British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will visit the country soon. Sunak had promised that Ukraine would be his first overseas port of call if he became PM, but in a high-profile U-turn has headed to Egypt and Cop 27 instead. Prystaiko said:“We’re not going to discuss the dates, because of the security of your prime minister. But he’s coming to Ukraine quite soon.” Russian forces are stepping up their strikes in a fiercely contested region of eastern Ukraine, worsening the already tough conditions for residents and the Ukrainian army, Ukrainian authorities said. “Very fierce Russian attacks on Donetsk region are continuing. The enemy is suffering serious losses there,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. US officials have reportedly warned the Ukrainian government in private that it needs to signal an openness to negotiating with Russia. Officials in Washington warned that “Ukraine fatigue” among allies could worsen if Kyiv continued to be closed to negotiations, the Washington Post reported. US officials told the paper that Ukraine’s position on negotiations with Russia was wearing thin among allies worried about the economic effects of a protracted war. External power was restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant two days after it was disconnected from the power grid when Russian shelling damaged high voltage lines, the UN nuclear watchdog said. Europe’s largest nuclear plant needs electricity to maintain vital cooling systems, but it had been running on emergency diesel generators since Russian shelling severed its outside connections. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, held secretive talks with top Russian officials in hopes of reducing the risk of nuclear conflict, the Wall Street Journal has reported. It cited US and allied officials as saying that Sullivan held previously undisclosed conversations in recent months with the Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov and the Russian security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev, Sullivan’s counterpart. The White House declined to comment on the report. “We have nothing to say about this publication,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/26/russia-accused-of-shelling-mariupol-humanitarian-corridor","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-26T15:34:29Z","webTitle":"Russia accused of shelling Mariupol humanitarian corridor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/russia-accused-of-shelling-mariupol-humanitarian-corridor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/26/russia-accused-of-shelling-mariupol-humanitarian-corridor","fields":{"headline":"Russia accused of shelling Mariupol humanitarian corridor","bodyText":"Russia has stepped up attempts to encircle defending forces in the east of Ukraine and stood accused of shelling a humanitarian corridor out of Mariupol, as the US vowed to move “heaven and earth” to help Ukraine win the war. Amid a flurry of diplomatic activity in Moscow and Germany, a fresh wave of civilian deaths were reported across eastern Ukraine as Vladimir Putin’s forces escalated their barrage of key targets on Tuesday and appeared to renege once again on giving safe passage to women and children. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, the besieged port city on the Sea of Azov where the remaining Ukrainian forces and civilians have been hiding out in a steel works, said the latest attempt to get people out had failed. Andryushchenko claimed that agreement on a humanitarian corridor out of the Azovstal steelworks had proven to be a “trap”, with Russian forces firing their artillery on the exit zone just moments after announcing through loudspeakers that a green corridor had been opened. Last week, Putin had ordered his troops not to storm the steel mill, but to seal it off so that “not even a fly comes through”. There are an estimated 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the complex, along with many of their families. Andryushchenko said that over the past 24 hours, there had been 35 airstrikes against the Azovstal plant, with one strike causing a fire to break out in one of the workshops where civilians had been hiding, leaving some under rubble. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, meeting the UN secretary general in Moscow, dismissed Ukraine’s proposal to stage peace talks in the port city, saying it was a “theatrical gesture” and “they probably wanted another heartrending scene”. Russia’s apparent flouting of the agreement for a humanitarian rescue of civilians trapped in Mariupol came amid increased efforts to push on in the east of Ukraine. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of the Donetsk region, reported that two people had been killed and six others wounded as “Russians continue to deliberately fire at civilians and to destroy critical infrastructure”. In the neighbouring region of Luhansk, the governor, Serhiy Haidai, said three people had died after Russian shells hit a residential building in the city of Popasna, which Russian forces have been trying to capture. There were also reports of damage to an important bridge across the Dniester estuary linking the strategically vital region of Bessarabia to the rest of the country. Should Ukrainian forces leave Bessarabia for fear of being cut off it could become a staging post for an attack on the Black Sea city of Odesa. Russia has refocused its operations in Ukraine in recent weeks away from storming the capital, Kyiv, in the north and towards creating a Kremlin-controlled region stretching across the east and south of Ukraine. At the US Ramstein airbase in Germany, Joe Biden’s defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, attending a meeting of officials from about 40 countries, pledged more weapons to foil Putin, while Germany announced it had cleared the way for delivery of Gepard anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine. Austin said he wanted to find a “common and transparent understanding of Ukraine’s near-term security requirements because we’re going to keep moving heaven and earth so that we can meet them”. Meanwhile, the head of the UN’s atomic watchdog has condemned the Russian occupation of the Chernobyl nuclear plant, describing the situation as “absolutely abnormal and very, very dangerous”. Rafael Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director general, spoke to reporters as he arrived at the site of the former nuclear power plant, which was occupied by Russian troops for several weeks. Grossi was heading an expert mission to Chernobyl to “deliver equipment, conduct radiological assessments and restore safeguards monitoring systems”, the IAEA said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/sep/06/morning-mail-britain-gets-truss-for-pm-albanese-flags-orderly-emissions-cuts-when-cosmetic-fillers-go-wrong","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-05T21:04:06Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Britain gets Truss for PM, Albanese flags ‘orderly’ emissions cuts, when cosmetic fillers go wrong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/06/morning-mail-britain-gets-truss-for-pm-albanese-flags-orderly-emissions-cuts-when-cosmetic-fillers-go-wrong","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/sep/06/morning-mail-britain-gets-truss-for-pm-albanese-flags-orderly-emissions-cuts-when-cosmetic-fillers-go-wrong","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Britain gets Truss for PM, Albanese flags ‘orderly’ emissions cuts, when cosmetic fillers go wrong","bodyText":"Good morning. Liz Truss will become Britain’s next prime minister. Albanese promises to work with the resources sector to “reduce emissions in a predictable and orderly way.” And the Guardian Essential poll tracks a worrying fall in Australians’ trust in government. Liz Truss will become Britain’s next prime minister after beating Rishi Sunak in the Conservative leadership contest. The foreign secretary won 81,326 votes (57.4%) of Tory members to the former chancellor’s 60,399 (42.6%) and will take over from Boris Johnson, who was ousted by his own MPs earlier this summer. But the euphoria of victory will quickly give way to the hard reality of the economic challenges ahead, with the country gripped by a cost of living crisis leaving families struggling to pay their energy bills this winter. A majority of voters think Scott Morrison should resign from parliament, and that he “diminished the reputation of government” by secretly appointing himself to five additional portfolios while prime minister, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The poll also finds trust in government in steady decline. Scott Morrison has said he didn’t immediately apologise for having himself secretly sworn in to multiple ministries because he didn’t want to be caught up in a “political circus” of criticism. Anthony Albanese has promised to work with the resources sector to “reduce emissions in a predictable and orderly way” and that Australia will continue to be a “trusted and stable supplier of energy” to trading partners. Albanese told the minerals industry parliamentary dinner on Monday the “cooperation and dialogue” Labor achieved at the two-day jobs and skills summit should be the rule not a “48-hour exception”. On Monday the Greens introduced new “climate trigger” laws into parliament that would ban emissions intensive projects.

The regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones damaged two infrastructure facilities, in the city. He said other missiles also struck the city again, injuring one person. On Monday, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanani denied supplying the drones to Russia, calling the claims “baseless”. In the northeastern Kharkiv region where Ukrainian forces regained a large swathe of ground in September, the bodies of 534 civilians including 19 children were found after Russian troops left, Serhiy Bolvinov of the National Police in Kharkiv told a briefing. The total included 447 bodies found in Izium. He also said that investigators had found evidence of 22 sites being used as “torture rooms”. Joe Biden has warned the world could face “Armageddon” if Vladimir Putin uses a tactical nuclear weapon to try to win the war in Ukraine. The US president made his most outspoken remarks to date about the threat of nuclear war, saying it was the closest the world had come to nuclear catastrophe for sixty years. “We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis,” he said. “We’ve got a guy I know fairly well,” Biden said, referring to the Russian president. “He’s not joking when he talks about potential use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons because his military is, you might say, significantly underperforming.” The 2022 Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski from Belarus, the Russian human rights organisation Memorial and the Ukrainian human rights organisation Center for Civil Liberties. Putin should face an “international tribunal”, the head of Ukraine’s Center for Civil Liberties said after the award. Writing on Facebook, Oleksandra Matviychuk called on the Russian president, the Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, and other “war criminals” to face an international tribunal in order to “give the hundreds of thousands of victims of war crimes a chance to see justice”. Matviychuk also called for Russia to be excluded from the UN security council “for systematic violations of the UN charter”. Ukrainian sources are attempting to clarify what President Volodymyr Zelenskiy meant yesterday when he talked about “preventive strikes” being necessary to stop Russia using tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov seized on the comments, interpreting them as a call for Nato to use nuclear weapons against Russia, and said the comments showed why Russia’s “special military operation” within Ukraine’s borders had been necessary. Advisor to Zelenskiy, Serhii Nykyforov, said “Colleagues, you have gone a little too far with your nuclear hysteria and now you hear nuclear strikes even where there are none. The president spoke about the period before 24 February. Then it was necessary to apply preventive measures to prevent Russia from starting the war. Let me remind you that the only measures that were about then were preventive sanctions.” A member of Vladimir Putin’s inner circle directly confronted the Russian president over mistakes and failings in the war in Ukraine, the Washington Post has reported, citing US intelligence. The headquarters of the armed forces of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) has claimed to have captured three settlements from Ukrainian forces in Donetsk. At least five people were killed and as many injured after Ukrainian forces struck a bus while shelling a strategically important bridge in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, Russia’s Tass news agency has reported. The office of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has issued a brief read-out after he held a call with his Russian counterpart. The pair discussed the latest developments in Ukraine, and Erdoğan repeated Ankara’s willingness to do its part to peacefully resolve the war. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has congratulated Putin on his 70th birthday, applauding him for his “distinguished leadership and strong will” in the latest sign of deepening ties between the two countries. In the birthday message, Kim spoke of Putin’s achievements in “building powerful Russia” and said the Russian leader was “enjoying high respects and support from the broad masses of people”. The EU has imposed a new round of sanctions on Russia, expanding import and export bans and blacklisting individuals over Moscow’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions. Zelenskiy told European heads of state gathered in Prague on Thursday that Ukraine must win so that Russia does not “advance on Warsaw or again on Prague”. The Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, who has been imprisoned in Moscow since April, is being investigated for “high treason”, as the authorities step up their case against him for his criticism of the war in Ukraine. The United States has accused Russian mercenaries of exploiting natural resources in Central African Republic, Mali, Sudan and elsewhere to help fund Moscow’s war in Ukraine, a charge Russia rejected as “anti-Russian rage”. The US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, has said the Wagner Group of mercenaries are exploiting natural resources and “these ill-gotten gains are used to fund Moscow’s war machine in Africa, the Middle East and Ukraine”. Ukrainian emergency services said three bodies were pulled from rubble Thursday after a Russian rocket strike destroyed a five-storey apartment block in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia. The Kremlin denied reports that 700,000 Russians had fled the country since Moscow announced a mobilisation drive it said would call up hundreds of thousands to fight in Ukraine. Two Russians who said they fled their country to avoid compulsory military service have requested asylum in the US after landing in a small boat on a remote Alaska island in the Bering Sea, Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski’s office said Thursday. The UN nuclear agency chief travelled to Kyiv to discuss creating a security zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after Vladimir Putin ordered his government to take it over. “On our way to Kyiv for important meetings,” the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head, Rafael Grossi, wrote on Twitter, saying the need for a protection zone around the site was “more urgent than ever”. Grossi is also expected to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss the situation at the plant. The IAEA said it had learned of plans to restart one reactor at the plant, where all six reactors have been shut down for weeks. Ukraine’s forces are pushing their advance in the east and south, forcing Russian troops to retreat under pressure on both fronts. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s military had made major, rapid advances against Russian forces in the past week, taking back dozens of towns in regions in the south and east that Russia has declared annexed. Military experts say Russia is at its weakest point, partly because of its decision not to mobilise earlier and partly because of massive losses of troops and equipment. Ukraine has extended its area of control in the Kherson region by six to 12 miles, according to its military’s southern command. Zelenskiy confirmed the recapture of the villages of Novovoskresenske, Novohryhorivka and Petropavlivka, saying the settlements were “liberated from the sham referendum and stabilised”, in an address on Wednesday. Moscow’s forces have left behind smashed towns once under occupation and, in places, mass burial sites and evidence of torture chambers. In Lyman, which was retaken by Ukrainian forces on Sunday, more than 50 graves were found, some marked with names, others with numbers, the Kyiv-based outlet Hromadske reported on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/may/19/zelenskiy-compares-russian-laser-threat-to-nazi-wonder-weapon","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-19T17:11:22Z","webTitle":"Zelenskiy compares Russian laser threat to nonexistent Nazi ‘wonder weapon’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/zelenskiy-compares-russian-laser-threat-to-nazi-wonder-weapon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/19/zelenskiy-compares-russian-laser-threat-to-nazi-wonder-weapon","fields":{"headline":"Zelenskiy compares Russian laser threat to nonexistent Nazi ‘wonder weapon’","bodyText":"Russia’s promise to use lasers to shoot down drones in Ukraine has prompted widespread scepticism that the novel and possibly nuclear-powered weaponry could be deployed on the battlefield or have any significant impact on the war. Yuri Borisov, Russia’s deputy prime minister, told the country’s Channel One television station that the new Zadira directed-energy weapon could destroy targets up to 5km away, and had incinerated a drone in five seconds in a test. But there was no immediate evidence to back up the claim, which was belittled by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who described it as a “wunderwaffe” – a nonexistent “wonder weapon” which was originally a propaganda invention of the Nazis. “The clearer it became they [the Nazis] had no chance in the war, the more propaganda there was about the wonder weapon,” Zelenskiy said. “Russia is trying to find its wunderwaffe. Allegedly laser. All this clearly indicates the complete failure of the invasion.” Laser systems designed to shoot down drones are being gradually developed by the world’s militaries – but most are at a test or prototype stage, and their military utility in a conflict is untried. Last month Israel’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, said the country’s military had successfully tested a laser interception system called Iron Beam. “It may sound like science fiction, but it’s real,” he said on Twitter. An accompanying video showed lasers locking on to and shooting down rockets, mortars and a large drone with similarities to a Turkish TB2, which has been used by Ukraine in defence against the Russians. Laser weapons work by directing a beam of high energy to burn a target, using large amounts of electricity in the process. In the case of a drone, they melt the exterior and destroy enough of it so it cannot fly. Israel suggested it was much cheaper to use laser weapons than missile systems to shoot down rockets, missiles and drones. Bennett said the cost was $3.50 a shot, but it is not clear to what extent this figure includes the cost of power. Some analysts said the Russian systems were powered by small nuclear reactors not dissimilar to those used in submarines. Last year the UK’s Ministry of Defence awarded three contracts worth about £72.5m in total, two of which were to develop military lasers for frigates and Wolfhound armoured vehicles, with the intention of engaging in “user experimentation” from 2023-25. Publicly declared laser weapons focus on the targeting of drones and missiles. The use of laser weapons to blind soldiers and civilians is banned by a convention signed by 109 countries, including Russia and Ukraine. One Russian analyst said Moscow would have to increase production of the weapons to make a difference to the war, in which Russian forces’ attempts to take the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine have stalled to the point of near stalemate. Dmitry Stefanovich, a research fellow at the Moscow-based Center for International Security, a division of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, said: “I think for it to become effective, Russia will need to scale up its production of the Zadira lasers. At the moment there simply isn’t enough to make any real difference.” A related issue is whether Russia had a transportable energy supply to power them. A second analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Moscow’s systems were reliant on small nuclear reactors to power them. “Nothing is being used as far I understand. Russia won’t be using the Zadira or Peresvet lasers in Ukraine. The problem is that these lasers are using nuclear power, which means that if Ukraine would target the installations, it would lead to a small nuclear disaster, exposing the Russian soldiers to radioactive material,” they said. “I believe this is just a lot of hype. I don’t think Russia would move their laser systems to Ukraine with all the risks involved. For example, Peresvet can hit targets within a 5km range, which means Ukraine would also be able to target it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/12/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-tells-officials-to-stop-leaking-military-tactics-un-sounds-nuclear-plant-warning-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-12T17:57:01Z","webTitle":"Zelenskiy tells officials to stop leaking military tactics; UN sounds nuclear plant warning – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/12/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-tells-officials-to-stop-leaking-military-tactics-un-sounds-nuclear-plant-warning-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/12/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-tells-officials-to-stop-leaking-military-tactics-un-sounds-nuclear-plant-warning-live","fields":{"headline":"Zelenskiy tells officials to stop leaking military tactics; UN sounds nuclear plant warning – as it happened","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Here is a round-up of today’s headlines: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday told government officials to stop talking to reporters about Kyiv’s military tactics against Russia, saying such remarks were “frankly irresponsible”. In the wake of major blasts that wrecked a Russian air base in Crimea on Tuesday, the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers cited unidentified officials as saying Ukrainian forces were responsible. The government in Kyiv, on the other hand, declined to say whether it had been behind the explosions. Ukraine’s security agencies issued a joint statement on Friday calling for the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross to send representatives to locations where Russia is holding Ukrainian prisoners of war (PoWs). The request follows earlier allegations by Kyiv that Moscow’s forces have tortured and executed prisoners, including by staging an explosion in a Ukrainian POW camp in Olenivka. The UK Ministry of Defence has said the explosions at the Russian-operated Saky military airfield in western Crimea earlier in the week were “almost certainly” from the detonation of up to four uncovered munition storage areas, though the original cause of the blasts remains unclear. At least five Su-24 fencer fighter-bombers and three Su-30 flanker H multi-role jets were almost certainly destroyed or seriously damaged in the blasts, according to British intelligence. The devastation at the Russian air base in Crimea suggests Kyiv may have obtained new long-range strike capability with potential to change the course of the war. The base is well beyond the range of advanced rockets that western countries acknowledge sending to Ukraine so far, with some western military experts saying the scale of the damage and the apparent precision of the strike suggested a powerful new capability with potentially important implications. The UN has urged a demilitarised zone around Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as Russia and Ukraine trade accusations over more shelling of the plant on Thursday. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company said it had been shelled five times by Russian forces on Thursday, resulting in staff being unable to change shifts. The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweeted that he has spoken with Pope Francis today. “Informed about the aggression that the Russian Federation is carrying out against Ukraine, about the terrible crimes of Russia,” he president wrote on Twitter. Russian ex-president Dmitry Medvedev issued a veiled threat on Friday to Ukraine’s western allies who have accused Russia of creating the risk of a nuclear catastrophe by stationing forces around the Ukrainian Zaporizhzhia power station. Ukraine has accused Russia of firing at Ukrainian towns from the site in the knowledge that Ukrainian forces could not risk returning fire, Reuters reported. It says Moscow has shelled the area itself while blaming Ukraine. Ukraine’s defence minister Oleksii Reznikov has said that a shipment of M20 MLRS tanks have arrived in Ukraine. In a tweet, he thanked the UK’s defence minister Ben Wallace and British people for the donation, which had been pledged earlier. “Your support is amazing and so important for Ukraine,” he said. Jose Andres, whose World Central Kitchen group has served more than 130m meals in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February, called for better coordination of food relief efforts in the country ahead of what promises to be a brutal winter. Donations were easing as the war drags on, he warned, which meant that WCK, which provides short-term emergency relief, must start winding down operations just as cold weather is likely to exacerbate problems facing millions of displaced Ukrainians. India said on Friday there was no pressure on it from western countries or anywhere else over its energy purchases from Russia, as Indian firms step up imports of oil and coal from the country shunned by some governments for its invasion of Ukraine. India, the world’s third-biggest crude importer, overtook China to become the biggest buyer of Russian oil in July based on sea-borne volumes, having bought very little from the country before the start of the war in Ukraine in February. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the Ukraine live blog for today. Thanks for following along. Goodbye for now. The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweeted that he has spoken with Pope Francis today. “Informed about the aggression that the Russian Federation is carrying out against Ukraine, about the terrible crimes of Russia,” he president wrote on Twitter. “We are grateful to the pontiff for his prayers for Ukraine. Our people need the support of the world’s spiritual leaders, who must convey to the world the truth about the horrors that the aggressor is committing in Ukraine,” he added. A Ukrainian artist Olena Yanko paints sunflowers on cars which were destroyed by Russian attacks in Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine. India said on Friday there was no pressure on it from western countries or anywhere else over its energy purchases from Russia, as Indian firms step up imports of oil and coal from the country shunned by some governments for its invasion of Ukraine. India, the world’s third-biggest crude importer, overtook China to become the biggest buyer of Russian oil in July based on sea-borne volumes, having bought very little from the country before the start of the war in Ukraine in February. Also in July, Russia became India’s third-largest coal supplier, up from the sixth position historically, as discounts drove shipments to a record, Reuters reported. The US has tried to lure India away from its main arms supplier Russia, but New Delhi says its own needs as an emerging country are paramount. India has not condemned the invasion. Ukraine’s security agencies issued a joint statement on Friday calling for the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross to send representatives to locations where Russia is holding Ukrainian prisoners of war (PoWs). The request follows earlier allegations by Kyiv that Moscow’s forces have tortured and executed prisoners, including by staging an explosion in a Ukrainian POW camp in Olenivka. Moscow claims Ukraine shelled the facility, killing over 50 PoWs, Reuters reported. In case you missed it earlier … The UK Ministry of Defence has said the explosions at the Russian-operated Saky military airfield in western Crimea earlier in the week were “almost certainly” from the detonation of up to four uncovered munition storage areas, though the original cause of the blasts remains unclear. At least five Su-24 fencer fighter-bombers and three Su-30 flanker H multi-role jets were almost certainly destroyed or seriously damaged in the blasts, according to British intelligence. Saky’s central dispersal area has suffered serious damage, but the airfield probably remains serviceable, the report added. The loss of eight combat jets represents a minor proportion of the overall fleet of aircraft Russia has available to support the war. However, Saky was primarily used as a base for the aircraft of the Russian navy’s Black Sea fleet. The fleet’s naval aviation capability is now significantly degraded and the incident is likely to prompt the Russian military to revise its threat perception, officials said. Russian ex-president Dmitry Medvedev issued a veiled threat on Friday to Ukraine’s western allies who have accused Russia of creating the risk of a nuclear catastrophe by stationing forces around the Ukrainian Zaporizhzhia power station. Ukraine has accused Russia of firing at Ukrainian towns from the site in the knowledge that Ukrainian forces could not risk returning fire, Reuters reported. It says Moscow has shelled the area itself while blaming Ukraine. Russia says it is Ukraine that has shelled the plant. “They [Kyiv and its allies] say it’s Russia. That’s obviously 100% nonsense, even for the stupid Russophobic public,” Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, wrote on his Telegram channel. “They say it happens purely by chance, like ‘We didn’t mean to’,” he added. “What can I say? Let’s not forget that the European Union also has nuclear power plants. And accidents can happen there, too.” Jose Andres, whose World Central Kitchen group has served more than 130m meals in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February, called for better coordination of food relief efforts in the country ahead of what promises to be a brutal winter. Donations were easing as the war drags on, he warned, which meant that WCK, which provides short-term emergency relief, must start winding down operations just as cold weather is likely to exacerbate problems facing millions of displaced Ukrainians. Here is an interesting report from Reuters on the group: Andres, whose work was hailed by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday in a televised address that usually focuses on the battlefield and diplomacy, is visiting some of WCK’s 7,500 distribution sites in Ukraine this month to drum up support for continued food relief in the country. “The cash is sooner or later going to start finishing, that’\u0080\u0099s why I’m calling on … all the countries that want to support Ukraine … that we need to become one,” he told Reuters this week at a distribution site in Irpin, a city near Kyiv. Irpin was reclaimed by Ukrainian forces after Russian attacks that killed nearly 300 people in early March. “If everybody is doing their own thing, we may be doubling efforts, wasting money, not helping Ukraine, especially as winter is coming,” the Michelin-starred Spanish chef added. The United Nations estimates that at least 12 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine since the invasion, with more than 5 million heading to neighbouring countries and 7 million believed to be displaced inside the country itself. Children watch as workers clean up after a rocket strike on a house in Kramatorsk, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, this morning. No injuries were reported in the strike. There are a couple of snaps from Reuters coming from the daily briefing from Russia’s defence ministry. Russia shot down two Himars missiles in Ukraine’s Donetsk region (from RIA news agency) A US-manufactured AN/MPQ-64 radar station was destroyed in eastern Ukraine (from Interfax) Russia’s permanent representation in the UN, Vasyl Nebenzia, has said the country does not support a proposal to create a demilitarised zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Interfax quotes Nebenzia: The demilitarisation of the station can make it vulnerable to those who want to visit it. No one knows what their goals and objectives will be. We cannot rule out any provocations, terrorist attacks on the station, which we must protect. Earlier, the UN secretary general António Guterres called for the withdrawal of all military personnel and military equipment from the station and to avoid the deployment of any other military forces or military equipment in the area. Guterres said: The facility should not be used as part of any military operations. Instead, it is necessary to urgently reach an agreement at the technical level on the establishment of a security perimeter and demilitarisation in order to ensure the security of the region. Eleven rockets hit the city of Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine at 2am, according to the city’s mayor. Mayor Oleksandr Honcharenko posted on Facebook: Private homes were destroyed. There is no information about victims. Occupiers destroy everything in their path – a terrorist tactic. The UK has posted its daily defence intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine. Key points as follows: On 9 August, explosions occurred at the Russian-operated Saky military airfield in western Crimea. The original cause of the blasts is unclear, but the large mushroom clouds visible in eyewitness video were almost certainly from the detonation of up to four uncovered munition storage areas. At least five fighter-bombers and three multi-role jets were almost certainly destroyed or seriously damaged in the blasts. Saky’s central dispersal area has suffered serious damage, but the airfield probably remains serviceable. The loss of eight combat jets represents a minor proportion of the overall fleet of aircraft Russia has available to support the war. Saky was primarily used as a base for the aircraft of the Russian Navy’s Black Sea fleet. The fleet’s naval aviation capability is now significantly degraded. The incident will likely prompt the Russian military to revise its threat perception. Crimea has probably been seen as a secure rear-area. Night shelling took place in Kharkiv last night, according to a report on BBC Ukraine’s live blog. The report cites Kharkiv OVA head Oleg Sinegubov as posting on Telegram: Last night, the Russians launched rocket attacks on Kharkiv. Four rockets were fired from Belgorod at once. At around 3am, two rockets hit an educational institution in the Slobid district. The report adds the following information from the Telegram post: In the Novobavar district, a rocket hit the road next to the administrative building. Shrapnel damaged the facade. The arrival of another rocket was recorded in the Kyiv region, with no casualties. Russian strikes were also recorded that night in the village of Tsirkuny and between Tsirkuny and Cherkasy Tyshky in the Kharkiv district. A 51-year-old woman died in the Zolochiv community due to shelling. At the same time, two more Kalibr missiles, launched by the Russians from the Caspian Sea, were shot down by Ukrainian air defences over the Kharkiv region. Ukraine’s defence minister Oleksii Reznikov has said that a shipment of M20 MLRS tanks have arrived in Ukraine. In a tweet, he thanked the UK’s defence minister Ben Wallace and British people for the donation, which had been pledged earlier. “Your support is amazing and so important for Ukraine,” he said. He added that more “gifts” would arrive soon. Kazakhstan is expected to sell some of its crude oil through Azerbaijan’s biggest oil pipeline from September to bypass a route Russia threatened to shut. Reuters reports: Kazakh oil exports account for more than 1% of world supplies, or roughly 1.4m barrels a day (bpd). For 20 years, they have been shipped through the CPC pipeline to Russia’s Black Sea port of Novorossiisk, which provides access to the global market. In July, a Russian court threatened to shut the CPC, prompting the Kazakh government and major foreign producers to set up contracts for other outlets as a precaution. None of the alternatives are as practical as the CPC pipeline, raising the risk of further volatility on energy markets. Rachel Hall here taking over from Samantha Lock.

At least five Su-24 fencer fighter-bombers and three Su-30 flanker H multi-role jets were almost certainly destroyed or seriously damaged in the blasts, according to British intelligence.

A shipment of Ukrainian grain is to be loaded for delivery to Ethiopia later today as another two export ships reportedly left Ukraine’s ports. Turkey’s defence ministry reported that the Marshal Islands-flagged Star Laura ship will transport 60,150 tons of corn to an Iranian port, while the Belize-flagged ship Sormovskiy 121 will transport 3,050 tons of wheat to a Turkish port, Dzerkalo Tyzhnia. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has told officials to stop talking to reporters about Kyiv’s military tactics against Russia, saying such remarks were “frankly irresponsible”. The president’s comments come after news organisations cited unidentified officials saying Ukrainian forces were responsible for blasts that destroyed a Russian air base in Crimea on Tuesday, despite Kyiv declining to say whether it was behind the explosions. The UN has urged a demilitarised zone around Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as Russia and Ukraine trade accusations over more shelling of the plant on Thursday. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company said it had been shelled five times by Russian forces on Thursday, resulting in staff being unable to change shifts. The British defence secretary said Vladimir Putin is unlikely to succeed in occupying Ukraine. Ben Wallace said that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “faltered” and was “starting to fail”, as he pledged more financial and military support to the eastern European nation’s defence. Russia has doubled the number of air strikes on Ukraine’s military positions and civilian infrastructure compared with the previous week, Ukrainian brigadier general Oleksiy Hromov said on Thursday. “The enemy’s planes and helicopters avoid flying into the range of our air defences, and therefore the accuracy of these strikes is low,” he told a news conference. Ukraine aims to evacuate two thirds of residents from areas it controls in the eastern battleground region of Donetsk before winter, partly out of concern people won’t be able to stay warm amid war-damaged infrastructure, the deputy prime minister said on Thursday. The government plans to evacuate some 220,000 people out of around 350,000, including 52,000 children, Iryna Vereshchuk told a news conference. In a separate report, Forbes Ukraine estimated that the aircraft destroyed at Russia’s Crimea airbase was worth $650m to $850m. “Based on various sources, Forbes estimated that before the explosions, aircraft equipment worth $650m to $850m was located at the airfield,” the report read. The UK Ministry of Defence has said the explosions at the Russian-operated Saky military airfield in western Crimea earlier in the week were “almost certainly” from the detonation of up to four uncovered munition storage areas, though the original cause of the blasts remains unclear.

The fleet’s naval aviation capability is now significantly degraded and the incident will likely prompt the Russian military to revise its threat perception, officials said. Estonia said on Thursday it will from next week prevent most Russians from entering the country with visas issued by Estonian authorities, cutting off a popular route into Europe’s passport-free Schengen zone. While exceptions apply, the foreign ministry for Estonia, a European Union member, said it will also cease to issue visas to Russians for work, study and business in the country. Foreign minister Urmas Reinsalu said in a statement: We have seen an enormous rise in the number of Russian citizens coming into or passing through Estonia. The possibility they have to visit Estonia, or other parts of Europe via Estonia, en masse is not in line with the principles of the sanctions we have imposed,” he said, adding that the order takes effect from 18 August. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday called on the west to impose a blanket travel ban on Russians while the European Commission questioned the feasibility of a ban. Latvia, Lithuania and the Czech Republic have already stopped issuing visas to most Russians, while Finland and Estonia recently called for the EU to do so jointly. A shipment of Ukrainian grain is to be loaded for delivery to Ethiopia later today as another two export ships reportedly left Ukraine’s ports. The total number of ships to depart the country under a UN-brokered deal is now 14, including the first export of wheat. “Thanks to the Black Sea Initiative we are ready to load more than 23,000 tonnes of grain and export it to Ethiopia,” Ukraine’s infrastructure minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on Twitter. Turkey’s defence ministry reported that the Marshal Islands-flagged Star Laura ship will transport 60,150 tons of corn to an Iranian port, while the Belize-flagged ship Sormovskiy 121 will transport 3,050 tons of wheat to a Turkish port, Dzerkalo Tyzhnia. The United Nations nuclear watchdog has called for officials to visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant as soon as possible amid renewed shelling in the area and warnings of the “catastrophic consequences” of continued fighting near Europe’s largest atomic plant. “This is a serious hour, a grave hour and the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] must be allowed to conduct its mission to Zaporizhzhia as soon as possible,” the agency’s chief, Rafael Grossi, told an emergency meeting of the UN security council on Thursday night. Ukraine’s state-run company operating the plant, Energoatom, said the area was struck five times on Thursday, including near the site where radioactive materials are stored. “Five [hits] were recorded near the plant management’s office – right next to the welding site and the storage facility for radiation sources,” Enerhoatom said in a post on its official Telegram channel. “The grass caught fire over a small area, but fortunately, no one was hurt.” The claims come just one day after Ukraine accused Russia of firing rockets from around a captured nuclear power plant, killing at least 13 people and wounding 10, in the knowledge that it would be risky for Ukraine to return fire. The UN’s top official called for an immediate end to all military activity around the Zaporizhzhia plant, warning that further “deeply worrying” incidents could – if they continue – lead to disaster. “I am calling for all military activities in the immediate vicinity of the plant to cease immediately and not to target its facilities or surroundings,” António Guterres, the secretary general, said in a statement ahead of the meeting. Guterres warned that any potential damage to the Zaporizhzhia plant “could lead to catastrophic consequences not only for the immediate vicinity, but for the region and beyond”. Grossi said he was ready to lead an expert mission to inspect the site in south-eastern Ukraine and called on Russia and Ukraine to cooperate so officials could travel as soon as possible. “Time is of the essence,” he told the 15-member security council via video feed, adding that the agency could perform urgent work on safeguards and provide a stabilising influence in order “to prevent a nuclear accident from happening”. A series of haunting images taken during a burial service for unidentified bodies in the town of Bucha on the outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine, have been released. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday told government officials to stop talking to reporters about Kyiv’s military tactics against Russia, saying such remarks were “frankly irresponsible”. In the wake of major blasts that wrecked a Russian air base in Crimea on Tuesday, the New York Times and Washington Post newspapers cited unidentified officials as saying Ukrainian forces were responsible. The government in Kyiv, on the other hand, declined to say whether it had been behind the explosions. Zelenskiy said in an evening address: War is definitely not the time for vanity and loud statements. The fewer details you divulge about our defence plans, the better it will be for the implementation of those defence plans. If you want to generate loud headlines, that’s one thing - it’s frankly irresponsible. If you want victory for Ukraine, that is another thing, and you should be aware of your responsibility for every word you say about our state’s plans for defence or counter attacks.” Zelenskiy addressed his remarks to state, local and military officials as well as other people he said were commenting on events at the front. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines: Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has told officials to stop talking to reporters about Kyiv’s military tactics. Divulging details about Ukraine’s defence plans is “frankly irresponsible”, he said. Meanwhile, the UN’s top official called for an immediate end to all military activity around the Zaporizhzhia plant, warning that further “deeply worrying” incidents could – if they continue – lead to disaster. It is 7.30am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has told officials to stop talking to reporters about Kyiv’s military tactics against Russia, saying such remarks were “frankly irresponsible”. The president’s comments come after news organisations cited unidentified officials saying Ukrainian forces were responsible for blasts that destroyed a Russian air base in Crimea on Tuesday, despite Kyiv declining to say whether it was behind the explosions. The devastation at the Russian air base in Crimea suggests Kyiv may have obtained new long-range strike capability with potential to change the course of the war. The base is well beyond the range of advanced rockets that western countries acknowledge sending to Ukraine so far, with some western military experts saying the scale of the damage and the apparent precision of the strike suggested a powerful new capability with potentially important implications. The UN has urged a demilitarised zone around Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as Russia and Ukraine trade accusations over more shelling of the plant on Thursday. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company said it had been shelled five times by Russian forces on Thursday, resulting in staff being unable to change shifts. However, Russian news agency Tass reported that the local Russian-imposed authorities in occupied Zaporizhzhia said the plant had been fired upon by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s Energoatom agency said the plant was operating normally. The United States supports calls for a demilitarised zone around the Zaporizhzhia plant after fighting involving Russian and Ukrainian forces in the vicinity of the plant, a State Department spokesperson said on Thursday. “Fighting near a nuclear plant is dangerous and irresponsible and we continue to call on Russia to cease all military operations at or near Ukrainian nuclear facilities and return full control to Ukraine, and support Ukrainian calls for a demilitarised zone around the nuclear power plant,” the spokesperson said. The British defence secretary has said Vladimir Putin is now unlikely to succeed in occupying Ukraine. Ben Wallace said that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “faltered” and was “starting to fail”, as he pledged more financial and military support to the eastern European nation’s defence. Russia has doubled the number of air strikes on Ukraine’s military positions and civilian infrastructure compared with the previous week, Ukrainian Brigadier General Oleksiy Hromov said on Thursday. “The enemy’s planes and helicopters avoid flying into the range of our air defences, and therefore the accuracy of these strikes is low,” he told a news conference. Ukraine aims to evacuate two thirds of residents from areas it controls in the eastern battleground region of Donetsk before winter, partly out of concern people won’t be able to stay warm amid war-damaged infrastructure, the deputy prime minister said on Thursday. The government plans to evacuate some 220,000 people out of around 350,000, including 52,000 children, Iryna Vereshchuk told a news conference. Ukraine expects a ship to arrive on Friday to load grain for delivery to Ethiopia under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey, Reuters reports. Ukraine expects $3bn of US financial aid to arrive in August and a further $1.5bn in September, its finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, said on Thursday. Marchenko said the payments were part of the $7.5bn financial aid package agreed by Ukraine and the US at the start of the summer and would be used to finance “critical spending” such as healthcare and pension costs. Belarus has said that blasts heard overnight at one of its military bases 19 miles from Ukraine were caused by a “technical incident”. At least eight explosions were heard after midnight near Zyabrovka military airport, according to reports on Telegram messenger. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports. McDonald’s will start reopening some of its restaurants in Ukraine in the coming months, in a show of support after the American fast-food chain pulled out of Russia. The burger giant closed its Ukrainian restaurants after Russia’s invasion nearly six months ago but has continued to pay more than 10,000 McDonald’s employees in the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/sep/01/liz-truss-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-tory-leadership-keir-starmer-bills-conservatives-labour-uk-politics-live-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T16:03:27Z","webTitle":"More rail strikes announced for September after talks with RMT and operators fail – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/sep/01/liz-truss-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-tory-leadership-keir-starmer-bills-conservatives-labour-uk-politics-live-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/sep/01/liz-truss-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-tory-leadership-keir-starmer-bills-conservatives-labour-uk-politics-live-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"More rail strikes announced for September after talks with RMT and operators fail – as it happened","bodyText":"Here is a round-up of all of today’s top news stories from Westminster: Tens of thousands of railway workers will stage fresh strikes in a long-running dispute over pay, jobs and conditions, PA Media has reported. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said its members at Network Rail and 14 train operators will strike on 15 and 17 September. The union said more than 40,000 members would take action, which would “effectively shut down” the rail network. Keir Starmer has denied that Labour’s energy policy amounts to “kicking the can down the road”, but acknowledged that something will have to be done early next year to tackle the crisis in the longer term. During a Q&amp;A on BBC Radio 5 Live, the Labour leader was quizzed on his plans to tackle soaring energy bills beyond the middle of next year, PA Media reported. One listener told him: “The public is more leftwing than the Labour party at the moment.” Starmer replied: “I don’t accept that is kicking the can down the road.” Boris Johnson has vowed to give his full support to the next prime minister, but could not resist using his penultimate speech to take a potshot at Liz Truss’s energy plans. In an attempt to shore up his legacy just days before he leaves No 10, the outgoing Conservative leader hailed the government’s “accelerated, long-overdue reforms” to make the UK more energy independent and announced £700m for the Sizewell C nuclear plant. Johnson also said that “only time will tell” what kind of ex-prime minister he will be, and he reiterated that he will give his “full and unqualified support” to his successor. He will leave 10 Downing Street next week when he is likely to be replaced as prime minister by the current foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who leads the former chancellor Rishi Sunak in polling. The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, has said energy supplies should not be cut off if people cannot afford their bills, as the Treasury examines a range of options to help consumers cope with the cost of living crisis. Zahawi promised that the government would expand on the £37bn package of aid announced earlier this year to help households tackle soaring energy costs. He told Sky News: “No one should be cut off because they can’t afford their bills.” Michael Gove has urged Liz Truss to reconsider energy rationing for businesses this winter, after she rejected the idea at Wednesday’s final Tory leadership hustings. Gove said the UK should follow other European countries in urging companies to show restraint in their use of electricity and gas. Michael Gove dismissed speculation he intends to quit politics, saying he is “definitely planning to stay in parliament”. Sacked by Boris Johnson as the levelling up and housing secretary after privately advising the prime minister to stand down, Gove laughed off suggestions he could become a newspaper editor. The energy crisis is hitting UK household budgets harder than any country in western Europe, according to analysis by the International Monetary Fund. The difference between the cost burden on poor and rich households is also far more unequal in the UK than other countries. The reason is the UK’s heavy reliance on gas to heat homes and produce electricity at a time when Russia’s war in Ukraine has sent gas prices soaring. In addition, the UK has the least energy efficient homes in western Europe. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, vowed to continue to put pressure on Beijing to end its policies against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, following a blistering report by the outgoing UN human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, who accused China of “serious human rights violations” that may amount to crimes against humanity. Keir Starmer told listeners to his BBC Radio 5 Live phone-in this morning that he knows what it is like to not be able to pay bills, amid rising concerns over the cost of living crisis. The Labour leader spoke about his own childhood as he was pressed on how his party would help struggling families. Dozens of charities have demanded the government provide urgent financial support to households dealing with the cost of living crisis and have warned of a “tsunami of need” in the UK. The open letter, signed by 48 charity leaders, warns that an “economic crisis of a magnitude not experienced for decades” will push many formerly comfortable households into poverty and desperation. Ambulance handover times is the “No 1 priority” for the NHS in England this winter, the health secretary, Steve Barclay, said in a speech this afternoon. Speaking at the rightwing Policy Exchange thinktank, Barclay said just a small number of hospital trusts accounted for almost half of ambulance delays. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. Thanks for following along. I’ll be back tomorrow morning to continue bringing you all the latest UK politics news. Tens of thousands of railway workers will stage fresh strikes in a long-running dispute over pay, jobs and conditions, PA Media has reported. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said its members at Network Rail and 14 train operators will strike on 15 and 17 September. The union said more than 40,000 of its members would take action, warning it woud “effectively shut down” the rail network. Talks between the union and rail industry have been ongoing but there has been no breakthrough or new offers from either Network Rail or the operators, the union said. The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, said: Our members have no choice but to continue this strike action. Network Rail and the train operating companies have shown little interest this past few weeks in offering our members anything new in order for us to be able to come to a negotiated settlement. Grant Shapps continues his dereliction of duty by staying in his bunker and shackling the rail industry from making a deal with us. We will continue to negotiate in good faith, but the employers and government need to understand our industrial campaign will continue for as long as it takes. The news follows announcements by Aslef and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association of strikes by their members in the coming weeks. Foreign secretary Liz Truss vowed to continue to put pressure on Beijing to end its policies in Xinjiang, following a blistering report by the outgoing UN human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, who accused China of “serious human rights violations” against Uyghur Muslims that may amount to crimes against humanity. Truss said in a statement that the UN’s long-awaited report provided new evidence of “the appalling extent of China’s efforts to silence and repress Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang”. She also said London would continue to act with international partners to “bring about a change in China’s actions, and immediately end its appalling human rights violations in Xinjiang”. The UN’s 45-page report concluded: “The extent of arbitrary and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim groups, pursuant to law and policy, in context of restrictions and deprivation more generally of fundamental rights enjoyed individually and collectively, may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.” The damming report was welcomed by rights activists and families of the victims in China’s Xinjiang region. But they also called on governments around the world to establish formal and independent investigations into the matter. Steve Barclay also said NHS trusts needed to prioritise the three cancers that account for two-thirds of the diagnosis backlog – skin, prostate and gastrointestinal. He said integrated health trusts should prioritise “new cancer pathways”, such as pharmacy and community referrals. He said: Alongside ambulance delays, the second dominant health issue is clearing the Covid waiting list backlog. Over the summer, the two-year waiting lists were virtually eliminated with a final 2,000 cases set to be resolved by the end of September. The health secretary added that patients “need to be able to exercise choice at the very start of their care”. He said the NHS needed to make better use of its app for patients to make appointments. The health secretary wants to “stimulate a conversation” about backroom staffing in the NHS, he said in a Policy Exchange speech about preparing for the winter. Steve Barclay claimed there were 53,000 staff in organisations across the NHS in England, “where the majority are not providing direct patient care”, in addition to hospital and GP management. He added: My point is this is not just an issue of cost. It is also about effectiveness. Because too much management can be a distraction to the front line. Staff at the centre need to streamline the administrative burden of those on the front line and not risk adding to it. If we are to reprioritise back office costs to the front line, there needs to be more transparency. Barclay added he had ordered a digital assessment of staffing in the NHS, telling the audience: It will stimulate, I hope, a conversation within the NHS about how priorities and resourcing is best aligned. Ambulance handover times is the “number one priority” for the NHS in England this winter, the health secretary, Steve Barclay, has said in a speech this afternoon. Speaking at the rightwing Policy Exchange thinktank, Barclay said that just a small number of hospital trusts accounted for almost half of ambulance delays. He said: Targeted help over the summer has been focused on these trusts, including building capacity in emergency departments, introducing pre and post cohorting and observation areas, supporting emergency department triaging and the risk assessment across the hospital as a whole. However, he said that not all of the issues were in the control of the hospitals and instead sat with ambulance trusts, integrated care boards, care homes and NHS England itself. He added: We currently have over 12,000 beds occupied by patients who are medically fit to discharge. This is also resulting in poor patient outcomes, in particular with the frail and elderly because patients often deteriorate if left in a hospital bed for too long. Boris Johnson has promised a £700m investment package if Sizewell C nuclear plant is to be built. He said it would be “madness” not to go ahead with the project, claiming that, if the plant was operational now, it would slash national fuel bills by £3bn. The GMB union national secretary Andy Prendergast has welcome Boris Johnson’s promise of funding for Sizewell C as a “belated step in the right direction”. “With energy prices going through the roof and all bar one of our nuclear power stations due to go off line by the end of the decade, this does at least provide some assurance on our energy security,” he said in comments reported by PA Media. “Years of political failure to make the right decision on new nuclear means we are woefully unprepared for the energy crisis facing us today. This same inertia has resulted in a failure to secure our domestic gas supply. The real-world consequences of this lack of political courage are higher bills and risk of blackouts this winter.” Dozens of charities have demanded the government provide urgent financial support to households dealing with the cost of living crisis and have warned of a “tsunami of need” in the UK. The open letter, signed by 48 charity leaders, warns that an “economic crisis of a magnitude not experienced for decades” will push many formerly comfortable households into poverty and desperation. Describing the challenges facing support organisations, the letter says food banks are “working flat out”, community centres are planning to provide winter “warm hubs”, and disability charities are providing cash to those who can no longer wait. But it warns many support organisations will close as charities cannot afford to keep building open. The letter was organised by the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations and signatories include the National Children’s Bureau, National Voices and Disability Rights UK. It further warns of crises in mental health provision and increased suicide rates while predicting more children will enter care and that animal charities will struggle to cope with abandoned pets. “We are calling on the government to urgently deliver meaningful financial support to those in the greatest need, directly to households and through the benefits systems that already exist to provide support.” Liz Truss, the favourite to become the UK’s next prime minister, has said a damning UN report that Beijing had committed “serious human rights violations” against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province “shames China”. The report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said: “The extent of arbitrary and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim groups, pursuant to law and policy, in context of restrictions and deprivation more generally of fundamental rights enjoyed individually and collectively, may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.” Truss, in her role as foreign secretary, said the report “provides new evidence of the appalling extent of China’s efforts to silence and repress Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang”. “It includes harrowing evidence, including first-hand accounts from victims, that shames China in the eyes of the international community, including actions that may amount to crimes against humanity. “This includes credible evidence of arbitrary and discriminatory detention, torture, sexual and gender-based violence, violations of reproductive rights, and the destruction of religious sites.” She said UN members now needed the chance to consider the report fully. The Chinese government, which attempted until the last moment to stop the publication of the report, said in an official response that it was “based on the disinformation and lies fabricated by anti-China forces” and that it “wantonly smears and slanders” China and interferes in the country’s internal affairs. Victims and human rights groups have said governments around the world should establish formal independent investigations into human rights abuses in Xinjiang. This is Tom Bryant picking up the UK politics live blog for an hour from Tom Ambrose Boris Johnson has vowed to give his total support to the next prime minister, but could not resist using his penultimate speech to take a potshot at Liz Truss’s energy plans. In an attempt to shore up his legacy just days before he leaves No 10, the outgoing Conservative leader hailed the government’s “accelerated, long-overdue reforms” to make the UK more energy independent and announced £700m for the Sizewell C nuclear plant. But he disparaged fracking, which Truss has pledged to lift the ban on, and hydrocarbons, another energy source his likely successor wants to exploit through further drilling in the North Sea. “If we could frack effectively and cheaply in this country, that would be possibly a very beneficial thing. I’m just, I have to say, slightly dubious that it will prove to be a panacea,” Johnson said on Thursday. “I would much rather that we focused on the things where we are brilliant, and where the environmental damage is really minimal.” Johnson later added: “Tell everybody who thinks hydrocarbons are the only answer and we should get fracking and all that: offshore wind is now the cheapest form of electricity in this country … Of course it’s entirely clean and green.” The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, has said households should not be cut off if they cannot afford their energy bills, as the Treasury examines a range of options to help consumers cope with the cost of living crisis. Zahawi promised that the government would expand on the £37bn package of aid announced earlier this year to help households tackle soaring energy costs. He told Sky News: “No one should be cut off because they can’t afford their bills. “I am working with the [energy] companies ... to make sure those people who are really struggling get that help both financially and personally.” Consumers are not automatically cut off if they do not pay energy bills, but UK charities have warned a group urging consumers not to pay this winter that there could be serious consequences. Zahawi said he was “deeply concerned” about vulnerable people living in freezing conditions this winter because they cannot afford to turn their heating on. Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, said the £700m announced for Sizewell C “could insulate huge numbers of draughty homes, and cut next year’s bills, instead of being thrown on to the slow-burning financial bonfire that is EDF, to increase our bills for decades”. He added: The contrast between these lumbering white elephants and the dynamic, cost-cutting, innovative technologies in the renewables sector could barely be more striking. While this down-payment on failure shows the government hasn’t noticed, the market has, and investors have fled the nuclear sector. To get Sizewell done, the government would have to step in and add the enormous costs of building reactors to the enormous costs consumers are already paying for their electricity. The “Boris bill” would be the prime minister’s legacy, he added. Michael Gove has urged Liz Truss to reconsider energy rationing for businesses this winter, after she rejected the idea at Wednesday’s final Tory leadership hustings. Gove said the UK should follow other European countries in urging companies to show restraint in their use of electricity and gas. While he admitted it was “not something that would come naturally to me or any Conservative”, he said Truss, who is expected to win the leadership contest and become prime minister next week, should prioritise ensuring there is enough energy for households during the worsening cost of living crisis. Truss has been under pressure for a week to reveal what extra support will be offered to people who will struggle to pay their bills after it was announced that the energy price cap will jump by 80% in October. Further rises are expected in January and April. It comes as health experts warned that cold homes will damage children’s lungs and brain development and lead to deaths as part of a “significant humanitarian crisis” this winter. Unless the next prime minister curbs soaring fuel bills, children face a wave of respiratory illness with long-term consequences, according to a review by Sir Michael Marmot, the director of University College London’s Institute of Health Equity, and Prof Ian Sinha, a respiratory consultant at Liverpool’s Alder Hey children’s hospital. Sinha said he had “no doubt” that cold homes would cost children’s lives this winter, although they could not predict how many, with damage done to young lungs leading to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema and bronchitis for others in adulthood. Johnson finishes his speech by saying he disagrees with those who oppose the government’s nuclear plans, adding that there “will always be dissenters”. And, with that, he leaves the podium and the speech – one of his last as prime minister – comes to a close. Boris Johnson has said he is not “morally” opposed to fracking, but claimed to be “dubious” it will prove to be a “panacea”. Taking questions from the media after his speech at Sizewell, the prime minister was asked about his position on fracking. He said: On fracking, you know, I am not intellectually, morally opposed to this at all. I think that if we could, you know, frack effectively and cheaply in this country, that would be a positive and beneficial thing. I have to say, I am just slightly dubious it will prove to be a panacea. I would much rather that we focused on the things where we are brilliant and where the environmental damage is really minimal, like offshore wind. Did you pick up just now, can I ask you if you can remember how much cheaper is offshore wind than gas? Nine times cheaper. So, you know, I cannot rest my case. We are brilliant at offshore wind, we need to put in sustainable baseload in the form of nuclear. Of course, we need a diversified policy where local communities want different solutions, they should be allowed to go for different solutions. But I don’t think that particular solution is going to be the panacea that some people suggest. Johnson also said that “only time will tell” what kind of ex-prime minister he will be, and he reiterated that he will give his “full and unqualified support” to his successor. He will leave 10 Downing Street next week when he is likely to be replaced a prime minister by the current foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who leads the former chancellor Rishi Sunak in polling. He said: I think only time will tell is my answer on that one. But my intention and what I certainly will do is give my full and unqualified support to whoever takes over from me. Otherwise, really to get on with life. The outgoing prime minister Boris Johnson says families in the UK are going to face a “very tough winter” and that “we just have to accept that” during a speech at Sizewell this afternoon. He says: Families up and down this country are going to face a very tough winter and we just have to accept that. What I would say to people is that the government really, really understands the difficulties you are facing. We totally get it. He adds that he wants to get over to people the “better future” that he believes is on the horizon once we are through it. He says: Out of this catastrophe of Putin’s war, I think good is going to come. Johnson is asked whether, with the benefit of hindsight, he would have ordered a second national lockdown in the UK during the Covid pandemic. He says that it is important that people remember what the measures to restrict the transmission of coronavirus were trying to do. He adds: We had at the peak of the pandemic, 40,000 people or more in NHS beds and we knew if you had another 20,000, 30,000 more – and it could have easily happened mathematically – in the NHS, then the system would have been overwhelmed. What would have happened then is that all those cases … of people who didn’t get help with their cardiac, concerns with their cancer diagnoses, all those other conditions would have been pushed out even further. The NHS would have been in an even worse position now. Johnson, who is now taking questions from the media, is asked about coming support for households and whether he had spoken to either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak about plans to protect households. Johnson reiterated the support the government had already provided but said it was “clear that come the new administration, there is going to be a further package”. He says: We have the fiscal firepower to sort it out. We do have a robust employment situation, we have the revenues coming to the exchequer to enable us to help people. That gives us the strength to continue to support people. The outgoing prime minister suggested that nuclear energy was one of “medium and long-term” options. Johnson said he expects “substantial sums” of cost of living help to be provided by his successor. Speaking at Sizewell in Suffolk, the prime minister said: We’re helping people now with the cost of living and of course there will be more cash to come, whoever takes over from me, in the months ahead - substantial sums, that’s absolutely clear. He added that offshore wind was now nine times cheaper than gas because of the “insanity of what Putin has done”. Johnson says the Russian leader believes the west will “flinch”. Johnson says he is wrong about the resolve of both the British people and European governments. He will fail, says Johnson. Boris Johnson has claimed that if Hinkley Point C had already been built, it would have slashed fuel bills by £3bn. He already said it would be “madness” not go ahead with the Sizewell C nuclear plant. He went on: That’s why we need to pull our national finger out and get on with Sizewell C. That’s why we’re putting £700m into the deal, just part of the £1.7bn of government funding available for developing a large-scale nuclear project to final investment stage FID (final investment decision) in this parliament. And in the course of the next few weeks, I am absolutely confident that it will get over the line, and we will get it over the line because it would be absolute madness not to. The outgoing prime minister says the main opposition to new nuclear reactors being built is “nimbyism”. He says he has diagnosed the problem as “myopia” and “short-termism”. Johnson adds: It is a chronic case of politicians not being able to see beyond the political cycle. For 13 years, the previous Labour government did absolutely nothing to develop this country’s nuclear industry. They said it didn’t make economic sense, they even said that in their manifesto. Well, thanks a bunch Tony and thanks a bunch, Gordon. Tell that to British industries that are now desperately short of affordable and reliable electricity. Tell that to families struggling with the cost of heat and light this winter. He also goes on to blame Nick Clegg for saying the UK shouldn’t build more nuclear power stations like Sizewell C in the run-up to the 2010 general election because “it wouldn’t even be completed until 2021 or 2022”. As per usual, there is little acknowledgement of the fact the Tories have been in power for 12 years and that he has been prime minister for the past three years… Speaking from Sizewell in east Suffolk, Boris Johnson begins by talking about a “much-thumbed” Ladybird book he owned as a child, which was called The Story of Nuclear Power. He says he was “enthralled” to read how UK scientists split the atom for the first time at the Cavendish laboratories in Cambridge. He said he noted how the world’s first civilian nuclear power station was built in Cumbria. He continues: I look back at the optimism in the pages of that book and I look at what has happened since and at the short-termism of successive British governments and their failure to do justice to our pioneering nuclear history … and I feel like one of those beautifully drawn illustrations of that Ladybird book of what happens in a nuclear pile. The graphite rods are taken out at the wrong moments and my blood starts to boil and steam starts coming out of my ears and I think I’m going to meltdown. I ask myself the question: ‘What happened to us?’. He asks if we have lost the “gumption and dynamism of our parents and grandparents”. The outgoing prime minister Boris Johnson is due to make a speech on energy at midday. It is understood that he is set to predict the UK will enjoy a future involving “cheap, clean, reliable and plentiful” energy, amid reports he will confirm the sign-off for a new nuclear power station. The speech will take place during a visit to Suffolk – one of his last as prime minister – and we will bring you all the top news lines from it here shortly. The energy crisis is hitting UK household budgets harder than any country in western Europe, according to analysis by the International Monetary Fund. The difference between the cost burden on poor and rich households is also far more unequal in the UK compared with other countries. The reason is the UK’s heavy reliance on gas to heat homes and produce electricity at a time when Russia’s war in Ukraine has sent gas prices soaring. In addition, the UK has the least energy efficient homes in western Europe. There is widespread agreement from energy experts on the best solutions: a large-scale and rapid insulation programme and a faster roll-out of wind and solar energy, which produce electricity that is currently about nine times cheaper than that from gas, as well as short-term financial support for bill payers. The government has consistently failed over the past decade to deliver major insulation programmes and has effectively banned onshore wind. The IMF analysis assessed the impact of the energy crisis expected over the whole of 2022, based on forward fossil fuel prices in May, since when prices have risen. It found that the average UK household is expected to lose 8.3% of its total spending power in 2022, as a result of having to pay higher energy bills. The figure in Germany and Spain is 4%, while only Estonian and Czech households face higher impacts than the UK in the whole of Europe. Keir Starmer told listeners to his BBC Radio 5 Live phone-in this morning that he knows what it is like not being able to pay bills, amid rising concerns over the cost of living crisis. The Labour leader spoke about his own childhood as he was pressed on how his party would help struggling families. He said: I actually do know what it is like to sit around the kitchen table not being able to pay your bills. It comes as UK households will see spending power cut by an average £3,000 by the end of next year unless the new government acts to counter the biggest drop in living standards in at least a century, research has indicated. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said soaring energy bills would cut household incomes by 10% and push an extra 3 million people into poverty. Starmer said he remembered the phone being cut off for “months at a time”, adding that he was not claiming “great poverty” but he said there were times his family could not pay for utilities. He added: Millions of people will be having that anxious conversation as we speak now. Michael Gove has dismissed speculation he intends to quit politics, saying he is “definitely planning to stay in parliament”. Gove, sacked by Boris Johnson as levelling up and housing secretary after privately advising the prime minister to stand down, laughed off suggestions he could become a newspaper editor. Of his relationship with the prime minister, he dismissed suggestions he had been sacked in revenge for turning on Johnson in 2016. He said Johnson wanted to “stand and fight and in order to do so he needed to show he was reconstructing his government”. He said: “I have both a reservoir of affection for Boris and great respect for what he did in office as well.” Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Gove, who is backing the former chancellor Rishi Sunak to be the next prime minister, said the frontrunner, Liz Truss, had “moved more on to the territory” staked out by Sunak over tackling the cost of living crisis during the course of the Conservative leadership campaign. He said Truss had acknowledged she needed to flesh out some of her earlier points. The Labour leader was also quizzed on how his party would deal with the Northern Ireland protocol during a Q&amp;A on BBC Radio 5 Live. Keir Starmer told a Belfast listener there could not be a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, adding: “We have got the protocol in place and we should build on that, not rip it up.” Asked by presenter Nicky Campbell why the UK couldn’t just “tweak it”, he said: The government has said it is going to rip it up - that is what is destroying our reputation internationally. Starmer said that a veterinary agreement between the UK and the EU would make a “massive difference”. “The EU has got to give and take as well”, he stressed. Keir Starmer has denied that Labour’s energy policy amounts to “kicking the can down the road”, but acknowledged that something will have to be done early next year to tackle the crisis in the longer term. During a Q&amp;A on BBC Radio 5 Live, the Labour leader was quizzed on his plans to tackle soaring energy bills going beyond the middle of next year, the Press Association reported. One listener told him: “The public is more leftwing than the Labour party at the moment.” Starmer replied: “I don’t accept that is kicking the can down the road.” He said his party’s plan is “meeting the concerns of millions of people”. He added that he understood the scale of the challenge facing households, adding that “many people listening and watching this will be saying: ‘I can’t afford that”’. Pressed on his longer-term plans, he pointed to his party’s call for a national mission on home insulation. “On the question of what we do long term, I am completely up for that challenge,” he told the programme. “I accept the challenge that something has got to be done in April.” Meanwhile, the former Tory cabinet minister Michael Gove has said he will carry on as an MP. He has previously said he does not expect to be in government again. It comes as the Liberal Democrats move to confirm a candidate for Gove’s Surrey seat amid speculation he is considering quitting parliament, which would spark a byelection. Lib Dem officials are planning for a possibly imminent campaign in which the party would fight on issues including the state of local hospitals and plans to drill for gas locally. Gove told Times Radio: I’m going to stay on as an MP. I’m going to make arguments for the vital importance of carrying on with the levelling up mission that Boris [Johnson] started. I’m going to be arguing very strongly for a focus on education, on the environment, on prison reform, that is compassionate, and progressive, and in the best traditions of the Conservative party. And I’ll be doing that as the majority of Conservative MPs do, from the backbenches. I’ll also be looking out for my constituents in Surrey Heath and making sure that I’m representing them effectively. The chancellor’s assertion that “nothing is off the table” came as the Conservative leadership frontrunner, Liz Truss, ruled out energy rationing this winter as she clashed over the cost of living crisis with her rival, Rishi Sunak, at the final hustings in London last night. The foreign secretary rejected the proposal, despite it being a key fall-back measure in the government’s “worst case” contingency planning. However, Sunak said “we shouldn’t rule anything out” after the French government warned it may have to ration energy, urging company bosses to take steps to curb consumption. As he made his final pitch to party members, the former chancellor added: The challenges we face with this crisis are significant. Many European countries are looking at how we can all optimise our energy usage, that is a sensible thing for us to be doing as a country. Asked by the LBC broadcaster Nick Ferrari at the last hustings before voting closes on Friday whether she could rule out energy rationing, Truss replied: I do rule that out. Yes. Under the government’s latest “reasonable worst case scenario”, published in August, businesses and even consumers could face blackouts this winter as concerns grow over power supplies. Officials believe that without energy rationing, the UK could experience blackouts for several days in January if cold weather combines with gas shortages to leave the country short of power. Good morning and welcome to the UK politics live blog. As the race to become the next Conservative leader and next prime minister enters the final furlong, we will be bringing you all the news and reaction from last night’s hustings. But we start with comments from the chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, who probably hasn’t even bothered unpacking at No 11 Downing Street and is likely to be out of a job by Monday. He said this morning that said “of course” the current level of support offered by government to deal with rising energy prices will not be enough, but that his team is looking at options for the next administration. Speaking to Sky News, Zahawi said: My pledge to your viewers is more help beyond the £37bn will also be coming. At the moment we’re midway of spending about £37bn. Asked whether it went far enough, he replied: Of course it’s not, which is why the moment I walked in to the Treasury on 5 July I gathered my leadership team, I said: ‘One, how are we doing on delivering the help?’ Because it’s one thing to announce it, very different to get it into people’s accounts. And there was a big focus on that. But equally importantly I said we need to prepare options for the incoming prime minister. The chancellor also said that “there’s nothing off the table” in terms of options the government is assessing for how to deal with rising energy prices. He said: There’s nothing off the table. We are looking at all the options. Everything from the chief executive of Scottish Power talking about help where we need to maybe create some sort of a fund for companies to be able to continue to help their customers. All the way through to making sure we target the help to both households and small and medium-size businesses and probably some larger businesses, because one of my concerns is the scarring effect on the economy if perfectly viable businesses in hospitality, in leisure, in high-energy use businesses would actually suffer or no longer exist because of Putin’s use of energy as a weapon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/31/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-189-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-31T14:48:28Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 189 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/31/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-189-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/31/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-189-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 189 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukraine’s forces have had “successes” in three areas of the Russian-occupied region of Kherson, according to a Ukrainian regional official. Yuriy Sobolevskyi, the deputy head of Kherson’s regional council, said Ukrainian troops had enjoyed successes in the Kherson, Beryslav, and Kakhovka districts, without providing details. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed, however, that Ukraine’s attempts to mount a counteroffensive in the south of the country had failed. In its daily briefing, it said Ukraine’s forces had suffered heavy losses in equipment and troops. It has not been possible to independently verify either side’s claims. A team of nuclear experts travelled to Zaporizhzhia amid international concern about the potential for an accident or radiation leak at the nuclear power plant there. The International Atomic Energy Agency envoys set off from Kyiv on Wednesday morning for the plant in south-eastern Ukraine, a Reuters witness reported from the scene. The UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, told a briefing in Kyiv: “We are finally leaving after six months of effort. The IAEA is heading to the Zaporizhzhia NPP. As you know, we have a very important task there – to work and examine the real situation there, to help stabilise the situation as much as possible.” Grossi said the IAEA will seek to establish a permanent presence at the Zaporizhzhia plant to avoid “a nuclear accident” at the facility. He added that the agency’s visit to the plant will last a few days. Russian-installed officials in the area near the power station previously suggested the visit might last only one day. Ukraine accused Russian forces of firing on a town near the Zaporizhzhia plant as inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog were on their way to inspect the facility. One of the shells hit the building where Energodar city council is located, according to its mayor, Dmytro Orlov. Ukraine also accused Russia of deliberately shelling corridors to make it unsafe for the IAEA inspectors to visit the plant. Mykhailo Podolyak, a key presidential adviser, said Russia was attempting to force the IAEA mission through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. Russia has halted gas supplies through a major pipeline to Europe, citing a need for maintenance on its only remaining compressor, raising the prospect of recession and energy rationing throughout the region. The outage on Nord Stream 1 means no gas will flow to Germany between 1am GMT on Wednesday and 1am GMT on Saturday 3 September, according to the Russian state energy firm Gazprom. Data from the website of the pipeline’s operator, as cited by Reuters, showed flows at zero at 4am-5am CET (2am-3am GMT) on Wednesday. European governments fear Moscow could extend the outage in retaliation for western sanctions imposed. Russia has the potential to open up a “second theatre of war” should it choose to do so, Germany’s chief of defence has warned. Russia is “very well capable of expanding the conflict regionally” and will not run out of ammunition any time soon, according to Gen Eberhard Zorn, the highest-ranking soldier of the Bundeswehr. The UN’s cultural agency has said it supports a bid by Ukraine to add the port city of Odesa to the Unesco world heritage list of protected sites. The historic centre of Odesa has already been struck by artillery fire and is located only a few dozen miles from the frontline, the agency said. Ukraine continues its offensive against Russia’s forces across southern Ukraine, pushing the frontline back “some distance in places”, according to British intelligence. The full report released by the UK Ministry of Defence added that Russia continued “to expedite attempts to generate new reinforcements for Ukraine”. The funeral of the Soviet Union’s last leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, who died on Tuesday aged 91, will take place in Moscow on Saturday, Russian news agencies reported, citing Gorbachev’s daughter and his foundation. The ceremony will be held on 3 September in the Moscow Hall of Columns, the same place where Joseph Stalin’s body was put on display after his death in 1953, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Gorbachev’s daughter, Irina. Vladimir Putin has sent official condolences to Gorbachev’s family of Mikhail Gorbachev as the Kremlin broke its silence overhis death. But it has demurred on whether the former leader will receive a state funeral or be dealt a final snub by a successor who tore down his legacy. Ukraine’s counteroffensive to retake Kherson will be a “slow operation to grind the enemy”, the senior presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych has said. “Of course, many would like a large-scale offensive with news about the capture by our military of a settlement in an hour,” he wrote. “But we don’t fight like that … Funds are limited.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said heavy fighting continued in “almost the entire territory” of Kherson. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, Natalia Humeniuk, said Ukraine’s forces had succeeded in damaging bridges that join Kherson across the river, rendering them “impassable for heavy machinery”. A Moscow-installed leader of occupied Kherson has reportedly fled to Russia. When asked by the Guardian about his location, Kirill Stremousov said he was currently “travelling around Russian cities, meeting different people for work”. A former head of Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, welcomed Ukraine’s counterattacks in Kherson, saying it was a key moment in the war. Sir Alex Younger told the BBC that the fightback from Kyiv showed the two opposing forces had “reached some kind of balance, which is an unexpected and frankly welcome situation”. Ukraine is using wooden decoys of advanced US rocket systems to trick Russia into wasting its missiles on them, according to the Washington Post. The decoy versions of US-supplied rocket launcher systems drew at least 10 Russian Kalibr cruise missiles, leading Ukraine to further boost its production of replicas in an effort to lure Moscow into firing its expensive long-range missiles on fake targets, the publication said. At least five people were killed and 12 wounded in Russian shelling of Kharkiv, Zelenskiy said. “Only one Russian shelling of Kharkiv took the lives of five people today, another 12 were wounded.” EU foreign ministers have agreed to fully suspend a visa facilitation agreement with Russia. The move will mean that Russian citizens applying for EU visas will find it more costly and time-consuming. Today’s announcement stops short of a blanket ban of travel visas for Russians, which eastern EU states and the Nordic countries were calling for. The move to restrict travel visas for Russians is a step “in the right direction”, Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said. Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have said they are considering barring Russian travellers from entry if the EU fails to do so. The move should contain exceptions “for dissidents as well as other humanitarian cases”, the four countries – which all border Russia – said in a joint statement published before the EU’s visa deal suspension announcement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2022/oct/02/tucker-carlson-ukraine-vladimir-putin-propaganda","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-02T08:00:32Z","webTitle":"Who is Tucker Carlson really ‘rooting for’ in Ukraine?

","bodyText":"If Americans think things are bad, there is always Tucker Carlson to make them seem worse. Never more so than when the Fox News host is talking about Russia’s war in Ukraine. “We’ve entered a new phase, one in which the United States is directly at war with the largest nuclear power in the world,” Carlson grimly warned his viewers on Tuesday. This alarming development, which apparently escaped the rest of the US media, was supposedly brought about by the sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines from Russia to western Europe. Sweden and Denmark say the pipelines were blown up with several hundred kilos of explosives, pouring vast amounts of natural gas into the sea and atmosphere. While European politicians hinted that Russia was responsible as part of a new phase of hybrid war over Ukraine, Carlson said the evidence pointed in another direction. “If you are Vladimir Putin, you would have to be a suicidal moron to blow up your own energy pipeline,” he claimed. So if not Putin, who? “In early February, less than three weeks before the war in Ukraine began, Joe Biden suggested on camera that he might take out these pipelines,” said Carlson. The Fox News anchor reasoned that the president’s warning that if Russia invaded Ukraine the US would shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline was a direct threat to sabotage it. “He said, there won’t be a Nord Stream 2. We’ll put an end to it. We will take it out. We will blow it up,” said Carlson. Biden did not say “take it out” or “blow it up” but that did not stop Carlson from concluding that the president had brought the US to the brink of nuclear war. It’s not clear how this take on events goes down with Fox News viewers, many of whom are more than willing to blame Biden for a wide array of problems but who might flinch at Carlson allying himself so closely with one of America’s sworn enemies. But it goes down very well in Moscow. Carlson’s commentaries on the Ukraine war generally reflect Putin’s speeches and claims. Russian television then plays back the monologues as evidence that Putin is right because the same is being said by “the most popular television presenter in America”. That in itself is a dubious claim. Although Tucker Carlson Tonight does well on cable, terrestrial channels have much larger audiences for their newscasts. But there is no doubt that Carlson has outsize impact. What is less clear is whether he really believes what he’s saying. A fast-moving war has required some deft footwork from Carlson. In August he scoffed at claims Russia was losing the war. “Here’s the weird thing. By any actual reality-based measure, Vladimir Putin is not losing the war in Ukraine. He is winning the war in Ukraine and Joe Biden looks at that and says we won’t stop until you proffer an unconditional surrender,” Carlson claimed. Russian television liked that so much it rebroadcast the monologue. Unfortunately for Carlson’s credibility as a military analyst, that very day Ukraine began an assault that resulted in Russian soldiers throwing away their weapons and running for the border. After that, Carlson swung back to claiming that Russia wasn’t fighting Ukraine but the west, particularly the US and Britain. He called Boris Johnson, the British prime minister at the time, a “hapless cutout” driving Ukraine to war at Washington’s bidding. “America and the UK demand total war with Russia, regime change war with Russia and of course, the Ukrainians caught in the middle had no choice but to concede,” he told his viewers. Carlson was apologising for Putin long before February’s invasion. In November, the Fox News host questioned US support for Kyiv in its fight with Russian proxies in breakaway regions and said he was rooting for Moscow. “Why do I care what is going on in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia?” he said. “I’m serious. Why do I care? Why shouldn’t I root for Russia? Which I am.” Amid an outpouring of derision, Carlson claimed he wasn’t serious after all. “Of course, I’m joking. I’m only rooting for America, mocking the obsession many on the left have,” he said. Yet in the following months, it proved not to be a joke. Carlson regularly delivered up a defense of Russia, or at least its leader. Shortly before Russia invaded in February, Carlson laid out a set of talking points that mirrored a speech made by Putin a few hours earlier attacking Nato. “Their one and only goal is to hold back the development of Russia,” Putin had claimed. “They just do not need a big and independent country like Russia around.” Carlson parroted Putin’s claim that Ukraine wasn’t a real country and said that its government was a “puppet” of the west, “essentially managed by the [US] state department”. Three months after the invasion, Carlson was still echoing Putin’s talking points with the added claim that the US was backing Ukraine as “payback for the 2016 election” won by Donald Trump and to exact “regime change” in Moscow. “We don’t arm Ukraine so we can help the Ukrainians. They are merely unfortunate pawns in all of this,” the Fox News host said. “We arm Ukraine so that we can punish Russia. Why? For stealing Hillary Clinton’s coronation.” It’s clear that Carlson’s support of Putin is at least partly rooted in hostility to Biden and the Democrats. But the Fox News host has also shown a predilection for associating with authoritarian leaders and not just Donald Trump. Carlson has developed a particular affection for Hungary’s president, Viktor Orbán, who is widely regarded as Putin’s Trojan horse inside the European Union. The Fox News presenter made a drooling documentary about Orbán, praising him for his brutal treatment of migrants. Orbán rewarded Carlson with a long interview, something the Hungarian leader has not done with his country’s own independent media since he took office in 2010. Carlson also visited Brazil to heap praise on its rightwing leader, Jair Bolsonaro. He has defended the Syrian dictator and Russian ally, Bashar al-Assad, and questioned whether he was guilty of the atrocities documented by the United Nations human rights groups. All of this has proved too much for others on the right who, while happy to attack Biden, recoil at Carlson siding so completely with Putin that he looks hostile to his own country. Eric Bolling, a host on the rightwing websiteNewsmax, on Monday called Carlson an “alleged American” and accused him of stoking a nuclear conflict. “It turns out Russian state media are using clips of Fox News’ Tucker Carlson to support Vladimir Putin’s war efforts in Ukraine,” said Bolling. “That is Russian state media using Tucker Carlson, alleged American, as propaganda to make their case that Russia is the victim.” Months earlier, the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz responded to Carlson’s claim to be rooting for Russia by questioning whose side the Fox News host was on. “It’s comments like this from Tucker Carlson that make me wonder who my friends are and who my enemies are – it makes me wonder whether the world has gone insane,” he tweeted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/24/revealed-russian-plan-to-disconnect-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-from-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-24T18:27:49Z","webTitle":"Revealed: Russian plan to disconnect Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/24/revealed-russian-plan-to-disconnect-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-from-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/24/revealed-russian-plan-to-disconnect-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-from-grid","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: Russian plan to disconnect Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from grid","bodyText":"A detailed plan has been drawn up by Russia to disconnect Europe’s largest nuclear plant from Ukraine’s power grid, risking a catastrophic failure of its cooling systems, the Guardian has been told. World leaders have called for the Zaporizhzhia site to be demilitarised after footage emerged of Russian army vehicles inside the plant, and have previously warned Russia against cutting it off from the Ukrainian grid and connecting it up to the Russian power network. But Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, told the Guardian in an interview that Russian engineers had already drawn up a blueprint for a switch on the grounds of emergency planning should fighting sever remaining power connections. “They presented [the plan] to [workers at] the plant, and the plant [workers] presented it to us. The precondition for this plan was heavy damage of all lines which connect Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Ukrainian system,” Kotin said in an interview on Ukraine’s independence day on Wednesday, with the country mostly locked down because of the threat of Russian attacks. He fears that Russia’s military is now targeting those connections to make the emergency scenario a reality. Both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the site. “They just started doing that, they starting all the shelling, just to take out these lines,” Kotin said. Other threats to nuclear security at the plant include vehicles packed so tightly into turbine halls that firefighters would struggle to access them if a fire broke out, and a campaign of terror against workers who have chosen to stay at the frontline plant. One was beaten to death, and another so severely injured that he needed three months to recover. More than 200 have been detained, Kotin said. The plant’s electricity connections are already in a critical situation, with three of the four main lines connecting it to Ukraine’s grid broken during the war, and two of the three back-up lines connecting it to a conventional power plant also down, he said. The Russian plan to disconnect it entirely would raise the risk of a catastrophic failure by leaving it dependent on a single source of electricity to cool the reactors. “You cannot just switch from one system to another immediately, you have to … shut down everything on one side, and then you start to switch on another side,” he said. During a shift between grid systems, the plant would be reliant only on a back-up diesel-powered generator, with no further options should that fail. After only 90 minutes without power the reactors would reach a dangerous temperature. “During this disconnection, the plant won’t be connected to any power supply and that is the reason for the danger,” he said. “If you fail to provide cooling … for one hour and a half, then you will have melting already.” Russia seized control of the Zaporizhzhia plant in March but it is still run by Ukrainian workers. There has been increasing alarm about Russian management of the site in recent weeks, and pressure on Moscow to allow UN inspectors to visit. Kotin said inspectors from the UN’s nuclear watchdog could be at the plant within one or two weeks to check on security, after progress in negotiations with Russia about a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Kotin is also concerned about the fire risk from vehicles packed into the turbine halls, which sit next to the two reactors still in operation. There are 14 trucks in one hall, and at least six in another, sources at the plant have told him. “In case there is a fire in the turbine hall you don’t even have a possibility to put it out or mitigate the consequences of this fire, because your fire brigades cannot get in, because any entry is blocked by the trucks, which are just packed in there,” he said. Any blaze could then potentially spread towards the reactor buildings, where a fire would have disastrous implications far beyond the immediate region. “This situation is very dangerous not only for the plant, for Ukraine, but also for the whole world because you never can say what the weather would be like and what the wind direction [would be].” Many other military vehicles are lined up under overpasses, built to house pipes and walkways between reactor and turbine complexes, Kotin said, perhaps to provide protection from drones. He praised about 9,000 workers who are still on duty at the plant, from a prewar workforce of about 11,000. Many evacuated their families but stayed at their posts because of the need for a skilled team to operate it. Modernisations to Ukraine’s nuclear plants in the wake of the Chornobyl disaster means that although the plant was built to Soviet specifications, Russian engineers don’t have the skills to operate it. “Actually, for us they are heroes, just doing their job in such unbelievable conditions,” said Kotin, who knows the plant, and its workers well because he spent most of his career there. He arrived as a young graduate and rose to become general manager. Rockets have also landed within two dozen metres of 174 spent fuel containers housed at the plant, which would be more vulnerable to weapons than the reactors, which are built to withstand the impact of a passenger jet. “It will probably withstand two explosions of maybe two missiles on one container and after that, it will be broken,” he said. “Actually we had a rocket came in just 10, 20 metres just from the site [where the containers are stored].” However, Kotin said that he hoped nuclear inspectors would be able to visit the Zaporizhzhia plant within “one, maybe two weeks”. “There is progress in negotiations … there is only modalities of the mission to finally agree between parties, and after that they will go. And actually I’ve seen some plans that they are to go at the end of the month.” He said he also had confidence that Ukrainian workers who have sacrificed so much for the plant would be able to keep it safe. “In any case, we won’t allow Russians to bring the world to the nuclear catastrophe and we will do everything just to return the plant to under our full control and operate it safely reliably, like it always been.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/26/morning-mail-visa-backlogs-human-impact-putins-army-plan-dutton-denounces-witch-hunt","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T20:50:18Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: visa backlog’s human impact, Putin’s army plan, Dutton denounces ‘witch-hunt’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/26/morning-mail-visa-backlogs-human-impact-putins-army-plan-dutton-denounces-witch-hunt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/26/morning-mail-visa-backlogs-human-impact-putins-army-plan-dutton-denounces-witch-hunt","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: visa backlog’s human impact, Putin’s army plan, Dutton denounces ‘witch-hunt’","bodyText":"Good morning. Vladimir Putin increases the size of Russia’s armed forces. Peter Dutton has denounced the inquiry into Scott Morrison’s secret ministries as a “witch-hunt”. And tropical regions could experience dangerously high heat levels most days of the year by 2100. Australia’s huge bureaucratic visa backlog has a very human impact: for example Huma, an Afghan woman set alight by the Taliban. She is waiting with her family in Pakistan in fear of deportation, anxiously waiting for a decision on her application which they lodged 12 months ago. This week the family’s Pakistan visa expired and they are in hiding. Their lawyer says their case is emblematic of thousands. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, as the war in Ukraine enters its seventh month with no signs of abating. The Russian president’s decree appears to point to the country’s aim to replenish its military, which has suffered heavy losses in Ukraine and failed to achieve its objective to capture Kyiv. Meanwhile, fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Peter Dutton has denounced the inquiry into Scott Morrison’s secret ministries as fresh concerns were raised about the former prime minister’s power to allocate grants.

The survey of 1,094 respondents shows 62% believed Australia was correct to pursue the nuclear submarine deal with the US and the UK, while 54% agreed with the statement: “The Aukus partnership is in Australia’s best security and economic interests.” But 55% thought the arrangement would further inflame relations with China – and after the French government’s furious reaction to Morrison’s decision to cancel a $90bn submarine contract with the Naval Group with minimal warning, 48% thought the new partnership would endanger trade deals with France and the European Union. With a federal election looming, likely in the first quarter of 2022, the latest poll shows the Coalition currently enjoys a 13-point lead over Labor when it comes to which party voters trust more to handle national security policy. The Coalition also enjoys a five-point lead on management of international relations. While the new Aukus submarine pact was clearly a response to China’s increasing militarisation in the Indo-Pacific – a trend that destabilises the region and imperils US interests – the latest poll suggests most Australians do not favour confrontation with Beijing. A majority of respondents (66%) characterised China as a “complex relationship to be managed”. Around a quarter (24%) characterised China as “a threat to be confronted” and 10% said Australia’s relationship with China is a “positive opportunity to be realised”. When asked about the impact of the nuclear submarine deal on domestic security, 45% said the partnership would make Australia more secure, while 55% of respondents either said the arrangement will make no difference or it will make Australia less secure. On voter trust to manage climate change, Labor has a 13-point lead over the Coalition. While Morrison was in the US last week meeting Joe Biden and Boris Johnson, and engaging in defence talks with the Quad – which is an informal grouping of the US, Australia, India and Japan – divisions erupted within the Coalition about whether the government should adopt a net zero emissions reduction target by 2050. The prime minister wants to unveil new climate commitments before the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. With the debate about net zero expected to span the next few weeks, the latest poll shows a majority of Australians would support government intervention to expand renewable energy (66%), with only 8% supporting coal or gas plants. With the new submarine pact sparking a renewed conversation about whether or not Australia needs a domestic nuclear power industry, 19% of respondents would also favour government support for nuclear power plants. When respondents were asked to what extent they would support or oppose using nuclear energy sources, 47% supported nuclear powered submarines (21% opposed) and 48% supported nuclear power (24% opposed), while 29% said they would support nuclear weapons (38% opposed). Voters were also asked about their attitudes to the management of the Covid-19 crisis. The latest poll indicates the Berejiklian government has recovered some of its lost standing with voters. Approval in the last survey stood at 46% (down from a high of 75% in March), but in the latest data, with the premier signalling the end of lockdown is close for vaccinated residents, 53% of respondents approved. In Victoria, as Delta cases continues to climb, sentiment has gone in the other direction. In the last survey, 50% approved of Daniel Andrews’ management of the pandemic, but that has dropped six points in a fortnight to 44%. The prime minister’s metrics were steady, with 45% saying the federal government’s management of the pandemic was good, and 30% saying poor. Voters were also asked about the roadmaps for reopening in the two states once vaccination thresholds reach 70-80% of adults. In NSW, 48% of respondents said they understood Berejiklian’s plan and had confidence in it, while 40% lacked confidence in it. In Victoria, 36% said they understood the Andrews plan and had confidence in it, while 50% lacked confidence in it. With Covid vaccination rates continuing to climb around the country, particularly in the lockdown states and the Australian Capital Territory, the number of respondents in the Guardian Essential survey declaring they will never be vaccinated is down to 7%. But that figure is significantly higher among voters planning to support someone other than the major parties."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/nov/19/authors-deborah-levy-juno-dawson-derek-jarman-home","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-19T12:00:56Z","webTitle":"‘You might as well be on the moon’: the authors taking residence in Derek Jarman’s home","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/19/authors-deborah-levy-juno-dawson-derek-jarman-home","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/nov/19/authors-deborah-levy-juno-dawson-derek-jarman-home","fields":{"headline":"‘You might as well be on the moon’: the authors taking residence in Derek Jarman’s home","bodyText":"Out on the shingled plains of Dungeness, Prospect Cottage is easily spotted: the black clapboard, the yellow paintwork, the John Donne lines written on the gable end. There is the garden, planted with sea kale and driftwood, and in the near distance, the nuclear power station, hulking and grey against the pale Kent sky. Today, as most days, there is also a smattering of visitors, hair wild and coats billowing, here to see the place where Derek Jarman spent the last years of his life. Jarman retreated to this unlikely corner of the country from London in 1987, following the death of his father. The film director, artist and author had first seen the fisherman’s cottage when visiting Dungeness with his friend, the actor Tilda Swinton. He bought it, tore out its chintzy interior, and filled it with his own works and those of his friends – among them Maggi Hambling, Gus Van Sant, John Maybury and Richard Hamilton. Following Jarman’s death from an Aids-related illness in 1994, the cottage was bequeathed to his friend, Keith Collins, whose care and companionship had enabled Jarman to continue working as his illness progressed. In 2018, Collins’s own death meant the cottage’s future was threatened, until the charity Art Fund rallied to conserve the property. When another arts charity, Creative Folkestone, became custodians of Prospect Cottage two years ago, they were determined that the building should not become a place for day-trippers to traipse through and exit via the gift shop. Rather they imagined a vivid new life for the cottage, opening up its rooms for creative residencies. Among Prospect Cottage’s earliest residents have been the writers Juno Dawson and Deborah Levy, who each visited this year as part of a project launched by Folkestone book festival. This week, as the festival gets under way, the writers will perform new work inspired by their time in Dungeness. “The purpose of saving the cottage wasn’t so it could be kept in aspic,” says Alastair Upton, standing in the cottage’s back kitchen, drinking a cup of tea. Upton is chief executive of Creative Folkestone, and today he and the Folkestone book festival’s co-curator Liam Browne have joined me on this rare visit inside the property, pointing out all its oddities and unusual objects. “There’s a wonderful sense of the beach blowing into the house,” Browne says. “All these stones and the wood and everything.” Throughout the cottage are items Jarman made from the shells and driftwood he collected nearby and repurposed into garlands, staffs and religious iconography. The walls are lined with canvases thick with bright paint, glass-fronted bookcases and stills from the director’s film sets. Glass panels in the doors between the rooms have been etched with ferns and lines of poetry. In the studio, on a spattered workbench, pots of paint stand, lids off, filled with blue and green and blazing orange. Beneath the workbench lies a pair of Jarman’s clogs. There is a sense of a home that has been lived in and loved. “There’s a distinction from, say, 19th- or early 20th-century artists,” Browne says. “You go to their houses and there’s a distance there because of time. But with Jarman, he’s within living memory, and this feels immediate in a very powerful way.” Browne and his co-curator Seán Doran approached Levy because of an unexpected connection to Jarman that she’d once discussed in a radio interview. “She said that when she was younger she was working in a cinema in London where they were screening Blue,” Browne explains. “She met Jarman, and he encouraged her when she didn’t know what kind of work she was going to do. That meeting was inspirational for her, it set her direction.” They thought Juno Dawson, author of This Book Is Gay, might find the residency interesting, but also liked the idea because she lives in Brighton: “We decided the contrast would be an interesting one,” Browne says. “Almost wherever you live in Brighton, you’re surrounded by people; the whole landscape [here is different] – the colour, the quieter presence of humanity.” Dawson asked whether her husband might accompany her to the residency. “I’ve seen enough horror films to not stay in a cabin by myself,” she says, when I speak to her. In the daylight, however, she developed a new appreciation of Jarman through the cottage interior. “He had quite specific tastes, and they could be morbid and macabre, but he also had a sense of humour,” she says, referring to Jarman’s crucified action figures and the artwork he made from pills and hypodermic needles towards the end of his life. “Even the bleakest of those works are still witty.” She tried to work in Jarman’s office, but couldn’t settle, relocating instead to the back of the house. “As soon as I went into the sunroom I felt my shoulders unclench,” she says. “It faces a wasteland, a desert, and I did my writing in there.” She was there the day the Queen died – there is now wifi at the cottage, and so she could not escape the news. “But it was the best place to be, because you’re so removed there – we felt sheltered, we couldn’t see the reaction. You might as well be on the moon.” It gave her a new perspective on Jarman, and isolation more broadly. “I started to understand why he went there,” she says. “I think there is a difference between solitude and loneliness. And I did start to think getting away from the world might not be a bad thing. That was the main thing that’s stayed with me – the power of not participating in public discourse.” In the sun room today, the writer and director Topher Campbell sits facing the garden, with its view across to the power station. Campbell, the current artist in residence at Prospect Cottage, is just two days into his stay, though this is not his first visit to the property. Thirty years ago, then in his late teens, he drove to Dungeness with a friend who knew Jarman. “He was very charismatic and very jovial and very welcoming,” he recalls. Still, he was struck by the strangeness of the location. “It was a mad place to come to. It still is,” he says. “The weather, dull skies and grey sea, and open landscape, and wind. It felt like, ‘Why the hell d’you want to be here?’” Later, Campbell got to know and understand Jarman a little better – they would run into each another at Soho restaurant Apollo’s, have a meal and a chat. “He was someone I thought I wanted to be like, I wanted to be making work.” He did not know Jarman was ill. “He was just this fun older guy with lots of energy. He was one of the most alive people I’ve met.” When he saw the call for residency applications, it felt like an opportunity to return to “Derek’s place”. Campbell notes how calm and well preserved the property now feels compared with his previous visit. “It was a busy space then,” he says. “There were so many materials being worked on at once. Everything was out – paints, woods, metals. It looked as if everything was happening.” Jarman was writing, too. “He had a diary open, I remember. This big book, like a Bible, and a big ink pot with one of those ink quills in, and the writing was intense and beautiful.” Almost 20 years after his death, Jarman’s sole work of narrative fiction was recently published by House Sparrow press. Written in 1971, and just 36 pages long, Through the Billboard Promised Land Without Ever Stopping tells the story of two men, the blind King and his valet John, on a quest across a surreal version of America. Its themes of displacement and exile often surfaced in Jarman’s work, and at Prospect Cottage, the place of his own chosen exile, they resonate strongly. Those writers and artists taking residencies here are under no expectation to respond to Jarman’s own work or themes, but they often find their way in regardless. Campell is working on two writing projects during his stay, one of which explores HIV positivity and desire – he is also HIV positive. There is the feeling for Campbell of continuing a legacy. So many gay men of Jarman’s generation were struck down by Aids in the 80s and 90s. “Derek is somebody who symbolises that legacy of creativity that we’ve lost,” he says. “We’ve lost generations. So I feel I’m honouring that as well.” As he settles in to his own days in exile here, Campbell says it isn’t strange to work in a place that stands much as its previous occupant left it. “I feel respectful about it, I’m celebrating something,” he says. “And I don’t feel I’m alone here; I feel I’m standing on the shoulders of a giant.” • This article was amended on 28 November 2022 to correct the spelling of Seán Doran’s first name. • Folkestone book festival runs until 27 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/14/russian-former-foreign-minister-igor-ivanov-ukraine-ceasefire","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-14T12:18:57Z","webTitle":"Russian former foreign minister calls for Ukraine ceasefire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/russian-former-foreign-minister-igor-ivanov-ukraine-ceasefire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/14/russian-former-foreign-minister-igor-ivanov-ukraine-ceasefire","fields":{"headline":"Russian former foreign minister calls for Ukraine ceasefire","bodyText":"A Russian former foreign minister has joined a call for all sides in the Ukrainian war to return to diplomacy and so reduce “the dramatically elevated risk” of a nuclear conflict. The appeal co-authored by Prof Igor Ivanov, now the president of the Russian International Affairs Council, may be a sign that some in the Russian foreign policy establishment believe that pursuing a purely military solution in Ukraine is a strategic mistake. Ivanov was appointed foreign minister under Boris Yeltsin in 1998 and resigned in 2004, four years into Vladimir Putin’s presidency. He has retained a status in Russian foreign policy circles. The statement urged all sides to back a ceasefire and end the “unjustifiable” loss of civilian lives. It was signed by Ivanov and a group of foreign policy heavyweights such as Wolfgang Ischinger, the former chair of the Munich Security Conference, Sam Nunn, the former US senator and co-chair of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, and Des Browne, the former UK defence secretary. As a Yeltsin-era minister, Ivanov is hardly part of Putin’s inner circle. But his position may reflect unease in Russia’s marginalised foreign ministry. The statement was published as negotiators from Russia and Ukraine met for a third round of bilateral talks on Monday. In advance of the talks both sides sounded more optimistic than before, but the cause for their optimism was unclear. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is pressing for a direct meeting with Putin. France, the UK and the US remain sceptical that Russia is yet willing to negotiate a settlement that the Ukrainian leadership would find acceptable. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, flew to Turkey for talks with Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Turkey has been offering to act as a mediator, and hosted talks between Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s current foreign minister, and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba. The statement co-authored by Ivanov avoids attributing responsibility for the war and instead focuses on the responsibility of nuclear states to eliminate nuclear risks. It says the conflict in Ukraine elevates such risks dramatically. “The firefight at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine was the latest reminder of how nuclear catastrophe can quickly rise to the surface in the ‘fog of war’,” the statement says. “The leaders of China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States together affirmed in January that ‘a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought’. “The first and most essential step toward reducing the risks of a consequential accident, mistake or miscalculation is a ceasefire to end the unacceptable and unjustifiable loss of human lives, including innocent civilians. “Dialogue, diplomacy and negotiations are the only acceptable route to resolving the conflict in a way that can stand the test of time. We must return to diplomacy and dialogue to ensure current disputes on core issues are negotiated and not fought. We welcome the first attempts of Russia and Ukraine to start such negotiations. We also welcome the efforts of world leaders aimed at finding a political settlement.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/23/cabinet-undecided-over-onshore-wind-ahead-of-uk-energy-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-23T13:03:14Z","webTitle":"Cabinet undecided over onshore wind ahead of UK energy plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/23/cabinet-undecided-over-onshore-wind-ahead-of-uk-energy-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/23/cabinet-undecided-over-onshore-wind-ahead-of-uk-energy-plan","fields":{"headline":"Cabinet undecided over onshore wind ahead of UK energy plan","bodyText":"Ministers have not yet made a final decision about whether to include a renewed push for onshore wind in next week’s energy independence plan, with some in cabinet sceptical about the move, government sources say. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has made clear publicly that he would like to see planning rules relaxed, in order to facilitate the building of more onshore windfarms. Michael Gove, who oversees the planning system, has also spoken out in favour. However, one cabinet minister said that there shouldn’t be a rush towards onshore wind because it’s “not cost-effective” and is “extremely expensive”. Some are understood to prefer a push for fracking, despite safety and environmental concerns. The energy independence plan was announced by the prime minister after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Set to be published next week, it is expected to propose a rapid expansion of nuclear power and accelerated targets for renewables – but it is unclear whether a relaxation of planning rules around onshore wind will be included. A Downing Street source said: “All options have to be on the table, given global price increases and the need to be self-sufficient – but nothing is decided yet”. David Cameron’s government tightened planning rules for onshore wind developments in 2014, requiring more local consultation. Sparked by grassroots Tory opposition from communities which saw the turbines as an eyesore, the move has effectively acted as a moratorium. Eight members of Boris Johnson’s cabinet – including Jacob Rees-Mogg, Steve Barclay, Brandon Lewis, Nadine Dorries, Nadhim Zahawi and Mark Spencer – were signatories to a 2012 letter opposing onshore wind, though a No 10 source said, “I wouldn’t read too much into that”. At the time, the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, said, “We need to ensure that protecting the local environment is properly considered alongside the broader issues of protecting the global environment.” Kwarteng has suggested the public’s opposition to windfarms has fallen away, given the push for net zero and the renewed interest in energy self-sufficiency since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “There were quite understandable political reasons that people didn’t want to see large-scale, onshore winds in their vicinity. I think that’s changed,” he told the i earlier this week. “I think the prime minister has been very clear that onshore wind has got to be part of the mix and we’ve got to look at planning.” He added: “The argument about onshore wind in 2015 was a historic argument even before we committed to net zero and the circumstances today with Putin. Russia, Saudi Arabia, all of those things mean that we’ve got to have more energy independence and I think onshore renewables are absolutely part of that.” When asked if the prime minister agreed with Kwarteng’s view, Johnson’s official spokesperson said on Tuesday: “I think the public has recognised the need to diversify our energy supply, and the importance of having sustainable energy sources, which move away from the volatility we see from non-renewables.” Scotland has pushed ahead with onshore wind, with a more liberalised planning system, and is regarded in Whitehall as what one government source described as a “major success story”. The UK has announced that it is seeking to phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of 2022, and will also examine ending Russian gas imports. Boris Johnson was himself previously sceptical about windfarms, writing in 2013 that they couldn’t “pull the skin off a rice pudding”. The shadow environment secretary, Ed Miliband, has argued that a “sprint” towards renewables, rather than investment in fracking, should be the government’s response to the crisis in Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-besieged-bakhmut-harder-and-harder-to-survive-in-says-official","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-06T18:09:17Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Kyiv mayor tells residents to prepare for the worst – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-besieged-bakhmut-harder-and-harder-to-survive-in-says-official","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-besieged-bakhmut-harder-and-harder-to-survive-in-says-official","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Kyiv mayor tells residents to prepare for the worst – as it happened","bodyText":"The Ukraine blog will now be closing for the day. Thank you for following our coverage. Ukraine’s army has accused Russia of the large-scale destruction of civilian vessels moored on the banks of the Dnieper River, in the occupied southern region of Kherson that Kyiv’s forces are trying to capture. Ukrainian forces have been piling pressure on Russian troops on the western bank of the Dnieper, fuelling speculation that Moscow’s troops are preparing to retreat to the other side. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s general staff said in a statement that the fuel from the destroyed vessels had leaked into the river’s delta and also accused Moscow’s forces of appropriating the vessels’ engines and other equipment, Reuters reported. The Ukrainian general staff gave no explanation for Moscow’s actions. Destroying civilian vessels would prevent Ukrainian forces from using them should they decide to cross to the eastern side in the event of any Russian withdrawal. Fighters affiliated with the Russian-installed administration of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region have arrived in the town of Amvrosiivka after being freed in a prisoner swap with the Ukrainian military. “I still can’t believe I’m home,” a returning prisoner of war, Maxim Chekanov, told Reuters. “It was so horrible. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.” added Chekanov, who said he had been captured by Ukrainian forces on 11 October. The fighters were freed during a prisoner exchange earlier this week, with the two sides in the eight-month-old conflict releasing 107 captives each. One woman, Lyudmila, said her returning son, Yevgeny, had lost a lot of weight since she last saw him. He walked slowly beside her, leaning on a walking stick. “I didn’t recognise him,” she said through tears as they sat next to each other, asking not to give their full names. “Everything will be OK, sweetie,” she told Yevgeny, who clutched a handkerchief to his face. US officials have reportedly warned the Ukrainian government in private that it needs to signal an openness to negotiating with Russia. Officials in Washington have warned that “Ukraine fatigue” among allies could worsen if Kyiv continues to be closed to negotiations, the Washington Post reported. US officials told the paper that Ukraine’s position on negotiations with Russia was wearing thin among allies who are worried about the economic effects of a protracted war. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said Ukraine is only prepared to enter negotiations with Russia if its troops leave all parts of Ukraine, including Crimea and the eastern areas of the Donbas, de facto controlled by Russia since 2014, and if those Russians who have committed crimes in Ukraine face trial. Zelenskiy also made clear that he would not hold negotiations with the current Russian leadership. Last month, he signed a decree specifying that Ukraine would only negotiate with a Russian president who has succeeded Vladimir Putin. The Russian-installed administration in Ukraine’s Kherson region said on Sunday that a number of settlements, including the city of Kherson, had lost water and power supplies after what it said was an act of “sabotage”. The Russian state-owned news agency Tass quoted Kherson’s Moscow-appointed governor, Vladimir Saldo, as saying that the city’s power supply was expected to be restored by the end of the day. Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, said on Twitter that Ukraine would “stand” despite Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure, adding that this would be done by using air defence, protecting infrastructure and optimising consumption. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the presidential office, assured people in Kyiv that the outages were still controlled. “Today, the situation with the supply of electricity to consumers in the capital is difficult,” the deputy head of the presidential office wrote on Telegram. Here’s a run through the latest developments as it passes 5.45pm in Kyiv. Kyiv authorities have begun planning the evacuation of the city’s 3m residents if the Ukrainian capital suffers a complete blackout, according to the New York Times. The Biden administration in the US is privately encouraging Ukraine’s leaders to signal an openness to negotiate with Russia and drop their public refusal to engage in peace talks unless Vladimir Putin is removed from power, according to the Washington Post. Russian forces are stepping up their strikes in a fiercely contested region of eastern Ukraine, worsening the already tough conditions for residents and the defending army, Ukrainian authorities have said. The mayor of Kyiv has warned residents to prepare for the worst, saying that if Russia keeps striking the country’s energy infrastructure they must prepare for having no electricity, water or heat as temperatures drop below freezing. Russian troops have been looting Kherson ahead of a potential withdrawal from the south-eastern Ukrainian city. Items taken range from art and cultural exhibits to ambulances and tractors. There has been an assassination attempt on a judge who sentenced two Britons to death in Russian-controlled Ukraine. Alexander Nikulin, who said Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner should be shot by a firing squad, was shot in Vuhlehirsk, in Donetsk, on Friday night. The local supreme court justice is in a serious condition in hospital. Russian troops are allegedly searching for residents in the Kherson region who are refusing to evacuate, before the forces’ potential withdrawal from the west bank of the Dnieper River. The Ukrainian foreign ministry has claimed its forces killed another 600 Russian soldiers in the past 24 hours. Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, has said the country did supply Russia with drones but that it took place before President Vladimir Putin’s forces invaded Kyiv. The drones have been used in attacks on civilian infrastructure, notably targeting power stations and dams. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy dismissed talk of limited Iranian supplies to Russia, saying Kyiv had downed 11 drones on Friday alone. He said: “If Iran continues to lie about the obvious, it means the world will make even more efforts to investigate the terrorist cooperation between the Russian and Iranian regimes and what Russia pays Iran for such cooperation.” Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Oleg Nikolenko, said Iran “should realise that the consequences of complicity in the crimes of Russian aggression against Ukraine will be much larger than the benefits of Russia’s support”. External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant two days after it was disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged high voltage lines, the UN nuclear watchdog said. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said he does not believe Russia will use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. The 300,000 troops Putin conscripted as part of the mobilisation drive are providing “little additional offensive combat capability” as the Russian military is struggling to train them, UK’s Ministry of Defence has reported. Scheduled power cuts will take place on Sunday in seven Ukrainian provinces including major cities such as Kyiv. Other provinces affected are Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy and Poltava. About 500 power generators have been sent to Ukraine by 17 EU countries to help with the energy problems caused by Russian attacks. At least 112,000 Russians have emigrated to Georgia this year, border crossing statistics show. Reuters reported that the first large wave of 43,000 arrived after Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February and the second wave came after Putin announced a nationwide mobilisation drive in late September. While residents of Kherson are being told to leave (see 14.54) many residents are choosing to stay. You can read the account of one anonymous Kherson resident here: A car with a loudspeaker drives around the city urging residents to leave and text messages are sent during the night. But, like me, many of my friends stayed. We buy food and store water. We do not believe in forced evacuation. People are said to be taken to remote regions of Russia – but these are rumours. There is practically no internet in Kherson. Communication has disappeared and even Russian TV channels have stopped broadcasting. That’s why there are so many rumours. We hear Ukraine’s artillery duel with Russia and we wait for release. President Zelenskiy has tweeted that he spoke with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday to discuss macro-financial aid for Ukraine. Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter: Noted the importance of continuing the grain initiative for world food security. Discussed increasing sanctions &amp; opposing actions of Iran, which supports aggression. Ukraine’s military said on Sunday that residents of Ukraine’s Russian-occupied city of Kherson received warning messages on their phones urging them to evacuate as soon as possible. Russian soldiers warned civilians that Ukraine’s army was preparing for a massive attack and told people to leave for the city’s right bank immediately. Ukrainian forces have been pushing forward in the south, as Russia intensifies its attacks on Kyiv. AP reports: Russian forces are preparing for a Ukrainian counteroffensive to seize back the southern city of Kherson, which was captured during the early days of the invasion. In September, Russia illegally annexed Kherson as well as three other regions of Ukraine and subsequently declared martial law in the four provinces. The Kremlin-installed administration in Kherson already has moved tens of thousands of civilians out of the city. Nataliya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s Southern Forces, told state television that Russia has been “occupying and evacuating” Kherson simultaneously, trying to convince Ukrainians that they’re leaving when in fact they’re digging in. She said: There are defence units that have dug in there quite powerfully, a certain amount of equipment has been left, firing positions have been set up. Russian forces are also digging in in the east of Ukraine. Russian attacks have almost completely destroyed the power plants that serve the city of Bakhmut and the nearby town of Soledar. Shelling killed one civilian and wounded three. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the region’s Ukrainian governor, said on Saturday: The destruction is daily, if not hourly. Moscow-backed separatists have controlled part of Donetsk for nearly eight years before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February and “protecting” the region was one of Putin’s justifications for the invasion. Russian troops have spent months trying to capture the entire province. While Russia’s “greatest brutality” was focused in the Donetsk region, “constant fighting” continued elsewhere along the front line that stretches more than 1,000km (620 miles), the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. Between Saturday and Sunday, Russia’s launched four missiles and 19 airstrikes hitting more than 35 villages in nine regions, from Chernihiv and Kharkiv in the northeast to Kherson and Mykolaiv in the south, killing two people and wounding six, the president’s office said. AP reports: In the Donetsk city of Bakhmut, 15,000 remaining residents were living under daily shelling and without water or power, according to local media. The city has been under attack for months, but the bombardment picked up after Russian forces experienced setbacks during Ukrainian counteroffensives in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions. The front line is now on Bakhmut’s outskirts, where mercenaries from the Wagner Group, a shadowy Russian military company, are reported to be leading the charge. Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the group who has typically remained under the radar, is taking a more visible role in the war. In a statement Sunday he announced the funding and creation of “militia training centers” in Russia’s Belgorod and Kursk regions in the southwest, saying that locals were best placed to “fight against sabotage” on Russian soil. The training centers are in addition to a military technology center the group said it was opening in St. Petersburg. The mayor of Kyiv has warned residents that if Russia keeps striking the country’s energy infrastructure they must prepare for having no electricity, water or heat as temperatures drop below freezing. Mayor Vitali Klitschko told state media: We are doing everything to avoid this. But let’s be frank, our enemies are doing everything for the city to be without heat, without electricity, without water supply, in general, so we all die. And the future of the country and the future of each of us depends on how prepared we are for different situations. Ukraine’s state-owned energy operator, Ukrenergo said parts of Kyiv were scheduled to have hourly rotating blackouts Sunday, with blackouts also planned in the nearby Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv and Poltava regions. The Associated Press reports that Kyiv plans to deploy about a 1,000 heating points, but this may not be enough for a city of 3 million people. The Russian-installed administration in Ukraine’s Kherson region said electricity and water supplies were “temporarily absent” on Sunday after what it said was a “terrorist attack” damaged three power lines in the region. In a statement on Telegram, it said the attack had been organised by Ukraine, though it provided no evidence, Reuters reported. The news agency said it was unable to immediately verify battlefield accounts from either side. Russian state-owned news agency Tass said that ten settlements, including Kherson city, which had a pre-war population of 280,000, had been left without electricity. Russian officials have in recent weeks repeatedly warned civilians to leave Kherson, amid what they say are preparations for a Ukrainian offensive against the city, the only regional capital that Russia has captured since ordering tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on 24 February. Russian forces are stepping up their strikes in a fiercely contested region of eastern Ukraine, worsening the already tough conditions for residents and the defending army, Ukrainian authorities have said. Following Moscow’s illegal annexation and declaration of martial law in Donetsk province Russia, the attacks have almost completely destroyed the power plants that serve the city of Bakhmut and the nearby town of Soledar, Pavlo Kyrylenko, the region’s Ukrainian governor said. Late on Saturday he said shelling had killed one civilian and wounded three. In a state television interview Kyrylenko said: The destruction is daily, if not hourly. The Associated Press gives more background: Moscow-backed separatists controlled part of Donetsk for nearly eight years before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Protecting the separatists’ self-proclaimed republic there was one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s justifications for the invasion, and his troops have spent months trying to capture the entire province. In his nightly video address on Saturday Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that while Russia’s “greatest brutality” was focused in the Donetsk region, “constant fighting” continued elsewhere along the front line that stretches more than 1,000km (620 miles). AP reports: Between Saturday and Sunday, Russia’s launched four missiles and 19 airstrikes impacting more than 35 villages in seven regions, from Chernihiv and Kharkiv in the northeast to Kherson and Mykolaiv in the south, according to the president’s office. Russia has focused on striking energy infrastructure over the last month, causing power shortages and rolling outages across the country. The capital, Kyiv, was scheduled to have hourly blackouts rotating Sunday in various parts of the city of some 3 million and the surrounding region, Rolling blackouts also were planned in the Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv and Poltava regions, Ukraine’s state-owned energy operator, Ukrenergo, said in a Telegram post. More positive news was the re-connection of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant to Ukraine’s power grid, local media reported Sunday. Europe’s largest nuclear plant needs electricity to maintain vital cooling system, but it had been running on emergency diesel generators since Russian shelling severed its outside connections. In the Donetsk city of Bakhmut, some 15,000 remaining residents were living under daily shelling and without water or power, according to local media. The city has been under attack for months, but the bombardment picked up after Russian forces experienced setbacks during Ukrainian counteroffensives in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions. In Kharkiv, officials are working to identify bodies found in mass graves after the Russians withdrew, Dmytro Chubenko, a spokesperson for the regional prosecutor’s office, said in an interview with local media. DNA samples have been collected from 450 bodies discovered in a mass grave in the city of Izium, but the samples need to be matched with relatives and so far only 80 people have participated, he said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy yesterday personally thanked all partners and donors to United24, which collects charitable donations in support of Ukraine, for these six months of support. United24 has posted details of how the Champion stadium in Irpin, which was completely destroyed by Russian shells, will be rebuilt. Andriy Shevchenko, ex-coach of the Ukraine national football team, and the United24 fundraising platform have started raising funds to restore the stadium in Irpin. The football player has already involved AC Milan in the fundraising campaign, the club will donate 150,000 euros for the restoration of the stadium, the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine posted on Telegram. Ukraine’s ministry of defence challenging the energy of Prince Akeem Joffer in Coming to America today, as it lists what it says are the total combat losses of the enemy from 24 February to 6 November. In the replies someone has posted the clip from the movie: Russia appointed a new acting commander of the Central Military District on 3 November, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. Major General Alexander Linkov replaces Colonel General Alexander Lapin who was purportedly removed from office at the end of October 2022. The MoD states: If confirmed, this follows a series of dismissals of senior Russian military commanders since the onset of the invasion in February 2022. The Commanders of the Eastern, Southern, and Western Military Districts were replaced earlier this year. Lapin has been widely criticised for poor performance on the battlefield in Ukraine by both Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Wagner head Yevgeny Prigozhin. These dismissals represent a pattern of blame against senior Russian military commanders for failures to achieve Russian objectives on the battlefield. This is in part likely an attempt to insulate and deflect blame from Russian senior leadership at home. Despite the energy crisis in Kyiv, the city is continuing to show its indomitable spirit, reports Mark MacKinnon, senior international correspondent for the Globe and Mail The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine has thanked the 17 EU countries which have provided the country with 500 power generators to help with its power supply problems. Kyiv authorities have begun planning the evacuation of the city’s 3m residents if the Ukrainian capital suffers a complete blackout, according to the New York Times. The widespread bombardment by Russian forces of critical energy infrastructure across the country is continuing, with 40% of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure damaged or destroyed. Municipal workers are setting up 1,000 heating shelters that can double as bunkers while engineers try to fix bombed-out power stations without the needed equipment, the NYT reports. Ukraine’s national energy utility said on Saturday that it would continue to impose rolling blackouts in seven regions in order to try to keep the grid from failing altogether. Roman Tkachuk, the director of security for the Kyiv municipal government was quoted as saying: If there’s no power, there will be no water and no sewage. That’s why the government and city administration is taking all possible measures to protect our power supply system. The NYT reports: “We understand that if Russia continues such attacks, we may lose our entire electricity system,” Roman Tkachuk, the director of security for the Kyiv municipal government, said in an interview, speaking of the city. Officials in the capital have been told that they would be likely to have at least 12 hours’ notice that the grid was on the verge of failure. If it reaches that point, Mr. Tkachuk said, “we will start informing people and requesting them to leave.” For now at least, the situation is manageable, and there were no indications that large numbers of civilians were fleeing Kyiv, he said. But that would change quickly if the services that relied on city power stopped. The Biden administration in the US is privately encouraging Ukraine’s leaders to signal an openness to negotiate with Russia and drop their public refusal to engage in peace talks unless Vladimir Putin is removed from power, according to the Washington Post. The Post quotes sources “familiar with the discussions”. The request was not a bid to force Ukraine into negotiations but an attempt to maintain support in countries worried about Putin’s war’s impact on the world economy and the threat of nuclear war. The Post quotes one anonymous US official who stated: “Ukraine fatigue is a real thing for some of our partners.” The White House National Security Council had no immediate comment on the accuracy of the Post report. A State Department spokesperson said: “The Kremlin continues to escalate this war. The Kremlin has demonstrated its unwillingness to seriously engage in negotiations since even before it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.” Tens of thousands of Italians have marched through Rome calling for peace in Ukraine and urging Italy to stop sending of weapons to fight the Russian invasion. Agence France-Presse reported that one large banner carried by protesters on Saturday read “No to war. No to sending weapons” as a vast crowd broke into cries of “give peace a chance”. Italy, a founding member of Nato, has supported Ukraine from the start of the war, including providing it with arms. The new far-right prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has said that will not change and the government has said it is expecting to send more weapons soon. But some, including former prime minister Giuseppe Conte, have said Italy should be stepping up negotiations instead. The peace rally was attended by about 30,000 people, Rome police told Italian media. Demonstrator Roberto Zanotto told AFP: The weapons were sent at the beginning on the grounds that this would prevent an escalation Nine months later and it seems to me that there’s been an escalation. Look at the facts: sending weapons does not help stop a war, weapons help fuel a war. Student Sara Gianpietro said the conflict was being dragged out by arming Ukraine, which “has economic consequences for our country, but for the respect of human rights too”. The Group of Seven foreign ministers, including Italy, vowed on Friday to continue supporting Ukraine in the fight against Russia. A Russian colonel general has purportedly been replaced in the latest of a “series of dismissals” of senior Russian military commanders since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the UK Ministry of Defence says. It said in its latest intelligence update that Maj Gen Alexander Linkov was reportedly appointed acting commander of Russia’s central military district on Thursday, replacing Col Gen Alexander Lapin. The ministry said: Lapin has been widely criticised for poor performance on the battlefield in Ukraine by both Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Wagner head Yevgeny Prigozhin. These dismissals represent a pattern of blame against senior Russian military commanders for failures to achieve Russian objectives on the battlefield. This is in part likely an attempt to insulate and deflect blame from Russian senior leadership at home. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has defended a controversial trip to China as “worth it” due to an agreement to oppose the use of nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine. Speaking to a meeting of his Social Democrats on Saturday, a day after his 12-hour visit to Beijing, Scholz hailed an accord with China’s President Xi Jinping that a nuclear escalation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine must be avoided, Agence France-Presse reported. Scholz said: I think that in light of all the debate about whether it was the right thing to travel there or not, the fact that the Chinese government, the president and I could state that there must not be any nuclear weapons used in this war, for that alone this trip was worth it. The German leader said after talks with Xi that he had insisted “the Russia war in Ukraine is a dangerous situation for the whole world” and urged Russia’s ally Beijing to use its “influence” on Moscow to avert an escalation and stop the invasion. Beijing’s Xinhua news agency reported: Xi underscored the need for China and Germany, two major countries with great influence, to work together in times of change and instability and contribute more to global peace and development. Residents of the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut are living in dire conditions, with civilians killed and wounded daily, the deputy mayor said as fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces raged around the city. “With every day it’s becoming harder and harder to survive in this city,” Reuters reported Oleksandr Marchenko as saying from inside an empty government building as mortar fire boomed nearby. He said more than 120 civilians have been killed in Bakhmut since Russia’s invasion in February. There are districts where we don’t know the exact number of people killed because active fighting is ongoing there or the settlements are temporarily occupied [by Russian forces]. Ukrainian troops were “firmly holding the frontline”, Marchenko said, while describing a deteriorating humanitarian situation facing the city, where the population has fallen from its pre-war level of about 80,000 to as low as 12,000 today. Bakhmut has been an important target for Russia’s military in its slow advance through eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region, one of the territories the Kremlin claims to have annexed. Kyiv’s military has said the area is the site of some of the heaviest fighting with Russian forces. Marchenko said Russia’s troops were “trying to storm the city from several directions”. Bakhmut has been without electricity, gas and running water for nearly two months. The coming winter would be most difficult for the elderly and infirm, Marchenko said. Welcome back to the Guardian’s ongoing live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. Here’s a run through the latest developments as it passes 9am in Kyiv. Russian troops have been looting Kherson ahead of a potential withdrawal from the south-eastern Ukrainian city. Items taken range from art and cultural exhibits to ambulances and tractors. There has been an assassination attempt on a judge who sentenced two Britons to death in Russian-controlled Ukraine. Alexander Nikulin, who said Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner should be shot by a firing squad, was shot in Vuhlehirsk, in Donetsk, on Friday night. The local supreme court justice is in a serious condition in hospital. Russian troops are allegedly searching for residents in the Kherson region who are refusing to evacuate, before the forces’ potential withdrawal from the west bank of the Dnieper River. The Ukrainian foreign ministry has claimed its forces killed another 600 Russian soldiers in the past 24 hours. Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, has said the country did supply Russia with drones but that it took place before President Vladimir Putin’s forces invaded Kyiv. The drones have been used in attacks on civilian infrastructure, notably targeting power stations and dams. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy dismissed talk of limited Iranian supplies to Russia, saying Kyiv had downed 11 drones on Friday alone. He said: “If Iran continues to lie about the obvious, it means the world will make even more efforts to investigate the terrorist cooperation between the Russian and Iranian regimes and what Russia pays Iran for such cooperation.” Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Oleg Nikolenko, said Iran “should realise that the consequences of complicity in the crimes of Russian aggression against Ukraine will be much larger than the benefits of Russia’s support”. External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant two days after it was disconnected from the power grid after Russian shelling damaged high voltage lines, the UN nuclear watchdog said. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said he does not believe Russia will use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. The 300,000 troops Putin conscripted as part of the mobilisation drive are providing “little additional offensive combat capability” as the Russian military is struggling to train them, UK’s Ministry of Defence has reported. Scheduled power cuts will take place on Sunday in seven Ukrainian provinces including major cities such as Kyiv. Other provinces affected are Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy and Poltava.

Teenage programmers sit on bean bags and wander up and down an external staircase built for a recent hackathon. Only one item of furniture is incongruous amid the bright colours and glass cubicles at the institute of economics and technology: an old turquoise-painted desk. A student who once sat at it went on to became an international celebrity – and Ukraine’s wartime president. “Volodymyr Zelenskiy was special. He was bright, hard-working and wanted to be the best of the best,” Andrii Shaikan, rector of the state university in Zelenskiy’s home town of Kryvyi Rih, told the Guardian. In the mid-1990s, Shaikan was at the university himself, in the year above Zelenskiy. The president’s father, Oleksandr, is a well-known academic and heads its department of informatics and applied software. Zelenskiy’s mother, Rymma, is an engineer. Both parents are Jewish. Like his friends and neighbours, Zelenskiy grew up speaking Russian. Shaikan said Zelenskiy Sr had hoped his son, who read law, may go into academia. Instead, the future president developed a taste for show business, taking part in sketches and comedy competitions. A photo taken by Shaikan in 1996 shows a floppy-haired Zelenskiy standing with a group of fellow student performers, dressed in white jeans and a colourful waistcoat. His home was in one of the city’s middle-class districts. Back then, Kryvyi Rih was known for its criminal associations. Young men who returned from the Soviet war in Afghanistan drifted into lives of crime and drug dealing. “As a teenager, Volodymyr had two alternatives: he could succeed, or he could become a member of a criminal gang,” Shaikan recalled. He added: “We watched Volodymyr realise himself step by step. He has great leadership skills and is quick at solving problems. He makes instant decisions. And it’s very difficult to influence him.” The rector said he was not a fan of Zelenskiy’s “mass culture” TV shows including Servant of the People and preferred his live standup acts. The rector voted for him in Ukraine’s 2019 presidential election, which Zelenskiy won by a landslide. “We knew his environment and family roots,” he said. One influence, Shaikan said, was Zelenskiy’s grandfather who worked in the USSR as a criminal detective. “Volodymyr was interested in the law. He wanted to take after his grandfather,” the rector said. In an interview with CNN, Zelenskiy revealed that his grandfather Semyon had fought in the Red Army, reaching the rank of colonel. Semyon’s father and three brothers perished in the Holocaust. The Germans murdered Zelenskiy’s great-grandparents when they burned down their village. His tragic family history makes ridiculous the Kremlin’s claim that Zelenskiy is a fascist. The president’s former teachers described Zelenskiy as an intellectually capable undergraduate, who sometimes missed classes because he was busy on stage. Afterwards, he would apologise and hand in his assignments, they said. He drew other people to him, they added, and won an Olympiad competition for his mastery of English. “He had a great sense of humour. I taught him business English in his fourth year. I was strict. Students had to write letters. He made fun of stereotypes, and would mock the format by saying he intended to transport camels and elephants,” lecturer Kira Vyshnevska said. “You could see his political sensibility growing. He criticised our corrupt political system,” she added. Economics lecturer Natalia Voloshaniuk said Zelenskiy was a “leader and an organiser” who took his studies seriously, even as his show business career took off. She added: “People followed him. He was an intellectual light, and a humorous and fun guy. His decency was obvious. There was lot of the real Zelenskiy in the president he portrayed in Servant of the People.” In spring, Russian forces came close to seizing Zelenskiy’s home town, which was built in the 19th century along a series of mines. The city in south-east Ukraine is Europe’s longest at 75 miles (120km) and is dotted with chimney stacks and 20th-century foundries. When the enemy advanced, Shaikan said he and his colleagues made molotov cocktails and dug ditches. Russia’s objective was to seize Kryvyi Rih’s airfield and use it as a base to conquer the south – and to humiliate Zelenskiy by occupying his native city and hanging up Russian flags. Ukraine’s armed forces shoved the Russians back. The frontline is now 31 miles (50km) away. Russian troops are encamped on the bank of the Dnieper river in Zaporizhzhia oblast. From there, they have been bombarding the Ukrainian-controlled towns of Nikopol and Marhanets, last week killing at least 16 people. All the victims were civilians. A 13-year-old girl was hospitalised. Enemy soldiers have occupied the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, just across the river, prompting international concern and accusations from Zelenskiy of “state terrorism” by Russia. Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of Kryvyi Rih’s military administration, said Moscow could no longer reach Kryvyi Rih with artillery. It still bombards the city once a week with longer range rockets. There was no prospect of the Russian army launching a second offensive in the region, he said, adding: “People are patriotic. Everybody is working for victory. Ukraine will free all its territory.” Since February, 70,000 internally displaced people have arrived in Kryvyi Rih, Vilkul said, fleeing from the Nikopol district and eastern and southern regions. He said that when Ukraine liberated these occupied areas, it would find evidence of murders and war crimes. “There will be many places like Bucha. The Russians are worse than German fascists,” he said. The city – which has a peacetime population of 600,000 – is feeding 40,000 refugees every day. It has converted a house of culture into a humanitarian centre, complete with racks of secondhand clothes, medicines, a nurse, legal advice and a children’s play area. Its industrial enterprises have ground to a halt, since Ukraine is unable to export and import materials from its Black Sea ports. Outside the centre, a mural of a familiar figure was being painted on a brick wall. It was none other than Boris Johnson. Artist Anastasia Scherba said she was grateful to the outgoing UK prime minister for supporting Ukraine and giving it weapons. The design – created by a collective from Odesa – showed Johnson giving a thumbs up. “He’s cool,” Scherba said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/feb/02/eu-guidebook-taxonomy-green-investments-gas-nuclear-included","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-02T15:41:37Z","webTitle":"EU includes gas and nuclear in guidebook for ‘green’ investments","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/02/eu-guidebook-taxonomy-green-investments-gas-nuclear-included","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/feb/02/eu-guidebook-taxonomy-green-investments-gas-nuclear-included","fields":{"headline":"EU includes gas and nuclear in guidebook for ‘green’ investments","bodyText":"The European Commission has been accused of undermining its climate goals after it defied critics by pushing ahead with plans to include gas and nuclear in an EU guidebook for “green” investments. Gas and nuclear were deemed bridge technologies to meet the EU’s target of net zero emissions by 2050, in long-awaited proposals on the EU’s “taxonomy for environmentally sustainable economic activities”, which were published on Wednesday. “The reason we are including gas and nuclear in the way we are doing it is because we firmly believe that this recognises the need for these energy sources in transition,” the EU commissioner for financial services, Mairead McGuinness, told reporters. Critics said including gas and nuclear in a guide intended to prevent greenwashing jeopardised the EU’s climate goals and hopes of keeping global heating below 1.5C. “The European Commission is significantly undermining the EU’s credibility as a climate actor,” Bas Eickhout, a Dutch Green MEP and vice-chair of the European parliament’s environment committee, said. “At the UN climate summit in Glasgow, small steps were taken towards phasing out fossil fuels. Yet, unfortunately, the commission is already turning back the clock and leaving the door open to the gas industry.” Laurence Tubiana, the chief executive of the European Climate Foundation and an architect of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement, said: “The EU taxonomy was envisioned as a vital tool to align financial flows with the Paris agreement. Instead, Europe is undermining its climate leadership and lowering standards in the EU and beyond. When a gold standard does emerge elsewhere, this taxonomy will be left behind.” Since the proposals leaked on New Year’s Eve 2021 – fuelling bitter accusations of a lack of transparency – the commission has made minor tweaks that make it easier for gas projects to get in the green guidebook. Gas plants can get the stamp of approval if they switch to low-carbon gases or renewables by 2035. A previous requirement to phase-in low-carbon fuels by 2026 has been dropped. The taxonomy – intended to channel billions of private money into climate-friendly investments – is fast becoming one of the biggest controversies of Ursula von der Leyen’s tenure as European Commission president. Last month Greta Thunberg and climate activists slammed the plans as “fake climate action” that flout scientific advice. In a further sign of anger, campaign group Avaaz staged a mock burial of the taxonomy on a roundabout outside the commission headquarters, with activists wearing face masks of Von der Leyen, Germany’s Olaf Scholz and France’s Emmanuel Macron. France pressured Von der Leyen to grant the stamp of approval for nuclear power, while Germany had lobbied for the inclusion of gas, although Scholz’s coalition government is split on the issue. “Europe is witnessing our biggest setback yet in our moonshot mission,” said Patricia Martín Díaz of Avaaz. “Labelling fossil gas and nuclear as green is incompatible with the EU’s 2050 climate targets and our hope of keeping 1.5C alive.” The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which represents 375 funds holding €51tn assets under management, also urged the commission to drop gas, citing International Energy Agency studies that show Europe’s existing gas plants will have to close by 2035. “Put simply, there is no remaining carbon budget for new investments in natural gas,” the group said. Other critics include an expert panel convened by the commission, which said the plans were “not in line” with the original regulation, agreed in July 2020. In its stinging rebuke, the EU platform on sustainable finance – a group that includes industry, NGO and finance experts from EU institutions – said they had doubts about the criteria for gas and nuclear, while “many are deeply concerned about the environmental impacts that may result”. The group said only gas plants emitting less than 100 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour over their lifecycle should be allowed, a criteria that excludes conventional gas. In contrast, the commission would allow gas plants emitting 270g CO2e/kWh to be classed as “sustainable” until 2030. A second alternative would allow gas plants that emit an average of 550g CO2 e/kWh over a twenty-year lifespan. Critics describe this as loophole that allows new gas plants to be built on a promise of carbon capture technology that is yet to take off. The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through so-called delegated acts – secondary legislation meant for technical issues that is not subject to the same degree of ministerial and parliamentary oversight. Critics have accused the commission of abusing the process, by smuggling in the controversial issues of nuclear and gas into the latest delegated act, rather than drafting a separate law. Only a supermajority of 20 out of 27 EU member states, or a majority of the European parliament’s 705 MEPs can now defeat the plans during a scrutiny period of four to six months that began on Wednesday. Commission officials played down the threat of a legal challenge from Austria and Luxembourg, describing it as “a very theoretical discussion”. Both countries oppose nuclear power, while Green ministers in the German coalition government have dismissed the plans as greenwashing. Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands had urged the commission not to label gas as green, while Germany declared its opposition to nuclear. Yet France, backed by central and eastern European member states, lobbied Von der Leyen to include gas and nuclear, which they consider as a bridge to the EU’s net zero future. The largest group in the European parliament, the European People’s party has come out in favour of gas, underscoring the difficulties of defeating the plans. “Flexibility is needed in the way we decarbonise. If, for example, Poland would like to replace a coal plant with several small gas plants, this should be possible if it helps achieve climate neutrality”, Esther de Lange, a Dutch Christian Democrat, said. Lisa Fischer, who leads the E3G thinktank’s work on climate neutral energy systems, said gas and nuclear had no place in the taxonomy. “Gas investments are not only harmful to the climate they are also increasingly financially risky. Nuclear makes the EU’s energy transition more costly than it needs to be.” In a sign of the intense arguments, McGuinness revealed that had been no unanimity among the commission’s top 27 officials; she said an “overwhelming majority” of EU commissioners had backed the plans. “We were legally obliged to do this,” she said referring back to the initial July 2020 law. Opponents in national capitals, however, say the commission had no obligation to include gas or nuclear."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/aug/15/morning-mail-afghan-refugee-visa-limbo-turnbull-backs-voice-olivia-newton-johns-best","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-14T21:00:42Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Afghan refugee visa limbo, Turnbull backs voice, Olivia Newton-John’s best","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/aug/15/morning-mail-afghan-refugee-visa-limbo-turnbull-backs-voice-olivia-newton-johns-best","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/aug/15/morning-mail-afghan-refugee-visa-limbo-turnbull-backs-voice-olivia-newton-johns-best","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Afghan refugee visa limbo, Turnbull backs voice, Olivia Newton-John’s best","bodyText":"Good morning. Today marks one year since the Taliban recaptured Kabul and Guardian Australia has spoken to Afghans still stranded abroad, despite having Australian visas. And Malcolm Turnbull, who as prime minister rejected an Indigenous voice to parliament, calling it a potential “third chamber”, says he would vote in favour of Labor’s proposed model. Many Afghans with Australian visas are stranded in Pakistan and Iran and other countries, living in a legal limbo and struggling to eke out a living.

Timor-Leste’s president has warned that his nation will seek Chinese support if Australia and Woodside Energy fail to back a gas pipeline between the resource-rich Timor Sea and his country’s southern shore, rather than Darwin. José Ramos-Horta said despite being Australia’s neighbour and ally, his country would “absolutely” look to Chinese investment to secure what he says is the “national strategic goal” of piping gas from the Greater Sunrise fields to his nation’s coast. The oil and gasfields, worth an estimated $71bn, are critical to Timor-Leste’s future.

Smoke billowed into the sky near Dzhankoi, a significant railway hub in the north of the peninsula used by the Russian military to transport troops and equipment to occupied Melitopol, which Moscow seized early in its full-scale invasion. Several explosions on Tuesday appeared to have destroyed a Russian ammunition depot and an electricity substation about 125 miles (200km) from the frontline with Ukrainian forces. According to Russian media, a further blast took place at a military airfield in the village of Hvardeyskye, not far from Crimea’s regional capital, Simferopol. Residents reported hearing loud explosions, Kommersant reported. Satellite images suggest the airbase housed a large number of Sukhoi warplanes, which were integrated with the Russian navy. The attack appears to have been carried out remotely using a drone. Another spectacular strike last week wiped out Russia’s Saky aerodrome in the west of Crimea. At least eight fighter jets were incinerated. Tourists relaxing on the beach fled in panic, while long queues of traffic sought to escape via a bridge to the mainland. It was unclear how Ukraine managed to reach the two military targets, and Kyiv has not formally confirmed responsibility. The US-supplied Himars system previously used by Ukrainian soldiers to destroy bridges across the Dnieper River has a range of about 50 miles. Officials in Kyiv have suggested the Crimea strikes may be the work of partisans emboldened by Ukraine’s recent guided missile successes, or the product of disagreements within the Russian military. Either way, Russia’s southern bases and command posts look suddenly vulnerable. One former senior Ukrainian official, speaking to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, confirmed that Ukraine had intelligence assets working deep behind enemy lines. Russia had previously assumed Crimea was beyond Kyiv’s operational reach. A promised Ukrainian counteroffensive to recapture the occupied southern city of Kherson has yet to happen. Instead, Kyiv has hit Crimea three times in a week, in clinical and flamboyant style. Russia’s logistics and weapons dumps have been badly affected. The ministry of defence in Moscow said a fire had broken out in Dzhankoi but offered no explanation as to what might have happened. “The necessary measures are being taken to eliminate the consequences of sabotage,” the ministry said. So far, Russia appears to have responded with two missiles from Belarus which landed near the city of Zhytomyr. The latest Ukrainian strikes appear to have further spooked Crimea’s population, which until recently had suffered few consequences from Vladimir Putin’s war. Queues were reported outside Simferopol train station of residents seeking to flee. Senior Ukrainian government aides expressed their glee on social media. Mykailo Podolyak, an adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the apparent attack was an example of “demilitarisation in action”. He posted on Twitter: “A reminder … Crimea occupied by Russians is about warehouse explosions and high risk of death for invaders and thieves.” Air forces spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat joked that Russia “does not comply with fire safety”. Another presidential aide, Oleksiy Arestovych, tweeted a Photoshopped picture of himself relaxing on a sun lounger similar to the ones pictured last week in Ukraine’s apparent Saky attack. In the background is black smoke. “Morning near Dzhankoi,” Arestovych wrote. Earlier, in his latest address, Zelenskiy again accused Moscow of “nuclear blackmail” and called on Russia to hand back the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which it is using as a military base from which it has been shelling the nearby Ukrainian-controlled towns of Nikopol and Marhanets. Zelenskiy called for sanctions to be imposed on Russia’s nuclear agency Rosastom and on the “entire nuclear industry of the terrorist state”. Rosatom employees are at the complex, which Ukrainian technical staff continue to operate. “All Russian troops must be immediately withdrawn from the plant and neighbouring areas without any conditions,” Zelenskiy said. More than 40 countries have urged Russia to pull out and to withdraw heavy weapons from the facility, Europe’s biggest nuclear plant. One former senior employee, speaking anonymously, said the Russians had moved large numbers of armoured vehicles into the giant turbine hall of reactor No 1. They said the Russians were shelling the plant from surrounding villages and roads. Their apparent goal was to raise the stakes in negotiations with Kyiv and to put pressure on the international community, which would force Ukrainian concessions, they suggested. “The whole situation in the plant is dangerous but still not catastrophic,” the source said. “I still believe they [the Russians] are not crazy and they will not get to the point of disaster.” Four of the reactors were no longer working and in a state of cold shutdown, they said. The other two were operational but functioning at half capacity. Rosatom staff were liaising with Russian soldiers and advising them which areas could be “safely” shelled, they alleged. Asked if Ukraine was itself shelling the plant, as Russia had claimed, the source replied: “That is like believing the sun goes around the Earth. It’s absolutely impossible. It’s our plant, our territory and our people. The Russians are responsible for this.” About 50,000 people live in Enerhodar, the city in the Zaporizhzhia region next to the nuclear complex. Russian troops keep a low profile and have hung Russian flags over its main buildings, including the former headquarters of the SBU, Ukraine’s intelligence service. Many male residents had evacuated their wives and children to safer Ukrainian-controlled territory, the source said. Schools and kindergartens were closed. Shops that were empty during the early months of the invasion now had products, available to buy with Ukrainian hryvnias, they added. Over the past 10 days, explosions have rocked Enerhodar nightly, the source continued. One man walking his dog was killed by shelling in the first district – thought to be the only local casualty in recent months. “The Russians are actively using the territory around the town. I hear all these terrible sounds at night and during the day. Sometimes it sounds as if the explosions are so close they are in my neighbour’s yard,” they said. There was every sign Russia plans to annex occupied Zaporizhzhia soon. An “election tent” had been set up in Enerhodar ahead of a so-called vote, they said. The front-page headline on a new Russian propaganda sheet, Zaporizhzhia Vesnik, reads: “Referendum will happen!” The source said: “None of my friends wants a referendum. I don’t see people who will vote. Maybe there are a few who live in a parallel universe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/feb/01/business-department-agrees-three-month-carbon-dioxide-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-01T13:17:03Z","webTitle":"UK beer and meat producers breathe sigh of relief after CO2 deal is struck ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/01/business-department-agrees-three-month-carbon-dioxide-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/feb/01/business-department-agrees-three-month-carbon-dioxide-deal","fields":{"headline":"UK beer and meat producers breathe sigh of relief after CO2 deal is struck ","bodyText":"Food and drink makers have cautiously welcomed a deal that will secure UK production of carbon dioxide, which is used in making meat, beer, baked goods and fizzy drinks, for at least three months. Meat processors, brewers, bakers and soft drink producers all use CO2 in making and packaging their goods. It is also required for the humane slaughter of animals including pigs and chickens, and is used by hospitals and nuclear power plants. A short government statement said the new industry-led deal would enable CF Fertiliser plant in Billingham, County Durham, to continue to operate. The plant was scheduled for potential shutdown this week after a three-month emergency deal brokered by the government came to an end on Monday. That deal was prompted by a crisis in CO2 supplies in late September as high energy prices combined with annual maintenance shutdowns to bring UK production to a near halt. The government was forced to use taxpayer money to fund a three-week bailout for CF Industries, which accounts for 60% of the UK’s CO2 supplies, to stave off supply chain chaos before the first three-month deal was agreed. It said it would not put up further funds. Kate Halliwell, the chief scientific officer at the Food and Drink Federation trade body, which represents hundreds of UK food and drink businesses, said: “UK food and drink manufacturers welcome the deal that will ensure continuity of CO2 supply, keeping our shops, pubs and restaurants stocked with our favourite food and drink.” But industry insiders said there were concerns about what the new industry deal would mean for the cost of CO2, which has risen sharply in the light of soaring energy prices. Emma McClarkin, the chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said: “We are encouraged by the agreement made between suppliers and CF industries, however we urgently need further details on the nature of the arrangement in order to understand the impact on our sector and the longer term sustainability of CO2 supply for the UK drinks sector. “Our sector is still reeling from the impact of a devastating winter and face rising cost pressures from all angles. A swift resolution to the CO2 supply issue is crucial in ensuring a strong and sustainable recovery for the beer and pub sector.” The business department said in a statement: “The government welcomes the industry’s agreement which is in the best interest of businesses.” It added that in the longer term the government would “like to see the market take measures to improve resilience, and we are engaging on ways this could happen”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/13/europe-russians-tourist-visa-ban-ukraine-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-13T15:36:18Z","webTitle":"‘The west doesn’t want Russians partying in the streets of Europe’: calls grow for a visa ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/13/europe-russians-tourist-visa-ban-ukraine-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/13/europe-russians-tourist-visa-ban-ukraine-war","fields":{"headline":"‘The west doesn’t want Russians partying in the streets of Europe’: calls grow for a visa ban","bodyText":"Thousands of Russians have flocked to Europe on short-term visas since the country invaded Ukraine. Some sought an escape from repression, while summer has brought Russian tourists just looking to escape to the beach. Now some European politicians are calling for an end to the short-term visas that allow Russians to holiday in the EU as the war in Ukraine rages on. Countries including Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Finland and the Czech Republic have called for the EU to limit or block short-term Schengen visas for Russians, in protest at their country’s invasion of Ukraine. After six months of war, the proposal echoes widespread frustration with a Russian public that seems either unable or unwilling to mount a meaningful resistance to the war being waged in their name. The situation has been aggravated by high-profile incidents including a Russian woman harassing two Ukrainian refugees in Europe. “Stop issuing tourist visas to Russians,” Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas wrote on Twitter last week. “Visiting #Europe is a privilege, not a human right.” But German chancellor Olaf Scholz rejected the call, saying a blanket ban on visas for Russians was “hard to imagine”. EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss the measure at an informal meeting this month, although universal approval from the bloc’s 27 members would be needed. The proposal has also set off a heated debate among Russians – including vocal opponents of the war, often living in exile in Europe – about how a visa ban could mark a step toward isolation reminiscent of the Soviet period. “I don’t see anything good in forbidding Russians from Europe because they need to see a free world,” said Ilya Krasilshchik, a Russian online publisher who has been threatened with prosecution in Russia for opposing the war and is currently in Europe. While he thought a visa ban was unlikely to pass, he said issues with opening bank accounts in Europe had made it difficult for dissidents to operate in exile. Instead he would want heightened scrutiny to weed out Russians with pro-war views. “And as to the idea that if Russians can’t leave the country, they’ll rise up and overthrow the regime, it’s a total lie ... The experience of the Soviet Union shows that closing borders doesn’t lead to overthrow of the regime. I understand the anger of the moment, but I think in the long term it is dangerous.” Many Russians approached by the Observer agreed that ordinary tourism had become a clear flashpoint as the country engages in a brutal war against its neighbour. “I believe if you leave Russia you have to be actively against the war,” said Ira Lobanovskaya, who started a Relocation Guide from the Russian Federation chat on Telegram to advise people on leaving the country. “You can’t be outside of politics any more: that is barbaric in the current climate. We stress this when helping people relocate ... I understand that the west doesn’t want Russians partying on the streets of Europe.” But keeping Russians in Russia would be counterproductive, she said. About half of the 40,000-plus people her organisation has advised want to speak out or attend anti-government marches, she added. “They need to unite abroad, form anti-war alliances and speak out. You can’t just topple a nuclear power like Russia right now from the inside. It is just unrealistic.” However, Ilya Ponomarev, a former Duma deputy who has lived in exile in Ukraine since 2016, is in favour of a ban. He said Russians capable of doing so should stay in Russia to fight the regime,it was not productive for people to simply go to jail, “leaving the country should be the last resort”. “You cannot abstain from this war,” he said in an interview in Ukraine. “If you want to abstain, don’t complain that you are being kicked out of Europe.” He said he believed 98% of people leaving the country were not in danger but left “just because it’s uncomfortable for them [in Russia]”. He went on: “I very much agree with the Estonian leader when she said that being in Europe is not a human right; it is a privilege. If you want this privilege, do something in Russia first, earn this privilege, make some bold move, and then leave. And we shouldn’t restrict these kinds of people from leaving.” In an online address this weekend Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated his call to limit Schengen visas for Russians, saying there “should be guarantees that Russian murderers and the accomplices of state terror do not make use of the Schengen visas”. But he also called for support for Russians “who indeed need help”. “There are well-known legal mechanisms, through refugee status, asylum requests, and other ways to receive support.” Russian activists say tourist visas are an important tool for many trying to leave Russia, especially when they flee over land borders because flying out of the country is too costly or too dangerous. “This is a safety mechanism for thousands of Russians who already or may in future suffer from repressions,” said Anton Barbashin of news website Riddle Russia, who is currently in Europe. “A visa ban will limit opportunities critics of the regime have for getting to safety when they need to.” Countries such as Latvia, Estonia and Finland have seen an influx of both Russian tourists and émigrés since the beginning of the war, and have begun independently tightening immigration rules and enforcing limited visa bans. Other informal proposals aimed at limiting Russian tourism during the war include requiring Russians to sign a statement condemning the invasion when they enter Europe. Former US ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul suggests that Russian visitors be required to pay a tax of around €100 toward Ukraine’s reconstruction. “For those countries reluctant to ban all Russians from visiting their countries, the idea of charging an extra fee for the visa that would then go to Ukrainian reconstruction offers an alternative response,” he said. “Doing nothing – just maintaining the status quo – should not be an option.” He argued that would avoid the blanket restrictions that could punish Russians who have opposed the war and help spark a brain drain in Russia. “As to the dilemma of Russians being accused of funding the Ukrainian government reconstruction, well that’s their choice, No one is forcing them to travel to democratic Europe! They can vacation in the European country of Belarus instead.” Wealthy Russians would probably find a way around any ban, said the British passport-holding son of a Russian businessman. He has been in Saint-Tropez this summer and there were “as many Russians as usual”. “The elite will always find a way to get to Europe,” he said. “Many of my generation went to school here. We have lived long enough in the west to receive residency permits or a second passport. Those who don’t are talking about getting Turkish papers if Europe goes through with this. There will always be loopholes for those with money.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/07/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-43-of-russias-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-07T01:05:57Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 43 of Russian invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-43-of-russias-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/07/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-43-of-russias-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 43 of Russian invasion","bodyText":"Ukraine is braced for a renewed Russian offensive on its eastern front as Russian forces withdraw from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup and intensify their attacks across Donbas. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called on Nato allies to supply more weapons to bolster Ukraine’s war effort, including war planes, heavy air defence systems, missiles and armoured vehicles. Speaking at Nato headquarters, where foreign ministers of member states are meeting later on Thursday, Kuleba said three items were on his agenda for when he talked to the allies and held bilateral meetings: “Weapons, weapons and weapons”. The UN general assembly will vote later on Thursday on whether to suspend Russia from the UN human rights council. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the new package of western sanctions against Russia were “not enough” and without more painful measures and supply of weapons, Russia would view the actions as permission to launch a new bloody attack. Russia’s defence ministry said it used missiles to destroy four fuel storage facilities in the Ukrainian cities of Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Chuhuiv. The ministry said the facilities were used by Ukraine to supply its troops near the cities of Mykolaiv and Kharkiv and in the Donbas region in the south-east of the country. Russian air attacks are now focused mainly on areas of eastern Ukraine and Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukrainian troops in the region, according to the Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych. At total of 10 humanitarian corridors will be open for civilian evacuations across Ukraine today, but Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said residents trying to leave Mariupol would again have to use their own vehicles. The mayor of Mariupol said more than 100,000 people still needed urgent evacuation from the city, and that more than 5,000 civilians, including 210 children, had been killed since the start of Russia’s invasion. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the US supplying Ukraine with weapons would “not contribute to the success of Russian-Ukrainian talks”. Poland’s deputy foreign minister Marcin Przydacz said the country needed financial assistance over the arrival of 2.5 million of Ukrainian refugees, many of them children. The Greek foreign minister, Nikos Dendias, said Athens would ask the international court of justice at The Hague to investigate war crimes in Mariupol. Ukraine and Hungary again exchanged barbed words. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said it considered Hungary’s willingness to pay for Russian gas in roubles an “unfriendly act”. Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, confirmed that fuel for his country’s nuclear power plants had arrived by air from Russia, and restated that Budapest did not support proposals for European energy sanctions against Russia. Defence ministers from Black Sea coastal countries held a video call to discuss the war in Ukraine, mines floating in the sea and regional security, the Turkish defence ministry said, adding that the ministers called for an immediate ceasefire. Russia’s communications watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against Google, including a ban on advertising the platform and its information resources, for allegedly violating Russian law. Roskomnadzor accused YouTube of being one of the “key platforms” it claimed was spreading fake information about Russia’s conduct in the war. YouTube suspended the account of Wang Jixian, a Chinese national in Odesa who has criticised Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. He was reported to the platform for content containing “suspected violence”. The number of alleged Russian war crimes Ukraine says is under investigation has increased to 4,820, according to a recent update from the country’s prosecutor general’s office. The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, said Australia was imposing sanctions on 67 Russians over the invasion of Ukraine. Austria, meanwhile, is to expel four Russian diplomats."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-key-points","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T14:51:12Z","webTitle":"Budget 2023: key points at a glance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-key-points","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-key-points","fields":{"headline":"Budget 2023: key points at a glance","bodyText":"Hunt’s opening remarks Jeremy Hunt kicks off by telling MPs the British economy is “proving the doubters wrong”, and the OBR is now forecasting there will be no recession, after the gloomy projections made in the autumn. “We are following the plan and the plan is working,” he says. Aubrey Allegretti, political correspondent: Hunt has the weight of his party and the country on his shoulders. The first budget in 18 months – when the UK has had two chancellors come and go – carries huge implications for people struggling during the cost of living crisis, businesses concerned about economic stability, and the Conservatives’ polling deficit. He nods to “difficult decisions” taken in the autumn and seeks to cajole grumpy Tory MPs by telling them “the plan is working”. To try to boost their spirits, he declares “inflation has peaked” and gets huge cheers for declaring a recession looks likely to be avoided. Cost of living support After a vigorous campaign from the consumer rights champion Martin Lewis and many charities, Hunt confirms that the energy price guarantee will remain at £2,500 until July – it had been set to rise to £3,000. The chancellor says: “Some people remain in real distress, and we should always remain ready to help when we can.” He says the measure would save the average family £160. As expected, Hunt extends the 5p cut to fuel duty made by Rishi Sunak last March, for another year. He also announces extra help for those with prepayment meters, saying he will “bring their charges in line with comparable direct debit charges”. He also announces a £63m fund to help leisure centres and pools afford their energy bills, and £100m extra for charities facing soaring costs. Aubrey Allegretti: Aware that energy prices are a big contributor to people feeling the strain, Hunt knows news that the energy price guarantee being kept at £2,500 from April until July will be welcomed. But he struggles to avoid smiling as opposition MPs laugh at his support for swimming pools – after this Guardian story. Economic forecasts Hunt says this will be a budget for “long-term, sustainable, healthy growth”, and it will deliver “prosperity with a purpose”. He says the OBR expects inflation, at 10.7% in Q4 of last year, to be 2.9% by the end of 2023 – meeting Sunak’s target of halving it. Since the autumn statement, the OBR, along with many other forecasters, has become slightly less gloomy about the prospects for 2023. It is now expecting GDP to contract by 0.2%, instead of the 1.4% it predicted in November. Hunt says that will be followed by growth of 1.8% next year, 2.5% in 2025 and 2.1% in 2026. That compares with November forecasts of 1.3% for 2024, 2.6% for 2025 and 2.7% for the year after – so the OBR is expecting stronger growth in the next two years, but a slower recovery thereafter. Aubrey Allegretti: While Hunt quietly sets as much distance between this budget and Kwasi Kwarteng’s disastrous mini-budget last September, he still needs to demonstrate a commitment to Liz Truss’s watchword – growth. It is a key target of Labour’s, and restless Tory backbenchers need to be convinced they are not just propping up a government engaged in managed decline. Hunt says growth is one of the PM’s five priorities, but defends his commitment to returning inflation to the 2% target and says it now looks poised to diminish to 2.9% by the end of the year. There are some who think the inflation cut would have happened anyway and that Hunt and Sunak are giving themselves a pat on the back for something more dictated by global headwinds. Hunt will have to prove his plan is partly responsible for the positive news. Public finances Hunt boasts that by the end of the forecast period, the government’s current budget deficit – day-to-day spending minus tax revenues – will be in surplus. He says the OBR is expecting that he will meet his fiscal rule of keeping public sector net borrowing below 3% of GDP, with £39.2bn to spare, by the end of the forecast. Public sector net debt was previously expected to peak at 97.6% of GDP in 2025-26, falling to 97.3% two years later. It is now expected to hit a somewhat lower peak of 97.3%, falling to 94.6% by 2027-28. As in the autumn statement, he says day-to-day spending will rise by 1% a year in real terms from next year to the end of the forecast period. Aubrey Allegretti: The wind is in Hunt’s sails here, because of a higher-than-expected tax take providing some extra fiscal headroom. This is well known, and Tory MPs expect the chancellor to make the most of it. In a nod to it, Hunt says this will provide “more money for public services and more money for future generations” – something he calls “deeply held on values that we put into practice today” that earns him some cheers from Tory MPs. It might not be as jazzy as the more retail spending commitments, but reducing debt was a hallmark of the coalition government – and Hunt is keen to stick at it. The chancellor draws attention to the economy inherited by the Tories in 2010, seeking to rouse the backbenches and as an attack on Labour’s performance in government. Levelling up Hunt says the government plans to create a dozen new investment zones that could become “12 potential Canary Wharfs”. He says areas including the West Midlands, Greater Manchester, Liverpool and Teesside had been identified as possible hosts, and they will need to develop proposals centred on universities or research institutes. Successful applicants will be given £80m of support as well and allowed to retain some local taxes. Hunt also announces an extra £400m for “levelling up partnerships” in areas including Redcar and Cleveland and Rochdale, as well as confirming the next round of city region transport settlements, which will be worth £8.8bn over five years. He confirms that the West Midlands and Greater Manchester will get new multi-year devolution funding deals, and be allowed to retain business rates. Aubrey Allegretti: It was the Boris Johnson government’s raison d’etre – but levelling up gets far fewer mentions these days. Wary that it was a key part of wooing the 2019 winning coalition of voters that helped the Tories shatter the “red wall”, Hunt knows it remains a vital mission. Truss-era ministers are understood to be frustrated with only 12 investment zones in higher-education hotspots going ahead. They believe the number is too low and that they will no longer fulfil “levelling up” in more deprived parts of the country. Hunt’s nod to key constituencies such as Redcar and regions such as Teesside show there is still ambition to fight to keep the Conservatives’ hold in those areas. Business tax and incentives Hunt says he wants to create “the most pro-business, pro-enterprise tax regime anywhere”, despite confirming that he will go ahead with the planned increase in corporation tax – first announced by Sunak – from 19% to 25% in April. He announces a new £9bn policy of “full capital expensing”, initially for the next three years, which allows firms to write off all investment against their tax bills. Hunt says the OBR believes this will boost business tax by 3% a year. He also announces a new “enhanced credit” for research-intensive businesses, worth £27 for every £100 they invest. Hunt also extends “draught relief”, so that the duty paid in pubs will be up to 11% lower than elsewhere. He calls this a “Brexit pubs guarantee,” saying it would not have been possible inside the EU. He also says he will put in place a new medicine regulator, which will give “rapid, often near-automatic approval for medicines and technologies already approved by trusted regulators in other parts of the world such as the US, Europe and Japan. And he says he will offer a £1m a year prize for the next 10 years for the most innovative research in AI. Aubrey Allegretti: The corporation tax rise is perhaps Hunt and Sunak’s weakest flank with Tory MPs. Former cabinet ministers Simon Clarke and Priti Patel have been breathing down the government’s neck on this. The chancellor defends the rise, by saying it will still leave the UK with the lowest headline corporation tax rate in the G7. His “tax cut” for capital expensing will give ministers another key line of defence – and comes with a hefty price tag of £9bn a year. It is a short-term boost for business investment, as Hunt acknowledges it won’t be made permanent until it is responsible to do so. Energy and climate Hunt announces £20bn of investment in carbon capture and storage, which he says will kick off with projects including Merseyside and Wales. He says nuclear power will be classed as environmentally sustainable, giving it access to investment incentives. Hunt also announces the creation of what he calls Great British Nuclear, which he says will help to bring down costs, and says the government will launch a competition for the design of small modular reactors – which could be co-funded by the government if they prove viable. Aubrey Allegretti: There are two big reasons for this focus on energy. It has become more politically salient since gas prices shot up after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and as the net zero target looms closer. Boosting nuclear is a way for the Conservatives to bash Labour, and Hunt acknowledges this – saying it is a “shame” the main opposition party did not champion the energy source when they were in government. We get what might be the first gag by the chancellor this budget – something that is usually peppered more frequently in such statements. Hunt jokes that energy security is so important because “the sun doesn’t always shine – even under a Conservative government”. Employment “Conservatives believe work is a virtue,” Hunt says, as he confirms a significant package of measures aimed at tackling economic inactivity, in what he calls a “back to work budget”. These include: Scrapping the much-derided work capability assessment – though details of its replacement are not yet clear. Introducing a new voluntary employment scheme for disabled people, universal support, worth £4,000 for up to 50,000 people. A £400m scheme to make more support for mental and physical health available to workers with health problems. For those on universal credit without a health problem, Hunt says benefits sanctions will be “applied more rigorously” to force claimants to search for work. “Independence is always better than dependence,” he says. Focusing on the over-50s, Hunt says he will increase the number of people who get “mid-life MOTs” from the Department for Work and Pensions, helping them assess their financial situation. There will be a new apprenticeship, called “returnerships”, for over-50s wanting to return to work in a new sector. And Hunt says he will lift the annual limit on tax-free pension contributions from £40,000 to £60,000 and abolish the lifetime cap, to tempt higher-paid older workers, such as doctors, to remain in the workplace. “No one should be pushed out of the workplace for tax reasons,” he says. Aubrey Allegretti: Given the number of people who are unable to work because of long-term sickness, retiring early, or unable to go back to work because of spiralling childcare costs, boosting employment is an important focus for the Treasury. Overhauling disability benefits has been a long-trailed plan. Doing so is hoped to incentivise people to return to the workforce. The tougher sanctions for those that fail to meet work search requirements or don’t take up a reasonable job offer are designed to head off any concerns from Tory backbenchers about “handouts”. Increasing the pensions annual tax-free allowance and scrapping the lifetime allowance was a key ask of some Tory MPs, who said they were driving NHS workers to quit. Hunt’s pledge that the long-delayed health service workforce plan is to be published “shortly” will be closely watched. But such promises have been made before. Childcare Hunt says he wants to reform a childcare system he says is “bad for children, and damaging for the economy”, and suggests the overhaul could get 11 million more women into work. As revealed in the Guardian, he says parents of children aged nine months to three years will be offered 30 hours a week of free childcare in term time – as long as both parents are working at least 16 hours a week. The change will be phased in gradually, by September 2025 – Hunt says this will allow for new provision to be available. Universal credit claimants will be able to receive childcare funding upfront, instead of in arrears, and the amount available will increase. Local authorities will be given more funding for wraparound care, from 8am-6pm, with an ambition that all schools will offer it by September 2026. Hunt says he will increase the funding for free nursery places, by £204m from September, and £280m next year – an average increase of 30%. Aubrey Allegretti: Sorting out the mess of unwieldy childcare issues is something Tory MPs have been pushing for quietly in the background. A campaign has been led by the “Next Generation Tories” group to push this up the political agenda, because of fears it is driving younger voters away from the party. Changing minimum staff ratios was also part of the supply-side reforms championed by Truss, so this section of Hunt’s speech will go down well with them. However, there are cries of disbelief when Hunt says that he aims to have wraparound childcare from 8am to 6pm rolled out for all schools by September 2026. That is a long way off and means it will have to be a pledge in the Conservatives’ next election manifesto."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/22/russia-ukraine-war-eu-to-prepare-new-sanctions-on-moscow-zelenskiy-lays-out-peace-formula-at-un-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-22T20:02:43Z","webTitle":"Ukraine war: Lavrov walks out of UN security council; Russians flee country to avoid military draft – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/22/russia-ukraine-war-eu-to-prepare-new-sanctions-on-moscow-zelenskiy-lays-out-peace-formula-at-un-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/22/russia-ukraine-war-eu-to-prepare-new-sanctions-on-moscow-zelenskiy-lays-out-peace-formula-at-un-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine war: Lavrov walks out of UN security council; Russians flee country to avoid military draft – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s slightly past 11pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Russian president Vladimir Putin is giving directions directly to generals in the field, CNN reports. According to two sources familiar with American and western intelligence that spoke to CNN, the direct orders from Putin to generals “hints at the dysfunctional command structure” that has affected Russia forces on the battlefield. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban wants EU sanctions on Russia lifted by the end of the year, a pro-government daily newspaper said Thursday. Orban, who has sought close ties with Russian president Vladimir Putin in recent years, has frequently railed against the sanctions which were imposed onto Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Many of the Ukrainians exchanged in the largest prisoner swap with Russia since the beginning of the invasion show signs of violent torture, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence said Thursday. On Wednesday Ukraine announced the exchange of a record-high 215 imprisoned soldiers with Russia, including fighters who led the defence of Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks that became an icon of Ukrainian resistance. Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said that he is not surprised that that Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov walked out of a UN security council meeting. “I’m not surprised,” Cleverly said at the UN, saying, “I don’t think Mr. Lavrov wants to hear the collective condemnation of this council.” Russian president Vladimir Putin is giving directions directly to generals in the field, CNN reports. According to two sources familiar with American and western intelligence that spoke to CNN, the direct orders from Putin to generals “hints at the dysfunctional command structure\" that has affected Russia forces on the battlefield. Other sources who are familiar with US intelligence told CNN that there are significant disagreements on strategy with military leaders who struggle to agree on where to focus their efforts in Ukraine. Additionally, a senior NATO official told the outlet that senior officials in Moscow are struggling to assign blame for Russia’s setbacks in the war. “Kremlin officials and state media pundits have been feverishly discussing the reasons for the failure in Kharkiv and in typical fashion, the Kremlin seems to be attempting to deflect the blame away from Putin and onto the Russian military,” the official said. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban wants EU sanctions on Russia lifted by the end of the year, a pro-government daily newspaper said Thursday. Orban, who has sought close ties with Russian president Vladimir Putin in recent years, has frequently railed against the sanctions which were imposed onto Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. According to Orban, the sanctions are more damaging to Europe than to Russia. Magyar Nemzet reported that Orban urged members of his Fidesz party at a closed-door gathering late Wednesday to get the sanctions lifted. “According to our information... Orban called on the members of the Fidesz faction to do their utmost to ensure that Europe lifts these sanctions by the end of the year at the latest,” the newspaper said. The government said it confirmed the content of the article. It comes as Brussels looks to impose further sanctions on Russia. Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said further sanctions would only “deepen the difficulties”. “Europe is suffering more from the restrictions imposed in response to the war in Ukraine than Russia, and therefore the eighth package of sanctions should be forgotten,” he said at the UN General Assembly in New York earlier this week. Hungary has been hit by record-high inflation. The country is highly dependent on Russian oil and gas, and there are fears for its energy supplies. Orban’s ruling Fidesz party meanwhile announced it would soon launch a national public consultation on the issue of sanctions - a method previously used to denounce EU migration policy for instance. It would aim to give Hungarians the chance to voice their opinion, Mate Kocsis, head of the party’s parliamentary group, told reporters. “It is not normal that sanctions are only decided by the Brussels elite,” Kocsis said. EU foreign ministers held an emergency meeting Wednesday to discuss the issue after Moscow mobilised reservists for its war in Ukraine. A final decision needs to be made at a formal session. Many of the Ukrainians exchanged in the largest prisoner swap with Russia since the beginning of the invasion show signs of violent torture, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence said Thursday. Agence France-Presse reports: On Wednesday Ukraine announced the exchange of a record-high 215 imprisoned soldiers with Russia, including fighters who led the defence of Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks that became an icon of Ukrainian resistance. “Many of them have been brutally tortured,” Kyrylo Budanov said during a press conference, without providing further details on signs of torture. Some of the detainees “are in a more or less normal physical condition, except for chronic malnutrition due to bad conditions of detention”, Budanov said. The prisoners were detained in Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian troops, as well as in Russia itself, according to the high-ranking official. Ukrainian interior minister Denys Monastyrsky during the same press conference said “absolutely all” of the Ukrainian prisoners swapped “need psychological rehabilitation.” Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said that he is not surprised that that Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov walked out of a UN security council meeting. “I’m not surprised,” Cleverly said at the UN, saying, “I don’t think Mr. Lavrov wants to hear the collective condemnation of this council.” It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Thousands of men across Russia have been handed draft papers after Vladimir Putin announced a partial military mobilisation. Among those who have been called up since the president’s announcement on Wednesday are Russians detained while protesting against the mobilisation, the OVD-Info rights group said. Traffic at Russian border crossings with Finland and Georgia surged after Putin’s partial mobilisation announcement sparked fears that men of fighting age would be called to fight on the frontline in Ukraine. Prices for one-way flights out of Moscow to the nearest foreign locations rose above $5,000 (£4,435), with most air tickets sold out completely for the coming days. Photos showed long tailbacks at border crossings with Finland and Georgia. In response, Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said her government was considering ways to sharply reduce Russian tourism and transit through Finland. “The government’s will is very clear, we believe Russian tourism [to Finland] must be stopped, as well as transit through Finland,” Marin told reporters. The Kremlin has dismissed reports of an exodus of Russian men of fighting age following Putin’s mobilisation announcement as “exaggerated”. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, also declined to deny Russian media reports that some anti-mobilisation protesters detained on Wednesday night had been given draft papers, saying: “This is not against the law.” Russian deserters fleeing mobilisation may be able to obtain protection in Germany, the German interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said. “Deserters threatened with serious repression can, as a rule, obtain international protection in Germany,” Faeser said in an interview. The Czech foreign minister, Jan Lipavský, said Russians fleeing the country will not be issued humanitarian visas by the Czech Republic. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has issued a strongly worded rebuke to Russia for “totally unacceptable” nuclear threats. Speaking at the start of a UN security council meeting the day after Putin raised the stakes in his invasion of Ukraine, Guterres said Moscow’s plans to annex parts of Ukraine were a “violation of the UN charter and of international law”. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, walked out of a UN security council meeting after accusing Ukraine and its western allies of “impunity” in Donbas. Ukraine and its allies were attempting to “impose on us a completely different narrative about Russian aggression”, Lavrov argued. He appeared to walk out of the UN meeting as his British counterpart, James Cleverly, addressed the council. Also speaking at the UN security council meeting, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, accused Putin of having “shredded” international order “before our eyes”. Russia’s president had added “fuel to the fire” by announcing mobilisation and planning “referendums” in occupied Ukrainian territory, and must be held to account for his actions, Blinken said. Nato has condemned plans to hold “referendums” in Russian-occupied regions in Ukraine, describing them as Moscow’s “blatant attempts at territorial conquest”. “Sham referenda” in the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson “have no legitimacy”, the alliance said in a statement following the announcement earlier this week that the regions were planning to hold “referendums” on joining the Russian Federation. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, also denied reports that an undisclosed clause in Putin’s decree on partial mobilisation provided for 1 million reservists to be enlisted to fight in Ukraine. “This is a lie,” Peskov said in response to a report by Novaya Gazeta that quoted an unnamed Russian official as saying the government’s real plan is to call up 1 million people. Security forces detained more than 1,300 people in Russia overnight at protests denouncing mobilisation, a rights group said. Those figures from across 38 Russian cities include at least 502 in Moscow and 524 in St Petersburg, according to the independent OVD-Info protest monitoring group. These are the largest protests seen since Putin launched his invasion in February. More than 200 Ukrainian and foreign citizens have been released from Russian captivity, including fighters who led the defence of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, in the biggest prisoner swap since Russia’s invasion began in February. In return, Russia received 55 prisoners from Ukraine, including the former Ukrainian MP Viktor Medvedchuk, an ally of Putin accused by Ukraine of high treason. Five Britons released from Russia overnight are meeting their families after several months of captivity in which it was feared they would be executed for fighting for Ukraine. A major diplomatic effort was behind the release of the five Britons who, together with two Americans, a Moroccan, a Croat and a Swedish national, were released by Russia to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. The five Britons have been named. Poland has distributed iodine tablets to regional fire departments to give to people in the event of radioactive exposure, after concerns about fighting around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The deputy interior minister, Błażej Poboży, said these were “routine, pre-emptive actions” to protect people in the event of a situation “which I hope will not happen”. Summons delivered to eligible men at midnight. Schoolteachers pressed into handing out draft notices. Men given an hour to pack their things and appear at draft centres. Women sobbing as they send their husbands and sons off to fight in Russia’s war in Ukraine. The first full day of Russia’s first mobilisation since the second world war produced emotional showdowns at draft centres and even signs of protest. And it appears Russia could be considering far more than the 300,000 new conscripts claimed by the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. One woman in a village in the Zakamensky region of Buryatia, eastern Siberia, said she first felt something was amiss when the dogs began barking at about midnight. In a community of 450 people, the village head was walking from house to house, seeking to hand out more than 20 draft notices. As men gathered before departing the next morning, she said, some drank vodka, while others hugged and told each other to stay safe. Women cried and made the sign of the cross over the small minibus that carried them away. “It’s not a partial mobilisation, it’s a 100% mobilisation,” said Alexandra Garmazhapova, the president of the Free Buryatia Foundation, an activist group that has reported on the draft in the region. In the past day, she said, she and her colleagues had received and identified more than 3,000 reports of povestka, or draft papers, being delivered in Buryatia within just 24 hours of Vladimir Putin announcing the draft. Read the full story here: Nato has condemned plans to hold “referendums” in Russian-occupied regions in Ukraine, describing them as Moscow’s “blatant attempts at territorial conquest”. Earlier this week, four Russian-occupied Ukrainian regions announced they were planning to hold votes on joining the Russian Federation. Ukraine and the west have indicated they will not recognise the annexations – and that Russia’s new territorial claims will not slow Ukraine reclaiming its sovereign land. In a statement today, Nato said: Sham referenda in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions of Ukraine have no legitimacy and will be a blatant violation of the UN charter. It added: Nato allies will not recognise their illegal and illegitimate annexation. These lands are Ukraine. Also speaking at the UN’s security council today, the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, called for “neutrality” and urged Russia and Ukraine to commit to “dialogue without pre-conditions”. China supported investigations into violations of international humanitarian law, but they should be “objective and fair, based on facts rather than an assumption of guilt” and “must not be politicised”, Wang said. Wang spoke with his Polish counterpart, Zbigniew Rau, on the sidelines of the UN meeting, where he argued that an expanded and protracted war was not in the interests of any parties, according to China’s foreign ministry. China hopes that the “flame of war” will go out as soon as possible, the Chinese ministry cited Wang as saying. Boris Johnson has said the UK must be prepared to give “more military assistance” and “more economic support” to Ukraine. Speaking to the Commons today, the former prime minister said it was “more vital than ever” that Britain has “the strategic patience to hold our nerve” and ensure that Ukrainians succeed in recapturing their territory. Johnson added: If Putin is going to double down on his aggression, then we must double down in our defence of the Ukrainians, and we must be prepared to give more military assistance and more economic support. Thousands of men across Russia have been handed draft papers after Vladimir Putin announced a partial military mobilisation. Among those who have been called up since the Russian president’s announcement yesterday are Russians detained while protesting in cities across the country, the OVD-Info rights group said. One protester in Moscow was told they faced a 10-year jail sentence for refusing to receive an enlistment order, it said. In a statement, OVD-Info said: Information was received from 15 police departments that the detained men were handed a summons to the military registration and enlistment office. Another demonstrator told the Moscow Times that male protesters were given draft papers at the police station. She told the paper: There was a military recruiting officer who gave the detained men draft notifications. When the first person was asked to go to a separate room, we did not understand what was going on — but when he returned with a draft slip, we just started crying. Earlier today, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to deny reports that some protesters had been given draft papers, saying only: “This is not against the law.” The Ukrainian journalist Nataliya Gumenyuk has written for us today about how Vladimir Putin’s mobilisation will make the war real for thousands of Russian families, and proves it is failing to hold the frontline. Ukrainians feel hope, not fear, she writes. Instead of thinking about Putin’s speech, many Ukrainians celebrated the exchange of 215 Ukrainian prisoners of war that took place on the same day. Among them were Azov battalion fighters, members of the the national guard, the head of the Mariupol patrol police, and a nine-months-pregnant paramedic who had spent six months in prison. Exhausted, thin, and wearing the same clothes they had on when captured in May 2022, many had a chance to call their relatives for the first time in months. “The best soil in the world,” one of the fighters said, kneeling down and kissing the land. Read the full story here: Russians fleeing the partial mobilisation ordered by Vladimir Putin will not be issued with humanitarian visas by the Czech Republic, the Czech foreign minister, Jan Lipavský, said. In a statement obtained by Agence-France-Presse, Lipavský said: I understand that Russians are fleeing from the increasingly desperate decisions taken by Putin. But those who are running away from their country because they do not want to fulfil a duty imposed by their own state do not meet the criteria for receiving humanitarian visas. Earlier today, Germany’s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, suggested that Russian deserters may be able to obtain protection in Germany. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, walked out of a UN security council meeting after accusing Ukraine and its western allies of “impunity” in Donbas. Ukraine and its allies were attempting to “impose on us a completely different narrative about Russian aggression”, Lavrov argued. Lavrov was nearly 90 minutes late for the security council meeting and appeared to want to leave as soon as he finished speaking. Britain’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, speaking at the council meeting after Lavrov, said the UK would support Ukraine all the way and for as long as it takes. Cleverly said Russia had tried to “lay the blame on those imposing sanctions” and that “every day, the devastating consequences of Russia’s invasion become more clear”. Cleverly said of Lavrov: He has left the chamber, I’m not surprised. I don’t think Mr Lavrov wants to hear the collective condemnation of this council. Speaking at the UN security council meeting, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, accused Vladimir Putin of having “shredded” international order “before our eyes”. Russia’s president had added “fuel to the fire” by announcing mobilisation and planning “referendums” in occupied Ukrainian territory, and must be held to account for his actions, Blinken said. We cannot – we will not – let President Putin get away with it. Blinken said it was critical to show that “no nation can redraw the borders of another by force”, adding: If we fail to defend this principle when the Kremlin is so flagrantly violating it, we send the message to aggressors everywhere that they can ignore it too. International criminal court (ICC) prosecutor Karim Khan has said there are “reasonable grounds” to believe crimes within the jurisdiction of the court have been committed in Ukraine. Speaking at the UN’s security council, Khan said the ICC investigation priorities were intentional targeting of civilian objects and the transfer of populations from Ukraine, including children. Hours after Vladimir Putin shocked Russia by announcing the first mobilisation since the second world war, Oleg received his draft papers in the mailbox, ordering him to make his way to the local recruitment centre in Kazan, the capital of the Tatarstan republic. As a 29-year-old sergeant in the Russian reserves, Oleg said he always knew that he would be the first in line if a mobilisation was declared, but held out hope that he would not be forced to fight in the war in Ukraine. “My heart sank when I got the call-up,” he said. “But I knew I had no time to despair.” He quickly packed all his belongings and booked a one-way ticket to Orenburg, a southern Russian city close to the border with Kazakhstan. “I will be driving across the border tonight,” he said in a telephone interview on Thursday from the airport in Orenburg. “I have no idea when I’ll step foot in Russia again,” he added, referring to the jail sentence Russian men face for avoiding the draft. Oleg said he was leaving behind his wife, who is due to give birth next week. I will miss the most important day of my life. But I am simply not letting Putin turn me into a killer in a war that I want no part in. The Kremlin’s decision to announce a partial mobilisation has led to a rush among men of military age to leave the country, likely sparking a new, possibly unprecedented brain drain in the coming days and weeks. The Guardian spoke to over a dozen men and women who had left Russia since Putin announced the so-called partial mobilisation, or who are planning to do so in the next few days. Read the full story here: The Finnish government is considering ways to sharply reduce Russian tourism and transit through Finland, the country’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said. Her remarks came after the Finnish border guard said traffic arriving at the country’s eastern border “intensified” overnight after Vladimir Putin ordered a partial military mobilisation. Some 4,824 Russians arrived in Finland via the country’s eastern border on Wednesday, an increase of 1,691 compared with the same day last week, it said. Traffic at the border remained elevated on Thursday but was under control, it added. At the Vaalimaa border crossing, roughly three hours’ drive from St Petersburg, three lanes of cars each stretched for 300-400 metres at around 1.15pm local time (1015 GMT), a border official told Reuters. A couple of hours later, traffic had quietened with cars stretching over three lanes for some 150 metres, according to a Reuters witness. Russian deserters fleeing the partial mobilisation ordered by Vladimir Putin may be able to obtain protection in Germany, the German interior minister has said. In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, Nancy Faeser said: Deserters threatened with serious repression can as a rule obtain international protection in Germany. She added: Anyone who courageously opposes Putin’s regime and thereby falls into great danger, can file for asylum on grounds of political persecution. Following Putin’s mobilisation announcement yesterday, Latvia’s foreign minister, Edgars Rinkēvičs, said his country, which borders Russia, would not offer refuge to Russians escaping mobilisation due to “security reasons”. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The Kremlin has dismissed reports of an exodus of Russian men of fighting age following Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a partial mobilisation as “exaggerated”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also declined to deny Russian media reports that some anti-mobilisation protesters detained on Wednesday night had been given draft papers, saying: “This is not against the law.” Traffic at Russian border crossings with Finland and Georgia surged after Vladimir Putin’s partial mobilisation announcement sparked fears that men of fighting age would be called to fight on the frontline in Ukraine. Prices for one-way flights out of Moscow to the nearest foreign locations rose above $5,000 (£4,435), with most air tickets sold out completely for coming days. Photos showed long tailbacks at border crossings with Finland and Georgia. Peskov also denied reports that an undisclosed clause in President Putin’s decree on partial mobilisation provided for 1 million reservists to be enlisted to fight in Ukraine. “This is a lie,” Peskov said in response to a report by Novaya Gazeta that quoted an unnamed Russian official as saying that the government’s real plan is to call up 1 million people. Security forces detained more than 1,300 people in Russia overnight at protests denouncing mobilisation, a rights group said. Those figures across 38 Russian cities include at least 502 in Moscow and 524 in St Petersburg, according to the independent OVD-Info protest monitoring group. These are the largest protests seen since Putin launched his invasion in February. More than 200 Ukrainian and foreign citizens have been released from Russian captivity, including fighters who led the defence of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, in the biggest prisoner swap since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February. In return, Russia received 55 prisoners from Ukraine, including the former Ukrainian MP Viktor Medvedchuk, an ally of Vladimir Putin accused by Ukraine of high treason. The five Britons released from Russia overnight are meeting their families after several months of captivity in which it was feared they would be executed for fighting for Ukraine. A major diplomatic effort was behind the release of the five Britons, who together with two Americans, a Moroccan, a Croat and a Swedish national, were released by Russia to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. The five Britons have been named. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said the prisoner swap carried out by Russia and Ukraine, involving almost 300 people and mediated by Turkey, was an important step towards ending the war. Erdoğan was quoted as saying that the exchange occurred as a result of the diplomatic traffic he conducted with Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy and Russia’s President Putin. The UK’s ministry of defence has described the mobilisation as an admission that Russia has “exhausted its supply of willing volunteers to fight in Ukraine”. It said “Russia is likely to struggle with the logistical and administrative challenges of even mustering the 300,000 personnel. It will probably attempt to stand up new formations with many of these troops, which are unlikely to be combat effective for months.” Poland has distributed iodine tablets to regional fire departments to give to people in the event of radioactive exposure, after concerns about fighting around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The deputy interior minister, Błażej Poboży, said these were “routine, pre-emptive actions” to protect people in the event of a situation “which I hope will not happen”. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you as we unpack the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has thanked Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his “facilitation” of the release of foreign citizens from Russian captivity. The Russian national airline, Aeroflot, said it would refund people who were unable to fly as planned if they were called up as part of Vladimir Putin’s mobilisation. Russian citizens subject to conscription are entitled to a refund on their plane ticket, the company said in a statement. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has been speaking at the security council meeting, where he said Russia’s war on Ukraine “shows no sign of letting up”. Addressing the UN security council meeting, Guterres said talk of a nuclear conflict was “totally unacceptable”. Any annexation of a state’s territory by another state through the threat or use of force is a violation of the UN charter and international law, he continued. On the subject of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, Guterres described the situation as remaining “of grave concern”. He said: All attacks on nuclear facilities must end and the purely civilian nature of such plants must be reestablished. Any damage to nuclear infrastructure, whether deliberate or not, could have terrible consequences for people around the planet. Guterres welcomed yesterday’s release of prisoners between Russia and Ukraine, describing the prisoner swap as a “welcome development”. Earlier we reported a video circulating on social media reportedly showing a military recruitment officer in Dagestan encountering some resistance from local men. Our Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth has shared a tweet suggesting protests may be taking place in Dagestan against the mobilisation. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said the prisoner swap carried out by Russia and Ukraine, involving almost 300 people and mediated by Turkey, was an important step towards ending the war, Turkish broadcaster NTV has reported. Erdoğan was quoted as telling reporters in New York that the exchange occurred as a result of the diplomatic traffic he conducted with Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy and Russia’s President Putin. “Turkey has now received the result of its belief in the power of dialogue and diplomacy,” he was cited as saying at the end of his visit to the US. “This exchange of prisoners, which took place under the mediation of Turkey, is an important step towards ending the war,” Reuters report he said. “We will continue our efforts to achieve peace and stability in the future. For example, as soon as we return, we will call the leaders again and continue our telephone diplomacy with them,” he added. The Kremlin has been moved to bluntly deny reports by the independent Novaya Gazeta Europe news service that an undisclosed clause in President Vladimir Putin’s decree on partial mobilisation provided for 1 million reservists to be enlisted to fight in Ukraine. [See 13.01] “This is a lie,” the presidential spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told the RIA Novosti news agency. The story hinges on the seventh paragraph in Putin’s decree, which in public versions is redacted and simply marked “for official use”. RIA reports: The seventh point is hidden in the document, which attracted the attention of journalists. As Peskov explained, this paragraph is for official use, so he cannot disclose its content. The spokesperson clarified that it was about the number of conscripts. Earlier today Peskov dismissed reports of an exodus of Russian men of fighting age following Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a partial mobilisation as “exaggerated”. In November 2021, Peskov said reports Russia intended to invade Ukraine were a “hollow and unfounded” invention of the western media. Reuters reports that Poland has distributed iodine tablets to regional fire departments to give to people in the event of radioactive exposure, after concerns about fighting around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Shelling at the site of Zaporizhzhia – Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant – has damaged buildings close to its six reactors and cut power cables, risking a nuclear catastrophe that would affect neighbouring countries. Russia and Ukraine blame each other for the shelling around the plant, which Russia has occupied. “After the media reports about battles near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, we decided ahead of time to take protective action to distribute iodine,” the deputy interior minister, Błażej Poboży, told private broadcaster Radio Zet. “I would like to reassure all citizens that these are routine, pre-emptive actions that are to protect us in the event of a situation which I hope will not happen,” he added. Iodine is considered a way of protecting the body against conditions such as thyroid cancer in case of radioactive exposure. Sweden’s foreign affairs minister, Ann Linde, has condemned the arrests of anti-war protesters in Russia after President Vladimir Putin ordered the country’s first military draft since the second world war. Writing on Twitter, Linde described the demonstrators as “courageous” who had her “deep respect”. The Guardian’s Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth writes that the actual number of reservists called up to support Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine could exceed the 300,000 figure stated by the country’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. A video circulating on social media reportedly shows men outside a military enlistment office in Dagestan challenging Vladimir Putin’s mobilisation. In the video, which has not been independently verified, a military recruitment officer is seen addressing a group of men in the mountainous Caucasus region. The five Britons released from Russia overnight are meeting up with their families after several months of captivity in which it was feared they would be executed for fighting for Ukraine. Shaun Pinner, who was released alongside Aiden Aslin, was pictured with his family in a hotel room this morning by his mother, Debbie Price, who thanked “all the amazing people” who made his release possible. The Presidium Network, a group involved in supporting the rescue of one of the five, said they knew all five had been reunited with close relatives, although they may not have returned home yet. Dominik Byrne, co-founder of Presidium, said: We know they’re safely in the UK and (have) been reunited with their families. A major diplomatic effort was behind the release of the five Britons, who together with two Americans, a Moroccan, Croat and Swede, were released by Russia to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. Saudi Arabia said its mediation effort was led by its crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, who had pulled out of attending the Queen’s funeral because of the ongoing controversy over his alleged role in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. It is unclear if the activity represented an attempt to boost the crown prince’s standing in the UK, but the Saudis were keen to show the former captives were safe in a video and pictures released as they got off the plane last night. Aslin, Pinner and the other three released Britons - John Harding, Andrew Hill and Dylan Healy - had been held by pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk, accused of being mercenaries fighting for Ukraine. Aslin and Pinner, who had joined Ukraine’s army and were captured in Mariupol, were sentenced to death by the court, a ruling that broke the Geneva conventions, which require that prisoners of war are not treated as criminals simply for taking part in fighting. It had been assumed that Russia or the pro-Russia separatists were trying to use the five men as diplomatic leverage. Their release was something of a surprise and came after internet rumours that Aslin and Pinner had been executed. It was also part of a wider prisoner swap deal, in which Russia released five commanders from the Azov steelworks battle, in a mediation involving Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, for pro-Russian oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk and 200 other prisoners in exchange for 55 Russians. Russia typically swaps prisoners on a one-to-one basis, and it had been feared the separatists would put the Azov steel plant defenders from Mariupol on trial. That it has backed away from keeping the prisoners suggests a rare concern for global public opinion on the part of Moscow. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has called on Ukraine’s allies to stand firm against Vladimir Putin’s “blackmail” of nuclear retaliation. Speaking to BFM television following his return from the UN general assembly in New York, Macron said: Our task is to hold our line, that is to say, help Ukraine as we are doing, to protect its territory and never to attack Russia. Russia is “very clearly under pressure” and has decided to “take a step toward escalation” but “we must never get carried away”, Macron added. One million Russian citizens could be called up to fight in the war in Ukraine as part of Vladimir Putin’s mobilisation drive, according to a report by a Russian newspaper. In a televised address to the nation on Wednesday, the Russian president said military service would only apply to “citizens who are currently in the reserve, especially those who have served in the armed forces, have certain military professions and relevant experience”. Shortly after Putin’s announcement, the country’s defence ministry Sergei Shoigu said 300,000 Russians would be called up as part of the mobilisation that would apply to “those with previous military experience”. “These are not people who’ve never seen or heard anything about the army,” he said, adding that students can “keep going to class”. But Novaya Gazeta, an independent Russian newspaper operating in exile, has quoted an unnamed official in Putin’s government as saying that the real plan is to call up 1 million people. The source told the newspaper that a classified seventh paragraph of the decree, signed by Putin on Wednesday, allows the Russian defence ministry to call up 1 million people. The source said: The figure was corrected several times, and in the end, they settled on a million. Traffic at Russian border crossings with Finland and Georgia surged after Vladimir Putin’s partial mobilisation announcement sparked fears that men of fighting age would be called to fight on the frontline in Ukraine. Prices for one-way flights out of Moscow to the nearest foreign locations rose above $5,000 (£4,435), with most air tickets sold out completely for coming days. Photos showed long tailbacks at border crossings with Finland and Russia. The Kremlin has described reports of an exodus of draft-age men from Russia as exaggerated. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has shared photographs of the Ukrainian citizens who have been released by Russia in the largest prisoner exchange since the start of the war. In a post on Telegram, Zelenskiy wrote: Ours. Free. We keep working to return all Ukrainians from Russian captivity. Glory to Ukraine! France will continue to support Ukraine with arms and training, the country’s defence minister, Sébastien Lecornu, said. Speaking after a meeting with his German counterpart, Christine Lambrecht, Lecornu added that France needed cooperation within the Nato alliance to continue its support for Kyiv. Vladimir Putin is “desperate” and “bluffing” with his threats to use nuclear weapons, according to Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko. In his speech yesterday, the Russian president warned that he had “lots of weapons to reply” to what he called western threats on Russian territory and added that he was not bluffing. Speaking to Sky News today, Prystaiko said: When somebody is saying that I’m not bluffing, that’s the first sign that they are actually bluffing. Otherwise, they would do something like prepare the nuclear arsenal. They’re not doing it, which means that he’s trying to find a magic wand which will allow him to get out of the situation because he’s deeply, deeply in trouble. Putin was trying to “intimidate all of us”, Prystaiko said, adding that he didn’t believe it would work. He added: We just believe in the hope that there are some forces around him (Putin) who will be able to tell him that, you know: ‘We are going nowhere, we’re going down and we’re bringing the whole nation with us.’ The Kremlin has dismissed reports of an exodus of Russian men of fighting age following Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a partial mobilisation as “exaggerated”. Flight sales data showed flights from Moscow to the capitals of Georgia, Turkey and Armenia, all destinations that allow Russians to enter without a visa, were sold out within minutes of Putin’s announcement on Wednesday. In his regular briefing with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also declined to deny Russian media reports that some anti-mobilisation protesters detained on Wednesday night had been given draft papers, saying: This is not against the law. Russia’s defence ministry has said 55 of its servicemen have been released in the largest prisoner exchange deal with Ukraine since the start of the war. In a statement, the Kremlin said: All servicemen have been delivered to the territory of the Russian Federation by military transport aircraft and are in medical institutions of Russia’s defence ministry. The fighters, who came from Russia’s armed forces and its proxies in the Russian-backed separatist regions of eastern Ukraine, were currently undergoing health checks, it added. The statement did not mention Viktor Medvedchuk, a former Ukrainian lawmaker and ally of Vladimir Putin accused of high treason. The Russian-installed separatist head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) said Medvedchuk had been freed as part of the deal. Nearly 300 people, including 10 foreigners and Ukrainian fighters who took part in the siege of Mariupol, were involved in the prisoner swap. Presidium Network has confirmed that the five Britons captured by Russian-backed forces have been released and are safely home. The organisation, a UK-based company that says it carries out evacuations of families and individuals from war zones, said: We know that all are back safely in the UK. The five are Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner, John Harding, Dylan Healy and Andrew Hill. The men are all “looking forward to normality with their families after this horrific ordeal”, said Dominik Byrne, co-founder of Presidium. The names of five British nationals released by Russian-backed forces in Ukraine overnight have been confirmed. Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner, John Harding, Dylan Healy and Andrew Hill were flown to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia before being flown back to Britain. They were reunited with their families after landing at Heathrow Airport. On Wednesday, the UK prime minister, Liz Truss, confirmed that five Britons held by pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine had been released after the intervention of Saudi Arabia. Aslin’s MP Robert Jenrick tweeted yesterday that he and “the other British prisoners of war held captive by the Russian authorities” were on their way back to the UK. In a video filmed on a plane with Pinner beside him, Aslin said: We just want to let everybody know we are out of the danger zone. “By the skin of our teeth,” Pinner added, and both men thanked those who had supported them during their detention. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here, taking over the live blog from Martin Belam to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Security forces detained more than 1,300 people in Russia overnight at protests denouncing mobilisation, a rights group said, hours after Vladimir Putin ordered Russia’s first military draft since the second world war. The independent OVD-Info protest monitoring group said that according to information it had collated from 38 Russian cities, more than 1,311 people had been held by late evening. It said those figures included at least 502 in Moscow and 524 in St Petersburg, Russia’s second most populous city. Unsanctioned rallies are illegal under Russia’s anti-protest laws. Russian interior ministry official Irina Volk, in a statement quoted by Russian news agencies, said officers had cut short attempts to stage what it called small protests. “In a number of regions, there were attempts to stage unauthorised actions which brought together an extremely small number of participants,” Volk was quoted as saying. “These were all stopped.” The Moscow Times is carrying a report that a Russian military recruitment office and an administration building were attacked overnight in two separate locations during the anti-mobilisation protests. The UK’s ministry of defence has described the mobilisation as an admission that Russia has “exhausted its supply of willing volunteers to fight in Ukraine”. It said “Russia is likely to struggle with the logistical and administrative challenges of even mustering the 300,000 personnel. It will probably attempt to stand up new formations with many of these troops, which are unlikely to be combat effective for months.” Traffic arriving at Finland’s eastern border with Russia has “intensified” during the night, the Finnish border guard said early on Thursday, while adding that the situation was under control. One-way flights out of Russia were rocketing in price and selling out fast on Wednesday after Putin ordered the immediate call-up of 300,000 reservists. Dmitry Medvedev, former Russian president and prime minister, and currently deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, has threatened attacks on Europe and US, saying “Referendums will be held, and the Donbas republics and other territories will be admitted to Russia. Any Russian weapons, including strategic nuclear weapons and weapons based on new principles, could be used [to protect them]. Therefore, various retired idiots with generals’ stripes do not need to scare us with talk about a Nato strike on Crimea. Hypersonic is guaranteed to be able to reach targets in Europe and the United States much faster.” Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has described Joe Biden’s speech on Wednesday at the UN as “indecent”, and accused the US president of mis-quoting his Russian counterpart over nuclear threats. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, shrugged off Russian moves to escalate the war, saying his country’s forces would continue their counteroffensive, not giving Russia breathing space to mobilise and dig in on Ukrainian soil. “We can return the Ukrainian flag to our entire territory. We can do it with the force of arms, but we need time,” Zelenskiy said in a recorded broadcast to the UN general assembly on Wednesday. Zelenskiy on Thursday thanked Turkey and Saudi Arabia for their roles in recent prisoner exchanges. This included a Briton who was threatened with execution after being captured by Russian forces during the siege of Mariupol, who has been released alongside four other Britons and five international prisoners after the intervention of Saudi Arabia. Aiden Aslin was released alongside the two fighters he was sentenced to death with at a controversial trial in Russian-held eastern Ukraine in June – Shaun Pinner, and a Moroccan named Brahim Saadoun. The general staff of the Ukraine army has issued updated figures of the losses it claims to have inflicted on Russia and pro-Russia forces within occupied areas of Ukraine, raising it to ~55,510. On Wednesday, Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, spoke of losses amounting to just under 6,000 personnel during what he termed Russia’s “special military operation”. North Korea has denied it is providing arms to Russia, state media said, weeks after the US said Moscow was turning to Pyongyang to replenish its stocks depleted by invading Ukraine. Uzbekistan’s state prosecutors warned citizens against joining foreign armies after Russia offered fast-track citizenship to those who sign up and Ukraine said it had captured Uzbeks fighting alongside Russians. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog agency said on Wednesday he had met Ukraine’s and Russia’s foreign ministers in a bid to establish a safety and security zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you for the next few hours. The British prime minister, Liz Truss, has just tweeted: “We will not rest until Ukraine prevails” alongside the full text of her speech to the UN general assembly yesterday, during which she said: No one is threatening Russia. Yet we meet here this evening… In Ukraine, barbarous weapons are being used to kill and maim people, rape is being used as an instrument of war, families are being torn apart. And this morning we have seen Putin trying to justify his catastrophic failures. He is doubling down by sending even more reservists to a terrible fate. He is desperately trying to claim the mantle of democracy for a regime without human rights or freedoms. And he is making yet more bogus claims and sabre-rattling threats. This will not work. The international alliance is strong and Ukraine is strong. The contrast between Russia’s conduct and Ukraine’s brave, dignified first lady, Olena Zelenska, who is here at the UN today, could not be more stark. The Ukrainians are not just defending their own country – they are defending our values and the security of the whole world. The general staff of the Ukraine army has issued updated figures of the losses it claims to have inflicted on Russia and pro-Russia forces within occupied areas of Ukraine. It has raised the casualty count by 400 personnel in the last 24 hours, taking it to a total of ~55,510. Yesterday Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, spoke of losses amounting to just under 6,000 personnel during what he termed Russia’s “special military operation”. The Ukraine figure likely includes forces fighting for the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic, who would not be expected to be counted in any official figure of Russian losses. Nevertheless, the two claimed figures – 55,510 and 5,937 – are some magnitudes apart. Neither figure has been independently verified. Dmitry Medvedev, former Russian president and prime minister, and currently deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, has issued another Telegram message containing his typically hawkish rhetoric. He says: Referendums will be held, and the Donbas republics and other territories will be admitted to Russia. The protection of all the territories that have joined will be significantly strengthened by the Russian armed forces. Russia announced that not only mobilisation capabilities, but also any Russian weapons, including strategic nuclear weapons and weapons based on new principles, could be used for such protection. Therefore, various retired idiots with generals’ stripes do not need to scare us with talk about a Nato strike on Crimea. Hypersonic is guaranteed to be able to reach targets in Europe and the United States much faster. But the western establishment, in general, all citizens of the Nato countries need to understand that Russia has chosen its own path. There is no way back. The Moscow Times is this morning carrying a report that a Russian military recruitment office and an administration building were attacked overnight in two separate locations during anti-mobilisation protests. Citing local news sources, it reports: In the city of Nizhny Novgorod 440km east of Moscow, a molotov cocktail attack started a small fire at a local enlistment building, according to the local nn.ru news website. A slightly larger fire broke out at a local administration building in Tolyatti, a city located 1,000km east of Moscow. The city’s news website nesluhi.info reported, citing emergency officials, that the molotov cocktail attack burned down the administration’s entrance. The Moscow Times reports it is not known if there were any arrests or injuries as a result of the apparent attacks. Telegram channel Mash posted pictures which it claims showed the damage to the building in Nizhny Novgorod. The claims have not been verified directly by the Guardian. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted to Telegram to thank Turkey and Saudi Arabia for their role in the recent prisoner release. Ukraine’s president writes: Ukraine returned 215 heroes from Russian captivity. We greatly appreciate the contribution of everyone involved in rescuing the defenders and will never forget it. Many thanks to the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, for leading this process. We agreed that the five released commanders of Azov will be in comfortable conditions in Turkey until the end of the war and will be able to see their families. Also, as a sign of gratitude for the help to our country, Ukraine freed from Russian captivity five citizens of Great Britain, two citizens of the USA, citizens of Morocco, Sweden, and Croatia. Thank you for your support Saudi Arabia. We remember all those who are in Russian captivity, and we will do everything for their rescue. Since Vladimir Putin announced the partial mobilisation of Russia yesterday, according to the OVD-Info monitoring group more than 1,300 people have been arrested in 38 different Russian cities. These are the largest protests seen since Putin launched his invasion in February. Agence France-Presse journalists in central Moscow report they saw at least 50 people detained by police in riot gear, while in the former imperial capital St Petersburg, police surrounded and detained a small group of protesters, loading them onto a bus as they chanted: “No mobilization!” “Everyone is scared. I am for peace and I don’t want to have to shoot,” AFP reports protester Vasily Fedorov, a student wearing a pacifist symbol on his chest, said. Here is a video clip of some of the scenes from the streets of Russia overnight. Traffic arriving at Finland’s eastern border with Russia has “intensified” during the night, the Finnish border guard said early on Thursday, while adding that the situation was under control. Reuters reports that Finnish border guard’s head of international affairs, Matti Pitkaniitty, said: “The number clearly has picked up.” “It is an exceptional number in the sense that it clearly is busier,” he said, adding that the situation was under control and border guards were ready at nine checkpoints. Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who is chair of the House of Commons defence committee in the British parliament, has been interviewed on Sky News this morning in the UK. He has been a strong proponent of more direct action and support from Nato for Ukraine, since Russia’s latest invasion began. He told viewers: I think our leaders are now recognising where this is all going and we need to step back and ask ourselves the fundamental security question that I pose ever more regularly. Is the world likely to become more dangerous or less over the next few years? I think the answer is clearly the former. This is not just about Ukraine, but the emergence of a new alliance with Russia, China, and other authoritarian states challenging the status quo that we’ve enjoyed since the end of the cold war. So our actions now, in how we handle Ukraine, given the conflict has now moved into a darker chapter, will determine I think how the next decade plays. He said: We’re involved in an economic war with Russia over oil, over gas, over energy. We’re training Ukrainians to fight, we’re arming them with other sophisticated weapons. We’re involved in a political war with Russia. We need to recognise that we need to move to a war footing, and how we protect our energy supplies, how we develop greater resilience to thwart expected grey zone attacks, how we procure and replace weapons systems that we’ve gifted – our cupboards are almost empty – and how we better assist vulnerable states such as such as Moldova. Specifically on the issue of the use of nuclear weapons, Ellwood expressed concern that Nato did not have a properly formulated doctrine, saying: We need to recognise we need to have proportionate responses if nuclear weapons are used, or indeed chemical weapons. We need robust protocols in place in case a tactical low yield nuclear weapon is used. When I visited Nato I asked this very question, and there wasn’t an answer. We need to be very, very clear if Putin steps over this threshold what the west will do. Kirill Stremousov, part of the Russian-imposed administration in occupied Kherson, has posted to Telegram ahead of the planned referendum in the region at the weekend. He has said: Residents of the Kherson region expect real statehood from Russia. After all, in recent years Ukraine has been turned into a colony according to the principles of the tribal system. Nazism was literally brought to the inhabitants of Ukraine in the open, we were forbidden to speak our native Russian language, “history” was being rewritten before our very eyes. We want the development of our Kherson region, and not allow our region to be robbed by “our European partners”. Residents of the Kherson region deserve respect and development opportunities. And this can only be done with Russia, but it will be a completely different story, country ... Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. Vitaliy Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, has posted a lengthy status update to Telegram detailing damage from a large number of strikes across the region. He says in the city of Mykolaiv itself “massive rocket fire” just after midnight led to “multi-story buildings were damaged, windows were broken, gas pipelines, water pipes, cinema and theatre courtyards, administrative buildings were damaged.” However, there appear to be no casualties or deaths as a result of the strikes. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has, according to Russia’s RIA news agency, described Joe Biden’s speech at the UN as “indecent”, and accused the US president of mis-quoting his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. RIA quotes Zakharova saying: As for the speech of the president of the United States, I consider it absolutely indecent how it began. Indecent not because they have nothing to do or they do not have the right to touch other countries. The fact is that he allegedly started quoting the president of Russia. We, as we always do, began to double-check Biden’s words. Biden said it for sure, but the president of Russia did not say that. She described the way that Putin’s words were being portrayed by Biden and the US media as “absolutely propaganda” and “contrary to what was actually said”. Here is how Joe Biden opened his speech in the UN, saying: Let us speak plainly. A permanent member of the United Nations security council invaded its neighbour, attempted to erase a sovereign state from the map. Russia has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations charter – no more important than the clear prohibition against countries taking the territory of their neighbour by force. Again, just today, President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the non-proliferation regime. Later in his speech he also said: Russia shunned the non-proliferation ideals embraced by every other nation at the 10th NPT review conference. And again, today, as I said, they’re making irresponsible nuclear threats to use nuclear weapons. Here is the passage, in translation, from Vladimir Putin’s speech on Tuesday where he mentioned nuclear blackmail and nuclear weapons: Nuclear blackmail was also launched. We are talking not only about the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is encouraged by the west, which threatens a nuclear catastrophe, but also about the statements of some high-ranking representatives of the leading Nato states about the possibility and admissibility of using weapons of mass destruction against Russia – nuclear weapons. For those who allow themselves to make such statements about Russia, I would like to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction, and for some components more modern than those of the Nato countries. And if the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal to protect Russia and our people. This is not a bluff. And those who try to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the weathervane can turn and point towards them. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink, has said her thoughts are with the recently released prisoners of war and their families. She tweeted: My thoughts this morning are with the released POWs, and with their loved ones. Thank you to President Zelenskiy and his team for including all prisoners of war, including two US citizens, who will be reunited with their families, in negotiations. Alexander Drueke and Andy Tai Huynh, both US military veterans from Alabama who had volunteered to fight, were released yesterday. Drueke’s aunt, Dianna Shaw, said the two men were “safely in the custody of the US embassy in Saudi Arabia and after medical checks and debriefing they will return to the states”. The UK’s ministry of defence has issued its daily intelligence briefing about how it sees the situation in Ukraine. It has concentrated today on the consequences of Russia’s partial mobilisation announced yesterday by Vladimir Putin, which it judges unlikely to be effective. It writes: Russia is likely to struggle with the logistical and administrative challenges of even mustering the 300,000 personnel. It will probably attempt to stand up new formations with many of these troops, which are unlikely to be combat effective for months. Even this limited mobilisation is likely to be highly unpopular with parts of the Russian population. Putin is accepting considerable political risk in the hope of generating much needed combat power. The move is effectively an admission that Russia has exhausted its supply of willing volunteers to fight in Ukraine. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

Those fighting in military conflicts abroad faced criminal prosecution under Uzbek law, the Central Asian nation’s Prosecutor General’s office said in a statement late on Wednesday. A video circulated in Ukrainian social media this month showed two Uzbeks captured in fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces; the detainees said they had been recruited in Moscow. Hundreds of thousands of Uzbeks live in or regularly travel to Russia to find work and provide for their families at home; some work illegally and risk being deported. Russia’s parliament passed a law this week offering fast-track citizenship to foreigners who join its army, part of a broader drive to strengthen the military amid the stalled Ukrainian campaign which also included partial mobilisation. Russia is set to face direct pressure at the United Nations on Thursday over its invasion of Ukraine, whose leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy has appealed to the world to punish Moscow. Agence France-Presse reports. As global leaders convened for the annual general assembly, the security council will hold a special session among foreign ministers called by France on impunity for rights abuses in Ukraine. The morning session is expected to bring Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov face to face with top western diplomats including secretary of state Antony Blinken, who has refused a one-on-one meeting since the 24 February invasion. After two years of pandemic restrictions, only one leader was still allowed to address the assembly virtually – Zelenskiy, who in a pre-recorded video called 15 times for “punishment” of Russia and received a rare standing ovation. The partial mobilisation announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin will not generate significant extra combat capability for months, the Institute for the Study of War writes in its latest report. The thinktank’s analysts also believe Putin comments about nuclear weapons did not mean he would use them to defend annexed areas of Ukraine. Putin’s order to mobilize part of Russia’s “trained” reserve, that is, individuals who have completed their mandatory conscript service, will not generate significant usable Russian combat power for months. It may suffice to sustain the current levels of Russian military manpower in 2023 by offsetting Russian casualties, although even that is not yet clear. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog agency said Wednesday he met with Ukraine’s and Russia’s foreign ministers in a bid to establish a safety and security zone around a nuclear plant in south-eastern Ukraine that is Europe’s largest, AP reports. The Zaporizhzhia power plant has faced almost daily shelling and bombardment, raising fears of a nuclear accident. Rafael Grossi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said that as a result of the separate meetings with Ukraine’s Dmytro Kuleba and Russia’s Sergey Lavrov, work has already begun on establishing and shaping the zone. He said he hopes to visit Kyiv soon, and “perhaps later on” go to Russia. “Given the urgency of the situation and the gravity of what’s going on in the field we have to move fast,” Grossi said. Both nations, he said, share “a conviction that the establishment of the zone is indispensable.” “The mere fact that the two foreign ministers are sitting down with me and are listening to our ideas, I think it’s a good indicator that there is a very strong solid base for this thing to happen,” he said. North Korea has denied it is providing arms to Russia, state media said, weeks after the US said Moscow was turning to Pyongyang to replenish its stocks depleted by invading Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reports. We have never exported weapons or ammunition to Russia before and we will not plan to export them,” an official at the defence ministry’s General Bureau of Equipment said in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). The statement comes after the White House said earlier in September that Russia was buying artillery shells and rockets from communist North Korea to support its war in Ukraine. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the US believed purchases “could include literally millions of rounds, rockets and artillery shells.” Liz Truss has dismissed as “sabre-rattling” Vladimir Putin’s warning that Russia will use “all the means at our disposal” to protect itself, warning in her UN speech: “This will not work.” The Russian president’s threats in a televised address to the nation appeared to suggest the conflict in Ukraine could spiral into a nuclear crisis, prompting a furious response from world leaders, led by the US president, Joe Biden. The new UK prime minister, who addressed the UN in New York hours after a virtual speech by the Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged world leaders not to “let up” on dealing with Putin despite domestic concerns about soaring energy prices. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has shrugged off Russian moves to escalate the war, saying his country’s forces would continue their counteroffensive, not giving Russia breathing space to mobilise and dig in on Ukrainian soil. “We can return the Ukrainian flag to our entire territory. We can do it with the force of arms, but we need time,” Zelenskiy said in a recorded broadcast to the UN general assembly on Wednesday, which Russia had tried to stop but was overwhelmingly voted down by member states. “Russia wants to spend the winter on the occupied territory of Ukraine … It wants to prepare fortifications on occupied land and carry out military mobilisation at home. We cannot agree to a delayed war because it will be even hotter than the war now.” Zelenskiy laid out what he said were five non-negotiable conditions for peace. These included punishment for Russian aggression, restoration of Ukraine’s security and territorial integrity, and security guarantees. A crime has been committed against Ukraine, and we demand just punishment,” Zelenskiy told the UN body. “A special tribunal should be created to punish Russia for the crime of aggression against our state... Russia should pay for this war with its assets,” the Ukrainian president said, urging the UN to “remove the right of veto” from Russia as a Security Council member. Zelenskiy reminded world leaders of the mass graves being exhumed in the recently liberated town of Izium as the general assembly gathered, saying that among the bodies was a man strangled with a rope, and another who had been castrated before the murder. The Ukrainian president said that was not the first of such atrocities. He told the global assembly: “Ask, please, the representatives of Russia why the Russian military are so obsessed with castration. What was done to them so that they want to do this to others?” Security forces detained more than 1,300 people in Russia on Wednesday at protests denouncing mobilisation, a rights group said, hours after President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia’s first military draft since the second world war. The independent OVD-Info protest monitoring group said that according to information it had collated from 38 Russian cities, more than 1,311 people had been held by late evening. EU foreign ministers have agreed to prepare new sanctions on Russia and increase weapons’ deliveries to Kyiv, Reuters reports. The bloc’s 27 foreign ministers are in New York for the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Vladimir Putin’s announcement of partial mobilisation – which included moves to annex swaths of Ukrainian territory and a threat to use nuclear weapons to defend Russia – showed panic and desperation. “It’s clear that Putin is trying to destroy Ukraine,” Borrell told reporters after ministers met to decide how to respond. After being briefed by Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba, the ministers agreed to task their teams to prepare an eighth sanctions package that would target “more relevant sectors of the Russian economy and continue targeting people responsible for the war of aggression in Ukraine,” Borrell said. EU ministers will hold their next formal meeting in mid-October when a sanctions package could be formalised. The ministers also agreed to ramp up weapons supplies to Ukraine. Borrell declined to give further details on the type of sanctions or military support, but said he believed there would be “unanimous” support within the bloc for new measures. Ukraine has announced that 215 Ukrainian and foreign citizens have been released by Russia in a prisoner exchange, including fighters who led the defence of Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks that became an icon of Ukrainian resistance. Russia received 55 prisoners including Viktor Medvedchuk, a former Ukrainian lawmaker and ally of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, accused of high treason, the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his daily address. Medvedchuk was arrested in April, after escaping house arrest on treason charges days after the Russian invasion. At the time, Zelenskiy suggested exchanging him for Ukrainian prisoners of war held by Russia but the Kremlin rejected the offer. There was never any doubt Russia would respond to its latest military setbacks, the Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, writes in his latest analysis. It was inevitable, after Russia’s sudden military reverse near Kharkiv, that Vladimir Putin would respond, announcing a partial mobilisation of extra troops and a fresh bout of sabre-rattling on nuclear weapons a day after announcing plans to hold high-speed annexation referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine. The timing, on the morning of Joe Biden’s speech to the UN general assembly aimed at rallying support for Ukraine, demonstrates that, to some extent, Putin’s announcements are about news management – to seize the agenda with tenuous claims that Russia is threatened by Nato “nuclear blackmail”. You can read the full report here: Good morning and welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As the war dominated the first in-person UN general assembly meeting in two years, EU foreign ministers agreed on new sanctions on Russia, a major prisoner swap was announced and more than 1,300 Russians were arrested for demonstrating against Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a partial mobilisation. Here are the latest developments, as of 7.30am Kyiv time: European Union foreign ministers agreed on Wednesday to prepare new sanctions on Russia and increase weapons’ deliveries to Kyiv after President Vladimir Putin ordered the country’s first wartime mobilisation since the second world war. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Putin’s announcement – which included moves to annex swaths of Ukrainian territory and a threat to use nuclear weapons to defend Russia – showed panic and desperation. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on the international community to adopt a five-point formula to achieve peace and security in Ukraine, in a wide-ranging and impassioned televised speech to the UN general assembly on Wednesday. The points include punishment for crimes of aggression, protection of life, restoration of security and territorial integrity, security guarantees and the determination of Ukraine to continue defending itself. Joe Biden and allied leaders have reacted angrily to Vladimir Putin’s threats to use nuclear weapons and pledged to maintain support for Ukraine. In his speech to the UN on Wednesday, Biden sought to unite the international community in the face of what he called “reckless” threats and “an extremely significant violation” of the UN charter. More than 1,300 protesters have been arrested in anti-mobilisation rallies that are taking place throughout Russia. According to OVD-Info, more than 1,311 people have been detained in 38 cities across Russia, with most of the detainees in Moscow and St Petersburg. North Korea has said it has never supplied weapons or ammunition to Russia and does not plan to do so in the future, according to a statement released by the state media service, KCNA. Russia has released 215 Ukrainians it took prisoner after a protracted battle for the port city of Mariupol earlier this year, including top military leaders, a senior official in Kyiv said. The freed Ukrainians included the commander and deputy commander of the Azov battalion that did much of the fighting, said Andriy Yermak, the head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office. Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of Russian-occupied Melitipol in Ukraine, has urged local men to evacuate the city amid mobilisation orders from Russia, the Kyiv Independent reports. Finland said it was working on a federal strategy to “limit or completely prevent” tourism from Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. “This national solution may include new legislation, which would be adopted very quickly,” the foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, told a press conference on Wednesday. Five British nationals held by pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine have been safely returned, the UK prime minister, Liz Truss, has said. Among those released was Aiden Aslin, a British-Ukrainian former care worker from Nottinghamshire. The Saudi foreign ministry said Russia had released 10 foreign prisoners of war captured in Ukraine after mediation by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. US citizens Alexander Drueke and Andy Tai Ngoc Huynh were among those released. Joe Biden has denounced Vladimir Putin’s threats to use nuclear weapons as “reckless” and “irresponsible” and called Russia’s planned annexation of more regions of Ukraine as “an extremely significant violation” of the UN charter. The US president was speaking to the UN general assembly, where he sought to galvanise the outrage of UN member states at the threat that Putin’s actions and “imperial ambitions” posed to the UN’s founding values. Earlier on Wednesday, Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation in Russia in a significant escalation that places the country’s people and economy on a wartime footing and sent shock waves across Russia. The Russian president said in a televised address that the “partial mobilisation” was a direct response to the dangers posed by the west. According to the decree, the contracts of soldiers fighting in Ukraine will also be extended until the end of the partial mobilisation period. Liz Truss and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said Putin’s speech on Wednesday was “a statement of weakness”. They said in a joint statement following a meeting between the pair in New York that Putin’s calls for partial mobilisation were “a sign that Russia’s invasion is failing”. Russia fired a series of long-range missiles at Ukraine’s second city Kharkiv early on Wednesday, hours after the Kremlin announced plans to annex Ukrainian territory and to carry out the partial mobilisation. Explosions were heard across Kharkiv at around 2am. At least one missile struck a high-rise apartment in the western Zalutino district. Ten residents were injured. The security service of Ukraine has released a recording of an intercepted call by a Russian soldier in which he appears to complain about the setbacks faced by Russian troops in recent months. “Locals hate us here. Ours rape local women,” the soldier appeared to say into the phone, adding there was little to no chance of him returning home anytime soon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2020/nov/19/edf-confirms-hinkley-point-b-to-be-shutdown-earlier-than-planned","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-19T19:10:32Z","webTitle":"EDF confirms Hinkley Point B to be shut down earlier than planned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/19/edf-confirms-hinkley-point-b-to-be-shutdown-earlier-than-planned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2020/nov/19/edf-confirms-hinkley-point-b-to-be-shutdown-earlier-than-planned","fields":{"headline":"EDF confirms Hinkley Point B to be shut down earlier than planned","bodyText":"EDF Energy has confirmed it will begin shutting down the 45-year-old reactors at Hinkley Point B nuclear power plant in Somerset within the next two years, earlier than scheduled. The “defuelling” will begin no later than July 2022, according to the French energy group. The shutdown was scheduled for 2023, but cracks were discovered in the graphite core of the reactor. Matt Sykes, the managing director of EDF Generation, said an inspection of Hinkley Point B’s graphite blocks revealed they were “in exactly the sort of condition” expected after 40 years of generating electricity. The power plant, which has been Britain’s most productive and whose operational life was extended, is offline for further inspections and is scheduled to return to service next year, pending approval from Britain’s nuclear safety watchdog. “As a responsible operator we feel it is now the right thing to do to give clarity to our staff, partners and community about the future life of the station,” Sykes said. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the UK’s Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), said the Hinkley Point B shutdown was “a reminder of the urgency of investing in new nuclear capacity to hit net zero”. EDF had expected the shutdown to take place after the start-up of Hinkley Point C, the first new nuclear power plant being built in the UK in a generation, which was originally due to begin generating electricity “well before 2020”. However, the scheduled start date has been delayed to between 2025 and 2026 owing to slow progress in agreeing with the government a guaranteed price for the electricity produced. Greatrex said: “Hinkley Point B has produced more clean electricity and saved more emissions, 105m tonnes, than any other single power station in British history. It can only be replaced by new nuclear stations that produce the same reliable, always-on, emissions-free power that Hinkley has provided for more than 40 years.” Boris Johnson’s 10-point climate plan, which was revealed on Tuesday, promised to advance large-scale nuclear projects and the developments of so-called “mini nuclear reactors” with a £525m support package. But the plan failed to give the greenlight to EDF Energy’s planned followup to the Hinkley Point C project at the Sizewell site, which the firm hopes to build alongside a Chinese nuclear company. The NIA said it hoped the government provided a clear path towards new nuclear capacity in an energy white paper, which is expected before Christmas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/apr/04/coalition-tries-for-third-time-to-let-renewable-energy-agency-fund-technologies-using-fossil-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-04T06:18:51Z","webTitle":"Coalition tries for third time to let renewable energy agency fund technologies using fossil fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/04/coalition-tries-for-third-time-to-let-renewable-energy-agency-fund-technologies-using-fossil-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/apr/04/coalition-tries-for-third-time-to-let-renewable-energy-agency-fund-technologies-using-fossil-fuels","fields":{"headline":"Coalition tries for third time to let renewable energy agency fund technologies using fossil fuels","bodyText":"The Morrison government has launched a third attempt to change the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) to allow it to fund a broader range of technologies, including some using fossil fuels. The Senate has twice in the past year used a disallowance motion to block new regulations introduced by the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, to expand Arena’s remit to include backing technologies such as hydrogen made with gas and carbon capture and storage (CCS). The most recent disallowance motion passed last Monday. It was moved by the outgoing Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells in her role as the chair of the standing committee for the scrutiny of delegated legislation. Fierravanti-Wells told the Senate the expansion of Arena’s remit was not consistent with what the parliament envisaged when it passed the laws creating the renewable energy agency. Labor, Greens and some crossbenchers opposed the expansion on the grounds a renewable energy agency should not fund fossil fuel developments. On Friday, with parliament having risen until after the upcoming election, Taylor released a new set of regulations to govern Arena. It will apply unless blocked by the Senate of the next parliament. Senate estimates heard on Monday that the new regulations would allow Arena to fund a larger range of technologies than the version disallowed last week. That version was explicitly tied to priority areas under the Coalition’s low-emissions technology roadmap. The latest version says Arena will be able to fund clean energy technologies as defined by the board of a separate government agency, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC). This created some confusion as CEFC, which is sometimes described as the national “green bank”, is banned from funding CCS and nuclear projects. Estimates heard Arena would not be subject to the same ban. Officials said nuclear power faced other prohibitions, but the new regulations could allow Arena to fund developments that use CCS such as the development of “blue” hydrogen made with gas. They could also let the agency back low-emissions transport, cement, steel and aluminium developments and carbon capture and utilisation projects. Through a spokesperson, Taylor said the government was committed to ensuring its agencies could “support the full range of technologies that will reduce emissions”. “These changes are supported by a broad cross section of peak bodies and industry groups,” the spokesperson said. “In this term of parliament, Labor has joined with the Greens to oppose more funding for these agencies and a broader technology mandate. They’ve gone against the advice of expert bodies like the International Energy Agency and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, who call for an ‘all of the above’ approach to reducing emissions.” Labor’s climate change and energy spokesperson, Chris Bowen, criticised Taylor’s attempt to redraw the new regulations. “The only thing that will stop this bloke’s attacks on cheaper and cleaner energy is a change of government,” he said. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the new regulation was a blatant attempt to “undermine the renewable energy agency”. “These regulations won’t last,” he said. “Sneakily acting after parliament has risen might buy the Liberals a few weeks, but we’ve defeated them before and – after we kick the Liberals out at the election – we will defeat them again.” Estimates heard Arena could already fund a range of technologies beyond solar and wind power before the change. They included bioenergy, battery storage, hydro power, pumped hydro, demand storage, green hydrogen made using renewable energy, geothermal and ocean energy. Referring to previously proposed regulations, industry group the Smart Energy Council has previously said it would launch legal action to challenge the broadening of Arena’s remit if it was not disallowed in the Senate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jul/28/joe-biden-climate-deal-senate","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T18:32:03Z","webTitle":"Joe Biden hails Senate deal as ‘most significant’ US climate legislation ever","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/28/joe-biden-climate-deal-senate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jul/28/joe-biden-climate-deal-senate","fields":{"headline":"Joe Biden hails Senate deal as ‘most significant’ US climate legislation ever","bodyText":"Joe Biden has hailed a congressional deal that represents the biggest single climate investment in US history – and hands him a badly needed political victory. In a stunning reversal, Senate Democrats on Wednesday announced an expansive $739bn package that had eluded them for months addressing healthcare and the climate crisis, raising taxes on high earners and corporations and reducing federal debt. The president said on Thursday: “This bill would be the most signification legislation in history to tackle the climate crisis and improve our energy security right away.” Biden, who has faced soaring gas prices that have helped drive inflation to 40-year highs, said experts agreed that the bill would help address the problem and urged Congress to pass it. “With this legislation, we’re facing up to some of our biggest problems and we’re taking a giant step forward as a nation … This bill is far from perfect, it’s a compromise, but that’s often how progress is made: by compromises.” The deal, struck between the majority leader, Chuck Schumer, and longtime holdout Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, would invest $369bn over the decade in climate change-fighting strategies including investments in renewable energy production and tax rebates for consumers to buy new or used electric vehicles. It includes $60bn for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and $30bn for a production tax credit for wind and solar, seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country’s dependence on fossil fuels. At Manchin’s insistence, $306bn is earmarked for debt reduction. The package, called the Inflation Reduction Act, would cut US emissions 40% by 2030, a summary released by Schumer’s office said, and earned praise from clean-energy advocates and Democratic party elders. Barack Obama, the former president, tweeted: “I’m grateful to President Biden and those in Congress – Democrat or Republican – who are working to deliver for the American people. Progress doesn’t always happen all at once, but it does happen – and this is what it looks like.” Al Gore, an ex-vice-president whose 2006 documentary film An Inconvenient Truth helped raise awareness of the climate crisis, wrote on Twitter: “The Inflation Reduction Act has the potential to be a historic turning point. It represents the single largest investment in climate solutions &amp; environmental justice in US history. Decades of tireless work by climate advocates across the country led to this moment.” Another component of the package would allow Medicare, the government-run healthcare programme for the elderly and disabled, to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, saving the federal government $288bn over the 10-year budget window. The Manchin-Schumer measure is substantially smaller than the $3.5tn Build Back Better spending bill that Biden asked Democrats to push through Congress last year. But it gave him a political win when he most needed it. His administration has been assailed by a cascade of setbacks including the war in Ukraine, a series of conservative supreme court rulings, soaring inflation and, on Thursday, a GDP report that showed gross domestic product shrank for the second consecutive quarter this year. This backdrop has left the president struggling with low job approval ratings and ebbing support from his own party. A CNN poll this week found that 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters want the party to nominate someone other than him in the 2024 election. But the surprise Senate deal, coming on the same day that the Senate passed legislation boosting domestic production of computer chips and Biden completed his recovery from a coronavirus infection, gave a glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel. John Zogby, an author and pollster, said there had already been signs that the president’s approval rating was improving. “This could very well be the critical win. First of all, it’s coming in the context of a few other wins: the manufacturing bill is another and, at the same time, there’s a sense the gas prices are going down. It’s an important piece of Build Back Better and it looks like it can happen. This could lift expectations.” The deal is a boost for Democrats ahead of midterm elections on 8 November that will determine control of Congress. Zogby added: “Democrats can go back to voters and say, ‘Look, we accomplished something. It may not have been what you wanted but here’s our first real accomplishment on climate change.’” Jonathan Kott, a former communications director for Manchin, told the MSNBC network: “Democrats really need to seize on this moment and tell this story, scream it at the top of their lungs. If this was Donald Trump, he’d be out there having press conferences in the Rose Garden all over the country. We should be doing the same thing.” The deal marked a dramatic U-turn by Manchin, a conservative Democrat and the swing vote in the evenly divided Senate, who has received more donations from oil and gas companies than any other legislator in recent years. Earlier this month he drew fierce condemnation from climate activists for apparently scuttling Biden’s spending plans, claiming that he was concerned about inflation. On Wednesday Manchin, who aimed to preserve federal oil and gas leasing projects and natural gas pipelines during months of talks, said the bill will invest in hydrogen, nuclear power, renewables, fossil fuels and energy storage. “This bill does not arbitrarily shut off our abundant fossil fuels.” Democrats hope to pass the bill by a simple majority in the Senate. Schumer told colleagues on Thursday that they now have an opportunity to achieve two “hugely important” priorities on healthcare and climate change, the Associated Press reported, but warned that final passage will be hard. It remains unclear whether Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who like Manchin has been a perennial thorn in Biden’s side, will vote in favour. There is also sure to be staunch opposition from Republicans. Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said in a statement the legislation would be “devastating to American families and small businesses. Raising taxes on job creators, crushing energy producers with new regulations, and stifling innovators looking for new cures will only make this recession worse, not better.” The bill must also pass the House of Representatives, where Democrats have a razor-thin majority, and be signed by Biden."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/commentisfree/2022/sep/12/reasons-for-cautious-optimism-the-good-news-on-the-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-11T17:30:37Z","webTitle":"Reasons for (cautious) optimism: the good news on the climate crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2022/sep/12/reasons-for-cautious-optimism-the-good-news-on-the-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/commentisfree/2022/sep/12/reasons-for-cautious-optimism-the-good-news-on-the-climate-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Reasons for (cautious) optimism: the good news on the climate crisis","bodyText":"There is no shortage of things to say about what’s going wrong. The extent of damage caused at 1.2C of global heating since pre-industrial levels is proving greater than was forecast by climate scientists not that long ago. As discussed last week, the disastrous toll of the historic flooding in Pakistan and heatwaves and droughts across the northern hemisphere summer appear signs of escalation. A peer-reviewed study found several disastrous climate tipping points, including the collapse of Greenland’s ice cap and Gulf Stream currents in the Atlantic Ocean, may now be unavoidable. But there is also evidence that action to combat the climate crisis is belatedly accelerating. Acknowledging that every fraction of a degree of global heating avoided makes a difference, here are some things to be positive about. Falling emissions in China While Australia’s emissions increased in the most recent data, China – the world’s biggest annual carbon polluter – recorded an 8% fall in the June quarter and a 3% cut year-on-year. As reported by analyst Lauri Myllyvirta in Carbon Brief, the drop compared with the same period in 2021 was 230m tonnes – equivalent to nearly half Australia’s annual emissions, and the largest cut in Chinese carbon pollution in at least a decade. It was driven by both short and long-term trends: a real-estate slump, Covid-related restrictions, weak growth in electricity use and continued renewable energy expansion. It is too early to say whether this is a permanent decline – a recently announced stimulus package may encourage construction and both clean and dirty energy use – but it is the fourth straight quarter in which pollution has fallen. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning For all the talk that China is continuing to build coal-fired power plants, electricity generation from burning the dirty fuel was down by 4% in the first six months of the year. As with most types of infrastructure, the country is building more coal capacity than it needs. This could yet be reversed, at least temporarily – coal-fired power has rebounded in recent weeks as hydro capacity slumped due to extreme drought and heat, and China’s commitment to the UN is that its emissions will peak before 2030. Renewable energy – particularly solar – is happening A report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) found more people are now employed in clean energy (which it defined as including renewable energy, electric vehicles, energy efficiency measures and nuclear power) than the fossil fuel industry. One small problem: clean energy jobs are not as well paid, in part because they are less likely to be unionised. But the argument that there are no jobs in clean energy has dissipated. Clean energy investment has grown by 12% a year since 2020, in part due to the rise of public and private support for sustainable finance, especially in wealthy countries. Renewable energy, new grids and energy storage account for more than 80% of total power sector investment. The IEA estimates spending on solar, batteries and EVs is now growing at a rate consistent with reaching global net zero emissions by 2050. In Europe, where Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has upturned the energy supply, there has been a significant swing towards renewable energy even while countries offer short-term support for fossil fuels to keep lights and heating on. The British thinktank Ember found a record northern summer of solar generation meant the continent was able to avoid spending €29bn($A43bn) on gas. Across the EU’s 27 countries, renewable energy provided 35% of electricity, compared to 16% from coal. According to an analysis by Bloomberg NEF, manufacturing of solar polysilicon – the semiconductor used in photovoltaic panels – is happening so rapidly that the entire supply chain needed to bring emissions to a halt is already under construction. It’s nearly all in China – just one of many potential complications outlined by Bloomberg’s David Fickling – but it says something about what is achievable. The rich are finally starting to step up (in some ways) There has been no agreement at UN climate talks on the rich paying up to help the developing world deal with the unavoidable loss and damage caused by global emissions, but the wealthy are finally moving to drive a clean energy transition in some of the countries that will matter. The goal is pretty simple – to give major rising emitters the financial and other support needed so their economic expansion steers away from fossil fuels. A template deal was announced at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, when South Africa signed a partnership Germany, the UK, the US, and the EU that promises $US8.5bn of global capital over the next three-to-five years as the country restructures its coal-dependent energy system. In June, the G7 confirmed a larger goal – to access up to $US600bn in public and private finance over five years for clean energy infrastructure in countries including Indonesia, India, Senegal and Vietnam. Along with other steps, such as G20 countries promising to stop financing new coal power overseas and the Asian Development Bank’s energy transition mechanism, it could re-draw what is possible. Ensuring local communities are not exploited or left behind in the process will be vital for its success. The US landed its white whale This is arguably the greatest reason for optimism this year. After years of trying and failing, the US – the biggest historic emitter – has passed major climate change legislation through its Congress. Analysis has found the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) could propel the country to a 43% cut in emissions by 2030 compared with 2005 levels – a big leap from where it was otherwise headed. If its political system holds together it should put the national target of a 50% cut this decade, and bigger cuts beyond, within reach. One key point to note: the US law underlines that penalising fossil fuel industries by pricing carbon is, while not dead, out of fashion. The IRA is mostly about investment – $US370bn of it – to help clean solutions usurp the old, dirty model. Much of it will be available only to goods manufactured in the US. Experts say in addition to cutting local pollution, this could also increase competition and lower costs on international markets. Australia is no longer a complete laggard Compared with the US, the passing of Australia’s first climate change legislation in a decade is minor news – it is a smaller country and a more modest bill – but it is still unarguably one of the positives stories of the moment. After years of Australia being bracketed with Russia and Saudi Arabia as a global laggard, the Albanese government will win praise for its new 2030 emissions reduction target (a 43% cut compared with 2005) at the next major UN climate summit in Egypt in November. But the Labor government can also expect questions. The most pertinent is likely to be the same one it is getting at home: will it really undermine its new commitment, and the global effort, by continuing to expand fossil fuel exports? It might need to develop a better answer.

Oleksii Reznikov told an online briefing on Friday: “As soon as there is God’s will, the weather and a decision by commanders, we will do it.” He gave no date for when the counteroffensive would start but said: “Globally speaking, we are to a high percentage ready.” Kyiv has been preparing a counterattack for several months aimed at repelling Russian forces from the east and south. The death toll from a Russian missile strike that hit a nine-storey block of flats in Uman, central Ukraine, has risen to 19, including two 10-year-old children, the regional governor, Igor Taburets, and other local officials have said. The announcement brings the total number of people killed in the wave of pre-dawn strikes to at least 21.Russian missiles also hit a home in the central city of Dnipro, where the city’s mayor, Borys Filatov, said a young woman and a three-year-old child had been killed. Vladimir Putin on Friday said Russia needed to act quickly and as a “cohesive team” to counter the west’s “economic aggression”, adding Moscow would expand ties with countries in Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. Russia’s economy has faced multiple challenges this year, including a weaker rouble, lower energy revenues and further isolation as western countries continue to impose an array of sanctions over its war in Ukraine. A leaked internal review commissioned by Amnesty International is said to have concluded there were significant shortcomings in a controversial report prepared by the rights group that accused Ukraine of illegally endangering citizens by placing armed forces in civilian areas. The report, issued last August, prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts of what went wrong. Among those who condemned the report was Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who accused Amnesty of “shift[ing] the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim”. A Ukrainian journalist, who formerly worked for the BBC, has been killed fighting on the frontline. Oleksandr Bondarenko volunteered for Ukraine’s territorial defence after Russia invaded the country in February 2022. He later became part of the military. Details of how he was killed in action are not yet known, BBC News reports. Bondarenko, known as Sasha or Sashko, worked from 2007 to 2011 at the BBC’s Ukrainian service, broadcasting from Kyiv. His colleagues paid tribute to the “extraordinary” and “heroic” reporter and news presenter. The UK has signed a £1.9bn deal with Poland to provide the eastern European nation with a British-designed air defence system. Some 22 Polish air defence batteries will be equipped with Common Anti-Air Modular Missiles (CAMMs) and launchers as part of the arrangement. It expands on pre-existing defence ties with Poland, where CAMMs are already deployed with the British army following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia has informed the UN’s nuclear watchdog that equipment spotted at Ukraine‘s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which Russia controls, will be used to fix a power transmission line that leads to Russian-held territory, the watchdog said on Friday. The planned restoration of the downed power line could heighten Ukrainian fears that Russia is preparing to connect Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, to the power grid of territory that it controls. A small number of International Atomic Energy Agency officials are present at the ZNPP, which is operated by Ukrainian staff working under the orders of Russian forces and the Russian nuclear company Rosatom. A UN committee said on Friday it was deeply concerned about human rights violations by Russian forces and private military companies in Ukraine, including enforced disappearances, torture, rape and extrajudicial executions, Reuters reports. In its findings on Russia, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called on the Russian authorities to investigate allegations of human rights violations committed during the invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree giving people living in parts of Ukraine that are under Moscow’s control a route to Russian citizenship – but also means those who decline it, or do not legalise their status, potentially face deportation. Reuters reports that the decree, which covers Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, the four regions Russia has claimed and partially controls, sets out ways that Ukrainian citizens living there – or those holding passports issued by Russia-backed breakaway republics – can start the process of becoming Russian citizens or legalise their status. Spain’s foreign ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador over a video shared on the embassy’s social media accounts that falsely portrayed Spanish troops fighting in Ukraine. Agence France-Presse cited Spanish media as saying the video, which has now been taken down, showed what the embassy claimed were Spanish soldiers on the battlefield, set against a clip of Spain’s defence minister, Margarita Robles, saying Spanish troops would never fight in Ukraine. Reports are emerging that the Russian colonel general Mikhail Mizintsev, known as the “Butcher of Mariupol”, has been removed as deputy defence minister in charge of logistics and supplies. Reuters cites a military blogger, Alexander Sladkov, and the news website RBC as saying Mizintsev, who orchestrated the siege of the devastated city of Mariupol last year, was no longer in the role he was appointed to last September. The Kremlin has said Russian military units that have fought in Ukraine will be represented in a parade in Moscow on 9 May to mark the anniversary of the Soviet victory in the second world war, Reuters reports. The holiday is one of the most important in the Russian calendar, usually featuring a huge show of military hardware on Red Square and a speech from President Vladimir Putin. Russia said its patience should not be tested over nuclear weapons in another repeat of hardline rhetoric. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that Russia will do “everything to prevent the development of events according to the worst scenario … but not at the cost of infringing on our vital interests”. The Biden administration is sanctioning Russia’s Federal Security Service for wrongfully detaining Americans. The sanctions are largely symbolic, since the organisation is already under sweeping existing sanctions for the invasion of Ukraine. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia welcomed anything that could hasten the end of the Ukraine conflict when asked about Wednesday’s phone call between the Chinese and Ukrainian leaders. But Russia still needed to achieve the aims of its “special military operation” in Ukraine. Putin has ordered the Russian government to create museums dedicated to Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine, according to instructions published on the Kremlin website. Russia’s foreign ministry has rejected a bid by the US embassy to visit the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in prison on 11 May. It said the measure was taken in response to Washington’s failure to process visas for “representatives from the journalistic pool” of the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, during his visit to the United Nations on Monday. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has invited Pope Francis to visit Ukraine. During a visit to the Vatican, he asked the pontiff for help to return children from the east of Ukraine who have been forcibly taken to Russia by Kremlin forces. Russia has reinforced its defences ahead of a much-expected counterattack by Ukrainian forces, analysts have suggested. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that the 500 miles (800km) of Russian lines protecting occupied Ukraine have been triple-fortified and received a “gush of manpower”. The timing comes as the usual winter freeze has begun to thaw and dry, making mobilisation more likely. A leaked internal review commissioned by Amnesty International is said to have concluded there were significant shortcomings in a controversial report prepared by the rights group that accused Ukraine of illegally endangering citizens by placing armed forces in civilian areas.

Among those who condemned the report was Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who accused Amnesty of “shift[ing] the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim”. Leaked to the New York Times, that unpublished review has concluded that the report was “written in language that was ambiguous, imprecise and in some respects legally questionable”, according to the newspaper.

Ukrainian Journalist Oleksandr Bondarenko,our Sasha was killed on the frontline.⁩ He couldn’t see the homeland ripped apart by invaders &amp;went to defend it as a soldier. RIP Sasha. Maciek Bernatt-Reszczynski, the former heard of the BBC’s Ukraine service said: It was always new challenges with this extraordinary man. Including the last, heroic one, to defend his country from aggression. Vladimir Putin on Friday said Russia needed to act quickly and as a “cohesive team” to counter the west’s “economic aggression”, adding Moscow would expand ties with countries in Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. Russia’s economy has faced multiple challenges this year, including a weaker rouble, lower energy revenues and further isolation as western countries continue to impose an array of sanctions over its war in Ukraine. Reuters reports that Putin told a meeting of Russian lawmakers: Today, in the face of the west’s economic aggression, the parliament, the government, all regional and local authorities need to act clearly and quickly work as one cohesive team. We are not going to leave Russia to isolate itself. On the contrary, we are going to expand pragmatic, equal, mutually beneficial, exclusively cooperative relations with friendly countries in Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. These are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. The UK has signed a £1.9bn deal with Poland to provide the eastern European nation with a British-designed air defence system. Some 22 Polish air defence batteries will be equipped with Common Anti-Air Modular Missiles (CAMMs) and launchers as part of the arrangement. It expands on pre-existing defence ties with Poland, where CAMMs are already deployed with the British army following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, PA reports. The CAMM system, made by missile firm MBDA, is designed to engage advanced air targets up to 25km away. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: We have played a crucial role in boosting Euro-Atlantic defences since Putin’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine, and this landmark agreement between the UK and Poland is another example of how, alongside our allies, we are committed to protecting our security for generations to come. As well as bolstering European air defences, this £1.9 billion deal will also support highly skilled jobs in both countries, delivering on my pledge to grow the economy, and creating better paid jobs and opportunity right across the UK. Georgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, wrapped herself in traditional British conservativism today as she sought to quash any doubts about her commitment to the western alliance and the fight to defeat Vladimir Putin, saying Ukrainian patriots have shown the love of freedom is stronger than missiles and tanks. Quoting Winston Churchill, followed by JRR Tolkien and the conservative philosopher Roger Scruton, she presented herself less as part of the neo-fascist tradition from which she hails, and more part of British conservatism. It was a skilful diplomatic move by a leader who needs to play down her past if the British are to support her efforts to become a major force in European politics. Her remarks in a speech at the conservative thinktank Policy Exchange extolled the virtues of Ukrainian patriotism, and gave her an international platform to distance herself from the coalition partners Forza Italia and the League, both of which have shown support for Putin in different ways. Quoting Tolkien, she said: “I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend. “The Ukrainian people have proven that there is something stronger than missiles and tanks. It is the love of freedom and within us.” She accused Putin of trying to turn Ukraine into a vassal state, denying the country its identity and sovereignty, but she said the strong and unified reaction of the free world showed how much we were willing to defend our founding values and achievements; values that should never be taken for granted. The Russian aggression was not simply an act of war, she said. It was an assault on the fundamental principle of civilisation and we could allow the law of the strongest to overcome the strength of law. She said Putin’s plan failed against the courage of those who loved their nation and were not willing to lose their identity, their sovereignty and freedom. It had also shattered against the reaction of the free world that did not hesitate to take sides. She urged the global south to recognise that the war was not about exclusively European interests but instead about the basis of coexistence for all nations. We have to counter the risk of polarisation between north and south, between the west and the rest. she said. We need to identify new areas and models of cooperation with Africa. The UK Conservative government, looking for allies inside the European Union, has lavished attention on Meloni, with the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, spending three hours with her on Thursday. James Cleverly, the UK foreign secretary, accompanying Meloni to a packed reception at the Italian embassy, welcomed her embrace of British conservatism. He praised her first six months as prime minister, saying he had been deeply impressed by the way she had combined “clear leadership with an ability to get things done”. She replied that Britain “could always count on me”. Russia has informed the UN’s nuclear watchdog that equipment spotted at Ukraine‘s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which Russia controls, will be used to fix a power transmission line that leads to Russian-held territory, the watchdog said on Friday. The planned restoration of the downed power line could heighten Ukrainian fears that Russia is preparing to connect Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, to the power grid of territory that it controls. A small number of International Atomic Energy Agency officials are present at the ZNPP, which is operated by Ukrainian staff working under the orders of Russian forces and the Russian nuclear company Rosatom. Reuters reports that the IAEA said in a statement: The (IAEA) team observed, and following questions were subsequently informed, that a large piece of equipment being transported into the turbine hall of Unit 3 was a transformer to replace the damaged ‘Kakhovka’ node in the ZNPP open switchyard. The Kakhovka line is one of the four 750 kV (kilovolt) lines that were operational before the military conflict. This line is linked to the currently Russian-controlled electrical grid, to the south of the ZNPP site. Only one of those four power lines is currently working and is the only source of external power to the plant, which it needs to keep cooling the fuel in its six reactors even though they are shut down. Failing to cool that fuel could lead to a potentially catastrophic nuclear meltdown. Here is what you might have missed: Ukraine’s forces are concluding their preparations for a long-expected spring counteroffensive against invading Russian troops, the country’s defence minister has said, and are broadly speaking ready. Oleksii Reznikov told an online briefing on Friday: “As soon as there is God’s will, the weather and a decision by commanders, we will do it.” He gave no date for when the counteroffensive would start but said: “Globally speaking, we are to a high percentage ready.” Kyiv has been preparing a counterattack for several months aimed at repelling Russian forces from the east and south.

The New York Times has reported that Amnesty International has been sitting on an independent review criticising its controversial allegation that Ukrainian forces were illegally endangering civilians. Amnesty’s accusation that Ukrainian troops were illegally putting “civilians in harm’s way” by basing themselves nearby and launching attacks from populated areas caused widespread anger when it was published last August. Russia claimed it as vindication but critics – including the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy – said it was poorly researched, ignored wartime realities and drew a moral equivalence between Russia, the aggressor, and Ukraine, the victim. Reports are emerging that the Russian colonel general Mikhail Mizintsev, known as the “Butcher of Mariupol”, has been removed as deputy defence minister in charge of logistics and supplies.

Britain’s opposition Labour party has asked the government why there has been no new weapons announcement since February and no fresh update from ministers to parliament since January. Emma Graham-Harrison and Artem Mazhulin report for The Guardian from Dnipro: The Russian attack killed Veronika in her bed on Friday morning, but left her childish chalk drawings of a happy family intact on the wall of their home. Portraits of “Mama”, “Nika” (her nickname), her uncles, grandparents and even the family cat “Kuzia” – the names written in by an adult – stretch all along the front of the house. They end only where the plaster was stripped off by an explosion and a fire that took the lives of the three-year-old and her mother, early on Friday morning. Hours later, Kuzia the cat looked on, bewildered and bedraggled by a steady rain, as “Uncle Seriozha” from the wall drawings tried to sort through the charred wreckage of their single-storey home. He hurled fragments of twisted metal out into the yard, sidestepping a doll thrown to the floor by the blast. Read more: A three-year-old killed and her family ripped apart in Ukraine missile strikes The UK’s Ministry of Defence has posted a map on its Twitter account of the current situation in Ukraine. Two new advisory bodies will help make Ukraine‘s defence ministry more efficient and transparent, defence minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Friday. The Office for the Support of Changes and the Public Anti-Corruption Council were set up earlier this month following allegations that the ministry bought food for troops at inflated prices, Reuters reports. The ministry has also received heavy weaponry from western allies as Kyiv prepares to launch a counteroffensive against Russian forces after 14 months of war in Ukraine. Reznikov told an online briefing: Today is a time for reform, even during this war. Reznikov said the Office for the Support of Changes had been tasked with “thinking out of the box” to propose institutional changes, including on the procurement of non-lethal resources. The Public Anti-Corruption Council contained people who were publicly elected by thousands of voters, he said. It will monitor potential corruption risks at the ministry. A former deputy defence minister and another ministry official have been served with “notices of suspicion” over wrongdoing involving contracts for food purchases for the army, the state anti-corruption agency said last week. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree giving people living in parts of Ukraine that are under Moscow’s control a route to Russian citizenship – but also means those who decline it, or do not legalise their status, potentially face deportation. Reuters reports that the decree, which covers Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, the four regions Russia has claimed and partially controls, sets out ways that Ukrainian citizens living there – or those holding passports issued by Russia-backed breakaway republics – can start the process of becoming Russian citizens or legalise their status. But it also says anyone who does not take steps to do so by 1 July 2024 will be regarded as a foreign citizen, leaving them at risk of being deported from territory Russia considers its own. The death toll from a Russian missile strike that hit a nine-storey block of flats in Uman, central Ukraine, has risen to 19, including two 10-year-old children, the regional governor, Igor Taburets, and other local officials have said. The announcement brings the total number of people killed in the wave of pre-dawn strikes to at least 21. Agence France-Presse said its reporters saw rescue workers extracting victims’ remains from destroyed buildings. “I want to see my children, they are under the rubble,” Dmitry, a 33-year-old local from Luhansk, told them. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, condemned the latest barrage and vowed to respond to “Russian terror”. Moscow said it had targeted reserve units of the Ukrainian military and that “all assigned objects were hit”. Russian missiles also hit a home in the central city of Dnipro, where the city’s mayor, Borys Filatov, said a young woman and a three-year-old child had been killed. No casualties were reported in Kyiv, which was among the other cities targeted in the attack. Ukraine said it had shot down 21 of a total of 23 Russian missiles as well as two drones. Spain’s foreign ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador over a video shared on the embassy’s social media accounts that falsely portrayed Spanish troops fighting in Ukraine. Agence France-Presse cited Spanish media as saying the video, which has now been taken down, showed what the embassy claimed were Spanish soldiers on the battlefield, set against a clip of Spain’s defence minister, Margarita Robles, saying Spanish troops would never fight in Ukraine. The ministry demanded the “immediate” removal of the video and summoned Russia’s ambassador to Madrid on Thursday “to protest the attacks on social media against the government”, expressing its “strong rejection of this type of publication”. Robles repeated on Friday there were “absolutely no Nato troops, no Spanish soldiers belonging to Spain’s armed forces, or the armed forces of any Nato country, in Ukraine. None.” She accused Russia of “using all kinds of methods, including misinformation, to undermine the friendship of the nations that are part of the European Union and Nato”. Russian cruise missiles have killed at least 17 people in the central Ukrainian cities of Uman and Dnipro, days after Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, begged his allies for more air defence supplies. The attacks were part of a wave of Russian missile and drone strikes in the early hours of Friday morning, the most intense aerial bombing of major Ukrainian cities in weeks. Footage from Uman, where at least 15 people were killed including two children, showed a building in flames and partly reduced to rubble. A mother and her three-year-old daughter were killed in their home on the outskirts of Dnipro. Fragments of a missile shot down by air defences appeared to have fallen on the house, in the rural area on the outskirts of Dnipro, police told neighbours. “It was loud enough to understand that someone was probably hurt,” said Oleksandr Kalinichenko, a neighbour who lives about 300 metres away.

The upper floor of a residential building in the central city of Uman, south of Kyiv, was struck as people slept early on Friday. Smoke was seen billowing from the destroyed building as rescue teams worked on the ground. The attack was part of a wave of Russian missile and drone strikes in the early hours of Friday morning, the most intense aerial bombing of Ukrainian cities in weeks A UN committee said on Friday it was deeply concerned about human rights violations by Russian forces and private military companies in Ukraine, including enforced disappearances, torture, rape and extrajudicial executions, Reuters reports. In its findings on Russia, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called on the Russian authorities to investigate allegations of human rights violations committed during the invasion of Ukraine. It said in a statement: The Committee was deeply concerned about the grave human rights violations committed during the ongoing armed conflict by the Russian Federation’s military forces and private military companies ... There was no immediate comment from the Russian permanent mission to the UN in Geneva. In its report, the committee listed excessive use of force, arbitrary detentions, killings and the forcible transfer of children from Ukraine to Russia among the violations committed. Russia, which the UN committee said had refused to provide it with information on the conflict, has denied committing atrocities and deliberately attacking civilians in Ukraine. It denies deporting Ukrainian children to Russia, saying it has evacuated them to keep them safe. The eurozone has defied predictions that the Ukraine war would plunge it into recession after a warm winter blunted the impact of higher energy prices. Data from Eurostat – the EU’s statistical agency – showed that growth in the 20 countries using the single currency stood at 0.1% in the first three months of 2023. The small overall increase disguised a wide variation across member states. The eurozone’s biggest economy, Germany, stagnated in the first quarter of 2023 after contracting by 0.5% in the final three months of 2022. Italy and Spain, the third and fourth-biggest eurozone economies, performed better than the markets had been expecting, each posting quarterly growth of 0.5%. France grew by 0.2%. Read more: Eurozone economy avoids recession ‘by a whisker’ Here is what you might have missed: Ukraine’s forces are concluding their preparations for a long-expected spring counteroffensive against invading Russian troops, the country’s defence minister has said, and are broadly speaking ready. Oleksii Reznikov told an online briefing on Friday: “As soon as there is God’s will, the weather and a decision by commanders, we will do it.” He gave no date for when the counteroffensive would start but said: “Globally speaking, we are to a high percentage ready.” Kyiv has been preparing a counterattack for several months aimed at repelling Russian forces from the east and south. Russia launched a wave of missile attacks across many of Ukraine’s biggest cities before dawn on Friday, killing a mother and young child in the port city of Dnipro, and fourteen people at a high-rise apartment building in the central city of Uman. Air raid alarms were active across Ukraine in the early hours of Friday morning, while explosions were heard in Kyiv, and southern Mykolaiv was targeted again. The New York Times has reported that Amnesty International has been sitting on an independent review criticising its controversial allegation that Ukrainian forces were illegally endangering civilians. Amnesty’s accusation that Ukrainian troops were illegally putting “civilians in harm’s way” by basing themselves nearby and launching attacks from populated areas caused widespread anger when it was published last August. Russia claimed it as vindication but critics – including the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy – said it was poorly researched, ignored wartime realities and drew a moral equivalence between Russia, the aggressor, and Ukraine, the victim. Reports are emerging that the Russian colonel general Mikhail Mizintsev, known as the “Butcher of Mariupol”, has been removed as deputy defence minister in charge of logistics and supplies. Reuters cites a military blogger, Alexander Sladkov, and the news website RBC as saying Mizintsev, who orchestrated the siege of the devastated city of Mariupol last year, was no longer in the role he was appointed to last September. The Kremlin has said Russian military units that have fought in Ukraine will be represented in a parade in Moscow on 9 May to mark the anniversary of the Soviet victory in the second world war, Reuters reports. The holiday is one of the most important in the Russian calendar, usually featuring a huge show of military hardware on Red Square and a speech from President Vladimir Putin. Russia said its patience should not be tested over nuclear weapons in another repeat of hardline rhetoric. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that Russia will do “everything to prevent the development of events according to the worst scenario … but not at the cost of infringing on our vital interests”. The Biden administration is sanctioning Russia’s Federal Security Service for wrongfully detaining Americans. The sanctions are largely symbolic, since the organisation is already under sweeping existing sanctions for the invasion of Ukraine. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia welcomed anything that could hasten the end of the Ukraine conflict when asked about Wednesday’s phone call between the Chinese and Ukrainian leaders. But Russia still needed to achieve the aims of its “special military operation” in Ukraine. Putin has ordered the Russian government to create museums dedicated to Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine, according to instructions published on the Kremlin website. Russia’s foreign ministry has rejected a bid by the US embassy to visit the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in prison on 11 May. It said the measure was taken in response to Washington’s failure to process visas for “representatives from the journalistic pool” of the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, during his visit to the United Nations on Monday. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has invited Pope Francis to visit Ukraine. During a visit to the Vatican, he asked the pontiff for help to return children from the east of Ukraine who have been forcibly taken to Russia by Kremlin forces. Russia has reinforced its defences ahead of a much-expected counterattack by Ukrainian forces, analysts have suggested. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that the 500 miles (800km) of Russian lines protecting occupied Ukraine have been triple-fortified and received a “gush of manpower”. The timing comes as the usual winter freeze has begun to thaw and dry, making mobilisation more likely. Britain’s opposition Labour party has asked the government why there has been no new weapons announcement since February and no fresh update from ministers to parliament since January. The death toll from an overnight Russian missile strike on the city of Uman, in central Ukraine, has risen to 14. In an update, the Ministry of Internal Affairs said: Uman: the bodies of two more people have just been removed from the rubble. As of now, 14 people were killed in a strike on an apartment block. The 14 people killed in Uman include two 10-year-old children. With two people killed in Dnipro, the overall death toll has risen to 16. Rescuers are using cranes to search for survivors among the remains of the multi-storey housing block in the central city of 80,000 inhabitants. The regional governor Igor Taburets said the city was hit by two cruise missiles, with one hitting a residential building and the other a warehouse. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted a video of the damage from Russia’s overnight missile strikes on an apartment building in Uman. Zelenskiy claims there are at least 13 dead from the attack, including two children. He said: Uman … The rubble is still being cleared. There are already 13 dead. Two of them are children that can’t be identified. The fate of their parents is unknown … The rescuers will work until they make sure that no one else is left under the rubble. We can defeat Russian terror together only – with weapons for Ukraine, the toughest sanctions against the terrorist state, and fair sentences for the killers. The Kremlin has said Russian military units that have fought in Ukraine will be represented in a parade in Moscow on 9 May to mark the anniversary of the Soviet victory in the second world war, Reuters reports. The holiday is one of the most important in the Russian calendar, usually featuring a huge show of military hardware on Red Square and a speech from President Vladimir Putin. Associated Press reports from the scene of the badly damaged apartment building in Uman where at least 10 people died in a Russian missile strike before dawn: All the glass flew out, everything flew out, even the chandelier fell. Everything was covered in glass,” resident Olha Turina said. “Then there was an explosion ... We barely found our things and ran out.” Turina, whose husband is fighting on the frontlines, said one of her child’s classmates was missing. “I don’t know where they are, I don’t know if they are alive,” she said. “I don’t know why we have to go through all this. We never bothered anyone.” One of the people killed was a 75-year-old who was in her apartment in a neighbouring building and suffered internal bleeding from the shock wave of the blast, according to emergency personnel on the scene. Three body bags lay next to the building as smoke continued to billow hours after the attack. One woman, crying in shock, was taken away by rescue crews for help. Reports are emerging that the Russian colonel general Mikhail Mizintsev, known as the “Butcher of Mariupol”, has been removed as deputy defence minister in charge of logistics and supplies. Reuters cites a military blogger, Alexander Sladkov, and the news website RBC as saying Mizintsev, who orchestrated the siege of the devastated city of Mariupol last year, was no longer in the role he was appointed to last September. The EU, which imposed sanctions on Mizintsev last June, referred to him as the Butcher of Mariupol, saying he was responsible for the “inhuman” siege of the shattered city. The defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, Reuters said, while the Kremlin has said it cannot say anything on the subject and referred questions on the matter to the defence ministry. Ukraine’s forces are concluding their preparations for a long-expected spring counteroffensive against invading Russian troops, the country’s defence minister has said, and are broadly speaking ready. Reuters reports that Oleksii Reznikov told an online briefing on Friday: “As soon as there is God’s will, the weather and a decision by commanders, we will do it.” He gave no date for when the counteroffensive would start but said: “Globally speaking, we are to a high percentage ready.” Kyiv has been preparing a counterattack for several months aimed at repelling Russian forces from the east and south. Nato said on Thursday its allies and partner countries had delivered more than 98% of the combat vehicles promised to Ukraine, strengthening Kyiv’s capabilities. Along with more than 1,550 armored vehicles, 230 tanks and other equipment, western allies have sent “vast amounts of ammunition” and trained and equipped more than nine new Ukrainian brigades, Nato’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, tweeted pictures of the damage from Russia’s overnight missile strikes this morning, when the death toll still stood at seven: Another night of Russian terror. Missiles and UAVs … Russian evil can be stopped by weapons – our defenders are doing it. And it can be stopped by sanctions – global sanctions must be enhanced. At least 12 people have since been confirmed dead in the strikes, including a 31-year-old woman and a two-year-old child in Dnipro, and 10 residents of a block of flats in Uman. Pope Francis has arrived in Hungary at the start of a three-day trip likely to be overshadowed by Russia’s war on Ukraine. The visit is the pope’s first since he was admitted to hospital for bronchitis in March. On Sunday he is due to preside at an open-air mass in front of parliament, Reuters reports. Francis has acknowledged the visit’s content will be affected by current events, even if its main purpose is to meet Hungarian Catholics and Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, on Friday. Orbán has said Hungary and the Vatican are the only two European states that can be described as “pro-peace” regarding Ukraine. Both have called for a ceasefire and negotiations to end the war, and Francis has urged Ukraine to be open to dialogue with “aggressor” Russia. Hungary, which supports a sovereign Ukraine but still has strong economic ties to Russia, has refused to send weapons to Ukraine. The pope has said sending arms to Ukraine is morally acceptable if they are used only for self-defence. Agence France-Presse confirms in its latest report that at least 12 people have died in missile and drone strikes that hit Ukraine as its forces prepare an expected counteroffensive. “Missile strikes killing innocent Ukrainians in their sleep, including a 2-year-old child, is Russia’s response to all peace initiatives,” the country’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted. Large-scale missile strikes had tailed off in recent months and Kyiv, which was among the cities targeted – without injury – on Friday, had not been hit by missiles for more than 50 days. Ukraine’s interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, said strikes on the town of Uman, south of the capital, led to “a total of 10 victims”, while the mayor of the central city of Dnipro, Borys Filatov, said two people – including a two-year-old child – had been killed there. Ukraine said it had downed 21 of 23 Russian missiles and two attack drones overnight. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned the latest barrage and vowed a response to “Russian terror”. In Uman, a central city of 80,000 inhabitants, a video broadcast by Ukrainian media showed a gutted apartment building, with rubble strewn around it. According to the regional governor Igor Taburets, Uman was hit by two cruise missiles, with one hitting a residential building and the other a warehouse. Ukraine’s interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, has just said the death toll from a Russian missile strike in the city of Uman, south of Kyiv, has risen to at least 10, with 17 wounded. The missile struck a nine-storey block of flats before dawn, while residents were still sleeping. In the south-eastern city of Dnipro, a missile struck a house, killing a two-year-old child and a 31-year-old woman, the regional governor, Serhiy Lysak, said. At least 12 people are now confirmed dead in the first large-scale Russian missile attack to hit Ukraine in nearly two months. Here are some agency pictures of the damage in Uman, about 215km (134 miles) south of Kyiv, as rescue workers tackle the aftermath of a pre-dawn Russian missile strile that hit a nine-storey residential building killing at least seven people. The death toll from a wave of pre-dawn Russian missile strikes, the first such large-scale attack to hit Ukraine in nearly two months, has risen to at least nine, Reuters reports. “This Russian terror must face a fair response from Ukraine and the world,” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy wrote in a Telegram post alongside images of the wreckage. “And it will.” A least seven people were killed and 17 wounded in the central city of Uman when a missile hit a nine-storey apartment building, Ukraine’s interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, Reporters at the scene described rescuers clambering through a huge pile of smouldering rubble and carrying a body bag away on a stretcher. In the south-eastern city of Dnipro, a missile struck a house, killing a two-year-old child and a 31-year-old woman, the regional governor, Serhiy Lysak, said. Three people were also wounded in that attack. Ukraine’s military command said it had shot down 21 out of 23 cruise missiles fired by Russia. The capital Kyiv was also rocked by explosions, with officials reporting that air defence units had destroyed 11 missiles and two drones. Two more people were wounded in the town of Ukrayinka just south of Kyiv, officials said. The New York Times has reported that Amnesty International has been sitting on an independent review criticising its controversial allegation that Ukrainian forces were illegally endangering civilians. Amnesty’s accusation that Ukrainian troops were illegally putting “civilians in harm’s way” by basing themselves nearby and launching attacks from populated areas caused widespread anger when it was published last August. “We have documented a pattern of Ukrainian forces putting civilians at risk and violating the laws of war when they operate in populated areas,” Agnès Callamard, the group’s secretary general, said. Russia claimed it as vindication but critics – including the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy – said it was poorly researched, ignored wartime realities and drew a moral equivalence between Russia, the aggressor, and Ukraine, the victim. The New York Times has obtained a copy of an 18-page report by five international humanitarian law experts commissioned by Amnesty to review its August statement. The panel absolved the human rights group on some gounds, the paper said, saying it was right to consider whether a defender, not just an aggressor, was obeying the laws of war. But it concluded Amnesty’s statement was “ambiguous, imprecise and in some respects legally questionable”, and that the key conclusion – that Ukraine violated international law – was “not sufficiently substantiated” by the evidence. The NYT cited a person familiar with the matter as saying an earlier version of the independent review was even tougher, but Amnesty succeeded in softening some of the terms used – including changing “not substantiated” to “not sufficiently substantiated”. The paper said the final version of the experts’ review was submitted in February but Amnesty International’s board decided not to release it, instead using it for an internal “lessons learned” exercise. Ukraine’s digital transformation minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, has tweeted video and pictures of the scale of the damage in Uman, where at least six people were killed by pre-dawn Russian missile strikes. The death toll from Russia’s pre-dawn missile strikes across Ukraine has risen to at least eight, Associated Press reports. The agency cited Ukrainian national police as saying at least six people were killed and 17 wounded in Uman, about 215km (134 miles) south of Kyiv, where two cruise missiles hit a nine-storey residential building. Three children were rescued from the rubble. Russia fired more than 20 cruise missiles and two drones at Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine early on Friday. Air raid sirens sounded around the capital in the first attack against the city since early March. Ukraine’s air force intercepted 11 cruise missiles and two unmanned aerial vehicles over Kyiv, Kyiv city hall said, but there were no immediate reports of any missiles hitting targets in the capital and no casualties were reported. A 31-year-old woman and her two-year-old daughter were also killed in the eastern city of Dnipro in another attack, the regional governor, Serhii Lysak, said. Four people were also wounded. Ukraine’s armed forces commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said the missiles were fired from aircraft operating in the Caspian Sea region. Zaluzhnyi said Ukraine intercepted 21 of 23 Kh-101 and Kh-555 type cruise missiles. After Russian missile strikes killed at least five people across Ukraine, Russia’s defence minister has said western allies’ real aim in Ukraine is to “strategically defeat” his country. The state-owned news agency RIA reported Sergei Shoigu as saying the west also aimed to pose a threat to China and maintain its own monopoly position. “Almost all” Nato member countries had now deployed their military capabilities against Russia, Shoigu said. Hello, this is Jon Henley taking over from Helen Sullivan. I’ll be bringing you further developments in Ukraine as they happen for the rest of the European morning. Russia launched a wave of missile attacks across many of Ukraine’s biggest cities before dawn on Friday, killing a mother and young child in the port city of Dnipro, and four people at a high-rise apartment building in the central city of Uman. Air raid alarms were active across Ukraine in the early hours of Friday morning, while explosions were heard in Kyiv, and southern Mykolaiv was targeted again. Authorities in Uman said the attack killed four and injured 17. Footage from the central city of Uman, which has a large Jewish population and was a major pilgrimage destination before the war, showed a building in flames, and partially reduced to rubble. Emergency services are still working at the site. A woman and three-year-old child were killed in the attack on Dnipro, the mayor said. I’m handing over to my colleague Jon Henley who will take you through the rest of this Friday’s difficult news. The death toll from a Russian strike on an apartment block in Uman has risen to four, the National Police of Ukraine has posted on Telegram, citing the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine, Ihor Klymenko. Rescue operations are ongoing, Klymenko said. Seventeen people were injured in the strike, including three children. The rise in the death toll brings the total confirmed deaths from this morning’s attacks to six people, including a three-year-old child. Here is our full story on this morning’s attacks. Russia has launched a wave of missile attacks across many of Ukraine’s biggest cities, killing a mother and young child in the port city of Dnipro, and three people at a high-rise apartment building in the central city of Uman. Air raid alarms were active across the country in the early hours of Friday morning, while explosions were heard in Kyiv, and southern Mykolaiv was targeted again. The attack came less than 24 hours after four cruise missiles, apparently launched from the sea, hit civilian buildings in the city, killing at least one person and abruptly ending nearly four months of relative calm there: Here are some photographs from the strike on an apartment building in Uman: A Cambridge engineering student, Harry Blakiston Houston, came up with an ingenious and cheap way to help Ukraine citizens who have had their windows broken during the war: In other news from the war, new satellite images offer a window into the aftermath of prolonged Russian shelling of Mariupol. For more than 80 days, Mariupol endured a brutal and unrelenting bombardment, as Russian forces determined to take the port city reduced much of it to rubble. In March 2022, a few days after the war began, Russian forces cut off electricity, water and gas supplies, forcing residents to melt snow for water and cook outside over open flames. Mariupol was encircled and the relentless bombing of the city began. After a maternity ward was shelled and images of bloodied, heavily pregnant women were broadcast across the world, the siege of Mariupol became emblematic of the brutality of the Russian invasion. Updated satellite imagery from Google Maps has reveals the scale of the destruction across large sections of the Ukrainian city – and the Russian efforts to erase any evidence of the atrocities that took place there. If you’re just joining us, Russia fired more than a dozen cruise missiles at Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine early Friday, killing at least five people and striking a residential building in central Ukraine, officials said. Air raid sirens sounded around the capital in the first attack against the city in nearly two months and Ukraine’s air force intercepted 11 cruise missiles and two unmanned aerial vehicles over Kyiv, according to the Kyiv City Administration. There were no immediate reports of any successful strikes in Kyiv but fragments from intercepted missiles or drones damaged power lines and a road in one neighbourhood. No casualties were reported. But a young woman and her three-year-old child were killed in the eastern city of Dnipro in another attack, according to the city’s mayor, Borys Filatov, in a Facebook post. He said more details would be provided later. And three people were killed in a cruise missile strike on a high-rise residential building in the city of Uman, in central Cherkasy region, the governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram. Three people were killed in this morning’s strike on an apartment block in Uman, in Ukraine’s Cherkasy region, the governor Ihor Taburets has just said on Telegram. “According to information at the moment, Russian rockets took the lives of 3 people. Another 8 are injured,” Taburets wrote. While Russia regularly bombed Ukrainian cities and infrastructure last winter, massive strikes had become less common in recent months. Most of the fighting is now in the east for control of the industrial Donbass region, in particular the city of Bakhmut, which has been almost completely destroyed. The air raid alert has also stopped in Kherson, according to the Kherson Regional State Administration on Telegram. The Kyiv City Military Administration (KMBA) says that there were no casualties in Kyiv during this morning’s attacks. The air raid alarms have ceased in Kyiv. The KMBA posted on Twitter: After a pause lasting 51 days, the enemy launched another missile attack on Kyiv. (The last missile attack on the capital was on March 9, 2023) According to the information being clarified, the shelling was carried out from strategic aviation planes. According to preliminary data, 11 cruise missiles were destroyed in the airspace of Kyiv. In addition to the missiles, 2 more UAVs were shot down (the type of drones is being established). Previously, as a result of falling debris, a local power line was cut off and the road surface was damaged in the Obolon district of the capital. There were no casualties among the civilian population and no destruction of residential facilities or infrastructure. The information is checked and clarified. Five people have been confirmed injured in the Russian cruise missile strike on a high-rise residential building in the city of Uman, in central Cherkasy region, the governor Ihor Taburets has just said on Telegram. “So far, as a result of the rocket attack on Uman, we have 5 injurues. They are in the hospital,” said Taburets. In a shocking video made by a resident of the high-rise building struck by a Russian missile early this morning in Uman, Ukraine, she says, her face and hands flecked with blood, “A rocket hit our home. We’re all covered in blood. Children slept here, thank God we’re all alive. All our windows are gone. We’re all covered in blood. I was so scared.” The woman is visibly upset and films the damage caused to her apartment, with windows blown from their hinges and glass everywhere. This morning’s wave of attacks by Russia acrosss Ukraine come a day after the Kremlin said it would welcome anything that could bring the end of the conflict closer, referring to a telephone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Wednesday. It was the first time the leaders had spoken since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. But the Kremlin also said still needed to achieve the aims of what it calls a “special military operation”. An attack on the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro early on Friday killed a woman and a three-year-old child, the city’s mayor said. “A young woman and a three-year-old child have been killed,” Borys Filatov said on Telegram. Filatov gave no further details of the attack or of other damage and casualties. Russian attacks struck Ukrainian cities after midnight in a wide arc extending from the capital Kyiv through central Ukraine and the southern region of Mykolaiv, Reuters reports. Here is the Reuters report on the strike on Uman: Pictures on social media showed an apartment building ablaze early on Friday in the central Ukrainian town of Uman, and police in the region said emergency services were operating. The pictures, posted on various news and other websites, showed flames shooting out from a heavily damaged building in the town. Parts of the building had collapsed. Zoya Vovk, a police spokesperson in the surrounding region, said emergency teams were operating. There were no details of casualties. We now have official confirmation of the strike on a high-rise building in Uman, in the Cherkasy region. Ihor Taburets, Head of the Cherkasy oblast Military Administration has posted on Telegram saying that a cruise missile hit the building, and that emergency services are at the site. Taburets said: “This morning, the occupiers attacked Cherkasy. We have two cruise missile hits in Uman: a residential building and warehouse buildings. We are finding out the consequences. All services are available on site. The air alert continues.” There are distressing videos emerging on social media of the aftermath of the strike on the residential building. We don’t have word yet of casualties or injuries. The Kyiv Independent is now reporting that the air defence systems are at work in Kyiv and that people should remain in shelters. A missile has reportedly hit a high-rise building in Uman, in the Cherkasy region on central Ukraine. Euromaidan, Kyiv Operativ and Faytuks news have posted videos of the reported attack, which shows a large part of a residential building totally blown apart. It is unknown at this stage how many people were inside. The Guardian has, however, not independently verified this report or the video below, though several local media organisations have shared it online: Euromaidan reports that eight cruise missiles have been launched at Ukraine – we’re seeing reports of missiles launched from the Caspian Sea, south-east of Ukraine. The Guardian could not verify these reports. A bit more detail now from Reuters: Explosions sounded in Kyiv and the region surrounding the capital early on Friday, Interfax Ukraine and local telegram channels reported. There were no details on which targets had been struck after midnight or of damage and casualties. The city’s military administration said anti-aircraft units were in operation. Earlier reports said cities stretching from central Ukraine to southern Mykolaiv Region had been hit by explosions after air raid alerts were declared throughout the country. Reuters is now reporting explosions in Kyiv, citing Interfax Ukraine and local telegram channels. The British Ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, who appears to be in Kyiv at the moment, wrote that she heard “bangs”: “Given up trying to sleep. Headed to windowless room with a book after hearing a bang outside,” she said. Several people and accounts on Twitter are reporting that explosions have been heard in Kyiv, though the Guardian and news agencies have not yet been able to verify this. Euan MacDonald, an editor at New Voices of Ukraine, wrote on Twitter, “4:42 something passing over Kyiv, then bangs – two”. Flash news said that subscribers had heard explosions in Kyiv. Iuliia Mendel, a former spokesperson to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has just posted on Twitter saying that in Kyiv it is, “Very loud outside. Noises of missiles flying, explosions.” In the early hours of Friday morning, air raid sirens sounded across Ukraine, including in Kyiv, as people headed to shelters. Interfax Ukraine news agency reported explosions in cities in widely separated regions, quoting local sources. Interfax said explosions were reported after midnight in Dnipro, Kremenchuk and Poltava in central Ukraine and in Mykolaiv in the south and another online source reported an explosion in Kyiv region. Interfax quoted regional Telegram accounts as saying unidentified airborne objects were headed for the west of the country. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. In the early hours of Friday morning, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv and across Ukraine, with explosions reportedly heard in Dnipro and in the Potava region – the Guardian has not been able to verify the explosions yet. We’ll have more on this shortly. In the meantime, here are the other key recent developments: The parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe has voted that the forced detention and deportation of children from Russian occupied territories of Ukraine is genocide. At least seven civilians were killed and 33 injured between Wednesday and Thursday, Ukraine’s presidential office said, including one person killed and 23 wounded when four Kalibr cruise missiles hit the southern city of Mykolaiv. Russia said its patience should not be tested over nuclear weapons in another repeat of hardline rhetoric. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said that Russia will do “everything to prevent the development of events according to the worst scenario … but not at the cost of infringing on our vital interests”. The Biden administration is sanctioning Russia’s Federal Security Service for wrongfully detaining Americans. The sanctions are largely symbolic, since the organisation is already under sweeping existing sanctions for the invasion of Ukraine. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia welcomed anything that could hasten the end of the Ukraine conflict when asked about Wednesday’s phone call between the Chinese and Ukrainian leaders. But Russia still needed to achieve the aims of its “special military operation” in Ukraine. The Kremlin said relations with European countries were at their “lowest possible level” amid more expulsions of diplomats. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, welcomed the discussion between China’s President Xi and Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy and repeated the possibility of the war ending at the “negotiating table”. Stoltenberg said 98% of promised combat vehicles had been delivered to Ukraine, comprising 1,550 armoured vehicles and 230 tanks. This equates to nine new Ukrainian brigades. Russia’s defence ministry claimed its forces had taken four blocks in north-western, western and south-western Bakhmut, Russia state-owned news agency RIA reported. The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group said on Thursday he had been joking when he said his men would suspend artillery fire in Bakhmut to allow Ukrainian forces on the other side of the frontline to show the city to visiting US journalists. Putin has ordered the Russian government to create museums dedicated to Moscow’s offensive in Ukraine, according to instructions published on the Kremlin website. A Moscow court on Thursday ordered the dissolution of a prominent research centre specialising in racism and xenophobia in Russia, in the latest move against critical voices since the start of the Ukraine conflict. Russia’s foreign ministry has rejected a bid by the US embassy to visit the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in prison on 11 May. It said the measure was taken in response to Washington’s failure to process visas for “representatives from the journalistic pool” of the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, during his visit to the United Nations on Monday. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has invited Pope Francis to visit Ukraine. During a visit to the Vatican, he asked the pontiff for help to return children from the east of Ukraine who have been forcibly taken to Russia by Kremlin forces. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Thursday that the Black Sea grain deal could only be saved by fully implementing it and that it was not “a buffet you can pick and choose from”. Moscow says parts of the deal meant to allow it to export its own agricultural goods are not being honoured. Andrij Melnyk, Ukraine’s former ambassador to Berlin, has said Germany is still failing to provide the support it should. “The Germans are helping much more than they were, and for that we Ukrainians are very grateful, but the government is only delivering as much as it feels it should,” he told Die Zeit. Russia has reinforced its defences ahead of a much-expected counterattack by Ukrainian forces, analysts have suggested. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that the 500 miles (800km) of Russian lines protecting occupied Ukraine have been triple-fortified and received a “gush of manpower”. The timing comes as the usual winter freeze has begun to thaw and dry, making mobilisation more likely. Britain’s opposition Labour party has asked the government why there has been no new weapons announcement since February and no fresh update from ministers to parliament since January."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/may/16/new-us-lab-aims-create-versions-atoms-never-recorded-on-earth","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-16T14:51:53Z","webTitle":"New US lab to create versions of atoms never recorded on Earth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/16/new-us-lab-aims-create-versions-atoms-never-recorded-on-earth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/may/16/new-us-lab-aims-create-versions-atoms-never-recorded-on-earth","fields":{"headline":"New US lab to create versions of atoms never recorded on Earth","bodyText":"From carbon to uranium, oxygen to iron, chemical elements are the building blocks of the world around us and the wider universe. Now, physicists are hoping to gain an unprecedented glimpse into their origins, with the opening of a new facility that will create thousands of peculiar and unstable versions of atoms never before recorded on Earth. By studying these versions, known as isotopes, they hope to gain new insights into the reactions that created the elements within exploding stars, as well as testing theories about the “strong force” – one of the four fundamental forces in nature, which binds protons and neutrons together in an atom’s nucleus. The facility could also yield new isotopes for medical use. Atoms are composed of protons, neutrons and electrons. The number of protons dictates an atom’s chemical behaviour and which element it is – eg carbon always has six protons, and gold 79 – whereas atoms of the same element containing different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Because many isotopes are unstable and decay quickly – sometimes within fractions of a second – scientists have only studied a small proportion of those thought to exist. “There are 285 isotopes of elements that exist on Earth, but we think that there are potentially 10,000 isotopes for the elements up to uranium,” said Prof Bradley Sherrill, the scientific director of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University, which officially opened on 2 May. “The goal of FRIB is to provide as wide of an access to this vast landscape of other isotopes as technology allows.” Some of these “rare isotopes” may drive reactions crucial to the formation of elements, so by studying them physicists hope to gain a better understanding of the chemical history of the universe – including how we got here. The vast majority of elements are thought to have been created within exploding stars, but “in many cases we don’t know which stars created which elements, because these reactions involve unstable isotopes – things we couldn’t readily get our hands on,” said Prof Gavin Lotay, a nuclear physicist at the University of Surrey, who plans to use the new facility to investigate common explosions called X-ray bursts within neutron stars. Another goal is to understand atomic nuclei well enough to develop a comprehensive model of them, which could provide fresh insights into the role they play in the creation of energy for stars, or the reactions occurring within nuclear power plants. The facility could also yield medically useful isotopes. Already, doctors use radioactive isotopes in eg Pet scans and some types of radiotherapy, but the discovery of additional ones could help improve diagnostic imaging, or provide new ways of seeking out and destroying tumours. To generate these isotopes, FRIB will accelerate a beam of atomic nuclei to half the speed of light and send them shooting down a 450-metre pipe, before crashing them into a target that causes some of the atoms to fragment into smaller combinations of protons and neutrons. A series of magnets will then filter out the desired isotopes and direct them into experimental chambers for further study. “Within a millionth of a second, we can select a particular isotope and deliver it to an experiment where [scientists] may catch it and watch for its radioactive decay, or we may use it to induce another nuclear reaction and use those reaction products to tell us something about the structure of the isotope,” Sherrill said. The first experiments will involve making the heaviest possible isotopes of fluorine, aluminium, magnesium and neon, and comparing their rates of radioactive decay with those predicted by existing models. “The surprise will be if our observations agree with what we expected,” Sherrill said. “Most likely they won’t agree, and then we’ll use that disagreement to refine our models.” Approximately a month later, FRIB researchers plan to measure the radioactive decay of isotopes thought to exist within neutron stars – some of the densest objects in the universe, formed when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses – to better understand their behaviour. “Finally we have the tools to enable people to do research that they’ve been waiting 30 years to do,” said Sherrill. “It’s like having a new, bigger telescope that can see further into the universe than ever before – only we’ll be seeing further in the nuclear landscape than we’ve ever been able to look before. Whenever you have a new tool like that, there’s the potential for discovery.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/nov/27/iran-nuclear-scientist-assassinated-mohsen-fakhrizadeh","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-27T19:52:25Z","webTitle":"Iran scientist's assassination appears intended to undermine nuclear deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/27/iran-nuclear-scientist-assassinated-mohsen-fakhrizadeh","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/nov/27/iran-nuclear-scientist-assassinated-mohsen-fakhrizadeh","fields":{"headline":"Iran scientist's assassination appears intended to undermine nuclear deal","bodyText":"The assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh may not much have impact on the Iranian nuclear programme he helped build, but it will certainly make it harder to salvage the deal intended to restrict that programme, and that is – so far - the most plausible motive. Israel is widely agreed to be the most likely perpetrator. Mossad is reported to have been behind a string of assassinations of other Iranian nuclear scientists – reports Israeli officials have occasionally hinted were true. According to former officials, the Obama administration leaned on Israel to discontinue those assassinations in 2013, as it started talks with Tehran that led two years later to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), by which Iran accepted constraints on its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. It would be a fair guess that Joe Biden would also oppose such assassinations when he takes office on 20 January and tries to reconstitute the JCPOA – which has been left wounded but just about alive in the wake of Donald Trump’s withdrawal in 2018. If Mossad was indeed behind the assassination, Israel had a closing window of opportunity in which to carry it out with a green light from an American president, and there seems little doubt that Trump, seeking to play a spoiler role in his last weeks in office, would have given approval, if not active assistance. He is reported to have asked for military options in Iran, in the aftermath of his election defeat. “I think they would have had to get a green light from Washington. I don’t think they would do it without,” Dina Esfandiary, a fellow at the Century Foundation, said. “In terms of motive, I think it’s just pushing Iran to do something stupid to ensure that the Biden administration’s hands are tied when they come in to pursue negotiations and de-escalation.’ Killing Fakhrizadeh would serve other ends, though arguably with less effect. When the nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) wrote up its final assessment of the military side of the Iranian programme, he was the only scientist mentioned by name, as being the mastermind behind the Amad plan to develop at least the capability of building a bomb. The IAEA found that Amad was wound up in 2003 but Fakhrizadeh remained at the hub of a network of scientists with knowledge and experience of nuclear weapons work; that work did not continue after 2003 as a “coordinated effort”. Ariane Tabatabai, Middle East fellow at the German Marshall Fund and author of a book on Iran’s national security strategy, compared the killing of Fakhrizadeh to the US assassination of the Revolutionary Guards general Qassem Suleimani at the beginning of the year. “Fakhrizadeh was to Iran’s nuclear program what Suleimani was to its proxy network,” Tabatabai said. “He was instrumental to its development and the creation of an infrastructure to support it, ensuring that his death won’t fundamentally alter the course of Iran’s nuclear programme.” Ellie Geranmayeh, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, agreed with the comparison, saying the killing was unlikely to have a profound impact on Iran’s capacity to develop nuclear weapons, if Tehran took the decision to do so. “While Fakhrizadeh is believed to have played crucial role advancing Iran’s nuclear activities, the program is not beholden to one person – just as the IRGC [Revolutionary Guards] wasn’t in case of Soleimani’s assassination,” Geranmayeh said. “The objective behind the killing wasn’t to hinder the nuclear programme but to undermine diplomacy.” If that is indeed the objective, will it succeed? Until now, Iran has been measured in its responses, both to Suleimani’s killing and to the waves of sanctions imposed by the Trump administration in the wake of the JCPOA withdrawal. But can Tehran continue to hold its nerve? A retaliatory strike could make it even harder for a Biden administration to negotiate the complex steps the US and Iran would have to take to return to compliance with the JCPOA, and open talks on other issues. The Fakhrizadeh killing may not be the last blow delivered during the last days of the Trump era. “The problem is if you keep pushing their buttons, eventually it’s going to work,” Esfandiary said. “I don’t know if this is going to be the occasion, but certainly the calls for proper action in Tehran are going to increase across the political spectrum. The hardliners have already started. So it’s becoming increasingly difficult for the Iranians to act with restraint.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jan/04/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-revises-makiivka-death-toll-to-89-zelenskiy-reiterates-warning-of-new-russian-offensive","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-04T18:59:09Z","webTitle":"Head of Ukraine military intelligence tells Kremlin to expect strikes ‘deeper and deeper’ into Russia – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jan/04/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-revises-makiivka-death-toll-to-89-zelenskiy-reiterates-warning-of-new-russian-offensive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jan/04/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-revises-makiivka-death-toll-to-89-zelenskiy-reiterates-warning-of-new-russian-offensive","fields":{"headline":"Head of Ukraine military intelligence tells Kremlin to expect strikes ‘deeper and deeper’ into Russia – as it happened","bodyText":"The blog is now closing. Here is a round up of today’s main events. Russia’s defence ministry on Wednesday blamed the illegal use of mobile phones by its soldiers for a deadly Ukrainian missile strike that it said killed 89 servicemen, raising the reported death toll significantly. Moscow previously said 63 Russian soldiers were killed in the weekend strike on Makiivka. Although an official investigation has been launched, the main reason for the attack was clearly the illegal mass use of mobile phones by servicemen, the ministry said. “This factor allowed the enemy to track and determine the coordinates of the soldiers’ location for a missile strike,” it said in a statement issued just after 1:00am in Moscow on Wednesday. The UK Ministry of Defence, in its daily intelligence briefing, said: “Given the extent of the damage, there is a realistic possibility that ammunition was being stored near to troop accommodation, which detonated during the strike creating secondary explosions. The Russian military has a record of unsafe ammunition storage from well before the current war, but this incident highlights how unprofessional practices contribute to Russia’s high casualty rate.” Denis Pushilin, who acts as the leader of pro-Russian occupiers in Donetsk, has praised the bravery of the soldiers who survived the attack. RIA quotes him saying: “We know, and we know first-hand, what it is to bear losses. And what real heroism is. Based on the information that I have, I can say with confidence that the guys from this regiment had many manifestations of courage and real heroism.” Further strikes deep in Russian territory should be expected, the head of the Ukrainian military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, has told the US TV channel ABC. He added that the attacks would come “deeper and deeper” inside Russia, without specifically saying whether Ukraine would be behind them. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, told his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that France would send light AMX-10 RC armoured combat vehicles to help in the war against Russia, an Elysee official said after a phone call between the two leaders. Ukraine’s military general staff said Russia had launched seven missile strikes, 18 airstrikes and more than 85 attacks from multiple-launch rocket systems in the past 24 hours on civilian infrastructure in three cities – Kramatorsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. “There are casualties among the civilian population,” it said. The reports have not been independently verified. Ukraine’s efforts to increase exports under the Black Sea grain deal with Russia are focused on securing faster inspections of ships rather than including more ports in the initiative, a senior Ukrainian official said on Wednesday. In a message posted to Facebook, Ukraine’s navy has claimed Russia has three combat-ready ships in action in the Black Sea and that it continues to “violate the international convention for the protection of human life at sea 1974 (Solas), disabling auto identification systems on civilian vessels in the Azov Sea”. Vladimir Putin took part in a ceremony by video link while the Russian frigate Admiral Gorshkov went into combat service equipped with the Zircon hypersonic missile systems. The Russian president said: “I am sure that such powerful weapons will reliably protect Russia from potential external threats and will help ensure the national interests of our country”. The defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the Gorshkov would sail to the Atlantic and Indian oceans and to the Mediterranean Sea. In Russia, calls have mounted to draw conclusions after the Makiivka tragedy. The influential head of state television channel RT, Margarita Simonyan, welcomed the army’s promise that officials “will be held accountable”, AFP reports. “I hope that the names of these persons” will be announced, she said. “It is time to understand that impunity does not lead to social harmony. Impunity leads to new crimes. And, as a result, to public dissent.” There have been unconfirmed reports that the servicemen were quartered in an unprotected building that was destroyed because munitions were stored on the premises and detonated in the strike. Heavy fighting around the largely ruined, Ukrainian-held city of Bakhmut is likely to persist for the foreseeable future, with the outcome uncertain as Russians have made incremental progress, according to a senior US administration official, Reuters reports. In a statement posted on Telegram, Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked President Emmanuel Macron for the decision to send the light armoured vehicles, and said the two leaders had “agreed on further cooperation to significantly strengthen our air defence and other defence capabilities”. He did not give further details. France last year supplied several Caesar howitzers to Ukraine. In October, Macron also said Paris would provide air defence weapons as Russia intensified missile strikes on critical infrastructure, Reuters reported. More on France sending AMX-10 light armoured vehicles to Ukraine. Speaking to reporters, the Élysée Palace official did not give any details about the volume or timing of the planned shipments but said the talks between the two countries would continue regarding the potential delivery of other vehicle types. “This is the first time that western-made armoured vehicles are being delivered in support of the Ukranian army,” the official said. The French-made AMX-10 is an armed reconnaissance vehicle with high mobility that carries four people, according to the French ministry of the armed forces’ website. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, told his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that France would send light AMX-10 RC armoured combat vehicles to help in the war against Russia, an Élysée Palace official said after a phone call between the two leaders, Reuters reports. Speaking to reporters, the official did not give any details about the volume or timing of the planned shipments.

He added that the attacks would come “deeper and deeper” inside of Russia, without specifically saying whether Ukraine would be behind them. Budanov said he would only be able to comment on his country’s responsibility for the attacks after the war was over. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for the 26 December attack on Russia’s Engels airbase, which is located more than 800 miles from the Ukrainian border, but Budanov admitted he was “glad to see it.” Of his visit to Bakhmut along the frontline in the Donetsk region in late December, he told ABC: “Soldiers showed me a section where dead bodies are piled up like something you would see in a movie. “There are hundreds of dead bodies just rotting away in the open field, in places they are piled on top of other bodies like makeshift walls, when Russian troops attack on that field they use those bodies for cover, like a shield. But it’s not working. There are actual fields of dead bodies there.” Budanov said he expects fighting to be the “hottest” in March, adding that Ukraine is planning a major push in the spring. Russia’s defence ministry on Wednesday blamed the illegal use of mobile phones by its soldiers for a deadly Ukrainian missile strike that it said killed 89 servicemen, raising the reported death toll significantly.

Based on the information that I have, I can say with confidence that the guys from this regiment had many manifestations of courage and real heroism.” About 200 people gathered in the Russian city of Samara on Tuesday to hold a vigil for soldiers from the city killed in the Makiivka attack. Mourners laid wreaths and roses in Samara’s central square, while priests recited prayers for the dead. Ukraine’s military general staff said Russia had launched seven missile strikes, 18 airstrikes and more than 85 attacks from multiple-launch rocket systems in the past 24 hours on civilian infrastructure in three cities – Kramatorsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. “There are casualties among the civilian population,” it said.

Defence minister Sergei Shoigu said the Gorshkov would sail to the Atlantic and Indian oceans and to the Mediterranean Sea. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has used his video address on Tuesday to reiterate warnings that Russia is set to launch a major offensive to improve its fortunes. “We have no doubt that current masters of Russia will throw everything they have left and everyone they can round up to try to turn the tide of the war and at least delay their defeat,” the Ukrainian president said. Zelenskiy spoke to his Romanian counterpart, Klaus Iohannis, on Wednesday, saying: “We agreed on steps to further develop Ukrainian-Romanian cooperation, primarily in the defence sector. I thanked Romania for its solidarity and support in resisting Russian aggression.” Germany is looking for further ways to help Ukraine protect its people and infrastructure, the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said on Wednesday, stressing that any dip in Europe’s resolve on the issue would serve as a boon to Moscow Newly released CCTV footage from the National Palace of Arts of Ukraine showed the moment a Russian missile hit the Alfavit hotel in Kyiv on 31 December, badly damaging it and a residential building. The European Union says natural gas storage levels are high despite Russian attempts to choke off supplies to Europe, AP reports. The 27 EU countries stocked up on gas last year in case of winter shortages. The EU Commission estimated that joint gas storage levels stand at almost 84% as of Wednesday. It said levels in December were 13% higher than the 2016-2018 average. Tim McPhiem, a Commission spokersperson, said “It’s a fairly good position to be in.” Russian pipeline gas accounted for 40% of all gas Europe imported before Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine in February, but has now dropped to about 9%. Energy prices have also tumbled, partly due to mild winter weather in Europe. Vladimir Putin sent a frigate to the Atlantic Ocean armed with new generation hypersonic cruise missiles on Wednesday, a signal to the west that Russia will not back down over the war in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Russia, China and the United States are in a race to develop hypersonic weapons, which are seen as a way to gain an edge over any adversary because of their speeds – more than five times the speed of sound – and manoeuvrability. In a video conference with Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, and Igor Krokhmal, the commander of the frigate named “Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov”, Putin said: “This time the ship is equipped with the latest hypersonic missile system – ‘Zircon’. I am sure that such powerful weapons will reliably protect Russia from potential external threats.” The weapons, he added, had “no analogues in any country in the world”. Shoigu said the Gorshkov would sail to the Atlantic and Indian oceans and to the Mediterranean Sea. The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has welcomed the award today of “honorary best city” of the year by PR agency Resonance Consultancy, in a move which seems designed to allow both parties to generate positive media coverage. On Telegram earlier today, Klitschko posted: The experts … noted the significant development of the city’s infrastructure over the past 10 years – the creation of new parks and squares and the improvement of old ones, putting parking in order, updating the rolling stock of municipal transport. Kyiv today is the heart of Europe. Which continues to fight - for life, for development, for the beauty of the city and the comfort of its inhabitants. In announcing the award, the agency posted an assessment of the city by Anna Babinets, who is editor-in-chief of Slidstvo.Info, an investigative reporting outlet based in Kyiv. Writing about the city, she said: How different things looked in February, when Russia launched its illegal war against Ukraine. Pundits around the world predicted the city’s imminent fall. Rockets rained on peaceful apartment blocks. Half of the city’s residents left. A column of Russian military vehicles stretched for kilometres on its murderous advance into the city. Although the Russians intended to capture Ukraine’s capital in three days, they never came close. Facing determined resistance and crippled by their own incompetence, they soon abandoned their ambitious plans. A few months later, most Kyivans returned home. This isn’t the first time Kyiv has sprung back to life. The city’s history is full of wars and revolutions – after each of which it inevitably blooms again in a 1,500-year cycle of devastation and rebirth. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has taken part today in a ceremony today – via video link – while the Russian frigate Admiral Gorshkov went into combat service equipped with the Zircon hypersonic missile systems. Russian state-owned media agency Tass quoted Putin as saying: I am sure that such powerful weapons will reliably protect Russia from potential external threats and will help ensure the national interests of our country. Today we have an important, if not a significant event: the Admiral Gorshkov frigate is starting a long-distance sea voyage. There is nothing unusual here, this is a common thing. But this time the ship is equipped with the latest Zircon hypersonic missile system, which has no analogues. During the event Reuters reports that the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the Gorshkov would sail to the Atlantic and Indian oceans and to the Mediterranean Sea. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has just posted a message on Telegram following a call with Klaus Iohannis, his Romanian counterpart. Zelenskiy says: Together with Klaus Iohannis we agreed on steps to further develop Ukrainian-Romanian cooperation, primarily in the defence sector. I thanked Romania for its solidarity and support in resisting Russian aggression. We discussed the peace formula and issues of the bilateral agenda. Moscow was facing some of its biggest internal criticism of the war over the Ukrainian strike on New Year’s Eve that killed 89 service personnel, and which it has blamed on soldiers illegally using mobile phones allowing Ukraine to locate the base in Makiivka. Semyon Pegov, a war correspondent decorated by Putin, said on Telegram the mobile phone explanation “looks like an outright attempt to smear the blame”, and there were other ways Ukraine could have spotted the base, Reuters reports. Other pro-Russian bloggers have said the strike was worsened because ammunition was stored at the site. Moscow has not confirmed this. Pegov said the death toll would rise further: “The announced data is most likely for those who were immediately identified. The list of the missing, unfortunately, is noticeably longer.” In its daily update on Wednesday, Ukraine’s military general staff said Russia had launched seven missile strikes, 18 airstrikes and more than 85 attacks from multiple-launch rocket systems in the past 24 hours on civilian infrastructure in three cities – Kramatorsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – Reuters reports. “There are casualties among the civilian population,” it said. Russia denies targeting civilians. The battlefield reports could not be independently verified by Reuters. About 200 people gathered in the Russian city of Samara on Tuesday to hold a vigil for soldiers killed by a Ukrainian rocket strike in Makiivka, eastern Donetsk, on New Year’s Eve. Mourners laid wreaths and roses in Samara’s central square, while priests recited prayers for the dead. Putin plans to talk to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Wednesday, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told Interfax. Turkey acted as mediator alongside the United Nations to establish a deal allowing grain exports from Ukrainian ports. Ukraine’s efforts to increase exports under the Black Sea grain deal with Russia are currently focused on securing faster inspections of ships rather than including more ports in the initiative, a senior Ukrainian official said on Wednesday, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s grain production and exports have fallen since Russia invaded in February and started blockading its seaports. Three leading Ukrainian Black Sea ports in the Odesa region were unblocked in July under an initiative between Moscow and Kyiv brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. Under the deal, all ships are inspected by joint teams in the Bosphorus. Kyiv accuses Russia of carrying out the inspections too slowly, causing weeks of delays for ships and reducing the supply of Ukrainian grain to foreign markets. Russia has denied slowing down the process. “Ukraine focuses on normalising inspections rather than opening new ports,” the senior Ukrainian official said. Germany is looking for further ways to help Ukraine protect its people and infrastructure, the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said on Wednesday, stressing that any dip in Europe’s resolve on the issue would serve as a boon to Moscow, Reuters reports. “And this year, we must protect and further develop the joint European unity that made us strong last year,” Baerbock said during a news conference with her Portuguese counterpart in Lisbon. Russia is deploying new military units to the northern part of occupied Crimea, Andrii Cherniak, a representative of the Ukrainian defence ministry’s main intelligence directorate, said, according to a report on the Kyiv Independent website. Russia is also reportedly fortifying the area and parts of Kherson Oblast, the report adds. “They (Russia) are losing. That’s why they create defensive structures where they can, realising that they will have to conduct combat operations on these lines,” he said. Cherniak said that Russian forces are currently making “every effort” to preserve the so-called land corridor to Crimea through occupied Ukrainian territories in the south of the country. Ukraine wants the United Nations to send peacekeepers to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant even without a deal with Russia to establish a safety zone there, the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company said. Ukraine has called for UN peacekeepers at the site since September. But the comment was the first time a Ukraine nuclear official has suggested publicly peacekeepers should be deployed in the absence of an agreement to create a safety zone at the plant, which Russia took control of soon after invading the country on 24 February. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said on Wednesday that the European Union had tried everything to stop the war in Ukraine but that Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, had nothing on his mind but to destroy the neighbouring country. Speaking at a conference in Portugal’s capital, Lisbon, Baerbock said Putin’s stance was the reason why it was “important to keep up the delivery of weapons so Ukraine can defend itself and protect people’s lives”. Russia’s defence ministry on Wednesday blamed the illegal use of mobile phones by its soldiers for a deadly Ukrainian missile strike that it said killed 89 servicemen, raising the reported death toll significantly. Moscow previously said 63 Russian soldiers were killed in the weekend strike on Makiivka. Although an official investigation has been launched, the main reason for the attack was clearly the illegal mass use of mobile phones by servicemen, the ministry said. “This factor allowed the enemy to track and determine the coordinates of the soldiers’ location for a missile strike,” it said in a statement issued just after 1:00 am in Moscow on Wednesday.

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, used his video address on Tuesday to reiterate warnings that Russia is set to launch a major offensive to improve its fortunes. “We have no doubt that current masters of Russia will throw everything they have left and everyone they can round up to try to turn the tide of the war and at least delay their defeat,” Zelenskiy said in a video address. Ukraine and the EU will hold a summit in Kyiv on 3 February to discuss financial and military support, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office said, but the bloc on Tuesday would not confirm the location, AFP reports. The US president, Joe Biden, will hold talks with Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, at the White House on 13 January to discuss North Korea, Ukraine, China’s tensions with Taiwan, and a “free and open Indo-Pacific”, the White House said on Tuesday. Oleksandr Syenkevych, mayor of Mykolaiv, has posted to Telegram to say that the air alert is over. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has published its latest situation map of how it assess the war to be going on the ground. Earlier the UK issued its latest defence intelligence update. It said of the attack at Makiyivka: The building was completely destroyed and, as the Russian MoD confirmed, 89 Russian personnel were killed. Given the extent of the damage, there is a realistic possibility that ammunition was being stored near to troop accommodation, which detonated during the strike creating secondary explosions. The building was only 12.5km from the Avdiivka sector of front line, one of the most intensely contested areas of the conflict. The Russian military has a record of unsafe ammunition storage from well before the current war, but this incident highlights how unprofessional practices contribute to Russia’s high casualty rate. This video clip purports to show damage in Kyiv caused by a Russian strike on 31 December which was captured on CCTV. The clip has not been independently verified. Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s latest message on Telegram has included some recent images of the conflict and the following text from Ukraine’s president: We are fighting and will continue to fight. For the sake of the main word: “victory.” It will come for sure. We’ve been heading for it for 315 days. In a message posted to Facebook, Ukraine’s navy has claimed that Russia has three combat-ready ships in action in the Black Sea, and that it continues to “violate the international convention for the protection of human life at sea 1974 (Solas), disabling auto identification systems on civilian vessels in the Azov Sea.” Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, has posted to Telegram to report that there is an air alert in the region. At the same time Suspilne, Ukraine’s state-owned broadcaster, has reported there is an air alert in effect in Kyiv. There are unconfirmed reports that air defence was activated twice in the Sevastopol region overnight. Sevastopol is in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The Kyiv Independent, citing the Telegram channel of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, said that Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, reported that air defence had been activated. Suspilne, the state-owned national broadcaster of Ukraine, has reported on Telegram that its correspondents in Kherson have heard explosions. More details soon … The city administration in Kyiv has said that 160 million passengers used the city’s subway in 2022, compared with 319 million passengers the previous year. It also said that about 5.200 people used the network for shelter on New Year’s Eve. In a statement posted to Telegram, the city authority said: On new year’s eve, during the air raid, about 5,200 people, including almost 400 children, used underground stations as shelter. The subway infrastructure operates 24/7 as a shelter and provides the most necessary conditions: drinking water, sanitary facilities and the possibility of recharging gadgets. The message continued by urging residents to “take care of yourself and use shelters during the air alert”. Vitaliy Kim, governor of Mykolaiv, has also posted to Telegram with the simple message: “Good morning! No power outages.” Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has published his regular daily status update to Telegram. He reports that overnight there were no air alarms, and that at present electricity blackouts are not anticipated in his western region of Ukraine. Even as the officially conceded death toll from the attack on a temporary Russian barracks in a vocational college in occupied Makiivka has been revised upwards, the Russian state-owned news outlet RIA is reporting that Denis Pushilin, who acts as the leader of pro-Russian occupiers in Donetsk, has praised the bravery of the soldiers there. RIA quotes him saying: We know, and we know first-hand, what it is to bear losses. And what real heroism is. Based on the information that I have, I can say with confidence that the guys from this regiment had many manifestations of courage and real heroism. Pushilin is the self-styled leader of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), one of the areas of Ukraine the Russian Federation has claimed to annex. Prior to the annexation claim, only three UN member states – Russia, Syria and North Korea – recognised the DPR as any kind of legitimate authority. Ukraine and the EU will hold a summit in Kyiv on 3 February to discuss financial and military support, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office said, but the bloc on Tuesday would not confirm the location, AFP reports. Zelenskiy discussed details of the high-level meeting with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, in his first phone call of the year, the office said in a statement on Monday. “The parties discussed expected results of the next Ukraine-EU summit to be held on 3 February in Kyiv and agreed to intensify preparatory work,” it said. A spokesperson for European Council president, Charles Michel, however, could not confirm on Tuesday that the joint summit would take place in the Ukrainian capital. He said the bloc would be represented at the summit by Michel and Von der Leyen, and not with the various leaders of EU countries. EU officials said there was a standing invitation for Zelenskiy to visit Brussels. Zelenskiy and Von der Leyen, in their call, also talked about the supply of “appropriate” weapons. The US president, Joe Biden, will hold talks with Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, at the White House on 13 January to discuss North Korea, Ukraine, China’s tensions with Taiwan, and a “free and open Indo-Pacific”, the White House said on Tuesday. The two leaders will discuss “a range of regional and global issues, including the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programmes, Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine, and maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” the White House said. The meeting between Washington and its key Asian partner in standing up to China’s increasing might comes as North Korea’s missile tests and calls for a larger nuclear arsenal worry US allies in the region. Kishida plans to discuss Tokyo’s new security policy, which saw the unveiling in December of Japan’s biggest military buildup since the second world war, Japan’s Yomiuri daily newspaper reported last week, citing multiple unidentified Japanese government sources. The White House said Biden will reiterate his full support for Japan’s recently released national security strategy. A Tokyo Gas unit is in advanced talks to buy US natural gas producer Rockcliff Energy from private equity firm Quantum Energy Partners for about $4.6bn, including debt, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. Reuters reports: If consummated, the deal would be the latest move by a Japanese entity to secure gas in jurisdictions perceived as friendly, the importance of which has risen for the import-dependent Asian nation after supply markets for the commodity were roiled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The all-cash deal with Houston-based TG Natural Resources, which is 70% owned by the Japanese energy firm, is set to be announced this month, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the discussions are confidential. Castleton Commodities International owns the rest of TG Natural Resources. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, used his video address on Tuesday to reiterate warnings that Russia is set to launch a major offensive to improve its fortunes. “We have no doubt that current masters of Russia will throw everything they have left and everyone they can round up to try to turn the tide of the war and at least delay their defeat,” Zelenskiy said in a video address. “We have to disrupt this Russian scenario. We are preparing for this. The terrorists must lose. Any attempt at their new offensive must fail,” he continued. Ukraine’s military has said it launched a strike that resulted in Russian loss of equipment and possibly personnel near Makiivka. But it has given no further details. Russia’s defence ministry on Wednesday blamed the illegal use of mobile phones by its soldiers for a deadly Ukrainian missile strike that it said killed 89 servicemen, raising the reported death toll significantly. Moscow previously said 63 Russian soldiers were killed in the weekend strike. The ministry’s reaction came amid mounting anger among some Russian commentators, who are increasingly vocal about what they see as a half-hearted campaign in Ukraine. Most of the anger on social media was directed at military commanders rather than Russian president Vladimir Putin, who has not commented publicly on the attack, which was another blow after major battlefield retreats in recent months. The Russian defence ministry said four Ukrainian missiles hit a temporary Russian barracks in a vocational college in Makiivka, twin city of the Russian-occupied regional capital of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Although an official investigation has been launched, the main reason for the attack was clearly the illegal mass use of mobile phones by servicemen, the ministry said. “This factor allowed the enemy to track and determine the coordinates of the soldiers’ location for a missile strike,” it said in a statement issued just after 1:00 am in Moscow on Wednesday. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest news for the next while. Russia’s defence ministry has acknowledged that 89 servicemen died in a Ukrainian strike on Makiivka in eastern Ukraine on New Year’s Eve, an increase in the previous reported death toll. Military officials have blamed the use of mobile phones by Russian soldiers within “reach of enemy soldiers” for the deadly attack. Moscow said previously 63 Russian soldiers were killed in the weekend strike. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address late on Tuesday that Russia was set to launch a major offensive, repeating earlier warnings. “We have no doubt that current masters of Russia will throw everything they have left and everyone they can round up to try to turn the tide of the war and at least delay their defeat,” Zelenskiy said. Here are the other key recent developments: The Ukrainian strike on Makiivka has generated “significant criticism of Russian military leadership”, according to a report from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). Several prominent Russian pro-war bloggers and commentators acknowledged the attack, with many suggesting the number of casualties was higher than the figures officially reported. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces has said up to 10 units of Russian military equipment of various types in occupied Makiivka were damaged or destroyed. Ukraine rarely announces responsibility for attacks on Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine, but its military reported the Makiivka attack as “a strike on Russian manpower and military equipment”. Satellite images taken by the US-based company Planet Labs that purportedly show the aftermath of the strike on Makiivka have circulated online, showing the building that allegedly housed the Russian troops before and after it was hit. The images, dated 2 January, show a building almost completely razed. Unverified footage posted online of the aftermath of the blast also showed a huge building reduced to smoking rubble. The UK’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, reaffirmed support for Ukraine during a call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The two men discussed further defence cooperation, their statements said. On national television in Ukraine, Yuriy Ignat, spokesperson for the Ukraine air force, said nearly 500 Russian drones have been downed since September. It is unlikely Russia will achieve a significant breakthrough near Bakhmut in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region in the coming weeks, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. This is due in part to Russia likely conducting offensive operations in the area at only platoon or section level, it said. The French prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, has said she is more confident over the situation of French energy supplies for the next few weeks. She cited lower consumption and an increase in nuclear power output. Nato countries will discuss their defence spending targets in the coming months as some of them call for turning a 2% target into a minimum figure, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, told the German news agency DPA. Ukraine and the EU will hold a summit in Kyiv on 3 February to discuss financial and military support, Zelenskiy’s office has said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/11/down-to-earth-radiators-vladimir-putin-russia-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-11T10:20:47Z","webTitle":"Can turning down our radiators turn up the heat on Vladimir Putin?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/11/down-to-earth-radiators-vladimir-putin-russia-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/11/down-to-earth-radiators-vladimir-putin-russia-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Can turning down our radiators turn up the heat on Vladimir Putin?","bodyText":"This piece first appeared in Down to Earth, the Guardian’s climate crisis newsletter. Sign up here to read more exclusive pieces like this and for a digest of the week’s biggest environment stories every Thursday Turning down the thermostat by 1C might not sound like much of a gesture when thousands of people are being killed in Vladimir Putin’s brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, but it may be one of the few ways by which ordinary people in Europe, and around the world, can make an impact on the horrific events. Europe is highly dependent on Russian gas, which makes up 45% of EU gas imports. And with prices sky-high – partly because of Putin’s actions – an estimated $500m a day is pouring into Russian coffers to fight the Kremlin’s war. If Europe wants to stop Putin, sanctions are needed, but so too are alternative sources of energy. The Ukraine war has starkly revealed a truth that governments failed to learn from throughout the climate crisis: that energy is a matter of national security, and getting off fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable power is a source of strength. Putin tightened the flow of Russian gas to Europe by about a quarter in the months leading up to his invasion, and prices have soared in response. He has used Russia’s dominance of Europe’s gas market as an “economic and political weapon”, the chief of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, said last week. The global energy watchdog laid out a 10-point proposal showing how Europe could reduce its consumption of Russian gas by about a third, including advice to consumers to turn down their thermostats by only 1C, from an average of 22C to an average of 21C – a level that maintains comfort and that most people will barely notice, but which will save about 10bn cubic metres out of the 155bn imported annually from Russia. Other measures could save more: ramping up renewable energy; insulating homes; a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies that have enjoyed a bonanza amid high energy prices, with the proceeds used to reduce bills for hard-pressed consumers; and delaying the planned closure of several nuclear power stations. All these are likely to be needed, and more. There is a serious danger, too, that governments will seek return to the coal-fired power stations they were phasing out – though they should note that about half of the coal used in the EU is imported from Russia. European countries are now re-evaluating their energy systems as a matter of urgency, and the results will help determine how the bloc tackles the climate crisis. Ironically, amid all this: Russia, if it wanted, could make a massive difference to the climate crisis, and at no cost. The IEA also found, in a separate report, that Russia is one of the biggest emitters of methane, the main component of natural gas, through its ageing and poorly constructed fossil fuel production infrastructure. Simply plugging those leaks – which would be profitable, because more gas could then be sold – could go a long way to help reduce temperature rises by 0.2C in the 2040s. But a country willing to slaughter today’s children with bombs and bullets is unlikely to balk at killing tomorrow’s through climate breakdown."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/09/russian-airbase-on-western-coast-of-crimea-damaged-in-explosions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-09T23:36:54Z","webTitle":"Russian airbase on western coast of Crimea damaged in explosions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/09/russian-airbase-on-western-coast-of-crimea-damaged-in-explosions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/09/russian-airbase-on-western-coast-of-crimea-damaged-in-explosions","fields":{"headline":"Russian airbase on western coast of Crimea damaged in explosions","bodyText":"A Russian airbase deep behind the frontline in Crimea has been damaged by several large explosions, killing at least one person, although it was not immediately clear whether it had been targeted by a long-range Ukrainian missile strike. Multiple social media videos showed explosions and clouds emerging from the Saky military base in Novofedorivka on the western coast of Crimea on Tuesday afternoon, prompting questions about how a location more than 100 miles (160km) from the frontline could have been attacked. Later a senior Ukrainian official appeared to claim responsibility, without giving details. Russia’s defence ministry told the RIA Novosti news agency that the explosions took place at about 3.20pm local time, and that “several aviation munitions detonated” in a storage area. It said it was trying to discern the cause of the incident. Russian tourists holidaying on beaches nearby could be seen leaving in fear. It is one of few occasions that the peninsula, occupied by Russia since 2014, has been directly affected by the latest fighting. Local people told one Russian news site that explosions went on for an hour. Sergey Aksyonov, the Russian-appointed head of occupied Crimea, said one person had died. Earlier, he had filmed a video statement near the site, with smoke rising in the distance, saying that ambulance crews and medics were on the scene. In his nightly address, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, did not discuss who was behind the attacks but vowed to “liberate” Crimea , saying “This Russian war against Ukraine and against the entire free Europe began with Crimea and must end with Crimea - with its liberation. “Russia has turned our peninsula, which has always been and will be one of the best places in Europe, into one of the most dangerous places in Europe. But we will return to the Ukrainian Crimea. From the Kharkiv region to Kherson, from Donetsk to Enerhodar, from Stanytsia Luhanska to Yalta, from Berdyansk to Novofedorivka – these are all parts of our country, this is Ukraine, which will be completely free. One adviser to the president, Mikhail Podolyak, said Ukraine was not taking responsibility for the explosions, suggesting partisans might have been involved. Asked by the Dozhd online television channel whether Kyiv was taking responsibility, replied: “Of course not. What do we have to do with this?” Earlier, he appeared to suggest the strike could herald a new phase of the conflict. Podolyak said that Kyiv’s long-term goal was “demilitarisation of the Russian Federation”. He added: “The future of the Crimea is to be a pearl of the Black Sea, a national park with unique nature and a world resort. Not a military base for terrorists. It is just the beginning.” Ukraine’s defence ministry said it could not determine the cause of the explosions but added, sardonically, that people should have regard for the rules of fire safety and “the prohibition of smoking in unspecified places”. The airbase, where Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill landed en route to the Yalta conference in February 1945, is too far – about 110 miles – from the frontline to be struck by conventional land-based Ukrainian rockets. It could, however, be in range of other longer-range systems. In the previous 24 hours there had been growing speculation about Ukraine’s missile capability after the US confirmed, for the first time, that it had supplied Kyiv with long-range anti-radiation missiles, used to knock out air defence systems. A Pentagon spokesperson said on Monday that the US had previously supplied a number of the weapons to Ukraine, but declined to say how many or of what type. The weapons are widely believed to be the AGM-88 high-speed anti-radiation (Harm) missile, a tail fin of which was being circulated by Russian bloggers on Sunday. They are typically launched from a plane and have a maximum range of about 90 miles. Over the last month, Ukraine has shown it is able to strike deeper and deeper into Russian-held territory using the Himars rocket artillery, which has a range of about 50 miles. However, there were other suggestions that the Saky base was hit by a guerrilla operation. Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of the state-owned Russia Today outlet, appeared to suggest in a tweet that the explosions were caused by sabotage – although she later said the explosion was caused by “several munitions” detonating in storage. In her later posts, Simonyan said there had been no missile strikes and added that claims Kyiv’s forces could strike 300km (186 miles) were “Ukropropaganda”. She advised people to “exhale and go to the beach”. Other videos, however, showed traffic jams forming as people sought to flee Crimea. The Saky airbase is about 165 miles from the Ukrainian city of Odesa, prompting speculation it could have been targeted by Neptune missiles previously used to knock out the Russian Moskva warship. The anti-ship missiles have a range of about 190 miles and can be used to hit ground targets. A Ukrainian official, speaking anonymously, told the New York Times that “a device exclusively of Ukrainian manufacture was used” in the attack. That could suggest it was a Neptune, a cruise missile developed by Ukraine and which first became operationally available in the early phases of the war. Earlier on Tuesday, officials said at least three Ukrainian civilians were killed and 23 were wounded by Russian shelling in 24 hours, including in an attack not far from the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The governor of Dnipropetrovsk region, Valentyn Reznichenko, said that Russian forces firing more than 120 rockets at the town of Nikopol, across the Dnieper River from the plant, damaged several apartment buildings and industrial sites. The prime ministers of Estonia and Finland have called on fellow European countries to stop issuing tourist visas to Russian citizens, saying they should not be able to take holidays in Europe while the Russian government carries out a war in Ukraine. Kaja Kallas, the Estonian prime minister, said on Tuesday that “visiting Europe is a privilege, not a human right” and that it was “time to end tourism from Russia now”, a day after a similar appeal from her counterpart in Finland, Sanna Marin. Zelenskiy went further in a Washington Post interview on Monday and called for a full travel ban and the expulsion of Russians who had moved to the west. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the idea amounted to “irrational thinking”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/07/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-196-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T18:17:31Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 196 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/07/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-196-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/07/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-196-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 196 of the invasion","bodyText":"Ukrainian forces have attacked the Russian-occupied eastern town of Balakliia in the Kharkiv region, a senior Russian-appointed official has said. Daniil Bezsonov added that if the town were lost, Russian forces in Izium would become vulnerable on their north-west flank. The Luhansk region’s governor, Serhiy Haidai, told Ukrainian television that a “counterattack is under way and … our forces are enjoying some success. Let’s leave it at that.” A Ukrainian counteroffensive is occurring in eastern and north-eastern Ukraine as well as in the south, a senior presidential adviser has claimed. Writing on Telegram, Oleksiy Arestovych said that in the coming months Ukraine could expect the defeat of Russian troops in the Kherson region on the western bank of the Dnieper River and a significant Ukraine advance in the east. Ukrainian forces are planning for a long and brutal campaign with the goal of taking back most of the Russian-occupied region of Kherson by the end of the year, according to reports. Ukraine’s goal of recapturing Kherson by the end of 2022 is ambitious but possible, US officials said. Ukraine has claimed to have destroyed a key strategic bridge used by Russian forces in Kherson. Ukraine’s armed forces shared a series of satellite images purported to show the damaged structure on Tuesday night. The military said the images showed “significant damage to the Daryiv bridge itself” as well as damage to a building near the river. Ukrainian troops could be in a position to seize the entire right bank of the Dnieper, including Kherson city, by October, according to a French general. Ukrainian forces have methodically prepared their counterattack in the southern Kherson region, launching offensives on “almost the entire southern frontline”, Gen Dominique Trinquand, a former head of the French military mission to the UN, said. Ukraine’s top military chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, has claimed responsibility for a series of strikes on Russian airbases in Crimea. The strikes used missiles or rockets and 10 warplanes were destroyed, he said. The attacks Zaluzhnyi took responsibility for reportedly included the devastating August strike on the Saki military facility. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk has urged residents of Russian-occupied areas around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to evacuate for their own safety. The town of Enerhodar, which serves the nuclear plant, has come under fire from Russian forces and lost electricity, according to its exiled Ukrainian mayor. Ukraine is considering shutting down the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant for safety reasons, according to Kyiv’s top nuclear safety expert. Oleh Korikov also expressed concerns about the reserves of diesel fuel used for backup generators. Vladimir Putin has accused Ukraine of threatening Europe’s nuclear security by shelling the plant, and claimed Russia has no military equipment at the facility. Russia has reportedly resumed shelling near the nuclear plant. A local official said the city of Nikopol – on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River from Zaporizhzhia – was fired on with rockets and heavy artillery. The report has not been independently verified. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency has said the world is facing “a very grave danger” as shelling continues at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. In his first television interview since leading an expert mission to the Russian-held plant, Rafael Grossi said what was “urgently needed” was to establish a protection around the perimeter of the facility. The UN nuclear watchdog has said its experts found extensive damage at the plant, in a report presented to the UN security council on Tuesday. The report said Ukrainian staff were operating under constant high stress and pressure where there was an increased possibility of human error. “We are playing with fire and something very, very catastrophic could take place,” the IAEA chief warned. Ukraine’s nuclear chief has said he would support the deployment of UN peacekeepers to Zaporizhzhia. The remarks by Petro Kotyn, the head of Ukraine’s nuclear agency Energoatom, came a day after the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for a demilitarised zone around the nuclear plant. The head of the EU executive has set out plans for windfall taxes, mandatory electricity savings and a cap on the price of Russian gas to limit Kremlin revenues used to finance the “atrocious” war in Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen outlined a five-point plan in response to an energy price crisis driven by the Russian shutdown of the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline but exacerbated by the climate crisis and lingering effects of the Covid pandemic. Vladimir Putin said western sanctions on Russia were shortsighted and a danger for the entire world, which he said was increasingly turning towards Asia. In a speech to the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, he also claimed the developing world had been “cheated” by a landmark grain deal designed to alleviate a food crisis. Putin also threatened to cut off energy supplies if price caps were imposed on Russia’s oil and gas exports. Russia would walk away from its supply contracts if the west went ahead with its plans, Putin said, warning that Russia would “sentence the wolf’s tail to be frozen”. Germany is well placed to survive the winter despite turmoil in the energy markets, its chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said. Scholz vowed that Germany would keep moving “at great speed” to shed its reliance on Russia for power, adding that gas reserves were at over 86% capacity and would be used to heat homes, generate electricity and power industry. Vladimir Putin will meet his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Uzbekistan next week, according to a Russian official. The pair plan to meet on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s summit in the Uzbek city of Samarkand on 15-16 September, Russia’s ambassador to China, Andrei Denisov, said. It would the first face-to-face between the two leaders since Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February. Britain’s new prime minister, Liz Truss, and her US counterpart, Joe Biden, have promised to strengthen their relationship in the face of Putin’s aggression. Truss’s call to Biden on Tuesday night followed a conversation with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and focused on what she called “extreme economic problems caused by Putin’s war”. Putin said the way Britain chooses its leaders is “far from democratic”, a day after Liz Truss replaced Boris Johnson as prime minister. In his first public comments on Truss’s appointment, the Russian president alluded to the fact she was chosen in a leadership ballot by members of the Conservative party, not by the whole country. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have reached an agreement in principle to restrict the entry of Russian citizens travelling from Russia and Belarus, the Latvian foreign minister said. Edgars Rinkēvičs said the increase of border crossings by Russian citizens was “a public security issue […] also an issue of a moral and political nature”. The leader of Russia’s governing party has proposed that a referendum should be held in occupied regions of Ukraine on 4 November on whether to become part of Russia. Andrei Turchak, the head of Vladimir Putin’s United Russia party, said it would be “correct and symbolic” to hold votes on that date, a Russian public holiday which is celebrated as the day of national unity. A Russian colonel who served as the military commandant of the occupied Ukrainian city of Berdiansk was killed in a car bombing, according to Russian state media reports. Russian officials have alleged that Ukraine was behind the attack on Col Artyom Bardin. If true, it would be the most significant assassination yet of an official working for the occupational government of Russia in Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/mar/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-russian-assault-on-bakhmut-has-largely-stalled-says-uk","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-25T21:02:47Z","webTitle":"Moscow ‘has deal with Belarus to station nuclear weapons’, says Putin – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-russian-assault-on-bakhmut-has-largely-stalled-says-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/mar/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-russian-assault-on-bakhmut-has-largely-stalled-says-uk","fields":{"headline":"Moscow ‘has deal with Belarus to station nuclear weapons’, says Putin – as it happened","bodyText":"It is slightly past 11pm in Kyiv. Here are today’s key developments: Russia has struck a deal with neighbouring Belarus to station tactical nuclear weapons on its territory, Tass news agency quoted president Vladimir Putin as saying on Saturday. Such a move would not violate nuclear nonproliferation agreements, Putin said, adding that the United States had stationed nuclear weapons on the territory of European allies. Ukraine’s deputy minister of defense Hanna Maliar went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. Russian oil company Gazprom reduces gas export to EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On March 24, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5 million cubic meters. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2 million cubic meters. The head of the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious.” Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid. The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. “The Bakhmut direction is the most difficult. Thanks to the titanic efforts of the defence forces, the situation is being stabilised,” said Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi in a post on Telegram, giving a synopsis of a telephone call with Adm Sir Tony Radakin, Britain’s chief of defence staff. At least 10 civilians were killed and 20 wounded in several parts of Ukraine during long-range Russian bombardments on Friday, officials said. The casualties included two people who died in heavy Russian shelling of the town of Bilopillia in Sumy province in northern Ukraine, President Zelenskiy’s office said. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reported that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Russia’s Vladimir Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict between Russia and Ukraine through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported. More than 5,000 former criminals have been pardoned after finishing their contracts to fight in Russia’s Wagner mercenary group against Ukraine, the founder of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said on Saturday. The Wagner group, originally staffed by battle-hardened veterans of the Russian armed forces, took on a much more prominent role in the Ukraine war after the Russian army suffered a series of humiliating defeats last year, Reuters reported. The United Nations has said it is “deeply concerned” by what it said were summary executions of prisoners of war by both Russian and Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. A new report from the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights said its monitors had documented dozens of the executions by both sides, that the actual number was likely higher and that they “may constitute war crimes”. Police in Russia have placed a former speechwriter for Vladimir Putin on a wanted list of suspects, the latest step in a sweeping crackdown on dissent. The Associated Press reports that Abbas Gallyamov wrote speeches for Putin during the Russian leader’s 2008-12 stint as prime minister. Gallyamov later became an outspoken political consultant and analyst who was frequently quoted by Russian and foreign media. He has lived abroad in recent years. The Russian former president Dmitry Medvedev said Moscow was readying for a Ukrainian counteroffensive that “everyone knows” Kyiv is preparing for. Medvedev, who is deputy chair of Putin’s security council, warned that Moscow was ready to use “absolutely any weapon” if Ukraine attempted to retake the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. Russia’s parliament speaker has proposed banning the activities of the international criminal court (ICC) after the court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accusing him of war crimes. Vyacheslav Volodin, an ally of Putin’s, said on Saturday that Russian legislation should be amended to prohibit any activity of the ICC in Russia and to punish any who gave “assistance and support” to the court. Russian forces attacked northern and southern stretches of the front in eastern Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region on Friday. Ukrainian military reports described heavy fighting along a line running from Lyman to Kupiansk, as well as in the south at Avdiivka on the outskirts of the Russian-held city of Donetsk. New Zealand’s foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, has expressed concern to China over any provision of lethal aid to support Russia in its war against Ukraine during a meeting with her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang. Mahuta’s press office on Saturday detailed her cautionary remarks in Beijing, days after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, concluded his trip to Moscow, where Xi and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, praised each other and spoke of a profound friendship, AP reported. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, as we wrap up the blog for today. Thank you for following along. A new EU sanctions package will be adopted in the next two weeks, Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Saturday, the Kyiv Independent reports. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons has condemned Russian president Vladimir Putin’s announcement on placing nuclear weapons in Belarus. “As long as President Putin has nuclear weapons, Europe cannot be safe. He justfies this dangerous escalation by citing decades of NATO nuclear sharing. As long as countries continue their complicity in considering nuclear weapons as anything other than a global problem, this helps give Putin cover to get away with this kind of behaviour,” ICAN’s interim executive director Daniel Hoegsta said in a statement. Ukraine’s deputy minister of defense Hanna Maliar went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. She added that details “are disclosed by the three aforementioned officials only when there is a military task requiring it. Because information is also a weapon and we fight with it too,” referring to the supreme commander in chief (president), the defense minister, and the chief commander. Russian oil company Gazprom reduces gas export to EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On March 24, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5 million cubic meters. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2 million cubic meters. Here are some additional comments from president Putin on the agreement with Belarus. Russia will have completed the construction of a storage facility for tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus by July 1, Putin said, adding that Russia would not actually be transferring control of the arms to Minsk. He added that Russia has already stationed 10 aircraft in Belarus capable of carrying tactical nuclear weapons, Reuters reports. Russia has struck a deal with neighbouring Belarus to station tactical nuclear weapons on its territory, Tass news agency quoted president Vladimir Putin as saying on Saturday. Such a move would not violate nuclear nonproliferation agreements, Putin said, adding that the United States had stationed nuclear weapons on the territory of European allies. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has long raised the issue of stationing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, which borders Poland, Putin said. “We agreed with Lukashenko that we would place tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus without violating the nonproliferation regime,” Tass quoted Putin. The head of the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”. The visit will be Grossi’s second to the plant, Reuters reports. Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid. “Last night the Russian army attacked a ‘point of invincibility’ in the Donetsk region’s Kostiantynivka. Today’s target for Russian artillery is a humanitarian aid delivery point in Kherson. “Two people were injured in enemy shelling, a 41-year-old woman and a 25-year-old man,” Prokudin added. The time in Kyiv is 6pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s news so far: The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. “The Bakhmut direction is the most difficult. Thanks to the titanic efforts of the defence forces, the situation is being stabilised,” said Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi in a post on Telegram, giving a synopsis of a telephone call with Adm Sir Tony Radakin, Britain’s chief of defence staff. At least 10 civilians were killed and 20 wounded in several parts of Ukraine during long-range Russian bombardments on Friday, officials said. The casualties included two people who died in heavy Russian shelling of the town of Bilopillia in Sumy province in northern Ukraine, President Zelenskiy’s office said. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reported that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Russia’s Vladimir Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict between Russia and Ukraine through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported.

That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Nadeem Badshah will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from Russia’s war against Ukraine. The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. “The Bakhmut direction is the most difficult. Thanks to the titanic efforts of the defence forces, the situation is being stabilised,” said Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi in a post on Telegram, giving a synopsis of a telephone call with Adm Sir Tony Radakin, Britain’s chief of defence staff. The seven-month battle for Bakhmut, where Russian forces have closed in on three sides, is the longest clash of the war, with Russia deploying regular soldiers and fighters of the mercenary Wagner group. Here are some of the latest images coming through from Ukraine: More than 5,000 former criminals have been pardoned after finishing their contracts to fight in Russia’s Wagner mercenary group against Ukraine, the founder of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said on Saturday. The Wagner group, originally staffed by battle-hardened veterans of the Russian armed forces, took on a much more prominent role in the Ukraine war after the Russian army suffered a series of humiliating defeats last year, Reuters reported. Prigozhin emerged from the shadows and recruited thousands of men from prisons, offering them the chance of freedom in return for serving in some of the most dangerous battles in Ukraine. “At the present time, more than 5,000 people have been released on pardon after completing their contracts with Wagner,” Prigozhin, a close ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in an audio clip posted on Telegram. Prigozhin said just 0.31% of those pardoned after Wagner service had gone on to commit crime, a figure he said was 10-20 times less than the standard indicators. Prigozhin, sometimes called “Putin’s Chef” for his sprawling catering businesses, is the most powerful of a group of Putin allies who now control what are essentially private armies that recruit top military officers, former spies and convicts. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Russia’s Vladimir Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict between Russia and Ukraine through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported. New Zealand’s foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, has expressed concern to China over any provision of lethal aid to support Russia in its war against Ukraine during a meeting with her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang. Mahuta’s press office on Saturday detailed her cautionary remarks in Beijing, days after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, concluded his trip to Moscow, where Xi and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, praised each other and spoke of a profound friendship, AP reported. Mahuta’s four-day trip, which began on Wednesday, was the first made by a New Zealand foreign minister to Beijing since 2018. It came at an awkward time, however, given Xi’s visit in the same week to give Putin a diplomatic boost after the international criminal court said it was seeking to put him on trial for alleged war crimes. On the Ukraine war, Mahuta reiterated her government’s condemnation of Moscow’s “illegal invasion”. Spring has arrived in Ukraine – with late March temperatures an unreasonably high 17C (63F) along much of the frontline in the east. It means it is possible to declare, definitively, that the Russian campaign to knock out Ukraine’s power grid has failed, and whatever happens next in the war, its people will not be frozen out of their homes, as was once feared when the cynical bombing campaign began on 10 October. The reality, of course, was the missile strikes on key infrastructure had been largely abandoned at the end of January, with Russian missile stocks at 10-15% of prewar levels, according to Ukrainian estimates. Moscow’s tactics are changing: Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Kyiv’s military intelligence, said in a TV interview that it appeared military fuel and “logistics systems” were now being targeted. There has been no shortage of bombing and fighting during the long winter, but in another sense little has happened. The battle for the small Donbas city of Bakhmut rages, as it has since last May, but in recent weeks Ukraine’s forces have been pushed back north and south of the city, leaving the urban centre increasingly isolated, its supply roads dangerously exposed. Drone footage depicts a battered urban landscape, although many buildings are still standing and troops are able to shelter in basements. As the weather turns, so too does talk of a Ukrainian counterattack. Kyiv’s forces are gradually taking delivery of previously promised western tanks, fighting vehicles and other munitions, and some of them have been freshly trained in Britain, Germany or Poland. But the country’s second most important commander, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, surprised most observers when he suggested, on Thursday, that the place for a counterstrike could be in or around Bakhmut itself. Russia’s parliament speaker has proposed banning the activities of the international criminal court (ICC) after the court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accusing him of the war crimes. Vyacheslav Volodin, an ally of Putin’s, said on Saturday that Russian legislation should be amended to prohibit any activity of the ICC in Russia and to punish any who gave “assistance and support” to the court. “It is necessary to work out amendments to legislation prohibiting any activity of the ICC on the territory of our country,” Volodin said in a Telegram post, Reuters reported. Volodin said the US had legislated to prevent its citizens ever being tried by The Hague court and that Russia should continue that work. Any assistance or support for the ICC inside Russia, he said, should be punishable under law. The ICC issued an arrest warrant earlier this month accusing Putin of the war crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. It said there were reasonable grounds to believe that Putin bears individual criminal responsibility. Russian officials have cautioned that any attempt to arrest Putin, Russia’s leader since the last day of 1999, would amount to a declaration of war. Police in Russia have placed a former speechwriter for President Vladimir Putin on a wanted list for criminal suspects, the latest step in a sweeping crackdown on dissent. The Associated Press reports that Abbas Gallyamov wrote speeches for Putin during the Russian leader’s 2008-12 stint as prime minister. Gallyamov later became an outspoken political consultant and analyst who was frequently quoted by Russian and foreign media. He has lived abroad in recent years. On Friday, Russian news outlets and an AP reporter discovered Gallyamov listed in the interior ministry’s database. His entry said he was wanted “in relation to a criminal code article” but did not include the law he was accused of breaking. Russia’s justice ministry added Gallyamov last month to its register of foreign agents, a designation that brings additional government scrutiny and carries strong pejorative connotations aimed at undermining the recipient’s credibility. The ministry said Gallyamov “distributed materials created by foreign agents to an unlimited circle of people, spoke out against the special military operation in Ukraine [and] participated as an expert and respondent on information platforms provided by foreign structures”. Gallyamov told AP on Friday that he learned he was on a wanted list from the media. No law enforcement agency had been in touch, so he didn’t know what charge he faced in Russia. He said in a phone interview: I presume that formally it’s the offence of discrediting the army. It is being used against anyone who refuses to amplify the Kremlin’s playbook and tries to conduct an objective, impartial analysis of what’s going on. Gallyamov described the move against him as part of the Russian government’s “intimidation strategy”. Russia’s assault on the fiercely contested eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut has “largely stalled”, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. It said in its latest intelligence update: This is likely primarily a result of extreme attrition of the Russian force. Ukraine has also suffered heavy casualties during its defence. The ministry said Russia’s situation had likely been worsened by “tensions between the Russian ministry of defence and Wagner Group, both of whom contribute troops in the sector”. The battle over Bakhmut has been the longest and bloodiest of Russia’s war in Ukraine. The UK ministry said Russia had probably shifted its operational focus towards Avdiivka, south of Bakhmut, and to the Kremina-Svatove sector in the north – “areas where Russia likely only aspires to stabilise its frontline”. This suggests an overall return to a more defensive operational design after inconclusive results from its attempts to conduct a general offensive since January 2023. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reports that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. There, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, professed friendship and pledged closer ties as Russia struggles in its war against Ukraine. At a joint news conference with Trudeau, Biden questioned the level of China and Russia’s cooperation, noting that China has not provided weapons to Russia for use against Ukraine. Biden said the US had expanded alliances including with Nato, the G7, South Korea and the Quad nations of the US, Australia, India and Japan. We have significantly expanded our alliances. Tell me how in fact you see a circumstance where China has made a significant commitment to Russia. What commitment can they make? Addressing Canada’s parliament, Biden said that, as Nato members, the two countries would “defend every inch of Nato territory”. Trudeau told the news conference that Ukraine was a top issue: Today we reaffirmed our steadfast support for the Ukrainian people as they defend themselves against Putin’s brutal and barbaric invasion. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Adam Fulton to bring you up to speed with the latest developments. The leaders of the US and Canada, Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau, have met in Ottawa and reaffirmed their “steadfast support” for Ukraine just days after the Russian and Chinese presidents held their summit in Moscow. Biden questioned the level of China and Russia’s cooperation, noting that China had not provided weapons to Russia for use against Ukraine. Trudeau said: “Today we reaffirmed our steadfast support for the Ukrainian people as they defend themselves against Putin’s brutal and barbaric invasion.” Meanwhile, Russia’s assault on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut has “largely stalled”, the UK Ministry’s of Defence says. “This is likely primarily a result of extreme attrition of the Russian force,” the ministry said in its latest intelligence briefing. “Ukraine has also suffered heavy casualties during its defence.” More on both of those stories shortly. In other key developments just after 9am in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv: At least 10 civilians were killed and 20 wounded from long-range Russian bombardments in several parts of Ukraine on Friday, officials said. The casualties included two people who died in heavy Russian shelling of the town of Bilopillia in Sumy province in northern Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office said. The United Nations has said it is “deeply concerned” by what it said were summary executions of prisoners of war by both Russian and Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. A new report from the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights said its monitors had documented dozens of the executions by both sides, that the actual number was likely higher and that they “may constitute war crimes”. The Russian former president Dmitry Medvedev said Moscow was readying for a Ukrainian counteroffensive that “everyone knows” Kyiv is preparing for. Medvedev, who is deputy chair of Putin’s powerful security council, warned that Moscow was ready to use “absolutely any weapon” if Ukraine attempted to retake the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. Russian forces attacked northern and southern stretches of the front in eastern Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region on Friday. Ukrainian military reports described heavy fighting along a line running from Lyman to Kupiansk, as well as in the south at Avdiivka on the outskirts of the Russian-held city of Donetsk. The US president, Joe Biden, said he believed China had not yet sent arms to Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. “I’ve been hearing now for the past three months China is going to provide significant weapons to Russia ... They haven’t yet,” he told a news conference on Friday. “Doesn’t mean they won’t, but they haven’t yet.” Ukraine claimed Russian forces were “running out of steam” in Bakhmut and its commanders have started to raise the prospect of an unlikely turnaround in the besieged eastern Ukrainian city. Three women were among at least five people killed after a Russian missile struck one of the “invincibility points” providing refuge and basic services for Ukrainian civilians in the eastern city of Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk region, local officials said. The Russians attacked overnight on Thursday with S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, prosecutors said Air force commanders from Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark have agreed to create a unified Nordic air defence aimed at countering the rising threat from Russia, they said. The intention is to be able to operate jointly based on already known ways of operating under Nato, according to statements by the four countries’ armed forces. The Danish air force commander, Major General Jan Dam, said: “Our combined fleet can be compared to a large European country.” About 10,000 civilians, many of them elderly and with disabilities, are living in “very dire conditions” in and around Bakhmut, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Several thousand civilians were estimated to remain in the city itself and be “spending almost the entire days in intense shelling in the shelters”, the ICRC’s Umar Khan said. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said the “friendship” between China and Russia has limits, and that Europe should welcome any attempts by Beijing to distance itself from Moscow’s war in Ukraine. He said China “has not crossed any red lines for us”, adding that Beijing’s proposals to end the war showed it did not want to fully align with Russia. The bodies of 83 Ukrainian soldiers killed fighting in the war have been returned from the Russian side, a Ukrainian official said. Separately, Kyiv said it handed over an undisclosed number of seriously wounded Russian soldiers. Seven Ukrainian children have been reunited with their families after being forcibly taken to Russian-occupied Crimea, the Kherson regional military administration said. The security situation around the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv will have to improve before its ports can be included in a deal allowing the safe export of Ukrainian grain, a senior Ukrainian official has said. The deal was extended this month, but Kyiv and Moscow differ over how long the extension will last."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/jul/02/could-sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-ruin-minsmere-rspb-suffolk","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-02T13:32:57Z","webTitle":"Could nuclear plant ruin Suffolk haven for avocets, bitterns and harriers?

","bodyText":"The Bittern Hide at the RSPB’s Minsmere reserve was doing steady business last Wednesday. More than a dozen birdwatchers were crammed into the elevated shelter which overlooks a broad band of heath, freshwater pools and reed beds stretching to the Suffolk coast. Marsh harriers swirled overhead and an occasional bittern swept across the landscape. In front of another nearby hide, avocets waded leisurely across a lagoon. Minsmere is an ornithologist’s paradise. But a threat hangs over its wildlife glories. In a few days, the government is set to announce its decision on whether to allow the Sizewell C nuclear power plant to be built by EDF on land that overlooks the 1,000-hectare (2,500-acre) reserve. Approval will trigger the go-ahead for one of Europe’s biggest construction projects, and the impact on the reserve will be intense. New roads and a temporary port may be built, and dozens of huge cranes erected across land that borders Minsmere. For at least a decade, construction of the giant plant’s twin nuclear reactors will proceed – day and night. “We are not opposed to the principle of there being energy infrastructure at the Sizewell site but the likely impact of this particular project could be very damaging,” said Adam Rowlands, Suffolk area manager for the RSPB. “There is a real threat to species that we have struggled to preserve here.” Minsmere, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, is rated as one of the UK’s finest wildlife reserves, though its origins are unusual. At the beginning of the second world war, it was decided the area’s low-lying farmland should be flooded as a protection against German invasion. After the war ended, it was discovered that avocets, which had been extinct in the UK for more than 100 years, had started nesting there. “At the time, there was all sorts of pressure being put on landowners to drain land and boost food production in the UK in the years after the war,” added Rowlands. “However, in the end it was decided to keep the area as a natural mix of shingle beaches, coastal lagoons, grazing marshes and woodland. The RSPB took this over in 1947. Essentially, the land was rewilded, long before the term became an ecological buzzword.” Many rare species, such as the marsh harrier and the bittern, found precious refuge at Minsmere. However, it was the return of the avocet that had the greatest impact. After a century’s absence from Britain, the black-and-white wader, with its distinctive up-curved beak, established a small colony at Minsmere. From there it spread slowly across the nation. Today, there are about 1,500 breeding pairs in the UK and the bird is now depicted in the RSPB’s emblem, a symbol of hope in the cause of saving threatened bird species. Nor are avocets, bitterns and marsh harriers the only Minsmere residents. Otters, water voles, kingfishers, nightjars, woodlarks, Dartford warblers, adders, natterjack toads and silver-studded blue butterflies have also made homes on the reserve. “It is the range of habitats that makes Minsmere special,” said Rowlands. “There are reed beds, wet grassland, ditches, coastal shingle, woodland, heather heathland and acid grassland. This is a precious space.” The prospect of a vast construction project proceeding on adjacent land, therefore, causes concerns. In Somerset, where EDF is building the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, about 1,600 workers are on site every day; 3m tonnes of concrete and 230,000 tonnes of steel will eventually be used to make the new power plant while the site is dominated by giant 40-metre (130ft) cranes. The construction of its twin at Sizewell C will be identical in scale. Sizewell C will also require vast amounts of water for its workers, and to make the concrete needed for its construction. It is not clear where this water will come from in an area where supplies are already stretched. After its completion, even greater amounts will be needed to cool its reactors. “There is also the issue of the warm water leaving the reactor,” said Rowlands. “That could have a significant impact on the marine environment on the coast at Minsmere, affecting the populations of fish and shellfish there and the birds that feed on them.” After nine years’ construction, Hinkley Point C is now two years behind schedule and £8bn over budget although EDF has argued that the lessons it is learning in constructing the Somerset plant will be crucial in keeping Sizewell C – which would provide electricity for 6m homes in Britain – on target in terms of cost and schedule. The company says it is already planting trees along its boundary with the reserve to protect Minsmere and it has also created 47 hectares of new habitats for foraging marsh harriers to the north of the construction site. “Climate change is one of the biggest threats to biodiversity, and Sizewell will play a big role in tackling the carbon emissions that are driving that change,” said an EDF spokesperson. “We have to get to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, and – combined with Hinkley Point C and further nuclear projects – Sizewell C will play a key role in getting us there.” Nevertheless, the RSPB remains concerned about the likely impact on the reserve it considers to be a jewel in its crown. “There are plans to have a new port, a massive new road and a new rail line built into the land beside this reserve in order to construct Sizewell C,” said Rowlands. “That is going to make it very, very difficult for us to preserve an absolutely glorious region where people can observe some of Britain’s finest wildlife.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/06/iaea-gravely-concerned-about-damaged-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T01:51:49Z","webTitle":"UN calls for demilitarised zone around Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/06/iaea-gravely-concerned-about-damaged-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/06/iaea-gravely-concerned-about-damaged-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant","fields":{"headline":"UN calls for demilitarised zone around Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant","bodyText":"The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has called for a demilitarised zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, involving the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in. Guterres was addressing a UN security council session on Tuesday, at which he supported the recommendations put forward Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who led an inspection visit to the occupied Zaporizhzhia plant last week, and presented a report to the security council. The report confirmed the presence of Russian soldiers and military equipment at the plant, including army vehicles. “We are playing with fire and something very, very catastrophic could take place. This is why in our report, we are proposing the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone limited to the perimeter and the plant itself,” Grossi said. Guterres said that, as a first step, Russian and Ukrainian forces should cease all military operations around the plant. “As a second step, an agreement on a demilitarised perimeter should be secured,” he added. “Specifically, that will include the commitment by Russian forces to withdraw military personnel and equipment from that perimeter and the commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move in.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, offered qualified support for Grossi’s proposal to create a demilitarised zone around the plant and asked for more detail on the plan. “If the content of this proposal is to demilitarise the territory of the nuclear power plant – and this is logical, as it was the Russian military presence that put the Zaporizhzhia plant on the brink of a radiation disaster - then we can support such a demilitarised protection zone,” he said. The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, blamed recent shelling of the plant on Ukraine and portrayed Russian forces as protecting the plant. He did not respond to the call for a security zone, a proposal Moscow has so far rejected. Nebenzya said he had not had time to read the IAEA report. The IAEA report presented on Tuesday said the agency was “gravely concerned” about the “unprecedented” situation at the plant, which is controlled by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian technicians, and urged interim measures to prevent a nuclear disaster. The report came as a Russian colonel who served as the military commandant of the occupied Ukrainian city of Berdiansk was reported to have been killed in a car bombing, according to Russian state media reports. The car bomb reportedly exploded near the city administrative headquarters, which is being used as a Russian base. Photographs showed that the car used by the Russian military official, who has been identified as Col Artyom Bardin, was severely damaged in the attack, which took place close to midday. Initial reports indicated that Bardin died from his wounds. But Vladimir Rogov, the Russian-appointed administrative head of the Zaporizhzhia region, said in a Telegram post written just after 8.30pm on Tuesday that the colonel continued to “fight for his life”. “Thank God, information about the death of the commandant of Berdyansk Artyom Bardin is not confirmed. Despite severe injuries, explosive leg amputation and massive blood loss, he is alive. Doctors continue to fight for his life,” he said. Russian officials have alleged that Ukrainewas behind the attack. If true, it would be the most significant assassination yet of an official working for the occupational government of Russia in Ukraine. At least two Ukrainians collaborating with the Russian government were killed in suspected partisan attacks in August. In one case, the deputy head of the Russian-installed military administration was shot to death in his home in the city of Nova Kakhovka. In late August, a Ukrainian politician from Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s party who had gone over to work with the Russians was killed in the Kherson region. Ukrainian staff were operating under constant high stress and pressure, especially with the limited staff available, the report said. “This is not sustainable and could lead to increased human error with implications for nuclear safety,” it added. Britain’s ambassador to the UN, Dame Barbara Woodward, told the security council the Zaporizhzhia staff were “no longer workers, but hostages being held at gunpoint.” Russian troops seized control of the site in early March and there have been repeated attacks in the vicinity, prompting fears of a nuclear disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have denied responsibility and the report did not ascribe blame for the damage its inspectors had discovered. The UN agency sent a 14-person team to the site last week, including its director general, Rafael Grossi, to assess the situation at the plant. At least two members of the team are to remain there on a permanent basis to ensure the facility’s safety. “There is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means,” the IAEA said. “This can be achieved by the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. “The IAEA recommends that shelling on site and in its vicinity should be stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant and associated facilities.” The IAEA said that, during its inspection, its team “closely witnessed shelling in the vicinity of the power plant, in particular on 3 September when the team was instructed to evacuate to the ground level of the administrative building”. On the same day, the plant was disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and was relying on a reserve line. “While the ongoing shelling has not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, it continues to represent a constant threat to nuclear safety and security with potential impact on critical safety functions that may lead to radiological consequences with great safety significance,” the inspectors wrote. Areas damaged by shelling included a turbine lubrication oil tank and the roofs of various buildings such as one housing a spent fuel transporter vehicle. Grossi is expected to brief the UN security council in New York on his findings later on Tuesday. Earlier, blasts rang out and power was cut in Enerhodar, the city surrounding the plant, according to Dmytro Orlov, the Ukrainian mayor who operates from outside Russian-held territory. Moscow repeated its longstanding accusations that Ukrainian forces had been shelling the plant. Kyiv says it is Russia that has been staging such incidents, to undermine international support for Ukraine and as a possible pretext to cut the plant from the Ukrainian power grid and steal its output. On the battleground in the east of the country on Tuesday, three civilians were killed in Russian rocket attacks in the Kharkiv region, a senior official said. In the past week the focus of fighting has shifted to the south, where Ukraine has started a long-awaited counterattack to recapture territory seized early in the war. Ukrainian officials posted an image online of three soldiers raising Ukraine’s flag on a rooftop in Vysokopyllya, in the north of Kherson. If confirmed, it could mark perhaps the most strategic breakthrough on the battlefield in the counteroffensive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/nov/11/mini-nuclear-plants-experiment-economics","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-11T19:37:25Z","webTitle":"Mini-nuclear plants may be an experiment worth exploring","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/nov/11/mini-nuclear-plants-experiment-economics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/nov/11/mini-nuclear-plants-experiment-economics","fields":{"headline":"Mini-nuclear plants may be an experiment worth exploring","bodyText":"An energy white paper is in the offing, so consider Rolls-Royce’s pitch for the wonders of small modular reactors (SMRs) a piece of last-minute lobbying. After all, it is clear already that more nuclear, in combination with more offshore wind capacity, is likely to be judged a central way to meet the UK’s targets for cutting carbon emissions. It’s an eye-catching pitch. “A domestic energy solution for the first time in a generation, with a product that is engineered, designed and manufactured in the UK,” as Tom Samson, the chief executive of the nine-member Rolls-led UK SMR consortium puts it. So not one of those mammoth £20bn-plus French-led and Chinese-backed Hinkley Point C constructions. A programme of building 16 mini-nuclear power stations would create 6,000 skilled jobs within five years, and a further 34,000 by the mid-2030s, says the consortium. About 80% of the components would be built in the Midlands and north of England. And the backers are already talking up the export potential – the Czech Republic and Turkey have signed up for feasibility studies. What’s not to like? The clue is in that word “feasibility”. The consortium hasn’t actually built an SMR yet, so claims about lower costs per megawatt hour versus EDF’s at Hinkley are yet to be tested on the ground. The first few stations would arrive at £2.2bn-£2.5bn, says the consortium, with the price dropping to £1.8bn after the first five. Yes, one can see how costs would fall: automated production lines, with the pieces transported for assembly on site, should yield efficiencies over time. On the other hand, we also know that nuclear projects never arrive on budget (as EDF could attest). And a key point about mini-nuclear plants, say sceptics, is that they have to be built near to where the energy is used in order to reduce transmission losses. Since a nuclear reactor is few people’s idea of a local community asset, there’s a planning issue. The consortium thinks that, actually, it could use existing nuclear sites for the first batch, perhaps because, at 440MW, or roughly a quarter of one of Hinkley’s two reactors, the proposed stations are at the large end of “mini”. But therein lies a debate over the economics of nuclear power. The immediate question for government is whether to give a green light for the next stage of development. That would mean legislative support, making sites available and coughing up roughly £2bn of public money. If nuclear power is deemed essential to hitting carbon targets, the answer is probably yes. A 30-year energy policy needs to be able to adapt to ever-changing financial calculations. SMRs have the advantage of speedier construction times than Hinkley-style mega-plants. They are an experiment worth exploring. Timing of Pfizer chief’s stock sell-off looks awful Albert Bourla, the chief executive of Pfizer, is a smart boss running a smart company. But he’s been spectacularly naive in selling $5.6m-worth of his shares in the firm on Monday, the day of the big announcement of a breakthrough with a coronavirus vaccine. The timing looks awful. There is no reason to suspect anything worse than naivety. Pfizer says the sale was part of a regular trading scheme that allows executives to buy or sell on pre-determined dates. The actual instruction to sell, says the company, was given in August – long before anybody had a whiff of the encouraging news from vaccine trials. Even so, somebody at Pfizer should have twigged that there could be a problem. Shares sales by executives need to be authorised and a mid-November date for the release of the first vaccine results has been known for weeks. The danger that Bourla could be perceived to be cashing in on possible good news should have been obvious (and, in the event, Pfizer’s rose 8% on Monday). It would have been a simple matter to tell him to wait until the hotly anticipated news was out of the way. To repeat, Bourla did things by the book. But one hopes the vaccine lives up to its promise. If Monday were to turn out not to have been “a great day for humanity”, as Bourla put it, the share sale would look even worse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/apr/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-lavrov-blames-west-for-deadlock-over-grain-deal-two-killed-in-kharkiv-museum-attack","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-26T17:47:50Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Xi and Zelenskiy hold talks; Russian aircraft ‘intercepted in international airspace’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-lavrov-blames-west-for-deadlock-over-grain-deal-two-killed-in-kharkiv-museum-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/apr/26/russia-ukraine-war-live-lavrov-blames-west-for-deadlock-over-grain-deal-two-killed-in-kharkiv-museum-attack","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Xi and Zelenskiy hold talks; Russian aircraft ‘intercepted in international airspace’ – as it happened","bodyText":"As the time in Kyiv approaches 9pm, here’s a roundup of today’s news in the ongoing war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian president spoke to the Chinese leader Xi Jinping for the first time since Russia’s invasion in February 2022. He said they had a “long and meaningful” phone call and that he would send an envoy to Beijing. Xi is reported to have said that China “would not sit idly by, nor would it add oil to the fire, still less exploit the situation for self gains,” in regards to Ukraine. Xi also said that “talks and negotiation” were the only way the conflict would end. He is going to send a peace delegation to Kyiv. British fighter jets helped in a joint-Nato response to intercept three Russian planes, including two SU-27 fighter jets, over the Baltic Sea on Wednesday. The Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny says he is being investigated on terrorism charges that could see him sentenced to 30 years in prison, Reuters reports. The Kremlin critic is currently serving sentences totalling 11-and-a-half years on charges including fraud and contempt of court, which human rights groups say were made up to silence him. Italy has said it wants to play a major role in the reconstruction of Ukraine and urged EU bodies to back the rebuilding of a country battered by over a year of war with Russia. Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, met the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, on Wednesday. A Ukrainian reporter working as a fixer for Italy’s daily newspaper Repubblica has been shot dead by snipers in Kherson, while his Italian colleague was wounded, the newspaper said Wednesday. “Our correspondent Corrado Zunino and his fixer Bogdan Bitik were victims of an ambush by Russian snipers today on the outskirts of Kherson, in southern Ukraine,” the Repubblica said. Russia is resettling poor citizens from remote parts of its country in the east of Ukraine, according to Ukraine’s deputy defence minister. Hanna Mailar said the inward migration into Ukraine was mainly being seen in Luhansk. In a press conference, Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said there was “no use now in saying who is right” in the conflict. In a joint conference with the Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez he said that “no one can doubt that Brazilians condemn Russia’s [invasion]. The mistake happened and the war started.” That’s all for today. Thanks for following along. We’ll be back tomorrow. A Ukrainian reporter working as a fixer for Italy’s daily newspaper Repubblica has been shot dead by snipers in Kherson, while his Italian colleague was wounded, the newspaper said Wednesday. “Our correspondent Corrado Zunino and his fixer Bogdan Bitik were victims of an ambush by Russian snipers today on the outskirts of Kherson, in southern Ukraine,” the Repubblica said. “Bitik unfortunately did not make it and died: he leaves behind his wife and a son. Corrado, who was wounded in the shoulder, is in the civil hospital in Kherson,” it said. Both reporters, who had extensively covered the conflict, were wearing bulletproof vests with “press” written on them, it added. “We were hit. I saw Bogdan on the ground, he wasn’t moving,” Zunino said in a telephone conversation with someone at the newspaper, the daily said. “I crawled until I got out of the line of fire. I ran until I came across a civilian’s car. I was covered in blood, I got myself taken to the hospital in Kherson. “I tried several times to call Bogdan, he didn’t answer. He was a great friend of mine, the pain is excruciating”, he was reported to have said. The reporters were ambushed near the bridge in Kherson, the Repubblica said. “It’s difficult to recover Bitik’s body at the moment, due to the presence of snipers,” it said. Italian foreign minister Antonio Tajani said his ministry and the Italian embassy in Kiev were working with the Ukrainian authorities on returning Zunino to Italy. Russia is resettling poor citizens from remote parts of its country in the east of Ukraine, according to Ukraine’s deputy defence minister. The claim was made amid long-standing reports that Ukrainians in the east of the country have been forcibly deported into Russia, and children effectively kidnapped. Hanna Mailar said the inward migration into Ukraine was mainly being seen in Luhansk. According to Maliar, people are being brought to the occupied territories and provided “every possible support” from the occupation authorities, including housing, employment, and loans for developing businesses. “In this way, the enemy seeks to destroy Ukrainian statehood and the national self-identity of society in the temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories,” Maliar wrote. The Reintegration Ministry reported on 29 March that over 19,000 Ukrainian children have been forcibly deported to Russia. Additionally, the National Resistance Center reported on 12 April that over 100,000 Ukrainian children from Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts have been transported to Russia under the pretext of receiving “medical treatment.” Parents cannot refuse treatment without being threatened with losing their parental rights, according to the center. As mentioned earlier in the blog, Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met with the Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez on Wednesday, and held a news conference which touched on Ukraine. Lula criticised the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Wednesday, but said there was “no use now in saying who is right” in the conflict. His comments came after he set off a storm among western allies by stating earlier this month that they were prolonging the fighting by supplying arms to Ukraine. “No one can doubt that Brazilians condemn Russia’s territorial violation of Ukraine. The mistake happened and the war started,” he said during an official visit to Spain. “There is no use now in saying who is right, who is wrong. What we have to do now is stop the war,” he added at a joint press conference with Sánchez, Reuters reports. “No one in the world is talking about peace except for me, it is like being alone screaming in the desert.” Lula, a 77-year-old former metalworker who served two previous terms as president from 2003 to 2010, has resisted taking sides over the conflict, neither with Europe and the United States, nor with China and Russia. He raised hackles earlier this month by saying Washington should stop “encouraging” the war by supplying weapons to Kyiv. Lula also angered Ukraine in recent days by suggesting it should agree to give up the Crimea peninsula, which Russia forcefully annexed in 2014 in a prelude to its invasion of Ukraine last year. His comments were criticised by Europe, Ukraine and the United States, with Washington accusing him of “parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda”. Asked again during his visit to Madrid about Crimea, Lula said, “it is not up to me to say who Crimea belongs to.” “When you sit at a negotiating table you can discuss anything, even Crimea,” he added. “But I am not going to discuss that, it is the Russians and the Ukrainians who will discuss that.” The US has welcomed the phone call between the Ukrainian president and his Chinese counterpart on Wednesday. “We think that’s a good thing,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters. “Now, whether that’s going to lead to some sort of meaningful peace movement or plan or proposal, I just don’t think we know that right now. “We have long said we want this war to end,” he said, adding that it could end “immediately” if Russia would pull its troops out of Ukraine. “If there’s going to be a negotiated peace, it’s got to (be) when president Zelensky is ready for it … where he can do it from a position of strength “We certainly would welcome any effort to arrive at a just peace, as long as that peace could be just, could be sustainable, and could be credible. “And in our view, it’s not going to be sustainable or credible unless the Ukrainians and president Zelensky personally is invested in it and supportive of it.” The Guardian’s central and eastern European correspondent Shaun Walker has asked the question on whether Russia is carrying out more espionage activity or whether their agents are just being caught more often. Since Russia launched its full-scale war in Ukraine last February, hardly a week goes by without news of Russian spies, agents or informants being unmasked somewhere in the world. A security guard at the British embassy in Berlin, sentenced to 13 years in prison. An alleged mole inside Germany’s intelligence service, suspected of passing information to Moscow. Nine people arrested in Poland accused of tracking weapons deliveries to Ukraine and planning acts of sabotage. Just last week, US authorities issued an indictment against four US citizens and three Russians accused of carrying out “a multi-year foreign malign influence campaign in the United States” on behalf of Russian intelligence. The list goes on and on. Perhaps most eye-catching has been the arrest of several alleged “illegals” – deep-cover, elite Russian spies trained to adopt foreign identities to embed into western societies and steal secrets.

According to Chinese state media Xi made the offer during a telephone call on Wednesday with Zelenskiy and offered to help facilitate peace talks aimed at achieving a ceasefire as soon as possible. Xi also appeared to pledge China would remain neutral in the conflict saying Beijing “will neither watch the fire from the other side, nor add fuel to the fire, let alone take advantage of the crisis to profit”. The Chinese leader’s comments come despite the fact that China remains Russia’s top strategic ally in the midst of the conflict. Read the full story here: Reuters reports the Romanian agriculture minister, Petre Daea, saying the European Commission will ban Ukrainian grain and oilseeds exports to Romania until 5 June. This comes after Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Slovakia took unilateral steps to ban imports of food products from Ukraine, citing a need to protect their own farmers from cheap food prices. Romania had not introduced a ban. As the Guardian reported last week, the European Commission has been trying to navigate a solution: Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the commission, has written to the leaders of Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, setting out support measures after four of those countries banned the import or sale of grain and other food products inside their borders earlier this week. The commission wants member states to approve a further €100m in compensation payments for farmers in affected countries, on top of €56.3m that has already been shared between Poland, Bulgaria and Romania. It is also considering banning the sale of grain in the five affected countries until the end of June, with wheat, maize, rapeseed and sunflower seeds only able to enter affected countries en route to another country. More details from the discussions between Denys Shmyhal and the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, according to a readout on the Ukrainian government website. More sanctions against the Russian nuclear industry was discussed, as well as the ongoing negotiations over the Black Sea grain deal that is due to expire in May. In the meeting, which was also attended by the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s hopes to join the EU were discussed as well as the potential accession to Nato. “I am grateful to Italy for the military and technical assistance it provides to Ukraine’s security and defence forces, in particular for the sixth aid package, which includes vital air defence systems.” said Shmyhal. Moscow has said Kyiv is undermining any peace attempts in response comments to the first call between the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, since Russia’s offensive, Agence France-Presse reports. China has sought to portray itself as neutral in the Ukraine conflict despite strong ties with Russia. It has not condemned Moscow’s offensive. “The Ukrainian authorities and their western minders have already shown their ability to mess up any peace initiatives,” the Russian foreign ministry said. Moscow noted “the readiness of the Chinese side to make efforts to establish a negotiation process.” Beijing proposed a vague political solution to the conflict that includes a call for dialogue and respect for all countries’ territorial sovereignty. “We see a broad consonance in our approach and in the provisions in the paper [published by China],” Russia’s foreign ministry said. It accused Kyiv of having rejected “any sensible initiatives aimed at a political and diplomatic settlement”. “The eventual consent to negotiations is conditioned by ultimatums with obviously unrealistic demands,” it said. Ukraine has said it would not negotiate with Vladimir Putin and that peace would only be possible after Russia withdrew its troops. After the call with President Xi earlier, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has appointed a new ambassador to China, Pavlo Riabikin. Reuters reports that the announcement was made on a decree posted on a Ukrainian government website. Italy has said it wants to play a major role in the reconstruction of Ukraine and urged EU bodies to back the rebuilding of a country battered by over a year of war with Russia. The prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and the president, Sergio Mattarella, met the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, on Wednesday. Italy struck the supportive tone at a bilateral summit with Ukraine in Rome convened to discuss reconstruction initiatives, saying private and public capital should contribute along with international institutions and multilateral banks. “We want to play a leading role not only politically, but also by involving businesses,” Meloni said speaking alongside Shmyhal according to Reuters. Meloni, who took office last October at the helm of a rightist coalition, encouraged Italian companies to contribute to Ukrainian reconstruction, calling it a “far-sighted” investment. So far Meloni has stuck to the pro-Ukraine policy of her predecessor, Mario Draghi, despite scepticism from some of her own coalition partners. The World Bank, United Nations, European Commission and Ukraine recently estimated it would cost $411bn to rebuild, a big jump from an earlier estimate of $349bn. Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said his country would help Kyiv join the EU and insisted Russia should share the burden of the reconstruction. “Any resolution of the conflict will have to ensure that Russia pays for the damage it has caused,” he said. In a recent visit to the United States, Ukraine’s Shmyhal said it was critically important to begin reconstruction this year and Kyiv had identified a priority funding gap of $14bn needed for 2023. A hub to repair Leopard 2 tanks that Ukraine is receiving from European allies will start operating in May. The latest development in a long-running theme about tank supplies was confirmed by Poland’s deputy prime minister and defence minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, at a joint press conference with Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, according to Ukrainian news website Ukrinform. Błaszczak said that an agreement was signed on Friday between Poland Ukraine and Germany on the creation of the maintenance and repair centre. “All these tanks will be serviced at Bumar-Labedy in Gliwice,” Błaszczak said. There is a concern about difficulties repairing the tanks because of a lack of spare parts, but Germany’s cooperation would ease any problems as the vehicles are made by a German company. “I really wanted the Germans to also feel their responsibility and for this process to take place quickly and effectively,” he said. Chinese state TV has reported more details of the call between presidents Xi and Zelenskiy. The Chinese premier said that “talks and negotiation” were the “only way out” of the war, CCTV reported according to Agence France-Presse. Though Beijing is officially neutral in the conflict, Xi has never condemned the Russian invasion. Zelensky has said repeatedly he would be open to talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi. In February Beijing unveiled a 12-point paper calling for a “political settlement” to the crisis in Ukraine. Some more details have become available of the British fighter jets who were involved in an operation to intercept three Russian planes over the Baltic Sea on Wednesday (see 7.49am). The RAF planes joined Eurofighters flown by Germany, and they intercepted two SU-27 fighter jets who were flanking an IL-20 surveillance plane who were flying with their location transponders turned off. Some interesting comments from China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying after President Xi’s phone call with Zelenskiy. Xi has so far met with Putin since Russia’s invasion, but not Zelenskiy, despite the Ukrainian president’s pleas. Otherwise he has not intervened in the crisis, with some claiming the conflict and geopolitical implications work in China’s favour. Among the most interesting lines is China claiming “as a responsible major country, China would not sit idly by, nor would it add oil to the fire, still less exploit the situation for self gains”. An group of special representatives will also be sent to Ukraine. This had been confirmed by President Xi to Zelenskiy during the call. She posted on Twitter: “China is consistent and clear-cut in its readiness to develop bilateral relations with Ukraine. Two sides need to carry forward the tradition of mutual respect and sincerity, and take the China-Ukraine strategic partnership forward. “On the Ukraine crisis, China always stands on the side of peace. Its core stance is to facilitate talks for peace. “China did not create the Ukraine crisis, nor is it a party to the crisis. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a responsible major country, China would not sit idly by, nor would it add oil to the fire, still less exploit the situation for self gains. “Everything China does is aboveboard. Dialogue and negotiation are the only viable way forward. “With rational thinking and voices now on the rise, it is important to seize the opportunity and build up favorable conditions for the political settlement of the crisis. “It is hoped that all parties would seriously reflect on the Ukraine crisis and jointly explore ways to bring lasting peace and stability to Europe through dialogue. “China will send the Special Representative of the Chinese Government on Eurasian Affairs to Ukraine and other countries to have in-depth communication with all parties on political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. “China has provided multiple batches of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and will keep providing help to the best of its ability.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Wednesday he had held a “long and meaningful” phone call with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, and hoped it would give impetus to relations with Beijing. “I had a long and meaningful phone call with...President Xi Jinping,” he wrote on Twitter. “I believe that this call, as well as the appointment of Ukraine’s ambassador to China, will give a powerful impetus to the development of our bilateral relations.” He did not immediately give any other details. The call was also confirmed by a Chinese government spokeswoman. Spain has welcomed Brazil’s interest in the push for mediation in peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, Reuters reports. The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, told a joint news conference with Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Wednesday. Lula has recently said that a group of neutral nations should come together to broke peace between Russia and Ukraine. He has refused to supply arms to Kyiv, and Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government has invited him to Ukraine to see the impact of the conflict. Russia’s envoy to the UN in Geneva said on Wednesday that no real progress had been achieved in resolving issues raised by Moscow over the Black Sea grain deal, which is set to expire in May. Speaking to reporters at the Russian permanent mission in Geneva, envoy Gennady Gatilov said Russia’s position on extending the deal remains unchanged. Moscow has said it will not agree to an extension unless the ewst removes obstacles to Russian exports of grain and fertiliser. Ukraine is urging its allies not to bow to Russian “blackmail” over nuclear plants it has seized during its invasion on the 37th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, Reuters reports. On Telegram, the president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: Thirty-seven years ago, the Chornobyl NPP accident left a huge scar on the whole world. We must do everything to give the terrorist state no chance to use nuclear power facilities to blackmail Ukraine and the entire world. An explosion of a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the formerly Soviet Ukraine spread radiation across Europe in 1986. It is thought around 30 plant workers and firemen died in the immediate aftermath and many more people died later from radiation-related illnesses. The decommissioned plant, north of Kyiv, lies near the Ukraine’s border with Belarus and was captured by Russian troops on 24 February 2022; the first day of Russia’s invasion. Moscow’s forces occupied the plant for five weeks before withdrawing on 31 March 2022. Ukrainian officials have accused Putin of attempting to blackmail Kyiv and its allies into meeting Russian demands due to safety concerns about radiation levels. The Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny says he is being investigated on terrorism charges that could see him sentenced to 30 years in prison, Reuters reports. The Kremlin critic is currently serving sentences totalling 11-and-a-half years on charges including fraud and contempt of court, which human rights groups say were made up to silence him. On Twitter, Navalny’s aides said: “They have presented absurd allegations that threaten me with 30 years in prison … that I, while in prison, commit terrorist acts.” In August 2020, Navalny was poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent and was hospitalised in critical condition. The Kremlin denied trying to kill him, though he blamed Putin for the attack. He was jailed in 2021 when he returned to Russia after receiving medical treatment in Germany following the poison attack. This month, Russian investigators formally linked Navalny supporters to the murder of Vladlen Tatarsky, a Russian military blogger and supporter of Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine, who was killed by a bomb in St Petersburg. Navalny’s allies have denied any involvement. Russian investigators have also said that 11 people have been added to an “international wanted list” in a case linked to Navalny, the state-owned news agency Tass reports. Yevgeny Roizman, the former mayor of Russia’s fourth-largest city Ekaterinburg, is going on trial today over accusations he discredited the Russian armed forces over the war in Ukraine. He has claimed he is being charged for describing Moscow’s military intervention in Ukraine as “the invasion of Ukraine”, the French press agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. Roizman, who has been a prominent Kremlin critic, said he knows he could go to prison at any moment. He is Russia’s last prominent opposition figure who is still in the country and has not been jailed. He could face five years in prison if convicted, Russian state media reports. In August 2022, authorities opened a criminal case against Roizman for “discrediting” the Russian armed forces in comments he made about the war in Ukraine. Roizman, 60, pleaded not guilty at the start of the trial in Ekaterinburg in a live YouTube broadcast of the hearing, according to AFP. Asked by the judge if he admitted his guilt, Roizman said “no”. In 2013, he became Russia’s highest-profile opposition mayor and held the position in the Urals city from from 2013 to 2018. All other top opposition figures are either in prison or in exile because of Vladimir Putin’s crackdown on anti-Kremlin dissent. Here are the images shared by the German air force of the Russian aircraft intercepted over the Baltic Sea. They are reported to be two SU-27 flankers and one IL-20 aircraft. Fears are growing in Ukraine that Moscow is pushing its close ally Belarus to take direct part in fighting, as Belarusian men are called to attend military training, AP reports. “Russian troops are already in Belarus, and I see the country gradually being turned into a military barracks,” Ruslan, an engineer who was recently summoned for military training in the Belarus capital of Minsk, told AP. He preferred not to share his full name out of concerns for his safety. Everybody fears that they won’t allow Belarusians to keep watching the war from a distance for too long. The Belarussian president Alexander Lukashenko has relied on the Kremlin’s political and economic support in recent months to help deal with protests and mass arrests. A Belarusian air defence unit was formed recently in Minsk, which is thought to station some of Moscow’s missile units. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited border guards in the northwestern Volyn region earlier this month, saying that the country must “be ready” for a possible invasion from Belarus, AP reports. Three Russian military aircraft flying without transponder signals have been intercepted in international airspace over the Baltic Sea, Reuters reports. Two Sukhoi Su-27 fighter aircraft and one Ilyushin Il-20 aircraft were identified by German and British forces, the German air force has said, adding several images of the aircraft mid-flight on Twitter. Ukraine is working with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and American companies to collect evidence of war crimes by Russians, such as geolocation and cellphone information, Reuters reports, citing senior officials. Ukrainian authorities are collecting digital information from battlefields and Ukrainian towns ravaged by the war since Russia invaded the country last February, said Alex Kobzanets, a FBI special agent. “Collection of that data, analysis of that data, working through that data is something the FBI has experience working through,” Kobzanets said at a cybersecurity conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. That work includes looking into cellphone information, forensic analyses of DNA samples, as well as analysis of body parts collected off battlefields, he said. The work reflects deepening collaboration between the US and Ukraine on the cyber front, where Russia has been a common adversary for both nations. The Russian government did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Some recent images from the war in Ukraine: The Ukrainian president, Volodymr Zelenskiy, in his latest statement on Telegram has said “no one can feel safe” unless Russia is defeated and called for the war to end with a “new Nuremberg”. “Every manifestation of Russian terror, every day of aggression is an additional argument that all this must end in the Tribunal – in a new Nuremberg against ruscism, against those who destroy lives and people, who use missiles against museums and guided bombs against churches. Russia must lose. The world cannot have any other goal,” Zelenskiy wrote. Russia’s war in Ukraine will be top of the agenda at the G7 summit next month, with the White House announcing on Tuesday that the US president, Joe Biden, will attend the meeting in Hiroshima, Japan. The leaders of the G7 - Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States - are meeting at the site of the world’s first nuclear attack, with Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, having said he hopes to make nuclear disarmament a key plank of discussions. A little more from Lavrov – the foreign minister also warned the European Union “is becoming militarized at a record rate” and aggressive in its goal of containing Russia. Associated Press reports he told a news conference he has no doubts that there is now “very little difference” between the EU and Nato. Lavrov said they recently signed a declaration, which he said essentially states that the 31-member Nato military alliance will ensure the security of the 27-member EU political and economic organisation. He was apparently referring to a January EU-Nato declaration on their “strategic partnership” which urges closer cooperation following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to confront evolving security threats, Associated Press says. Moscow has seen “practically no results” from a pact with the United Nations that aimed to help Russia’s grain and fertilizer exports and blamed Western countries for creating a deadlock, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on in New York on Tuesday. Russia has signalled that unless a list of demands is met to remove obstacles to those exports, it will not agree to extend a related deal beyond 18 May that allows the safe wartime export of grain from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. Lavrov, at a news conference at the United Nations in New York, praised the work of UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres and UN aid chief Martin Griffiths in their bid “to reach agreement with countries that have announced illegitimate and lateral sanctions against the Russian Federation.” “But there has been practically no result,” Lavrov said. Russia signed a three-year deal last July in which the United Nations agreed to help try and remove any obstacles to its grain and fertilizer exports. While those exports are not subject to Western sanctions imposed following the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Moscow says restrictions on payments, logistics and insurance are a barrier to shipments. Hello and welcome to our continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Virginia Harrison and I’ll be bringing you the latest for the next little while. It’s coming up to 8am in Kyiv, here’s where things stand: Two women have been killed and 10 wounded in a strike on a museum in Kupyansk in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: “The terrorist country is doing everything to destroy us completely. Our history, our culture, our people. Killing Ukrainians with absolutely barbaric methods.” Russian president Vladimir Putin on Tuesday signed a decree establishing temporary control of the Russian assets of two foreign energy firms, signalling Moscow could take similar action against other companies if need be. The decree – outlining possible retaliation if Russian assets abroad are seized – showed Moscow had already taken action against Uniper SE’s Russian division and the assets of Finland’s Fortum Oyj. The number of daily casualties Russia is suffering has fallen by about 30% in April, UK intelligence has said. In its daily intelligence briefing, the Ministry of Defence reported that the drop was probably due to the end of Russia’s winter offensive, which, it added, had largely failed. The MoD also said Russia was now likely to be preparing its troops for Ukraine’s counteroffensive. Kyiv admitted it was behind a drone attack in the bay of Sevastopol, Ukrainian authorities confirmed. However, officials rejected Russian claims that the attack had put the operation of the grain corridor at risk. Russia’s foreign ministry has said it is expelling a Moldovan diplomat in what it cast as retaliation for the expulsion last week of a Russian diplomat in Moldova. The ministry said in a statement it had summoned Moldova’s ambassador in Moscow to announce the expulsion, as well as to protest against what it called “unfriendly steps towards Russia” and “regular anti-Russian statements”. Lithuania’s parliament voted on Tuesday in favour of allowing border guards to turn back migrants who illegally enter the country. Lithuania borders fellow EU states Latvia and Poland, as well as Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. In 2021, Latvia declared a state of emergency and Lithuania began planning a razor-wire fence to stop record numbers of migrants crossing its border from Belarus. A former commander in Russia’s Wagner mercenary group seeking asylum in Norway has pleaded guilty to being involved in a fight outside an Oslo bar and carrying an air gun in public and said he felt “very ashamed”. Andrei Medvedev, 26, crossed the Russian-Norwegian border in January and has spoken out about his time fighting with Russian invasion forces in Ukraine. Britain and France’s sports ministers insisted on Tuesday that Russian and Belarusian athletes must never compete as neutrals as recommended by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) because they could still be funded by their governments. A court in Russia has convicted a former police officer of publicly spreading false information about the country’s military after he criticised the war in Ukraine to his friends over the phone. The ex-officer, Semiel Vedel, was sentenced on Monday to seven years in prison and barred from working in law enforcement for four years after his release. Risks of a direct military confrontation between the two nuclear powers, Russia and the United States, are steadily growing, the Tass news agency quoted a senior Russian diplomat as saying on Tuesday. Vladimir Yermakov, the foreign ministry’s head of nuclear non-proliferation, told the Russian state news agency that Washington was escalating the risks through its conduct with Moscow. It is time for the Nato alliance to “stop making excuses” and accept Ukraine as a member, as the country has demonstrated its readiness and has much to offer, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba said. Writing in Foreign Affairs, Kuleba said the political will of the alliance had been “sorely lacking” on the issue of admitting Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/oct/27/first-thing-climate-crisis-funds-not-delivered-to-countries-in-grave-need","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-27T10:31:53Z","webTitle":"First Thing: Climate crisis funds ‘not delivered’ to countries in grave need","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/27/first-thing-climate-crisis-funds-not-delivered-to-countries-in-grave-need","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/oct/27/first-thing-climate-crisis-funds-not-delivered-to-countries-in-grave-need","fields":{"headline":"First Thing: Climate crisis funds ‘not delivered’ to countries in grave need","bodyText":"Good morning. Billions of dollars ostensibly committed to addressing the impacts of the climate crisis in poorer countries are not being delivered, the UN’s humanitarian chief has declared. Martin Griffiths said he was “scrambling to try to understand” where a promised $100bn a year agreed at the UN climate change conference in 2009 by richer countries has gone. “The truth of the matter is that we are scrambling to try to understand where the climate money is that was promised a decade ago. Where is it? Who’s holding it and who is not delivering it to places like Somalia?” the UN’s undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator said, referring to a worsening famine in the east African country where US troops are stationed. “Somalis are the victims of our behaviour, the victims of our habits – not of theirs. And yet we haven’t even managed to get to them the money that we pledged nobly some time ago for exactly this kind of purpose.” Amid growing calls from African countries for easier access to the pledged funds, Griffiths said he had “failed” to get an answer when he asked governments how climate financing was decided and delivered. Follow the money. The Green Climate Fund was created as a way to deliver the money promised in 2009, but its impact has been limited since rich countries often channel their financing through the World Bank or regional development banks. Iranian authorities reportedly open fire in Mahsa Amini town On the 40th day since the death of Mahsa Amini in Iran, which typically spells the end of an official mourning period, security forces reportedly fired shots as they clashed with protesters who had rallied in their thousands in her home town. “Security forces have shot teargas and opened fire on people in Zindan Square, Saqqez city,” Hengaw, a Norway-based group that monitors rights violations in Iran’s Kurdish regions, tweeted without specifying whether there were any dead or wounded. It said more than 50 civilians had been injured by direct fire in cities across the region. Appeals had gone out for protesters to take to the streets despite a ban by the security forces. The call was answered in Tehran, Isfahan and Mashhad, but the biggest gathering was in Saqqez, the home town of Amini – who died three days after she was arrested by the morality police for being dressed “inappropriately” – in the western Kurdistan province. ‘Woman, life, freedom’. As many as 10,000 mourners attended Amini’s gravesite yesterday despite security services warning her family not to hold the ceremony and commanding a heavy presence in the city. The shootings appear to have happened when a smaller group marched to the governor’s office in Saqqez. China is locking down parts of Wuhan again Almost three years after the first ever Covid case emerged in the now infamous Chinese city of Wuhan, more than 800,000 people have been forced to lock down for at least three days as streets and homes were effectively sealed. China today reported a third consecutive day of more than 1,000 new Covid cases nationwide, triggering more curbs and restrictions across the country despite it representing a modest tally. In a mosaic of measures across the country, Wuhan suspended the sale of pork in parts of the city after authorities said one Covid case had been linked to the local pork supply chain. The country has repeatedly vowed to stick to its zero-tolerance response to Covid-19 and implement what the authorities say are necessary measures to contain the virus. Does a full lockdown beckon for Guangzhou? China’s fourth-biggest city by economic output sealed up more streets and neighbourhoods and kept people in their homes as new areas were deemed high-risk in a Covid resurgence that has persisted into its fourth week.

Stat of the day: Carbon emissions ‘to peak in 2025’, says IEA Worldwide government spending on clean energy in response to the Ukraine invasion would mark a “historic turning point” in the transition away from fossil fuels as global carbon emissions from energy peak in 2025, the International Energy Agency has projected. Government spending on clean fuels in response to Russia’s invasion has massively increased, according to analysis by the world’s leading organisation in the sector. “None of the government leaders complained about too much clean energy,” Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, said. “They complain that they don’t have enough clean energy.” Under the new plans investment in low-carbon energy such as solar, wind and nuclear power will rise to $2tn a year by 2030, an increase of more than 50% from today. “The golden age of gas is approaching the end,” Birol said. Don’t miss this: Bellwether state holds key to Brazil election Brazil’s two presidential candidates are campaigning hard in Minas Gerais, which has a long record of picking the winner, before a crunch second round vote as they offer their contrasting visions to the country. “I think the best Bolsonaro will manage is a draw in Minas … and this tells you a lot about how I feel about the election overall. This is going to be a tight race but it’s one where Lula remains favourite,” said Felipe Nunes, a political scientist from the state’s federal university. Nil César, a campaigner posting flyers, told the Guardian’s Tom Phillips that President Jair Bolsonaro’s contempt for the poor and dramatic loosening of gun laws meant their pre-election operation was quite literally a matter of life or death for the community’s disfranchised youth. Climate check: Thirsty elephants irk drought-hit Kenyan farmers A drought in Kenya’s south-eastern region around a conservation area has brought elephants scouring the area for food and water close to farmers. “Experts say we are suffering because people in rich countries have polluted the atmosphere,” said farmer Francis Mutuku. “I cannot plant maize any more and need to switch to crops that take a short time to mature and that require little water, such as green grams [mung beans].” Rachel Kennedy, who lives close to Mutuku, says she is leaving water in a drinking trough intended for her cows so that the elephants – which can consume 200 litres of water a day – can drink and not destroy the concrete tank. “I moved my cows to my ancestral home over 50km away to avoid confrontations with elephants,” she said. Last Thing: The doctors leaving anti-abortion states Four months after Roe v Wade was overturned, some providers have left states restricting abortions or changed careers, writes Poppy Noor. Some have been left scrambling to make plans out of state due to bans in places such as Texas. “They needed to get all the way to the east coast or west coast before they would find a doctor who could help them, and they needed to do it in the next 24 or 48 hours. Even in the best scenario I don’t think 99% of people could have made that trip in the time they had,” said Alireza Shamshirsaz, a Texan now living in Boston, on a couple whose pregnancy was not going to be viable who came to him for care. “If we wait to the edge, we have more near misses. In medicine, when you have too many near misses, eventually, you actually miss. That means ending up with a dead mother,” he added. “If you can’t do a termination, who will support these kids after the birth? Who will pay the bills they will need for medical care? Nobody.

EU leaders in Brussels are expected to sign off on last week’s recommendation by the European Commission, the EU executive. Russia’s Tass news agency is carrying a report that British citizens Sean Pinner and Aiden Aslin, alongside Moroccan Saadoun Brahim, are preparing an appeal against their death sentences. Tass quotes Pinner’s lawyer Yulia Tserkovnikova saying “my colleagues and I are preparing the full text of the appeal against the verdict in the interests of our clients”. British authorities have described the trial as a “sham”, with one MP saying the men were essentially being held as hostages. The men argue that they were part of Ukraine’s armed forces, and should be subject to the Geneva convention on prisoners of war. Russia’s ministry of defence claims to have killed at least 650 Ukrainian soldiers in the last 24 hours in its latest daily operational briefing. It claims that “the enemy continues to suffer significant losses” and that it “destroyed 49 tanks with fuel for military equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine, as well as up to 50 multiple launch rocket systems located in the hangars.” Russian forces are putting the Lysychansk-Sievierodonetsk pocket under increasing pressure by steadily advancing around the fringes, according to British intelligence. Since 19 June, Russian forces have “highly likely” advanced over 5km towards the southern approaches of the Donbas city of Lysychansk, according to the latest UK ministry of defence report. Ukrainian troops may need to pull back from the key frontline city of Lysychansk to avoid being encircled after Russian forces captured two villages to its south, regional governor Serhiy Gaidai has said on national television. “In order to avoid encirclement, our command could order that the troops retreat to new positions,” he said. “All of Lysychansk is within reach of their fire. It is very dangerous in the city.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said believes Russian forces are attempting to destroy cities in the eastern Donbas region in the same way they did in Mariupol. During his nightly address, Zelenskiy said: “The goal of the occupiers in this direction remains the same - they want to destroy the whole Donbas step by step. Entire. Lysychansk, Slovyansk, Kramatorsk - they aim to turn any city into Mariupol. Completely ruined.” Three cruise missiles hit Ukraine’s southern port city of Mykolaiv today, while air defences shot down another two missiles near the southern city of Odesa, the Ukrainian armed forces said in a statement. The governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Valentyn Reznichenko, has accused Russia of using cluster munitions in the region. Ukraine is expected to hold a preliminary hearing in its first trial of a Russian soldier charged with raping a Ukrainian woman during Russia’s invasion, the first of what could be dozens of such cases. The suspect, Mikhail Romanov, 32, who is not in Ukrainian custody and will be tried in absentia, is accused of murdering a civilian in the Kyiv capital region on 9 March and then repeatedly raping the man’s wife, according to court files. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has said Russia and Belarus must take urgent joint measures to improve their defence capabilities and “increase the combat readiness of troop groupings and the unified regional air defence system.” The UK foreign secretary Liz Truss has warned that the grain crisis in Ukraine must be solved by global leaders within the next month, otherwise the world could see “devastating consequences”. The Kremlin has reiterated its assertion that Russia has not stolen any grain from Ukraine, as Turkey said it was probing allegations from Kyiv and would not allow any such grain to be brought to Turkey. Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said Turkey was taking the claims seriously. US donations of its new “Himars” multiple launch rocket system, or MLRS, have arrived in Ukraine. Ukraine’s minister of defence announced the arrival of the precision-guided missile launchers on Twitter. “Himars have arrived to Ukraine,” Oleksii Reznikov wrote. “Summer will be hot for Russian occupiers. And the last one for some of them.” Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, has accused Vladimir Putin of “wholly immoral” behaviour, saying the Russian president has “weaponised” food, energy and migration as part of his war effort. Lithuanian president Gitanas Nauseda has said the country must raise defence spending to 3% of GDP to enable it to host a much larger number of Nato troops. The European Union and Norway have agreed to cooperate to bring more gas from western Europe’s biggest producer to the EU’s 27 countries, nearly half of which are now facing cuts to their Russian gas supplies. Dramatic footage emerged on Wednesday from Russia of what appears to be a drone flying into an oil refinery and causing an explosion in what could be an attack inside Russia’s borders. Video shared on social media showed the unmanned aerial vehicle crashing into the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Rostov region, in what would be an embarrassing breach of Russia’s air defence systems. Residents and workers at a nuclear power plant in Enerhodar, a city in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, are being abducted by Russian occupiers, according to the region’s mayor. “Whereabouts of some unknown. The rest are in very difficult conditions: they are being tortured with electric shock, bullied physically and morally,” said mayor Dmytro Orlov. A television tower in the Ukrainian separatist-held city of Donetsk has been badly damaged by shelling and broadcasting has been interrupted, the local Donetsk news agency reported.

And mea culpas? Never met them. In the last eight years of Coalition rule, there have been more than 20 different climate and energy policies, which have been announced with fanfare before fizzing into the background, or just being trashed altogether. Here’s a short rundown of what the last eight years has looked like. 2013-14 – Direct(ish) action After Tony Abbott repealed Labor’s carbon price, his new government replaces the measures with the Direct Action policy. It is described as “a scheme that will provide the incentive for firms to reduce their carbon emissions and, at the same time, minimise the costs to industry and the Australian economy”. The emissions reduction fund is a key component, set up to “directly support CO2 emissions reduction activities by business and industry”. The original idea behind the ERF is that the government will pay for projects that will reduce CO2 emissions “at least cost”. Its adequacy and impact are questioned from the beginning and it has limited real-world impact. 2017 – ‘This is coal’ Scott Morrison brings in a lump of coal to parliament and coos, “This is coal. Do not be afraid. Do not be scared. It will not hurt you,” before passing it around the frontbench where it is cradled by Barnaby Joyce. At the same time, the Turnbull government insists it is taking climate policy seriously. 2017 – Clean energy target overhaul Malcolm Turnbull embarks on designing a new energy policy to improve system reliability while reducing emissions in electricity. The chief scientist, Alan Finkel, suggests the government adopt a clean energy target. That proposal lasts about five minutes. The rejection of the clean energy target leads to the national energy guarantee, which signals the end of Turnbull’s prime ministership. 2017-18 – National energy guarantee (1, 2 and 3) First mentioned in late 2017, the Neg imposes two obligations on energy retailers: to supply sufficient quantities of “reliable” power to the market, and to reduce emissions between 2020 and 2030. Turnbull wants to legislate the mechanism but the proposal becomes enmeshed in leadership tensions. With rightwingers moving against him, he proposes implementing elements of the Neg through regulation rather than legislation. When Morrison takes over as prime minister, he dumps the Neg’s emissions reduction component altogether. 2018 – RET wind-down (and the policy for no policy) In 2013 Abbott tried to move against the renewable energy target as well as Labor’s carbon price. This failed but the scheme was criticised by the Coalition for bringing too much intermittent renewable energy into the power grid. Five years later, with the RET due to expire in 2020, the minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, says there will be no policy to replace it. “The truth of the matter is the renewable energy target is going to wind down from 2020, it reaches its peak in 2020, and we won’t be replacing that with anything,” he says. That contradicts advice from the energy security board, which says investors and the market need policy certainty to ensure orderly investment. 2018-19 – Default energy prices and big sticks With new climate policy in the too-hard basket, the Coalition focuses on energy prices. At this point, the Morrison government is still not ruling out investing in further coal stations. The “big stick” policies are designed to give the government powers to break up energy companies if consumer prices don’t fall. In the end, the government backs down from its threat of divesture powers, and the stick becomes more of a twig amid internal and external discord at the idea. The divesture powers go from complete ministerial discretion, to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission advice and ministerial discretion, to no divesture powers. A default market offer for energy prices is also introduced, which forces power companies to lower their opening offers to customers, and make it easier for consumers to find cheaper electricity plans. All of this is geared towards the coming 2019 election, which the Coalition wins. 2018-20 – Coal is still king. Sort of Facing a possible blow-up from the Nationals, Taylor floats the idea that taxpayers indemnify new coal projects against any sort of carbon price. “What we are saying is the risks that government needs to absorb to get investment in reliable generation, we will look at absorbing,” he says. “We need the investment.” Power companies are moving away from coal as generation assets age, and firmed renewables lower in price. But the Nationals want to prolong coal generation. A standoff with private power companies heats up over the future of their ageing coal assets. The Nationals propose taxpayer underwriting of new coal generation. But that proves a red line for Liberals in metropolitan seats. There are internal tensions about carbon risk and banks refusing to finance new coal projects. The Nationals go to war with the banks, accusing them of virtue signalling. But Liberals argue banks are acting prudently. 2019-21 – Nuclear power could be king. Maybe In yet another attempt to quell rumblings within the National party, some suggest nuclear power is a potential answer to everyone’s problems. A parliamentary inquiry is established to look into an Australian nuclear power industry, which government MPs support and non-government MPs do not. Australia has a moratorium on nuclear energy for one thing, for another, there is no guarantee of a commercial return, given the cost. And that’s even with a carbon price, which the Morrison government is against. Nuclear power is not carbon neutral and it is not a renewable energy (uranium is finite). Still, the nuclear debate continues. Now with News Corp advocacy. 2019 – No need to make changes In a press conference before his address to the UN in New York, Morrison says his government’s record on climate has been “misrepresented” by the media. Asked whether Australia intends to update its emissions reduction commitments as required by the Paris agreement’s five-yearly review process, he suggests that Australia’s 2030 target is fixed: “We are keeping to the commitments we have set and do you know why? That’s what I put to the Australian people.” 2019 – $1bn for hydro, gas and batteries Turns out that not having a stable climate policy is not great when it comes to investment. So the government turns to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and offers up $1bn “to support Government investment in new energy generation, storage and transmission infrastructure, including eligible projects shortlisted under the Underwriting New Generation Investments (UNGI) program”. (Not the coal ones though.) The investment is a bit of a turnaround from 2015 when Abbott tried to abolish the fund, and then, when the Senate wouldn’t let him, banned it from investing in major wind and solar projects. 2020-21 – Gas-led recovery Of course, this is still Australia, so the clean energy fund and the Australian renewable energy agency find their mandates changed so they can be used to finance and support fossil fuel projects, as long as there is some (so far failed) carbon abatement project attached. “There are no good and bad emissions reductions,” Morrison says. There are only emissions reductions. Emissions reductions by different means have no greater or lesser moral qualities.” This is mainly done because of the “gas-led recovery” the government decides is going to lead Australia out of Covid. Gas is, of course, a fossil fuel. The gas-fired recovery is the brain child of the Covid advisory recovery committee headed by Nev Power, a former mining executive. 2020-21 – Technology roadmap The last couple of years have all been about roadmaps and shifting horizons, so it makes sense that a technology roadmap is created to shape Australia’s climate policy. The main takeaway? “Technology not taxes”. Which ignores the fact that no one is proposing a tax, because this is not 2010 and the world has moved on. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change drops its latest report, which finds we are almost out of time to act in any sort of meaningful way on the climate crisis. Which increases pressure on Australia from its key allies and trading partners – the US, Europe and the UK, to commit to doing something. So far, what Australia has floated is deemed insufficient. An actual plan is now apparently forthcoming but first it has to get past the Nationals. There is a meeting on Sunday to discuss the plan, which is meant to finally commit Australia to a net zero emissions target by 2050. Just no one mention 2030. 2021 – Glasgow is a go After first saying his job was to stay and speak to Australians about the plan, not the international community, Morrison confirms he will attend the UN climate summit next month, where he will present Australia’s climate plan to the world. It is worth keeping in mind that the government is focused on all things 2050, while the world is moving to medium-term targets for 2030. That debate is still very much not settled in Australia. It’s also worth keeping in mind that net zero emissions does not mean no emissions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2022/dec/19/scott-morrison-swept-away-by-political-tide-as-anthony-albanese-fights-to-fireproof-2023","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-18T14:00:51Z","webTitle":"Scott Morrison swept away by political tide as Anthony Albanese fights to fireproof 2023","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/dec/19/scott-morrison-swept-away-by-political-tide-as-anthony-albanese-fights-to-fireproof-2023","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2022/dec/19/scott-morrison-swept-away-by-political-tide-as-anthony-albanese-fights-to-fireproof-2023","fields":{"headline":"Scott Morrison swept away by political tide as Anthony Albanese fights to fireproof 2023","bodyText":"After coming to office in an election which saw the Liberal party routed in the cities and Labor record its lowest primary vote since the 1930s, the Albanese government got straight to work, legislating a number of campaign promises. The early diligence has been rewarded with positive opinion polls, and Labor has enjoyed a honeymoon with voters, but the new government faces many complex challenges in 2023. The road to 21 May Scott Morrison began his final year in office on the back foot. Australians were fatigued by the coronavirus pandemic and battling natural disasters. People were unsettled by the war in Ukraine and escalating geopolitical tensions closer to home. Inflationary pressure was increasing, eroding family budgets. Digging in for a tough political fight, the Coalition focused efforts on a cash-splash budget to be delivered in March. The government gave cash to Australia’s low- and middle-income earners and cut the fuel excise in half, and $20bn was allocated to regional spending over the medium term. But the largesse failed to turn the political tide. On election day, the Liberal party recorded its lowest seat share since 1946. A swath of Liberal moderates – including the architect of the budget, Josh Frydenberg – were defeated by teal independents, the Greens gained territory in Brisbane and Labor was able to form its first majority government at federal level since 2007. The Australian National University’s Australian Election Study later concluded Morrison was the least popular major party leader since its research began in 1987. Rapid fire transition Labor sprinted out of the blocks after winning the election, beginning parliamentary negotiations on its new emissions reduction target for 2030 and on the federal integrity commission – Australia’s first federal anti-corruption commission. The 2030 target passed in August and the integrity commission in November. The government hosted a jobs and skills summit, setting the scene for new legislation authorising multi-employer bargaining as a policy response to years of stagnant wages. The industrial reform legislation strained Labor’s initially cordial relationship with key business groups and also required concessions to secure support from Senate kingmakers. After delivering a budget that forecast a 56% increase in energy prices by the end of 2023, Labor spent the closing months of 2022 working up a regulatory intervention to try to secure price relief for consumers and businesses. Anthony Albanese also embarked on a wide-ranging reset of diplomatic relationships with the United States and France, and sought early personal connections with regional partners including Japan, India, Indonesia and Pacific leaders. Supported by the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, Albanese began to track towards a reset of the China relationship, which culminated in a face-to-face meeting with Xi Jinping in Bali in November. While Labor forged ahead, the Coalition regrouped, appointing Peter Dutton as leader, but Morrison cast a long shadow over the redux. It was revealed in August that he had sworn himself in to a number of ministerial portfolios during the pandemic, mostly without telling his former colleagues, Labor set up an inquiry led by former high court judge Virginia Bell and the House of Representatives went on to censure the former prime minister – a historic rebuke. Tough battles ahead: climate policy While the Albanese government secured an early win on legislating its 2030 emissions reduction target, a target has little value without mechanisms to drive the promised transition to low emissions. Over the coming months, Labor will reboot the rules for Australia’s heaviest polluters, who have traditionally been vociferously opposed to serious climate action. The government proposes to engage the Abbott-era “safeguard” mechanism to accelerate the rate of emissions reduction in facilities such as coalmines and aluminium smelters. Labor had wanted to begin this work before Christmas, but that ambition was derailed by the power prices intervention. Given heavy polluters often buy carbon credits as an alternative to reducing emissions, the government also has to ensure the integrity of the credits scheme. After a respected whistleblower described Australia’s scheme as a fraud and waste of taxpayer money, Labor established a review by the former chief scientist Ian Chubb. The government will drive the safeguards overhaul at the same time as responding to the Chubb review – in January. Shortly after that, Labor also has to push along its strategy to accelerate the uptake of electric vehicles. The other big item in the transformation agenda is building new high voltage transmission lines to bolt more renewables into the power grid – a huge project rendered more complex by supply chain disruptions and labour shortages. Next year is when the government’s climate agenda will be fleshed out. The response will be a key test. Are the climate wars over, or is Australia about to enter a new phase of an old battle? Voice to parliament Albanese has made achieving the central recommendation of the Uluru statement – establishing a constitutionally enshrined body to make representations to parliament and the government on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples – a key objective of his prime ministership. Achieving this requires a successful referendum delivering the required double majority (approval from a majority of voters nationally and a majority in a majority of the states). History suggests bipartisanship is the bedrock of successful forays to change the constitution, but the Nationals have already declared opposition. The Liberals are yet to determine a position. The referendum is expected to be held in 2023, but it is not entirely clear when. Some suggest October. Others hint it could be earlier. The prime minister flagged the possible referendum question when he attended the Garma festival in July – do you support an alteration to the constitution that establishes an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice? He also suggested words that could be added to the constitution. Opponents of the voice claim the change must be resisted because there is not enough detail about what it will do, a contention rejected by ministers and Indigenous leaders who have been working on the proposal for years. Opinion polls suggest a majority of Australians in a majority of states would support the voice, with young people strongly in favour. Polls also suggest many people don’t have their head around the detail, a vacuum which could prove problematic for advocates of constitutional reform in the event “no” campaigners are able to mount an effective scare campaign. Cost of living “It’s the economy, stupid” is the famous political maxim coined by the Democratic party strategist James Carville. The quip persists because the performance of the economy is very often linked to the longevity of governments. Treasury forecast in October inflation was likely to peak at close to 8% by the end of 2022, before easing gradually over the next two years. That means sustained high consumer prices, accompanied by higher borrowing costs. These conditions are never comfortable for governments, but cushioning voters from a sustained cost-of-living crisis comes at a cost. Earlier in 2022, the economic ministers, Jim Chalmers and Katy Gallagher, flew a kite about the stage-three tax cuts. Before the election, Labor promised to deliver the stage-three package, which predominantly benefits higher income earners. But flattening the tax scales will cost $254bn over 10 years. Chalmers and Gallagher gestured towards some tinkering to rebuild the fiscal buffers, but Albanese ultimately killed the debate. Rebuilding the fiscal buffers remains a sound idea, given the uncertainty in the economic outlook, but it is unclear whether Labor is prepared to risk breaking an election promise. It is possible the government could seek a mandate for broader tax changes at the 2025 election. In any case, inflation and the state of the economy will remain a significant focus in 2023. Escalating great power competition in the Indo-Pacific also has significant fiscal implications for Australia. In the first quarter of next year, there will be a conversation about Australia’s ability to defend its shores. Deterrence and military capability Australia’s decision to enter the Aukus nuclear submarine agreement with the United States and the UK generated headlines around the world. Questions persist about how this agreement will be executed given Australia lacks a domestic nuclear power industry. It is also unclear how Australia will manages the capability gap that exists in the interim. There are also fears Aukus will fuel a regional arms race. Nuclear submarines are only one component of a much bigger strategic question. Can Australia defend itself in a dangerous age? Do we have the right mix of hardware and personnel? Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine has put this existential query front-of-mind for many governments, including our own. To this end, an external review of Australia’s defence capability will report in March. That review is expected to pave the way for more spending on defence and deterrence, including the acquisition of more missiles and drones to step up Australia’s capacity to respond against sudden attack. Expect to hear much more on these questions in the opening six months of next year. Electoral funding: testing the limits of new politics? When Australians elected a Labor government in May, they also ushered in a progressive parliament with a substantial crossbench, including teal independents backed in part by the fund-raising juggernaut that is Climate 200. Disclosures released by the Australian Electoral Commission indicate the teal campaigns in 2022 were powered by $10.2m of political donations. Climate 200 raised $13m and donated to 23 campaigns. The resources magnate Clive Palmer has also invested a fortune in recent federal elections, with a much smaller reward. Labor will have the numbers in parliament for an overhaul of the donations and disclosure regime, and has plans to legislate caps on electoral spending. The ALP’s 2022 campaign director, Paul Erickson, says the current lack of restrictions “has allowed extremely high-net-worth individuals, groups and networks to distort the political conversation with levels of advertising that were previously inconceivable in Australian elections”. But Climate 200 notes electoral expenditure caps “do not put candidates on a level playing field if they don’t take into account the entrenched benefits to incumbents”. It is unclear whether Labor’s inclination to constrain campaign spending will be shared by the Liberal party after it lost a chunk of its metropolitan heartland to the teals in May, or whether a version of that reform can be hammered out, bearing in mind legitimate concerns about the structural benefits of incumbency. This won’t be the biggest debate of the new political year, but it will be an interesting one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/22/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-21T18:00:45Z","webTitle":"What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week?

Catch up with the must-read news and analysis","bodyText":"Putin unleashes a fresh wave of strikes Daniel Boffey reported from Zaporizhzha, where the Russians generally strike at 2am, 4am and 6am, or when “people’s dreams are at their deepest”, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the governor of the south-eastern region of Ukraine where, at the time of writing, 70 people had been killed in two weeks. Among the dead was Serhiy Govelov, 56. His son and wife, Bogdan and Olga, had run down and out of their apartment after a missile hit their building at 2.30am. Serhiy was lying at the bottom in a huge crater. “They tried to pull him out but instead watched as his internal organs spilled out into the dirt. ‘He was still alive, he was still alive,’ says Olga. The grief has put them in an almost trance-like state. “The trees outside the apartments have a peculiar foliage today: ripped blouses, trousers, skirts and T-shirts catapulted 20 metres on to their branches from washing lines on the balconies of shattered homes. A total of 15 people died in this strike. “The region of Zaporizhzhia, and its capital, is one of the four provinces, along with Donetsk and Luhansk to the east and Kherson to its south-west, that were said by Putin to have been annexed into the Russian Federation on 1 October.” Russia attacked Kyiv with nearly 30 “kamikaze” drones on Monday morning, killing four, including a pregnant woman and her partner, days after Vladimir Putin said there would be no more “massive strikes” on the country. Also on Monday, a Russian military jet crashed into a residential building shortly after taking off near the border with Ukraine, sparking a major fire that has reportedly left at least 13 people dead, according to Russian news agency Interfax, citing a senior official. Daniel Boffey was in Kyiv when Monday’s strikes started, and wrote about the experience, which started with hearing a sound “similar to a moped at first but ever more like the full-throated roar of a motorbike”. He sheltered in a station underpass, where “parents tried to distract toddlers with anything they had to hand: a toy car, a pebble.” Dan Sabbagh looked into what kamikaze drones are, writing that Russia’s increasing use of the weapons reflects “both a strength and a weakness”. While their use appears to demonstrate that Russia is running short of guided missiles, he wrote, “Monday morning’s drone bombings in the centre of Kyiv, in two clusters at the time of the morning rush hour, show how the weapons can cause destruction and fear in a capital that until a week ago had not been attacked for months.” Meanwhile, Britain joined France in viewing the Iranian supply of armed drones to Russia as a breach of Iran’s obligations under the 2015 nuclear deal. The Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Naser Kanani, in his weekly press conference again denied Iran was supplying drones to Russia, challenging claims by the US, Ukraine and many arms specialists that Iranian-manufactured Shahed-136 drones were in clear use. A third of Ukraine’s power stations destroyed in 10 days Ukraine introduced an emergency schedule of power cuts to help stabilise the country’s energy supply, which has been badly damaged by more than 300 Russian drone and missile attacks over the past 10 days – and as the weather turns cooler. The bombing is often inaccurate and civilians have been killed in residential buildings in Kyiv and other big cities, Dan Sabbagh and Patrick Wintour reported. But enough have got through to cause problems for a power grid already short of generation capacity after the Zaprorizhzhia nuclear power plant was shut down. Kyiv’s mayor appealed to residents to conserve electricity by turning off air conditioners, electric kettles and microwaves, and said houses experiencing reduced water pressure should use water as “economically as possible”. Dan Sabbagh looked into what winter is likely to bring for Ukrainians. “It is a grim warning. While attention has been focused on the civilian casualties and chaos caused by Russia’s renewed bombing of Kyiv and other major cities, its impact on the country’s energy supply has not been quantified until today,” he wrote. “President Zelenskiy announced that 30% of the country’s power stations had been knocked out in just eight days, an astonishing proportion in a short amount of time with blackouts occurring in the east of the capital.” Iran strengthens commitment to Russia Iran significantly deepened its involvement in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by providing technical support for Russian pilots flying Iranian-made drones to bomb civilian targets, the White House confirmed. The national security council lead spokesperson, John Kirby, said on Thursday that it was the US’s understanding that Iranian advisers were in Crimea to provide training and maintenance – but not to actually pilot the drones – after Russian forces experienced difficulties in operating the unmanned flying bombs. “The information we have is that the Iranians have put trainers and tech support in Crimea, but it’s the Russians who are doing the piloting,” Kirby said. “Tehran is now directly engaged on the ground and through the provision of weapons … that are killing civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure. These are systems that the Russian armed forces are not familiar [with] using and these are organically manufactured Iranian UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles]. The Russians just don’t have anything in their inventory.” Iran has also agreed to provide a batch of medium-range missiles to Russia, designed to supplement the severely run-down stock of Russian missiles as part of a bid to systematically destroy Ukraine’s electricity infrastructure ahead of a brutal winter, Patrick Wintour reported. While repeated its denial of selling drones to Russia on Tuesday, Tehran at the same time asserts it is fully entitled to sell arms abroad, as the restrictions on arms sales contained in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal expired in 2020. The US, France and the UK say missile sales would be in breach of the nuclear deal. The White House has straightforwardly accused Iran of lying about the drone sales, but has been more circumspect about the missile sales. The cost to Ukraine of downing the “kamikaze” drones being fired at its cities vastly exceeds the sums paid by Russia in sourcing and launching the weapons, analysis suggests. Daniel Boffey crunched the numbers. Russia’s new commander admits the situation is tough The new commander of Moscow’s army in Ukraine announced on Tuesday that civilians were being “resettled” from the Russian-occupied southern city of Kherson, describing the military situation as “tense”. Pjotr Sauer, Dan Sabbagh and Julian Borger reported on his statement from Kyiv and Washington. “The enemy continually attempts to attack the positions of Russian troops,” Sergei Surovikin said in his first televised interview since being appointed earlier this month, adding that the situation was particularly difficult around the occupied southern city of Kherson. Surovikin’s statements on Tuesday came amid repeated military setbacks for Russian forces. Surovikin admitted that the situation in Kherson was “not easy”. “Further actions and plans regarding the city of Kherson will depend on the developing military-tactical situation, which is not easy. We will act consciously, in a timely manner, without ruling out difficult decisions,” he added. The comments appeared to mark a rare acknowledgment of the difficulties facing Russian forces. But it was not immediately clear whether Surovikin, the ruthless general now in charge of the war, was hinting at a looming Russian withdrawal from Kherson or a fresh round of airstrikes. Kyiv is protecting its statues from Russian strikes Charlotte Higgins wrote about how Kyiv is protecting its statues from Russian strikes. Kyiv’s statues – sandbagged by the city authorities for protection – are one of only a few reminders, along with an 11pm curfew and the regular wailing of air raid sirens, that this bustling city is at war. Boxed up, muffled, veiled and hidden, they also give Kyiv a strange new look – as if the sculptures have been replaced by contemporary artworks. In Volodymyrska Hirka Park, where paths wind through trees above the Dnieper River, a sculpture dedicated to Dante Alighieri was inaugurated in 2021 – a gesture towards western European, rather than Russian, culture. His gaunt, rather mournful carrara marble head pokes up comically from above the sandbags. Hungary and Poland have fallen out over the war Jennifer Rankin looked at the growing rift between Hungary and Poland. “While Warsaw has been one of Kyiv’s staunchest supporters, urging tougher sanctions, Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, has described Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as his ‘opponent’ and blamed the EU’s Russia policy for inflation and soaring energy prices,” she wrote. “Despite a few tentative olive branches, Polish-Hungarian relations remain tense.” She reports that a recent YouGov poll exposed the gulf in public perceptions of the war between the two neighbours. While 65% of Poles support maintaining sanctions against Russia, only 32% of Hungarians back this EU policy. Similarly, three-quarters of Polish citizens blame Russia for the war, compared with only 35% of Hungarians."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/13/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-293-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-13T17:09:19Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 293 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/13/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-293-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/13/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-293-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 293 of the invasion","bodyText":"Generators are as important as armour in helping Ukraine survive Vladimir Putin’s energy terror this winter, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. Ukraine needed an additional €800m (£686m) to survive the winter and €1.5bn to restore the long-term damage to the energy grid, its president told an emergency conference in Paris convened to coordinate infrastructure and humanitarian aid to the country over the next four months. More than €1bn was raised to support Ukraine this winter at the aid conference in Paris, France’s foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, said. The money, pledged by 46 countries and 24 international organisations, would be split between restoring Ukraine’s depleted energy network, the food sector, water supply, health and transportation, Colonna said. Ukrainian forces have reportedly damaged a key bridge outside the southern city of Melitopol, a key objective for Kyiv in the region. Video posted online showed two supports of the bridge had been damaged during the attack, just two days after Ukraine hit a Russian barracks sited in a resort in the city, with Himars rockets causing substantial damage and casualties. Ukrainian officials gave the all clear on Tuesday after air raid sirens blared across the country following warnings that Russia may carry out a new wave of missile strikes. Ukrainian media said the alerts may have been triggered by MiG fighter jets that took off from Ryazan, near Russia’s border with Ukraine, and flew towards Belarus. Russia and Ukraine pounded each other’s forces in heavy fighting in the eastern region of Donetsk on Tuesday. Moscow is battling to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, two of four territories the Kremlin claims to have annexed in votes rejected by most countries as illegal. The town of Klintsy in Russia’s southern Bryansk region was shelled overnight by Ukraine, the regional governor claimed, adding that there were no casualties or damage. “As a result of the work of the air defence systems of the Russian Armed Forces, the missile was destroyed, some parts hit the territory of an industrial zone,” governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram. Ukraine must take into account the new territorial “realities” that include Russia’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions, the Kremlin has said. Ukraine’s president said on Monday that Russia could begin to withdraw its troops from the territory of Ukraine to show they are capable of abandoning their aggression. In response, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there could be “no question” of Moscow beginning to pull out its troops by the end of the year. Russian president Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping will hold talks to discuss the events of 2022 in late December, the Russian business daily Vedomosti reported. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, told the newspaper that the date and the agenda of the meeting are already known, but an official announcement will come later. The talks will unlikely be face-to-face, the paper said. The Belarusian ministry of defence has announced a “sudden combat readiness check” of its troops. The exercises are mostly taking place in the north-west of the country, not close to Ukraine’s border. This is one in a string of announcements by Belarus since mid-October which Kyiv say is designed to stoke fear in Ukrainians and disinform Ukraine’s army. Germany will approve another €50m in winter aid for Kyiv following Russia’s missile attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said. She said Berlin was working to deliver generators, blankets and heating fuel to Ukraine over Christmas. The UK Foreign Office announced it was sanctioning 12 Russian commanders for their role in attacks on Ukrainian cities. Those sanctioned include Maj Gen Robert Baranov, identified by Bellingcat as the commander of programming and targeting Russian cruise missiles, as well as four Iranians including the co-owner and managing director of MADO, an Iranian drone engine manufacturer. Arms shipments to Ukraine will end as soon as peace talks to end the Russian invasion begin, Italy’s defence minister told parliament. “I am aware that military aid will have to end sooner or later, and will end when we will have the peace talks that we are all hoping for,” said the defence minister, Guido Crosetto, while addressing the upper-house Senate. French president Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday that there was an agreement on removing heavy weapons from Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plants. Talks were underway, he said, adding: “We managed to protect Chornobyl and our goal is to protect Zaporizhzhia. The coming weeks will be crucial.” Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said he did not expect to have contacts with the US regarding further prisoner exchanges, Russian media reported. The White House said on Monday that senior US officials plan to hold talks this week with Russian counterparts to discuss the case of the detained American, Paul Whelan. Ryabkov was quoted as saying that he didn’t know what the Americans “have in mind”. Ukraine has called for the west to supply Patriot missiles batteries and other modern air defence systems. The country’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, appealed to western allies on Monday amid growing concerns that attacks by Russia on its electricity grid could create a new wave of refugees. The United States has shipped the first part of its power equipment aid to Ukraine, US officials said on Monday, as Washington works to support the country’s energy infrastructure against intensifying attacks from Russia. The first tranche was power equipment worth about $13m, one of the officials said. Another source familiar with the matter said two more planeloads of equipment would leave from the United States this week. The head of Norway’s refugee council said he expects another wave of hundreds of thousands of refugees from Ukraine to go to Europe over the winter because of “unliveable” conditions. Millions of people in Ukraine have been left without heat, clean water or power amid plummeting temperatures, following Russian missile strikes on the country’s energy infrastructure. The European Union reached a deal in principle to send an €18bn ($18.93bn) financial aid package to Ukraine and approve a minimum tax on major corporations in a big move that narrowed a rift between the bloc and recalcitrant member Hungary. European Union governments on Monday struck a deal with Hungary that sorts out financial aid for Ukraine in 2023 and gains Budapest’s approval for a global minimum corporate tax, all in exchange for EU flexibility about funds paid to Hungary. The complex deal came after months of wrangling between EU institutions, member countries and Hungary and was spelled out on Monday by the council that represents EU member governments and by diplomats speaking anonymously. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged leaders of the Group of Seven nations on Monday to support his idea of convening a special global peace summit in winter dedicated to bringing peace to his country. Zelenskiy also appealed to the G7 nations for an additional 2bn cubic metres of natural gas as well as long-range weapons, modern tanks, artillery units and shells. Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout has joined the Kremlin-loyal ultranationalist Liberal Democratic party (LDPR), its leader said. Bout, once nicknamed “the Merchant of Death”, was freed last week after 14 years in US custody in a high-profile swap with the American basketball star Brittney Griner. The move could see Bout seek a seat in the Russian parliament. The exiled mayor of Melitopol claims Russian troops are “redeploying” and “panicking” following Ukrainian attacks on the Russian-occupied city over the weekend. Russian forces “are busy moving their military groups to other places to try to hide them”, Ivan Fedorov said without providing evidence. Ukraine’s deputy head of military intelligence has warned that Russia has enough missiles to launch another three to five waves of strikes on the country. Vadym Skibitsky also claimed Russia is using old Ukrainian missiles against Kyiv and outlined the four general directions from which Russia is launching missiles into Ukraine. Two civilians have been killed and 10 more injured after Russian rocket attacks on the town of Hirnyk in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. Russian forces struck the centre of the town “with cluster munitions and Uragan MLRS [multilaunch rocket systems]”, the prosecutor general’s office said. Two people were killed and another five wounded after Russian troops shelled the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson, according to local authorities. “The enemy again attacked the residential quarters of Kherson,” governor Yaroslav Yanushevich said on Telegram, adding the Russian forces hit a maternity ward, a cafe and apartment buildings on Saturday. Ukraine has claimed to have struck a headquarters used by the paramilitary Wagner group in the occupied territories of the Luhansk region. Serhiy Haidai, the exiled governor of the Luhansk region, told Ukrainian television that a strike in the town of Kadiivka had led to a “huge number” of deaths among the mercenary group that has been accused of torture and other war crimes. Vladimir Putin will not hold a year-end press conference for the first time in at least a decade, in what Kremlin watchers view as a break with protocol due to his war in Ukraine. There would also be no New Year reception at the Kremlin, officials said, possibly a decision influenced by the reluctance to celebrate because Russia’s war in Ukraine has not gone to plan. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said he would be “open minded” about supplying Ukraine with longer-range weapons if Russia continued to target civilian areas. Wallace said he “constantly” reviewed the weapons systems the UK sends to Ukraine, and that he “will be open minded to see what we do next” if Moscow tries to “break those Geneva conventions”, referring to agreed basic humanitarian principles during war. The EU has secured enough gas for this winter but could face a gas shortage next year if Russia further cuts supplies, the European Commission and the International Energy Agency (IEA) have warned. An international team of legal advisers has been working with local prosecutors in Ukraine’s recaptured city of Kherson to gather evidence of alleged sexual crimes by Russian forces. A team from Global Rights Compliance, an international legal practice headquartered in The Hague, are conducting a full-scale investigation part of a broader international effort to support overwhelmed Ukrainian authorities. A neo-Nazi paramilitary group linked to the Kremlin has asked its members to submit intelligence on border and military activity in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, raising concerns over whether far-right Russian groups are planning an attack on Nato countries. The body of a 23-year-old Zambian student who died while fighting for the Russian army in the war in Ukraine has been returned home.

Polls show more than 70% of people, especially Conservatives, are in favour. The government’s December 2020 energy white paper seems to agree, saying onshore wind is one of the “key building blocks of the future generation mix”. But there is a problem. While it is possible to build gas or nuclear power stations however many people object to the coastline or nature being trashed, it is possible in England for one person to prevent a wind development. The national planning policy framework, updated in July, says proposals for onshore wind cannot go ahead unless objections by the local community have been fully addressed and the proposal has their backing. Or, as RenewableUK puts it, “new developments require unanimous public support”. Fortunately Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not have such a hurdle, so that is where almost all wind development will take place, leaving many suitable sites in England unused."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jun/05/russia-launches-air-strikes-into-kyiv-for-first-time-in-five-weeks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-05T11:04:22Z","webTitle":"Russia claims to have targeted western-supplied tanks in Kyiv airstrikes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/05/russia-launches-air-strikes-into-kyiv-for-first-time-in-five-weeks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jun/05/russia-launches-air-strikes-into-kyiv-for-first-time-in-five-weeks","fields":{"headline":"Russia claims to have targeted western-supplied tanks in Kyiv airstrikes","bodyText":"Russia launched airstrikes on Kyiv for the first time in five weeks on Sunday, claiming it had targeted western-supplied tanks – while the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, warned more targets would be struck if weapons deliveries continued. Several explosions were heard around the eastern Kyiv suburbs of Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi early on Sunday morning, wounding one person. The strikes represented a change of tack on the part of the invading forces. Russia’s ministry of defence said the strikes had destroyed T-72 tanks that had been provided to Ukraine by European countries that were being stored in the buildings of a car repair business, although the claim could not immediately be verified. Oleksandr Kamyshin, the chair of the board of Ukrainian Railways, said the Russian claims were false. “There are no such tanks at the plant, as well as no military equipment. There are only cars that we repair. These carriages we need for export – these are, in particular, grain carriages,” he said. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said “one victim was hospitalised” in the incident. Sergei Leshchenko, a member of the Ukrainian railway company’s supervisory board, added that its facilities had been struck. They were the first bombing raids on any part of the capital since the end of April and appear to represent an attempt to strike supply lines from Kyiv to the east, where both sides are embroiled an intense battle for control of Donbas. Perhaps signalling the new approach, Putin told Rossiya state television that Russia would hit fresh targets in Ukraine if the US delivered the longer-range rockets that it had promised to Kyiv last week. If such missiles were supplied, “we will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting”, said Putin, who is believed to be closely involved in military decision-making. The Russian leader did not specify what would be struck, although logistics points would be amongst the most logical targets. Russia has been irritated by the US decision to supply Ukraine with Himars truck-mounted multiple-launch rocket systems, with missiles that have a range of about 20 to 40 miles, greater than anything in Kyiv’s armoury. “All this fuss around additional deliveries of weapons, in my opinion, has only one goal: to drag out the armed conflict as much as possible,” Putin said in his TV interview. Ukraine and the west believe the rockets could help Kyiv prevent Russian forces massing behind the frontlines for future attacks, but Putin argued it would not bring on any significant change to the military balance. “We understand that this supply [of advance rocket systems] from the United States and some other countries is meant to make up for the losses of this military equipment,” Putin said. “This is nothing new. It doesn’t change anything in essence.” Ukraine’s nuclear energy company Energoatom also warned that a Russian cruise missile had come dangerously close to the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant, in the south of the country, at about 5.30am, apparently heading for Kyiv. It said the missile “flew critically low” over the site and that Russian forces “still do not understand that even the smallest fragment of a missile that can hit a working power unit can cause a nuclear catastrophe and radiation leak”. The last time Kyiv was hit was on 28 April, when a Russian missile killed a producer for the US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Since then Moscow has ignored the capital as it tries to push Ukraine out of Donbas. Britain’s Ministry of Defence said that Ukrainian forces had counterattacked in Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, “likely blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained” – but offered no assessment whether the effort was pushing the invaders back. On Saturday, Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian governor of Luhansk province, said his country’s forces had regained about 20% of the Donbas city, which had been under days of sustained attack by concentrated Russian shelling and airstrikes. Haidai repeated that claim on Sunday, adding that eight Russians had been taken prisoner and that the occupiers had “lost a huge number of personnel”. A humanitarian headquarters in neighbouring Lysychansk had been struck with 30 shells overnight, the governor said. Ukrainian forces were “successfully slowing down Russian operations” in Donbas and were making “effective local counterattacks in Sievierodonetsk”, said the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, overnight. The research group, which closely monitors the fighting, said that Russia “may still be able to capture Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk” and that it appeared that “Ukrainian defences remain strong in this pivotal theatre”. Britain’s Ministry of Defence said Russia was relying on “poorly equipped and trained” separatist forces from Luhansk to conduct the clearance of the city, a tactic it said had been previously employed by Moscow’s forces in Syria. “This approach likely indicates a desire to limit casualties suffered by regular Russian forces,” it added. One Ukrainian presidential adviser urged European nations to respond with “more sanctions, more weapons” to the missile attacks – and appeared to criticise the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who had said in an interview on Friday that Russia must not be humiliated in Ukraine so that a diplomatic solution could eventually be found. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the President’s Office, tweeted: “While someone asks not to humiliate Russia, the Kremlin resorts to new insidious attacks. Today’s missile strikes at Kyiv have only one goal – kill as many Ukrainians as possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/apr/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-reportedly-carrying-out-overhaul-of-security-services-over-data-leaks-to-ukraine-says-us-thinktank","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-20T17:52:29Z","webTitle":"Kremlin’s foreign minister to meet UN secretary general; US considering ban on exports to Russia – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/apr/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-reportedly-carrying-out-overhaul-of-security-services-over-data-leaks-to-ukraine-says-us-thinktank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/apr/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-moscow-reportedly-carrying-out-overhaul-of-security-services-over-data-leaks-to-ukraine-says-us-thinktank","fields":{"headline":"Kremlin’s foreign minister to meet UN secretary general; US considering ban on exports to Russia – as it happened","bodyText":"The time is now approaching 9pm in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. Here is a roundup of today’s news as Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, visited the country and held a joint press conference with Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Ukraine’s future lies in Nato, the western military alliance’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, said during his first visit to the country since Russia’s invasion 14 months ago. He pledged continued military support for Ukraine, saying that, so far, Nato allies had trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops and provided €65bn ($71.31bn) of military aid alone. “Nato stands with you today, tomorrow and for as long as it takes,” Stoltenberg stated, before inviting Volodymyr Zelenskiy to the Nato summit in Vilnius in July. Zelenskiy said Nato needs to invite Ukraine to become a member and give it a timeframe for accession. “There is not a single objective barrier to the political decision to invite Ukraine into the alliance and now, when most people in Nato countries and the majority of Ukrainians support Nato accession, is the time for the corresponding decisions.” Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s longtime foreign minister, will meet the UN secretary general, António Guterres, on Monday, according to Russia’s ambassador to the UN. The two last met at the G20 summit in Bali in November. According to ambassador Vassily Nebenzia the Black Sea grain deal will be an item for the meeting on Monday. Denmark, together with the Netherlands, is to donate 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Denmark’s acting defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said they are not Danish tanks, but tanks “which are bought in collaboration with the Netherlands”. Foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen described it as “a very significant contribution”. The admiral of Russia’s Pacific fleet has left his position after a check of its combat readiness. Adm Sergei Avakyants left his post as commander as it was announced he will oversee a new centre for military sports training and “patriotic education”. Units from the Pacific fleet had been taking part in inspection exercises that were announced by the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, last week. The Financial Times has reported that a leaked US intelligence report shows that China refused a request from the Wagner mercenary group for weapons. Wagner’s request in early 2023 suggested “it had some confidence Beijing would be open to arming Moscow, going beyond other non-lethal forms of support for the military campaign provided by Chinese companies,” according to the FT. Switzerland will add Wagner and news agency RIA to its list of Russian-sanctioned entities. A group of Ukrainian servicemen have been accused of treason for giving away information during an unauthorised mission that enabled Russia to attack a military airfield, Ukraine’s SBU security agency said. The SBU announced in a statement that the servicemen had attempted, “without coordination with the relevant state authorities”, to seize a Russian plane last July after its pilot said he would defect. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has criticised the delays in the EU plan for jointly buying ammunition for Ukraine. The EU agreed the purchase of 1m artillery rounds for Ukraine in March, but there are still discussions about the plan’s details. The US and other allies of Ukraine are considering an outright ban on most exports to Russia in an attempt to increase economic pressure on Russian president, Vladimir Putin. The report by the Bloomburg business website says discussions are under way ahead of the G7 leaders’ summit in May. It is thought that it will be followed by similar actions by EU member states. The United States announced $325m in new military aid for Ukraine, including additional ammunition for high mobility artillery rocket systems, advanced missiles and anti-tank mines. It is the 36th security package since the war began in February 2022. That’s all for today, thank you for following along. We’ll be back tomorrow. Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s longtime foreign minister, will meet the UN secretary general António Guterres on Monday, according to Russia’s ambassador to the UN. The two last met at the G20 summit in Bali in November, where they discussed the Black Sea grain deal. According to ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, the Black Sea grain deal will again be an item for the meeting on Monday. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has criticised the delays in the EU plan for jointly buying ammunition for Ukraine. The EU agreed the purchase of 1m artillery rounds for Ukraine in March, but there are still discussions about the plan’s details. One disagreement is over whether the firms to receive the contracts should be just in the EU, and whether the US or UK should be involved. Politico reported on Wednesday that France is pushing for the funds to stay in the EU. Kuleba tweeted on Thursday: “The inability of the EU to implement its own decision on the joint procurement of ammunition for Ukraine is frustrating. This is a test of whether the EU has strategic autonomy in making new crucial security decisions. For Ukraine, the cost of inaction is measured in human lives.” A group of foreign affairs committees from parliaments across Europe have signed a joint statement calling for the “immediate and unconditional release” of Vladimir Kara-Murza. It was signed in London on Thursday during a security conference which included discussions about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Other signatories include representatives from Sweden, Ireland, Poland and Denmark, as well as Baltic states and other Visegrád members. It says: “We … strongly condemn [the] Russian court decision sentencing one of the leading [politicians] and Kremlin vocal critic Vladimir Kara-Murza to 25 years on politically motivated charges. “It is a clear demonstration of misuse of power by Russian authorities and [an] attempt to silence political opponents.” A Ukrainian brigade that vows to “destroy Russian troops” simulated a skirmish in the woods near Kyiv on Thursday, as the country pushes ahead with plans for a counteroffensive – with the hope of getting similar results to the one that swept across south-eastern Ukraine in autumn 2022. In a glade of pine trees, reconnaissance troops from the Bureviy brigade, playing the “enemy,” covered their faces in camouflage makeup and balaclavas, donned yeti-style suits and rolled in marsh water to blend in with their surroundings. Then another group representing Ukrainian forces launched a surprise attack on them, shooting blanks and flinging smoke grenades according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). Part of the National Guard internal troops, Bureviy, or storm, brigade is also known as the “first presidential brigade”. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised its “resilience” this week. Bureviy says its name in Ukrainian can also be deciphered as “brigade to destroy Russian troops”. Ukraine has said they will aim to liberate regions that are now under Moscow's occupation – including Crimea. “It’s time to return what’s ours,” reads the National Guard’s recruitment site. “At the beginning of the war, we took a defensive position. Our task was to restrain the enemy,” said one of the Bureviy soldiers, Taras, 41, who joined up soon after Russia’s invasion in February 2022. “Now we must go on the counteroffensive. We need to win back what was taken from us,” said the former manager in a factory making armoured doors. Italy said it is seeking to freeze the assets of a Russian arrested in Milan at Washington’s request who disappeared while under house arrest only to re-emerge in Russia. Agence France-Presse reports that justice minister, Carlo Nordio, was called to parliament to explain what happened with Artyom Uss, the son of Siberian governor, Alexander Uss, who was arrested in Italy on a US warrant in October. He went missing from his residence near Milan at the end of March, despite wearing an electronic tracking bracelet, the day after a judge ordered his extradition to the US. The US had warned that he may flee. Washington accuses Uss of taking part in illegal schemes to export US military technology to Russia. In evidence to MPs, Nordio did not explain how he escaped, saying only that an investigation was under way. But he said Italy was “checking whether it was possible to insert Uss in the list of Russian citizens whose assets it is possible to freeze”. “Let’s see [if] we can at least attack him on his assets,” he added. The minister also said he had initiated disciplinary proceedings before the court of cassation against the magistrates of the Milan appeal court who authorised his transfer from detention to house arrest. On 4 April, Uss announced he was back in Russia, giving no details of how he escaped. Uss was one of five Russians arrested on Washington’s request in October for “unlawful schemes to export powerful” US military technology to Russia. The US justice department said some of these had been “discovered on the battlefields of Ukraine”. The US and other allies of Ukraine are considering an outright ban on most exports to Russia in an attempt to increase economic pressure on Russian president, Vladimir Putin. The report by the Bloomburg business website says discussions are under way ahead of the G7 leaders’ summit in May. It is thought that it will be followed by similar actions by EU member states. It would transform the current sanctions package of measures in favour of introducing more stringent restrictions. Only a limited amount of goods could still be traded. Earlier on Thursday, the Financial Times reported that, according to EU officials, there would be no new sanctions against Russia in the near future. A group of Ukrainian servicemen have been accused of treason for giving away information during an unauthorised mission that enabled Russia to attack a military airfield, Ukraine’s SBU security agency said on Thursday. The SBU said in a statement that the servicemen had attempted, “without coordination with the relevant state authorities”, to seize a Russian plane last July after its pilot said he would defect. During the “special operation”, they revealed details about the location of Ukrainian air force personnel and aircraft that made it possible for Russia to carry out a successful missile strike on the Kanatove airfield in central Ukraine near the city of Kryvyi Rih, it said. A Ukrainian commander was killed, 17 other personnel were wounded, two fighter jets were destroyed and the airstrip, buildings and equipment suffered significant damage, the SBU said in the statement posted on the Telegram messaging app. The SBU did not say how many service personnel were involved, or identify them, but said they were accused of treason and abuse of their position. “According to the investigation, the (air) strike was caused by the arbitrary actions of individual servicemen who decided to … seize a plane of the Russian Aerospace Forces, whose pilot supposedly agreed to an offer to defect to Ukraine,” it said. “These actions of individual servicemen, which led to serious consequences, death and injury of Ukraine’s defenders and harmed the country’s defence capabilities, require an appropriate legal assessment.” The Financial Times has reported that a leaked US intelligence report shows that China refused a request from the Wagner mercenary group for weapons. Wagner’s request in early 2023 suggested “it had some confidence Beijing would be open to arming Moscow, going beyond other non-lethal forms of support for the military campaign provided by Chinese companies,” the FT reported. However no weapons have been provided and it hasn’t been in contact with the group. China’s foreign minister, Qin Gang, has said that the country will not sell weapons to either side in the war, despite US concerns being raised. Russian president, Vladimir Putin, visited China and met President Xi Jinping in March. Ukraine has also said it has not found any Chinese weapons on the battlefield. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Ukraine. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that a person has been killed after shelling in the Kherson region. On its official Telegram channel, it posted to say that “civil infrastructure objects, residential buildings, commercial premises and motor vehicles were damaged” in Kizomys. Citing the local prosecutor’s office, Suspilne said: “So far, the death of one man is known, the number of wounded is being identified.” Kizomys is on the right-bank of the Dnipro River, to the north of the portion of Kherson occupied by Russia. Kherson is one of the partially controlled regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Milk, poultry and other food products should be included on a list of Ukrainian imports to be temporarily banned by the EU, Poland’s agriculture minister said on Thursday. It follows Hungary extending its ban on grain to other foodstuffs on Thursday (see 10:13am). “We discussed our proposals, our list is much wider – milk, poultry meat, honey,” Robert Telus told a news conference. European trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis discussed the plans on Wednesday with ministers from Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, as well as with Ukrainian counterparts. More from the press conference here, Volodymyr Zelenskiy also told journalists that he urged Stoltenberg to overcome the “restraint” of some member states in supplying modern warplanes, long-range weapons, artillery and armour. He said they had discussed the meeting at Rammstein in Germany for military powers on Friday, and how Ukraine may be able to get more aid. Holdups were costing lives of Ukrainian soldiers, he added. Zelenskiy went on to say that he wanted Ukraine to have security guarantees while on the Nato aceession path. The president added that he sees Stoltenberg’s visit as a sign of Nato’s openness to “open a new ambitious chapter” for Ukraine and the alliance, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s future lies in Nato, the western military alliance’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Thursday during his first visit to the country since Russia’s invasion 14 months ago. “Let me be clear: Ukraine’s rightful place is in the Euro-Atlantic family. Ukraine’s rightful place is in Nato. And over time, our support will help you to make this possible,” Stoltenberg told reporters during a joint press conference with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv, Reuters reports. He pledged continued military support for Ukraine, saying that, so far, Nato allies had trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops and provided €65bn ($71.31bn) of military aid alone. “Nato stands with you today, tomorrow and for as long as it takes,” Stoltenberg stated, before inviting Zelenskiy to the Nato summit in Vilnius in July. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Nato needs to invite Ukraine to become a member and give it a timeframe for accession during a visit by the alliance’s secretary general. The Ukrainian president told a joint news conference in Kyiv with Nato chief, Jens Stoltenberg, that a Nato summit in Vilnius in July could become “historic”, and that he had been invited to attend. “I am grateful for the invitation to visit the summit, but it is also important for Ukraine to receive the corresponding invitation,” he told reporters, according to Reuters. “There is not a single objective barrier to the political decision to invite Ukraine into the alliance and now, when most people in Nato countries and the majority of Ukrainians support Nato accession, is the time for the corresponding decisions.” The admiral of Russia’s Pacific fleet has left his position after a check of its combat readiness. Adm Sergei Avakyants left his post as commander on Thursday as it was announced he will oversee a new centre for military sports training and “patriotic education”. Units from the Pacific fleet had been taking part in inspection exercises that were announced by the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, last week. Its results have not been announced. The fleet has been involved in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including some combat action for its marines in Vuhledar, Donetsk. Associated Press photographer Evgeniy Maloletka won the World Press Photo of the Year award on Thursday for his harrowing image of emergency workers carrying a pregnant woman through the shattered grounds of a maternity hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, in the chaotic aftermath of a Russian attack. The Ukrainian photographer’s 9 March 2022 picture of the fatally wounded woman, her left hand on her bloodied lower left abdomen, drove home the horror of Russia’s brutal onslaught in the eastern port city early in the war. The 32-year-old woman, Iryna Kalinina, died of her injuries a half hour after giving birth to the lifeless body of her baby named Miron. “For me, it is a moment that all the time I want to forget, but I cannot. The story will always stay with me,” Maloletka said in an interview before the announcement. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday paid his first visit to Kyiv since Russia’s full-scale invasion, in a show of support for Ukraine as it prepares to launch a counteroffensive. Stoltenberg paid his respects to Ukrainian soldiers who have been killed fighting in the war and reviewed damaged Russian military equipment displayed on a central square in Kyiv Denmark, together with the Netherlands, is to donate 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. Denmark’s acting defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen said they were not Danish tanks, but tanks “which are bought in collaboration with the Netherlands”. Foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen described it as “a very significant contribution”. Russian state-owned news agency Tass has cited Ismini Palla, spokesperson for the UN office at the joint coordination centre for the deal in Istanbul, saying that “inspections of vessels under the grain deal resumed on 19 April and are scheduled for 20 April”. The Donetsk People’s Republic, the Russian-imposed authority in Ukraine’s occupied Donetsk region, has claimed that overnight a woman has been killed in the city of Donetsk by shelling from Ukrainian armed forces. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, which Russia captured last year, will stop using US-produced nuclear fuel as quickly as possible, the Interfax news agency quoted a Russian official as saying. A flash in the sky over Kyiv prompted confusion and alarm as city authorities said it was caused by a Nasa satellite re-entering the atmosphere, while the US space agency denied involvement. A “bright glow” was observed over Kyiv around 10pm local time and shortly after, the Ukrainian air force said the flash was “related to the fall of a satellite/meteorite”. Switzerland will add the private military Wagner group and news agency RIA to its list of Russian sanctioned entities. Russia’s federal security service, the FSB, seems to be conducting “a large-scale overhaul of domestic security organs,” the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, reports in its update today. The overhaul appears to be related to leaks of data to Ukraine, the ISW reports. Switzerland will add the private military Wagner group and news agency RIA to its list of Russian sanctioned entities, Reuters reports the Swiss department of economic affairs, education and research said on Thursday. Hungary has banned imports of honey and certain meat products in addition to grains from Ukraine until 30 June, the prime minister’s chief of staff said on Thursday, increasing pressure on Brussels to broaden proposed European Union-wide measures. The European Commission said on Wednesday it would take emergency “preventive measures” for wheat, maize, sunflower seeds and rapeseed after some central European countries took unilateral steps to ban imports of food products from Ukraine to protect their own agricultural sectors. However, Hungary and Poland have said that other products should also be included. Reuters reports Gergely Gulyás said the Hungarian ban on imports of major cereals and agricultural products “includes a total of 25 products, the most important of which are cereals, rapeseed and sunflower seeds, flour, oil, honey and certain meat products”. Agriculture minister István Nagy told state news agency MTI on Wednesday that Hungary will continue to allow transit of Ukrainian grain, ensuring the departure of such shipments “in a controlled manner”. “It was worthwhile for Hungary to take firm action and protect the interests of Hungarian farmers,” he said, referring to the ban, adding the measures forced Brussels to take action. Here are some of the images of Jens Stoltenberg in Kyiv this morning. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday paid his first visit to Kyiv since Russia’s full-scale invasion, in a show of support for Ukraine as it prepares to launch a counteroffensive. Stoltenberg paid his respects to Ukrainian soldiers who have been killed fighting in the war and reviewed damaged Russian military equipment displayed on a central square in Kyiv, a Reuters photographer said. Reports and images on social media suggest that Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has arrived in Kyiv this morning. The Russian military has launched a video campaign to lure more professional soldiers to fight in Ukraine which challenges those interested to show they are “a real man” and swap what it casts as humdrum civilian life for the battlefield. The ad, set to imposing rock music, follows a report from British military intelligence and Russian media reports that suggest Moscow is seeking to recruit up to 400,000 professional soldiers – on a volunteer basis – to bolster its forces in Ukraine. The ad has so far been released on major Russian social networking sites. It invites men to sign a contract with the Russian defence ministry for a salary starting at 204,000 roubles (£2,000 / $2,495) a month, and begins by showing a man in a supermarket dressed in military uniform holding a heavy machine gun. He is then shown instead in the uniform of a supermarket security guard with the question: “Is this the kind of defender you dreamed of becoming?” Next in the video, a man is walking through the fog with other soldiers on what looks like a battlefield. He is then shown as a gym instructor helping a client lift weights. “Is this really where your strength lies?” the video asks, before cutting to a taxi driver taking a client’s fare who then transforms into a soldier on the battlefield. “You’re a man. Be one,” the ad concludes. After launching a partial mobilisation drive in September which prompted tens of thousands of Russian men to flee the country to avoid being drafted, the authorities are playing down the possibility of a second mobilisation call – despite a recent move to introduce electronic call-up papers to clamp down on draft dodgers – and are seeking to recruit volunteers instead. Posters seeking professional soldiers have sprung up in the Russian capital in recent weeks declaring: “Our profession is to defend the Motherland.” Reuters reports the posters, which say the army is looking for gunners, sappers, military medics, drivers and tank commanders, promise potential recruits “respect, an honourable profession and decent pay”. DR, Denmark’s public broadcaster, is reporting that foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and acting defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen have said the 14 Leopard 2 tanks being donated by the Netherlands and Denmark could be with Ukraine in early 2024. Poulsen is quoted as saying they are not Danish tanks, but tanks “which are bought in collaboration with the Netherlands”. Rasmussen described it as “a very significant contribution”. A quick snap is breaking across Danish news sources, citing the Ritzau news agency, that Denmark, together with the Netherlands, is to donate 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. More details soon … Pakistan has placed its first order for discounted Russian crude oil under a new deal struck between Islamabad and Moscow, the country’s petroleum minister said, with one cargo to dock at Karachi port in May. The deal will see Pakistan buy crude oil only, not refined fuels, and imports are expected to reach 100,000 barrels a day if the first transaction goes through smoothly, minister Musadik Malik told Reuters on Wednesday night. Russian state-owned news agency Tass has posted on its official Telegram channel to state that “inspections of vessels under the grain deal resumed on 19 April and are scheduled for 20 April”. It cited Ismini Palla, spokesperson for the UN office at the joint coordination centre for the deal in Istanbul. The Donetsk People’s Republic, the Russian-imposed authority in Ukraine’s occupied Donetsk region, has posted on one of its Telegram channels to claim that overnight a woman has been killed in the city of Donetsk by shelling from Ukrainian armed forces. It said the woman, born in 1968, died when a private residential building was hit. The claims have not been independently verified. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, which Russia captured last year, will stop using US-produced nuclear fuel as quickly as possible, the Interfax news agency quoted a Russian official as saying on Thursday. Reuters reports Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the general director of Russian nuclear energy firm Rosenergoatom, which is now in charge of the occupied plant, told Interfax it had about four years’ worth of US-made fuel in reserves. But the Russian management will seek to replace that fuel with the Russian one as quickly as possible as it considers its own technologies superior, he said. A flash in the sky over the Ukrainian capital prompted confusion and alarm as city authorities said it was caused by a Nasa satellite re-entering the atmosphere, AFP reports, while the US space agency denied involvement. A “bright glow” was observed over Kyiv around 10pm local time, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, Sergiy Popko, wrote on Telegram. An air raid alert was activated, Popko said, but “air defence was not in operation”. Shortly after, the Ukrainian air force said the flash was “related to the fall of a satellite/meteorite”. But a Nasa spokesperson denied this assessment, telling the AFP news agency that the satellite in question was “still in orbit”. The US space agency had announced earlier this week that a retired 300kg satellite would re-enter the atmosphere some time on Wednesday. “However, that re-entry has not yet occurred … No other Nasa satellite re-entered the atmosphere earlier today,” a Nasa spokesperson told AFP. The ISW reports that the changes may be a way for the Kremlin to “conduct an overhaul of the domestic security apparatus to oust officials who have fallen out of Kremlin favour and consolidate further control internal security organs”. Russia’s federal security service, the FSB, seems to be conducting “a large-scale overahaul of domestic security organs,” the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, reports in its update today. The overhaul appears to be related to leaks of data to Ukraine, the ISW reports: The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) appears to be conducting a large-scale overhaul of domestic security organs. Russian state-controlled outlet TASS reported on 19 April that the FSB and the Main Directorate of the Security Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) have been conducting mass checks at the Moscow Central District Internal Affairs Directorate and several Moscow district police offices for the past several weeks due to “the leakage of data from Russian security forces at the request of Ukrainian citizens.” … Russian outlets reported that the suspected police officers leaked personal data on Russian security forces to external individuals, some of whom are Ukrainian citizens. The reported FSB and MVD raids on the Moscow police departments are occurring against the backdrop of a series of arrests and dismissals of prominent members of Rosgvardia (Russian National Guard) leadership. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. Our top story this morning: Russia’s federal security service, the FSB, appears to be conducting “a large-scale overahaul of domestic security organs,” the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, reports in its update today. The overhaul appears to be related to leaks of data to Ukraine, the ISW reports. More on this shortly. Here are the other key recent developments in the war: Ukraine has received two types of air defence system ahead of the Ramstein military group meeting on Thursday, where it will ask for more supplies. A Patriot air defence system delivery was confirmed by the defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, on Wednesday. The second of four promised German Iris-T system were also delivered, according to a German newspaper which had spoken to government officials. No official announcements have been made. The United States announced $325m in new military aid for Ukraine, including additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, advanced missiles and anti-tank mines. It is the 36th security package since the war began in February 2022. The European Commission is proposing €100m (£88m) in compensation for EU farmers affected by the recent influx of Ukrainian grain as well as restrictions on selling wheat and maize in affected countries, in a move to calm tensions with central and eastern Europe. Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the commission, has written to the leaders of Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, setting out support measures after four of those countries banned the import or sale of grain and other food products inside their borders earlier this week. Bulgaria had confirmed its temporary halt on Wednesday. Inspections of ships are resuming after a two-day hiatus under a UN-brokered agreement on the safe export of grain from Ukrainian Black Sea ports, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, said on Wednesday. A Ukrainian military spokesperson accused Moscow of a “provocation” after Russian proxy forces said Ukrainian forces had blown up four buildings in the eastern city of Bakhmut, killing 20 civilians. The spokesperson said Ukrainian forces never target civilians. Russia also denies targeting civilians. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said on Wednesday during a visit to Sweden that the US looks forward to welcoming Sweden as a Nato member before the alliance’s summit in July, and will encourage Turkey and Hungary to ratify accession. Along with Finland, Sweden applied to join Nato in May last year. Finland’s application was processed in record time and it became the 31st member of the alliance earlier this month. A joint investigation by the public broadcasters of several Nordic countries alleges that Russia has established a programme using spy ships disguised as fishing vessels aimed at giving it the capability to attack windfarms and communications cables in the North Sea. The Kremlin critic Ilya Yashin has lost an appeal against what his supporters say was a politically motivated decision to jail him for eight and a half years – in a case that has echoes of Monday’s jailing of Vladimir Kara-Murza. The former Moscow councillor’s appeal was rejected as authorities continue to repress freedoms in Russia, with independent media shut down and leading opposition figures behind bars or in exile. Russia has said it summoned the UK ambassador Deborah Bronnert on Tuesday after she criticised the 25-year jail term given to Kara-Murza. She spoke to reporters outside Moscow city court alongside the US and Canadian ambassadors, describing the sentence as “shocking” and called for Kara-Murza, who holds joint UK and Russian citizenship, to be released immediately. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited the Volyn region of Ukraine, which borders with Belarus and Poland, where he praised the work of border guards. Russian drones struck Ukraine’s southern Odesa region overnight and caused a fire at an infrastructure facility, the head of the military command of the Odesa region, Yuri Kruk, said on Wednesday. No casualties have been reported and firefighters were working at the scene, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/jun/17/collin-reeves-ex-soldier-somerset-couple-murder","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-17T13:31:09Z","webTitle":"How parking row in Somerset village ended in couple’s brutal murder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/17/collin-reeves-ex-soldier-somerset-couple-murder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/jun/17/collin-reeves-ex-soldier-somerset-couple-murder","fields":{"headline":"How parking row in Somerset village ended in couple’s brutal murder","bodyText":"On the night of 21 November last year, Collin Reeves sat down on the stairs of his home in the Somerset village of Norton Fitzwarren and broke down in tears. He was in a terrible place. Since leaving the army four years before, Reeves had flitted between unsatisfying jobs, missing the structure and sense of purpose he had found in the military and dwelling on the horrors he had seen in Afghanistan. He had found the Covid lockdowns difficult and worried he would not be able to support his wife and two children. The final straw had come that evening when his wife, Kayley Reeves, said she wanted a trial separation. What Reeves did next was cruel and devastating. He caught sight of a framed commando dagger he had been presented with when he left the army, removed it from its mount and went outside. Using the skills he had learned on the elite commando course, Reeves slipped unseen into the garden of his neighbours Jennifer and Stephen Chapple, a coffee shop worker and a teacher respectively, with whom he had fallen out over parking – the sort of trivial row that takes place in countless streets. He walked into their living room and murdered both, shouting: “Die, you fuckers, die!” He stabbed each of them six times. Mercifully, their two children did not wake and were whisked away by police officers after Reeves dialled 999 to confess. Relations between the two families had been cordial until the Chapples got a second car. Each house on their street had only one designated parking spot and Jennifer Chapple began to park on an undesignated area that did not block Reeves’s spot but made it slightly trickier for him to manoeuvre. Reeves took umbrage and in May 2021 confronted her aggressively and told her: “You can’t park there.” Jennifer Chapple was concerned enough to contact the police. She told a friend: “He’s ex-military so he definitely thinks he should get what he wants.” She messaged another: “The developers didn’t take into account that people would want to park in front of their own houses … apparently it’s the biggest deal in the world to [Reeves] and he’s made it a personal vendetta.” The housing association that part-owns the Reeves and Chapple houses, LiveWest, was alerted and sent out a note advising residents: “We advise that you only park in your allocated parking space.” Tensions grew. During the pandemic, Reeves took a job as a security guard at Hinkley Point, where a nuclear power station is being built, but quit, unable to shake off the feeling he was under surveillance from the cameras there. On 11 November, 10 days before the killing, Reeves launched a torrent of abuse at Jennifer Chapple, swearing at her and insulting her. Again, she reported this to the police. She messaged a friend expressing frustration that little had been done after she contacted police in May. “I called them before because he tried this before and they did jack shit.” She described him as a “trained killer” who “gets off on how I react to his popping off”. A police community support officer contacted her. She said she did not want any formal action taken but wanted her concerns put on record. The officer flagged up the situation with LiveWest. On the day of the killings, Reeves took his children to see Christmas lights being turned on and stopped off at a war memorial to remember fallen comrades. Shortly after 9pm, Reeves carried out the attack. When he was booked into custody he gave his military serial number and said it had been an “operation”. Reeves was to say that he could not remember the killing but was triggered into action by the bright white of the Chapples’ security light flashing on, reminding him of flares in a war zone. He described being stationed in Camp Bastion in Afghanistan and witnessing colleagues being brought back from patrols horrifically wounded. His troop commander had been killed. He said after his tour he had not been given time to “decompress”. In the witness box, Reeves said he had been physically abused as a boy and had had suicidal thoughts since he was 12. He said he joined the army aged 17 and had been proud to pass the commando course. He accepted he was a “trained killer”, though had not actually killed while in the army. He argued that he must have been suffering an “abnormality of mental functioning” at the time of the killing. Speaking after the verdict, DI Neil Meade, the senior investigating officer, said he did not buy Reeves’s claims that he was mentally unwell. He did not believe Reeves had planned the attack but, catching sight of the dagger as he sat on the stairs, had acted spontaneously. “He saw his life falling apart and acted.” The force’s handling of Jennifer Chapple’s concerns about Reeves has been investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct but it is not expected to find that officers did anything wrong. “Nobody could have predicted what happened,” Meade said. Two psychiatrists examined Reeves and diagnosed depression but not severe mental illness. He told one that life “felt dark all the time” and she judged that he had “regressed” to his training at the time of the attack. The jury at Bristol crown court was told there was no dispute that Reeves killed the Chapples. The only issue was whether his plea of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility could be accepted. Their verdict shows that they, too, did not buy Reeves’s explanation for his brutal attack."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/oct/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-fire-engulfs-part-of-kerch-bridge-between-crimea-and-russia","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-08T20:14:03Z","webTitle":"Three killed as huge explosion causes key Crimea-Russia road bridge to collapse – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/oct/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-fire-engulfs-part-of-kerch-bridge-between-crimea-and-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/oct/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-fire-engulfs-part-of-kerch-bridge-between-crimea-and-russia","fields":{"headline":"Three killed as huge explosion causes key Crimea-Russia road bridge to collapse – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s 11pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: France’s prestigious Bayeux War Correspondents’ Awards on Saturday largely honoured reporting on the Ukraine conflict, with Associated Press and Burkina Faso newspaper Sidwaya among the recipients. The photo prize went to Ukrainian photographer Evgeniy Maloletka for his work with video journalist Mstyslav Chernov on the fall of Mariupol for AP. The death toll from Russia’s attack on Zaporizhzhia has increased to 19, Ukrinform reports. According to the outlet, the body of the 19th victim was discovered underneath the rubble on Saturday. The Ukrainian GDP has shrunk by 30% in nine months, the ministry of economy announced on Saturday. “Among the negative factors that affected the economy, the weather and the actions of the occupiers stand out. Due to prolonged rainy weather in some regions in September, the pace of grain crop harvesting slowed down, which negatively affected the volume of harvested products,” the ministry said. An adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted a message on Twitter saying the explosion which damaged Russia’s road-and-rail bridge to Crimea was just “the beginning”. “Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything that is stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled,” Mykhailo Podolyak wrote. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom, warned the diesel generators at Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant only have a limited supply of fuel at present. Overnight shelling cut power to the plant, which needs cooling to avoid a meltdown, forcing it to switch to emergency generators. Ukraine is “very lucky” to have friends across Scotland, delegates at the SNP annual party conference have been told. Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko addressed delegates in Aberdeen on Saturday, where she thanked the people of Scotland for providing humanitarian aid and taking in refugees from her country during the Russian invasion. France’s prestigious Bayeux War Correspondents’ Awards on Saturday largely honoured reporting on the Ukraine conflict, with Associated Press and Burkina Faso newspaper Sidwaya among the recipients. Agence France-Presse reports: Instituted in 1994, the Bayeux Calvados-Normandy Awards have honoured exceptional reporting on war and unrest. The choice of Bayeux is significant as it was the first French town to be liberated by the Allied forces during World War II. With the exception of the Burkina Faso award, all the prize-winners were awarded for their coverage of the war in Ukraine. The photo prize went to Ukrainian photographer Evgeniy Maloletka for his work with video journalist Mstyslav Chernov on the fall of Mariupol for AP. The written press prize went to Mariam Ouedraogo of Sidwaya for her reporting in Burkina Faso, which has suffered two coups this year. In television, Theo Maneval and Pierre Dehoorne won the first Amnesty International prize for “Viktor and the kiss of war” in Ukraine for France 5, with the large-format prize going to Philip Cox of the Guardian for “The Spiderman of Sudan”. For radio, the international jury awarded the prize to Maurine Mercier, who recorded the testimony of a mother and her daughter on “two weeks of rape and terror in Bucha”, also in Ukraine, for France Info - RTS. The death toll from Russia’s attack on Zaporizhzhia has increased to 19, Ukrinform reports. According to the outlet, the body of the 19th victim was discovered underneath the rubble on Saturday. The death toll was previously reported at 14 when Russia’s “kamikaze-drones” hit several residential buildings killing a child on Thursday. The Ukrainian air force has shot down an Iranian-made Shahed-136 combat drone with a machine gun on Saturday, Euromaidan reports. The Ukrainian GDP has shrunk by 30% in nine months, the ministry of economy announced on Saturday. In a statement, the ministry said: Among the negative factors that affected the economy, the weather and the actions of the occupiers stand out. Due to prolonged rainy weather in some regions in September, the pace of grain crop harvesting slowed down, which negatively affected the volume of harvested products.” “In addition, the unstable operation and periodic disconnections of the occupied ZANP [Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant] from the energy system of Ukraine made it necessary to redistribute the load among other participants in the system, which exerted significant pressure on the entire Ukrainian energy system.” An adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted a message on Twitter saying the explosion which damaged Russia*s road-and-rail bridge to Crimea was just “the beginning”. “Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything that is stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled,” Mykhailo Podolyak wrote. He told Reuters he believed the blast had been arranged by Russia, although he did not say how he knew. “This is a concrete manifestation of the conflict between the FSB (intelligence service) and (private military companies) on the one hand and the Ministry of Defence/General Staff of the Russian Federation on the other,” he said. Trains can resume using a road-and-rail bridge between Russia and Crimea after it was damaged in an explosion earlier, Russia’s transport ministry said in a statement, Reuters reports. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom, warned the diesel generators at Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant only have a limited supply of fuel at present. Overnight shelling cut power to the plant, which needs cooling to avoid a meltdown, forcing it to switch to emergency generators. Kotin told BBC World News: “Right now we are working on logistics to supply more fuel for these generators. “If [the generators] run out of fuel, after that they will stop, and after that there will be a disaster ... there will be a melting of the active core and a release of radioactivity from there.” Ukraine is “very lucky” to have friends across Scotland, delegates at the SNP annual party conference have been told. Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko addressed delegates in Aberdeen on Saturday, where she thanked the people of Scotland for providing humanitarian aid and taking in refugees from her country during the Russian invasion. Vasylenko said: “It’s a great honour to be here on the stage, addressing your 88th conference of the Scottish National party. “It’s an even bigger honour for me to be representing the people of Ukraine up on this stage. It’s just that I wish I was addressing you today as Lesia Vasylenko, member of parliament of Ukraine, chair of the environmental sub-committee on climate change, talking about Ukraine’s input and impact in dealing with global challenges. “Instead, I am addressing you today as Lesia Vasylenko, member of a wartime parliament of Ukraine that is fighting very hard for its existence and for the physical survival of its people. “That is first and foremost, but of course we are also fighting to defend the very meaning of the concepts of freedom, democracy and human rights.” Vasylenko also drew praise from the party’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford. In his speech to the conference later in the day, Blackford praised her “courage”, adding: “Today we renew our support for Lesia and for her nation - but we also renew our opposition to the Russian aggression, the oppression, and the illegal annexation of their country. “Today, tomorrow and every day in the future – Scotland stands with the people of Ukraine.” Blackford also told delegates “the international community must not rest until the war criminal Putin is put in front of the international court in the Hague, where he belongs”. Fears that Russia is navigating its way around sanctions are unfounded, according to experts who say Moscow is suffering a bigger hit than institutions such as the World Bank have been predicting. Some analysts have interpreted the strength of the rouble, the size of the warchest of cash available to Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin’s ability to redirect exports destined for Europe to willing southern neighbours as a signal that the arsenal of sanctions deployed against Moscow is failing to bite. But the economist Mikhail Mamonov thinks otherwise. He was part of a team that modelled the Russian economy in 2014. It measured the impact of sanctions in the wake of Putin’s annexation of Crimea, and revealed that even the minimal financial and trade blockade imposed at the time had had an impact.” The time in Kyiv is 6pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines so far: Three people were killed after a truck bomb caused a fire and the collapse of a section of a bridge linking Russia with Crimea, Russian officials said. Russia’s national anti-terrorism committee said the truck bomb set alight seven railway carriages carrying fuel, resulting in a “partial collapse of two sections of the bridge. Meanwhile, Russia’s defence ministry said Russian troops fighting in the Mykolaiv, Kryvyi Rih and Zaporizhzhia regions of southern Ukraine could receive all the supplies they needed via existing land and sea corridors. Saturday’s explosion on the road-and-rail bridge, which has been used to take Russian personnel and military supplies through the peninsula into other parts of southern Ukraine, brought down sections of road taking traffic in one direction and also damaged railway tracks. The parliamentary leader of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s party has stopped short of claiming that Kyiv was responsible for the Kerch bridge explosion but appeared to cast it as a consequence of Moscow’s takeover of Crimea and attempts to integrate the peninsula with the Russian mainland. “Russian illegal construction is starting to fall apart and catch fire. The reason is simple: if you build something explosive, then sooner or later it will explode,” David Arakhamia, the leader of the Servant of the People party, wrote on Telegram. The series of explosions that rocked Kharkiv early on Saturday sparked a fire at one of the city’s medical institutions, the mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city said. Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram that the explosions were the result of missile strikes in the city centre, Associated Press reported. They also sparked a fire in a non-residential building. Volodymyr Zelenskiy says Russian officials have begun to “prepare their society” for the possible use of nuclear weapons in the war. The Ukrainian president denied having called for strikes on Russia, urging instead that pre-emptive sanctions be imposed on Moscow, in an interview with the BBC. Russia has targeted Zaporizhzhia with explosive-packed “kamikaze drones” for the first time, as the death toll from a missile strike on an apartment building in the city rose to 11. The regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones damaged two infrastructure facilities in the city. He said other missiles also struck the city again, injuring one person. The Iranian foreign ministry has denied supplying the drones to Russia. Russia has named a new senior commander of Russian forces in Ukraine. Sergei Surovikin, the former commander of Russia’s operations in Syria, is “a notoriously corrupt and brutal general even by the Russian army’s standards, according to the UK MoD”, reports the FT’s Moscow bureau chief. The German defence minister has told Nato it must do more to bolster security, warning: “We cannot know how far Putin’s delusions of grandeur can go.” Christine Lambrecht said Germany had heard of Russian threats to Lithuania for implementing EU sanctions and that they must be taken seriously and be prepared, reports Reuters. The UN atomic watchdog has renewed calls for a protection zone at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, condemning overnight shelling on its power line as “tremendously irresponsible”. The shelling cut the power line that supplies cooling systems to the Russian-held plant, reports Reuters. The UK has rejected Moscow’s call for a secret ballot in the United Nations general assembly next week on whether to condemn Russia’s move to annex four regions in Ukraine and requested that the 193-member body vote publicly. Reuters reports that the general assembly is set to vote on a draft resolution that would condemn Russia’s “illegal so-called referenda” and the “attempted illegal annexation”. Vladimir Putin marked his 70th birthday on Friday with little fanfare, amid further signs that key parts of the Russian president’s invasion of Ukraine were unravelling and triggering unprecedented criticism at home, Reuters reports. News programs made only passing references to the birthday and public events were low-key, in contrast to just a week ago when Putin held a huge concert on Red Square to proclaim the annexation of nearly a fifth of Ukrainian land. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Nadeem Badshah will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Ukraine. Russia’s transport ministry has said that limited road traffic for cars and buses had resumed on intact lanes of the Kerch bridge, which was hit by an explosion early in the morning. It said traffic would for now be restricted to crossing between Crimea and the Russian Taman peninsula in alternating directions. Sergei Aksyonov, the Russian-appointed governor of the Crimean peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014, said on social media that heavy goods vehicles would have to wait to cross by ferry. The series of explosions that rocked Kharkiv early on Saturday sparked a fire at one of the city’s medical institutions, the mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city said. Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram that the explosions were the result of missile strikes in the city centre, Associated Press reported. They also sparked a fire in a non-residential building. There were no immediate reports of casualties after the blasts, which set off a series of secondary explosions. Russia has named a new senior commander of Russian forces in Ukraine. Sergei Surovikin, the former commander of Russia’s operations in Syria, is “a notoriously corrupt and brutal general even by the Russian army’s standards, according to the UK MoD”, reports the FT’s Moscow bureau chief. Russia has reportedly said that road traffic will soon resume on parts of the damaged Crimean bridge. The Russian transport ministry said the bridge would shortly reopen to road traffic on undamaged lanes, reports Reuters. The German defence minister has told Nato it must do more to bolster security, warning: “We cannot know how far Putin’s delusions of grandeur can go.” Christine Lambrecht said Germany had heard of Russian threats to Lithuania for implementing EU sanctions and that they must be taken seriously and be prepared, reports Reuters. Speaking during a visit to German troops deployed in Lithuania, Lambrecht said on Saturday: The fact is that we, Nato, must do more for our common security because we cannot know how far Putin’s delusions of grandeur can go. She added: We’ve heard Russia’s threats to Lithuania which was implementing European sanctions on the border with Kaliningrad. This is not nearly the first threats and we must take them seriously and be prepared. Iuliia Mendel, the former spokesperson of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has shared what appears to be footage from the damaged bridge between Crimea and Russia. The footage has not been independently verified by the Guardian. The UN atomic watchdog has renewed calls for a protection zone at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, condemning overnight shelling on its power line as “tremendously irresponsible”. The shelling cut the power line that supplies cooling systems to the Russian-held plant, reports Reuters. “The resumption of shelling, hitting the plant’s sole source of external power, is tremendously irresponsible,” Rafael Grossi, chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency said, confirming that it is now dependent on diesel generators. The agency said that Grossi would visit Russia and Ukraine soon to discuss establishing a protection zone. Railway traffic on a damaged road and rail bridge linking Russia and the Crimean peninsula will resume at 8pm local time, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Russia’s transport ministry. A huge blast that brought down part of the bridge’s roadway had occurred at around 6am. Three people were killed after a truck bomb caused a fire and the collapse of a section of a bridge linking Russia with Crimea, Russian officials said. Russia’s national anti-terrorism committee said the truck bomb set alight seven railway carriages carrying fuel, resulting in a “partial collapse of two sections of the bridge”. A man and a woman who were riding in a vehicle across the bridge were killed by the explosion and their bodies were recovered, Russia’s investigative committee said. It did not provide details on the third victim. Meanwhile, Russia’s defence ministry said Russian troops fighting in the Mykolaiv, Kryvyi Rih and Zaporizhzhia regions of southern Ukraine could receive all the supplies they needed via existing land and sea corridors. Saturday’s explosion on the road-and-rail bridge, which has been used to take Russian personnal and military supplies through the peninsula into other parts of southern Ukraine, brought down sections of road taking traffic in one direction and also damaged railway tracks. CCTV footage appears to show the moment the bridge linking Crimea and Russia was hit by a huge explosion early on Saturday morning. Elizabeth Tsurkov, a fellow at the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy, a thinktank based in Washington DC tweeted that Russia was claiming just months ago that the Kerch bridge could not be attacked. She wrote: Only 3 months ago, Russian propaganda was claiming that the Crimea bridge was impossible to attack because of 20 different modes of protection covering it, including military dolphins. What a colossal failure. A truck bomb earlier today caused a fire and the collapse of a section of the bridge linking Russia-annexed Crimea with Russia, Russian officials said, damaging a key supply artery for Moscow’s faltering war effort in southern Ukraine. The speaker of Crimea’s Kremlin-backed regional parliament immediately accused Ukraine, though the Kremlin did not apportion blame. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly threatened to strike the bridge and some lauded the attack, but Kyiv stopped short of claiming responsibility. At least three spans of the Kerch bridge collapsed following the blasts earlier on Saturday, according to Bellingcat’s Nick Waters. In a short thread on Twitter, he highlighted the areas of damage caused by the explosion. The parliamentary leader of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s party has stopped short of claiming that Kyiv was responsible for the Kerch bridge explosion but appeared to cast it as a consequence of Moscow’s takeover of Crimea and attempts to integrate the peninsula with the Russian mainland. “Russian illegal construction is starting to fall apart and catch fire. The reason is simple: if you build something explosive, then sooner or later it will explode,” David Arakhamia, the leader of the Servant of the People party, wrote on Telegram. “And this is just the beginning. Of all things, reliable construction is not something Russia is particularly famous for,” he said. Other Ukrainian officials were more celebratory while still stopping short of claiming responsibility, AP reported. The secretary of Ukraine’s National security and defense council, Oleksiy Danilov, posted a video in his Twitter with Kerch bridge on fire on the left side and video with Marilyn Monroe singing her famous “Happy Birthday Mr President” on the right side. In Moscow, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that “the reaction of the Kyiv regime to the destruction of civilian infrastructure shows its terrorist nature”. In August, Russia suffered a series of explosions at an airbase and munitions depot in Crimea, which underlined its vulnerability. Twelve miles long and taller than the Statue of Liberty, the Kerch bridge project to the occupied Crimean peninsular was the jewel in the crown of Vladimir Putin’s infrastructure projects – described in the Russian media as the “construction of the century”. When the Russian president opened its road span on 15 May 2018, driving an orange Kamaz truck across the bridge, he boasted of its significance. “In different historical epochs, even under the tsar priests, people dreamed of building this bridge. Then they returned to this [idea] in the 1930s, the 40s, the 50s. And finally, thanks to your work and your talent, the miracle has happened.” Heavily defended since the start of Russia’s fulls scale invasion of Ukraine, it was seen as important enough for Moscow to warn of reprisals if the bridge was targeted. But on Saturday morning, in circumstances that are still unclear, a huge explosion rocked the Kerch bridge, collapsing part of the road carriageway into the Kerch Strait below and setting fire to fuel tankers on a train crossing the second railway span of the bridge. The enormous significance of the damage to the bridge, obliquely claimed by a senior adviser to the Ukrainian presidency, will become clear in the coming hours and days – not least whether Moscow feels compelled to retaliate for the attack. The UK has rejected Moscow’s call for a secret ballot in the United Nations general assembly next week on whether to condemn Russia’s move to annex four regions in Ukraine and requested that the 193-member body vote publicly. Reuters reports that the general assembly is set to vote on a draft resolution that would condemn Russia’s “illegal so-called referenda” and the “attempted illegal annexation”. It also reaffirms the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and calls on states not to recognise Russia’s move. Moscow last week moved to annex the four Ukraine regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – after staging the “referendums” that have been denounced by Ukraine and its allies as illegal and coercive. In a letter to UN states earlier this week, Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, lobbied for a secret ballot, arguing that western lobbying meant that “it may be very difficult if positions are expressed publicly”. Britain’s UN ambassador, Barbara Woodward, said on Friday that the rules of the general assembly were clear that any representative may request a recorded vote. She wrote to the general assembly president: To conduct a secret ballot on a general assembly decision would go against decades of precedent and undermine the practices of the world’s most representative deliberative body. A truck bomb has caused the fire and collapse of a section of a bridge linking Russia with Crimea, according to Russian authorities. The National Anti-Terrorism Committee said the bomb set alight seven railway carriages carrying fuel, resulting in a “partial collapse of two sections of the bridge”. The committee did not immediately apportion blame, the Associated Press reported. Putin was informed about the explosion and ordered the creation of a government panel to deal with the emergency. The 12-mile bridge across the Kerch Strait linking the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov is the longest in Europe. It cost billions of pounds to build and it has provided an essential link to the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly threatened to strike the bridge. Damage caused by the explosion on Kerch bridge earlier today. Here is some more footage of the moment of the blast on the Kerch bridge from Russia to Crimea, a hated symbol of the Kremlin’s occupation of the southern Ukrainian peninsular. Images from the bridge showed a fiercely burning fire engulfing at least two railway carriages from a train on the bridge, accompanied by a vast column of black smoke, and one half of the parallel road bridge collapsed into the Kerch Strait. The explosion, which witnesses said could be heard kilometres away, took place before 6am on Saturday while a train was crossing the bridge. A Ukrainian presidential adviser posted a message on Twitter after conflicting reports of an explosion or fire on Saturday that damaged the bridge connecting the Russian mainland to the occupied Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, calling it “the beginning” but not directly claiming Ukrainian responsibility. “Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled,” Mykhailo Podolyak wrote. Vladimir Putin marked his 70th birthday on Friday with little fanfare, amid further signs that key parts of the Russian president’s invasion of Ukraine were unravelling and triggering unprecedented criticism at home, Reuters reports. News programs made only passing references to the birthday and public events were low-key, in contrast to just a week ago when Putin held a huge concert on Red Square to proclaim the annexation of nearly a fifth of Ukrainian land. Putin was shown on state television meeting leaders of other former Soviet allies at an informal summit in St Petersburg. The Kerch bridge from Russia to Crimea – a hated symbol of the Kremlin’s occupation of the southern Ukrainian peninsular – has been hit by a massive explosion on the span that carries railway traffic. Images from the bridge showed a fiercely burning fire engulfing at least two railway carriages from a train on the bridge, accompanied by a vast column of black smoke. The explosion, which witnesses said could be heard kilometres away, took place around 6am on Saturday while a train was crossing the bridge, although it was not immediately clear what caused it. Some images appeared to show a second fire at some distance from the main blaze. Later images also appeared to show that part of road bridge that runs parallel with the train tracks had collapsed. Peter Beaumont in Kyiv has the story: A series of explosions shook Kharkiv early on Saturday, sending towering plumes of smoke into the sky and triggering a series of secondary explosions in the eastern Ukraine city. Associated Press reported there were no immediate reports of casualties. The blasts came hours after Russia concentrated attacks on areas it illegally annexed. Volodymyr Zelenskiy says Russian officials have begun to “prepare their society” for the possible use of nuclear weapons in the war. The Ukrainian president denied having called for strikes on Russia, urging instead that pre-emptive sanctions be imposed on Moscow, in an interview with the BBC. Russia has targeted Zaporizhzhia with explosive-packed “kamikaze drones” for the first time, as the death toll from a missile strike on an apartment building in the city rose to 11. The regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones damaged two infrastructure facilities in the city. He said other missiles also struck the city again, injuring one person. The Iranian foreign ministry has denied supplying the drones to Russia. The Russian justice ministry has declared one of the country’s most popular rappers to be a “foreign agent”, a designation that has been used to harass Kremlin critics and journalists. Oxxxymiron – real name Miron Fyodorov – was added to a list of foreign agents alongside four journalists and Dmitry Glukhovsky, a prominent writer. The rapper has called the Kremlin’s Ukraine offensive a “catastrophe and a crime”. Ukrainian authorities found a mass grave in the recently recaptured eastern town of Lyman in Donetsk and it was unclear yet how many bodies it held, the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said in an online post on Friday. Separately, the Ukrinform news agency cited a senior police official as saying the grave contained 180 bodies. The bodies of 534 civilians including 19 children were found in the north-eastern Kharkiv region since Russian troops left, Serhiy Bolvinov of the national police in Kharkiv said. That included 447 bodies found in Izium. He also said investigators had found evidence of 22 sites being used as “torture rooms”. Russia has reportedly sacked the commander of its eastern military district, Col Gen Alexander Chaiko, the news outlet RBC has reported. His reported departure marks the latest in a series of top officials to be fired after defeats and humiliations in the war in Ukraine. Joe Biden has warned the world could face “Armageddon” if Vladimir Putin uses a tactical nuclear weapon to try to win the war in Ukraine. The US president made his most outspoken remarks to date about the threat of nuclear war, saying it was the closest the world had come to nuclear catastrophe for 60 years, “since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis”. The US does not have indications that Russia is preparing to imminently use nuclear weapons, the White House said. Asked about Biden’s comments, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said: “He was reinforcing what we have been saying, which is how seriously ... we take these threats.” The 2022 Nobel peace prize has been awarded to human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski from Belarus, the Russian human rights organisation Memorial and the Ukrainian human rights organisation Centre for Civil Liberties. Oleksandra Matviychuk, the centre’s head, said on Facebook after the award that Vladimir Putin as well as the Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, and other “war criminals” should face an international tribunal, and Russia should be excluded from the UN security council “for systematic violations of the UN charter”. The International Monetary Fund has announced it will provide $1.3bn in emergency aid to Ukraine through its new food crisis assistance program. A member of Putin’s inner circle directly confronted the Russian president over mistakes and failings in the war in Ukraine, the Washington Post has reported, citing US intelligence. At least five people were killed and as many injured after Ukrainian forces struck a bus while shelling a strategically important bridge in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, Russia’s Tass news agency has reported. The armed forces’ headquarters of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has claimed to have captured three settlements from Ukrainian forces in Donetsk. The office of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said after a call with Putin that the pair discussed the latest developments in Ukraine, and Erdoğan repeated Ankara’s willingness to do its part to peacefully resolve the war. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has congratulated Putin on his 70th birthday, applauding him for his “distinguished leadership and strong will”. Kim spoke of Putin’s achievements in “building powerful Russia” and said the Russian leader was “enjoying high respects and support from the broad masses of people”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/16/us-couple-nuclear-submarine-secrets-brazil-jonathan-diana-toebbe","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-16T16:31:48Z","webTitle":"Brazil was alleged intended recipient of US couple’s nuclear submarine secrets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/us-couple-nuclear-submarine-secrets-brazil-jonathan-diana-toebbe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/16/us-couple-nuclear-submarine-secrets-brazil-jonathan-diana-toebbe","fields":{"headline":"Brazil was alleged intended recipient of US couple’s nuclear submarine secrets","bodyText":"The country that an American spy couple tried to sell nuclear submarine secrets to last year has been revealed to be Brazil. Jonathan and Diana Toebbe, a suburban couple who lived in Annapolis, Maryland, were arrested last October and charged with attempting to sell the design of US nuclear-powered submarines to someone they thought was a representative of a foreign power – but who turned out to be an undercover FBI agent. The identity of the foreign power had remained concealed until now. According to a Brazilian official and others familiar with the investigation, Jonathan Toebbe approached Brazil nearly two years ago and offered to provide classified documents he had stolen from the US Navy Yard in Washington, the New York Times reported. Toebbe, who planned for years to sell the information to a foreign power, had worked for the US government since 2012. He held a top-secret security clearance and specialized in naval nuclear propulsion, according to the FBI. At one point, he was assigned to a laboratory in Pittsburgh that focused on nuclear power development for the US navy, said officials. The FBI’s investigation into the Toebbes began in December 2020 when the FBI received a package addressed to a foreign country. It included operational manuals and technical details. According to court documents, the package was intercepted in the Brazilian mail system and rerouted to an FBI legal attache. “Please forward this letter to your military intelligence agency,” a note accompanying the package read. “I believe this information will be of great value to your nation. This is not a hoax.” The FBI proceeded to initiate an encrypted conversation with the Toebbes who offered highly classified navy secrets in exchange for $100,000 in cryptocurrency. A person familiar with the investigation told the New York Times that although the US government wanted to initially disclose the name of the involved country, Brazilian officials did not want their cooperation to be publicly revealed. A senior Brazilian official told the outlet that Brazil cooperated with American investigators because of close bilateral relations and friendly relations between the intelligence services. Brazilian officials and the FBI cooperated after Jonathan Toebbe was hesitant to perform a dead drop, a method of passing information using a secret location. According to court records, Toebbe wrote to his contact, who was in fact an FBI undercover agent, “I am concerned that using a dead drop location your friend prepares makes me very vulnerable … For now, I must consider the possibility that you are not the person I hope you are.” He then asked his contact for “some physical signal you can make that proves your identity to me”. “I could plan to visit Washington DC over the Memorial Day weekend. I would just be another tourist in the crowd. Perhaps you could fly a signal flag on your roof? Something easily observable from the street, but nothing to arouse an adversaries [sic] suspicion?” With the cooperation of Brazilian officials, the FBI undercover agent told Toebbe to look for a signal in the window of a Brazilian government building in Washington last year during Memorial Day weekend. Toebbe saw the sign and agreed to deliver the sample of secrets in a peanut butter sandwich to West Virginia. He and his wife were arrested six months later. Speaking to the Guardian, one former intelligence official who requested anonymity said, “What’s striking is the level of cooperation to place a signal inside the embassy and that he refers to himself as an amateur when his tradecraft was quite sophisticated.” In February, the Toebbes pleaded guilty to espionage charges. Jonathan Toebbe faces up to 17 and a half years in prison while Diana Toebbe faces up to three."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/apr/02/protests-energy-prices-cap-uk-electricity-gas-household-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-02T17:10:20Z","webTitle":"Protests over soaring energy prices take place across UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/02/protests-energy-prices-cap-uk-electricity-gas-household-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/apr/02/protests-energy-prices-cap-uk-electricity-gas-household-bills","fields":{"headline":"Protests over soaring energy prices take place across UK","bodyText":"Thousands of people have taken to the streets in the UK in protest against the sharp rise in energy prices, as a cabinet minister said the government could not “completely nullify” the increases. Demonstrations took place on Saturday, including one near Downing Street in central London where crowds gathered to hear speeches, including from former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Other protests took place in cities including Cardiff and Birmingham. They follow a major increase in the energy price cap on Friday, with average household gas and electricity bills rising to £1,971 a year. A further jump in October could take the cost up to £2,600. Groups including the Trades Union Congress and anti-poverty campaigners have voiced alarm at the changes, and said that when combined with increasing inflation and low pay, it could push people into “impossible choices” between heating their homes or eating. A spokesperson for the People’s Assembly Against Austerity, the organiser of Saturday’s series of events, said: “Public outrage over the cost of living crisis is growing fast, and our response is gaining momentum.” Corbyn said: “I’m meeting people who are terrified of the next bill, so the very least we need is a price cap on energy, and then we need to say, well look at the profits of energy companies and look at the difficulties of people living.” The price increase is driven by more demand on energy as economies recover from the effects of the Covid pandemic, with supply unable to keep up. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also exacerbated the issue, with some countries stopping or limiting their purchase of Russia’s oil and gas. Ministers have announced a council tax rebate for April and a £200 loan available from October to help soften the burden, but the Labour party has said there should be a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help provide support to those in need. In France, the government has limited energy bill increases to 4% this year. Speaking on Sky News on Saturday, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said: “We [the government] can’t completely nullify the impacts of the global markets and global pressure, for example, on energy, which is obviously the main focus at the moment for most people. “But we will put in the support that we can, as and when we can, as I say, looking …… across the board at what we’re doing with the public’s money.” Labour said the government should bring in laws to keep prices down. The shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said: “We would be meeting with oil and gas companies to make sure that it happened and, if it didn’t, then we’d be putting in legislative measures to make sure that it did. “I think we do need to see legislative measures if North Sea oil and gas companies, petrol retailers, are experiencing record profits and not passing any of those savings on to customers.” She said she was shocked that the increase in national insurance contributions was going ahead when people were having to deal with other spiralling costs. “It frankly beggars belief when we think about what people are having to pay over the coming weeks and months, that the government would not be doing much more to support people, let alone making things harder,” she told Times Radio. Amid a renewed focus on energy, the government’s strategy on the issue has yet to be revealed – weeks after it was due to be announced. Reports in the Times suggested that Boris Johnson was considering trebling the amount of onshore wind power by 2035, despite many Tory backbenchers opposing it. Nuclear power is also expected to feature heavily. Asked why there had been a delay and whether he supported onshore windfarms, Lewis said: “It’s complicated work to look at how we can have an energy policy package that’s holistic, that looks at all parts of energy, and we can become more domestically self-supportive on that, which will have a positive impact on prices. It’s right they take that time to have a look at it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/01/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-37-of-the-russian-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-01T01:23:26Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 37 of the Russian invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-37-of-the-russian-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/01/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-37-of-the-russian-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 37 of the Russian invasion","bodyText":"The Red Cross says an evacuation plan for Mariupol has been agreed with “top-level authorities” from Ukraine and Russia. There are thought still to be more than 100,000 civilians in the besieged southern port city. Earlier, Oleksii Iaremenko, a Ukraine deputy minister, said it was 36 days since Mariupol had received any medical or humanitarian supplies. Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are expected to restart on Friday by video, focusing on the peace framework the Ukrainian side presented during a face-to-face meeting in Istanbul earlier this week. Russian forces have reportedly left the Chernobyl power plant, the Ukrainian Atomic Energy Ministry said, citing personnel at the site. The troops began leaving after soldiers got “significant doses” of radiation from digging trenches at the highly contaminated site, Ukraine’s state power company said. Energoatom said the Russians had dug in at a forest inside the exclusion zone around the now-closed plant and “panicked at the first sign of illness”, which “showed up very quickly”, and began preparing to leave. Russian troops reportedly took an unspecified number of captive Ukrainian servicemen hostage after leaving the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Energoatom said in a statement on Telegram. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, repeated his warning that Russia was preparing for “powerful strikes” in the Donbas region after appearing to withdraw from an assault on Kyiv. The Pentagon agreed Russia may be repositioning some of its forces to send them to the Donbas. Nato’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, said Russian forces were not withdrawing, but regrouping. He also said the alliance had yet to be convinced Russia was negotiating in good faith in peace talks in Istanbul, because Moscow’s military objective since launching its invasion of Ukraine had not changed. Russia is redeploying some of its forces from Georgia to reinforce its invasion, British military intelligence said on Thursday. “It is highly unlikely that Russia planned to generate reinforcements in this manner and it is indicative of the unexpected losses it has sustained during the invasion,” the ministry said. The White House said the US had evidence that the war against Ukraine had been “a strategic disaster” for Russia. “We have seen incontrovertible evidence that this has been a strategic disaster for Russia,” the director of communications, Kate Bedingfield, said, adding that Russia was “working to redefine the initial aims of their invasion”. The US president, Joe Biden, said the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, “seems to be self-isolated” and that “there’s some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers”. He did not provide evidence. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, seemingly concurred, saying Putin was “not the force he used to be” as the Russian president became increasingly isolated. Speaking on Sky News, Wallace said: “President Putin is not the force he used to be. He is now a man in a cage he built himself. He’s isolated. His army is exhausted, he has suffered significant losses. The reputation of this great army of Russia has been trashed.” Russia has threatened to halt contracts supplying Europe with a third of its gas unless they are paid in Russian currency. Putin signed a decree on Thursday saying foreign buyers must pay in roubles for Russian gas from Friday, or contracts would be halted. Germany and France rejected the demands, calling them “blackmail”. EU and Chinese leaders will meet for a first summit in two years on Friday, with Brussels keen for assurances from Beijing that it will neither supply Russia with arms nor help Moscow circumvent western sanctions. EU officials close to the summit preparations said any help to Russia would damage China’s international reputation and jeopardise relations with its biggest trade partners – Europe and the US. Britain and its allies have agreed to send more military aid to Ukraine to help defend it against Russia’s invasion, the Wallace, said. As part of the agreement, armoured vehicles and long-range artillery would be sent. Australia will send armoured Bushmaster vehicles to Ukraine after Zelenskiy asked for them during a video appeal to Australian lawmakers. Russia said it would respond to the EU’s “irresponsible” sanctions. A senior foreign ministry official, Nikolai Kobrinets, told the Russian state media agency RIA: “The actions of the EU will not remain unanswered … the irresponsible sanctions by Brussels are already negatively affecting the daily lives of ordinary Europeans.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/apr/28/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-could-kill-500m-fish-campaigners-claim","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-28T12:15:02Z","webTitle":"Sizewell C nuclear plant could kill 500m fish, campaigners say ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/28/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-could-kill-500m-fish-campaigners-claim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/apr/28/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-could-kill-500m-fish-campaigners-claim","fields":{"headline":"Sizewell C nuclear plant could kill 500m fish, campaigners say ","bodyText":"More than 500 million fish, including protected species, could be sucked into the cooling system of a proposed £20bn nuclear power plant in Suffolk if construction goes ahead, environmental campaigners say. A local campaign group, Together Against Sizewell C (Tasc), claims the subsequent deaths of millions of fish is “inhumane and unacceptable” and flies in the face of the government’s green agenda. Also opposing the development, the bird conservation group RSPB expressed concern over predicted levels of fish loss on the marine birds that feed on them. The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), a government agency, has assessed the marine impacts of the plant and said it was confident the mortality rates caused by Sizewell C would be “sustainable” and the impact on the wider marine community “insignificant”. EDF, the French state-owned company behind the plan to build Sizewell C, claims the proposed plant could generate 3.2GW of electricity, enough to provide 7% of the UK’s electricity needs, or power 6m homes. The Nuclear Industry Association describes it as “a vital next step” in the UK’s efforts to secure new low-carbon electricity as older nuclear reactors are shut down. However, environmental campaign groups, including Greenpeace, argue that nuclear reactors are unnecessary and expensive, compared with a combination of renewable energy and battery storage technology. The RSPB and the local community group Stop Sizewell C said the reactor poses a risk to the natural habitats along the Suffolk coast and the adjacent Minsmere nature reserve. Planning documents published by EDF have revealed that almost 8 million fish were “impinged” – or sucked into the cooling system – by the existing plant Sizewell B each year between 2009 and 2013. Extrapolating from these figures, Tasc has estimated that 28 million fish could be impinged in the cooling system of both plants each year, which is 560 million over the two decades the plants are expected to operate, between 2035 and 2055. The proposed plant is larger than Sizewell B and will take in 2.5 times the amount of seawater, Tasc said. Pete Wilkinson, the chair of Tasc and a co-founder of Greenpeace UK, said the estimates were “staggering”. Such wildlife loss was the “tip of the iceberg”, he said, as it did not take into account fish fry, eggs, crustacea and other aquatic life. “Tens of millions of fish, crustaceans and other marine biota will be sacrificed for the purposes of cooling a plant which is not needed to keep the lights on, which will do nothing to reduce global carbon emissions, which will be paid for from the pockets of all UK taxpayers and bill-paying customers, leaving future generations with a lasting legacy of an impoverished environment,” he said. Wilkinson said he expected Cefas to condemn the impact on fish at the inquiry stage of the Sizewell C planning process. “Cefas’s stated aim is ‘to help keep our seas, oceans and rivers healthy and productive, and our seafood safe and sustainable … ’ Instead, it seems that Cefas appears quite at ease presiding over the deaths of millions of fish and clearly feels the huge number of fish deaths is acceptable in that the overall health of fish stocks will not be compromised.” Adam Rowlands, the RSPB’s Suffolk area manager, said: “It is our position that the project should not go ahead. The potential impacts on the environment are too great. Fish impingement is one of our concerns. These fish provide a valuable food supply to rare birds nesting and breeding in the area.” Protected species breeding in the area include little and common terns and in the winter there are a number of internationally important red-throated divers. “They won’t feed on dead fish,” Rowlands said. Asked what impact such a loss of fish might have, Rowlands said: “We haven’t seen evidence to convince us that removing that amount of fish from the population wouldn’t have an impact.” If the plant goes ahead, it will be built on part of Sizewell marshes, a site of special scientific interest. It will also be adjacent to the southern boundary of the RSPB-owned Minsmere nature reserve, a Ramsar (internationally important wetland) site and special protection area. Minsmere is one of only five sites in Britain to receive the Council of Europe European Diploma for protected areas award, whose renewal depends on Sizewell C not causing any damage. A spokesperson for Cefas said: “There is no scientific evidence that the proposed new nuclear developments will cause large-scale destruction of marine life or impact protected species.” Its role in relation to the Sizewell C project was to ensure “the marine evidence base is scientifically robust, to fully assess the potential marine impacts and, where feasible, to work with EDF engineers to reduce potential impacts by design optimisation”, the spokesperson said, adding that issuing any objection to the proposal was outside its remit. “Our objective is to ensure that the adverse impacts of human activities don’t affect the long-term viability of communities, habitats, or populations of vulnerable and declining species. “Where impacts do occur, such as mortality of fish on power station intake screens, we assess these against other sources of mortality (natural and anthropogenic) and the ability of the population to withstand such losses. Compared to the natural population size, relatively few fish will be impacted and we are confident that mortality rates caused by the new nuclear industry are sustainable and the impact on the wider marine ecosystem will be insignificant.” It said it had produced three chapters of the environmental statement, including on marine ecology and fisheries, submitted by Sizewell C to the planning process for public and regulatory scrutiny. It added: “In undertaking this nationally important work for EDF to develop UK’s new nuclear capability, we avoid conflicts of interest by not providing advice to government regulators on new nuclear developments.” A spokesperson for Sizewell C said: “Our assessments show that the fish impacted are mainly sprat and herring. The intake of these species by Sizewell C is 0.01% of the stock in the area. Fisheries scientists describe the impact of new nuclear power stations on the marine ecosystem as ‘insignificant’.” The spokesperson said they would use a more modern “fish returns system” than the one at Sizewell B, to ensure higher survival rates and that the returned fish that did not survive would be “eaten by other sea life”. A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said it was responsible for “stringent regulation” of the nuclear industry to prevent harm to the environment and local communities. Speaking about an EDF subsidiary created to build and run Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C nuclear power stations, they said: “We are currently considering NNB Generation Company’s environmental permit application for their proposed cooling water discharge, and will determine it once we have assessed the impacts to the marine environment – including fish populations.” The Sizewell C planning process began in May 2020 and an examination is now under way by the Planning Inspectorate. This stage of the process is expected to take about six months, during which local people and organisations can make representations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/03/minister-rules-out-energy-rationing-in-uk-despite-ukraine-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-03T13:49:28Z","webTitle":"Minister rules out energy rationing in UK despite Ukraine crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/03/minister-rules-out-energy-rationing-in-uk-despite-ukraine-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/apr/03/minister-rules-out-energy-rationing-in-uk-despite-ukraine-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Minister rules out energy rationing in UK despite Ukraine crisis","bodyText":"A cabinet minister has rejected calls for the UK to consider rationing energy, as a plan to drastically increase onshore wind power also appeared to be significantly scaled back. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had been a “massive wake-up call” for western nations about their dependence on imported oil and gas, which European countries are now trying to wean themselves off. However, Shapps said the UK would not follow the lead of other countries, such as Germany, that have put emergency measures in place to ration gas if Russia cuts off supplies to Europe. An international row is escalating over Russia’s demand that, from 1 April, all gas purchased by foreign countries must be paid for in roubles – a move that G7 countries have rejected. According to Reuters, the Dutch government said it would urge consumers to use less gas, Greece has called an emergency meeting of suppliers, and the French energy regulator urged consumers not to panic. Labour’s Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, said fuel rationing “should be an extreme option”. “We should be making those plans and the government should be preparing – not necessarily in public – for that situation,” he told the BBC’s Sunday Morning show. After the prime minister, Boris Johnson, flew to Saudi Arabia and the UAE to urge oil-producing countries in the Middle East to turn on the taps, Reynolds said the government should not be “shopping from one authoritarian regime to the next for fossil fuels”. He called for the long-delayed energy security strategy to be published with a particular focus on generating more renewable and nuclear energy, as well as improving energy efficiency. Reynolds also said there was “a lot of complacency in this country about the relative lower exposure to Russian gas that we have”, warning that if European countries stopped importing it then they would turn to the same providers used by the UK, squeezing supplies further and keeping prices high. But asked if he could completely rule out energy rationing in the UK, Shapps said: “Yes I can … We don’t see rationing being part of our approach to this, and nor should it be.” Shapps instead raised the prospect of generating more offshore wind, though he appeared to walk back on plans to double the amount of onshore wind power by 2030. The Guardian reported last month that ministers were considering drastically increasing the amount of power generated by onshore wind turbines by the end of the decade from 14 gigawatts to 30. Johnson was headed for a showdown with his own cabinet and backbenchers, but Shapps’s public disapproval will be interpreted as a sign that the government is preparing to back down. Shapps said there “may be places where it’s appropriate”, but that he thought “by and large, I think it’s better to build significant wind power offshore”. Earlier, he told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show: “I don’t favour a vast increase in onshore windfarms for pretty obvious reasons. They sit on the hills there and can create something of an eyesore for communities as well as actual problems of noise as well.” Instead, Shapps said he favoured nuclear modular reactors. This follows the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, telling the Sunday Telegraph that up to seven nuclear power stations could be built in Britain to radically expand homegrown energy. The UK’s new energy security strategy is expected to be published on Thursday. In a bid to smooth cabinet splits over the planned dramatic increase in onshore wind, No 10 said any decisions “will always be subject to consent from local communities”. However, a senior energy industry source told the Guardian they believed the antipathy to onshore wind came from “a small but determined group of backbench MPs and feels ideological rather than logical”. “Local MPs will justify house building, if they see it’s in the national interest, even in places they think there’s local opposition,” they said. “Often there are compromises made or locals get rewarded for having the infrastructure, but the homes get built. In contrast, onshore wind is treated by some MPs as something that isn’t valuable or vital - when it is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/12/no-10-must-not-cave-in-to-tory-climate-sceptics-on-fracking-says-ed-miliband","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-12T08:00:06Z","webTitle":"No 10 must not cave in to Tory climate sceptics on fracking, says Ed Miliband","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/12/no-10-must-not-cave-in-to-tory-climate-sceptics-on-fracking-says-ed-miliband","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/12/no-10-must-not-cave-in-to-tory-climate-sceptics-on-fracking-says-ed-miliband","fields":{"headline":"No 10 must not cave in to Tory climate sceptics on fracking, says Ed Miliband","bodyText":"The shadow secretary of state for climate change and net zero, Ed Miliband, has warned Boris Johnson against caving in to climate sceptics on the Conservative backbenches, after No 10 appeared to open the door to fracking. As the government reviews its energy strategy after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the prime minister’s spokesperson said this week that “all options” were under consideration, making clear that included the practice of fracking. Writing in the Guardian, Miliband warns against “doubling down on fossil fuels through a fracking-style dash for gas, which some on the Conservative benches are proposing”, and calls instead for a “clean energy sprint” towards renewables. “We don’t have time for more of the government’s ideologically driven failure, nor their failure to take on the deniers on their backbenches. They play the climate hokey-cokey and we end up with climate delay,” he said. Johnson has promised to publish an energy independence plan, setting out the government’s approach to phasing out imports of Russian oil – and potentially gas. It is expected to include a focus on renewables, nuclear power and North Sea gas. At prime minister’s questions this week Johnson said the plan would appear “in the course of the next few days”, but government sources now suggest it may come after the chancellor’s spring statement on 23 March. The Net Zero Scrutiny Group of Conservative MPs, chaired by Craig Mackinlay, has been increasingly vocal in challenging the government’s green policies. The group recently called for the removal of VAT on fuel bills and the green levies paid by households, as well as the resumption of fracking in the face of rapidly increasing oil and gas prices. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is known to be unenthusiastic about fracking, but said on Wednesday he had agreed with the prime minister that it did not make sense to concrete over fracking wells in Lancashire operated by the energy firm Cuadrilla, which were due to be closed. He told MPs the government’s position since 2019 had been to take “a precautionary approach that supports shale gas exploration if it can be done in a safe and sustainable way”. Miliband also called on the government to take action on “the Cinderella of this government’s energy policy: home insulation and energy efficiency”, adding “the best way of reducing our demand for fossil fuels is to reduce energy demand overall”. On Friday, the former Tory minister Rory Stewart called for “a government and civilian effort equivalent to the Covid response” to cut energy demand, including reducing the speed limit to 50mph and making all public transport free. Ministers have been more focused on demand in recent days, however. With imports of Russian oil due to be phased out by the end of the year, and the government looking at ending Russian gas imports, Kwarteng has met with the oil ministers of potential alternative suppliers, including Saudi Arabia. Ramping up imports from the Gulf state would be controversial, given Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s alleged role in approving the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, Layla Moran, said: “Britain is stuck in between a rock and a hard place because this government kicked the can down the road when it came to securing homegrown energy. If Boris Johnson is forced to cosy up to Saudi Arabia for more oil he will only have himself to blame. “By cutting support for domestic renewable energy the government is now forced to go begging around the world for more tainted oil.” • This article was amended on 12 March 20202.

Thanks for following developments with us, you can read all our Ukraine coverage here. It’s slightly past 11pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: According to a new law adopted on Thursday, every Ukrainian serviceman is now allowed to take an annual paid leave of ten days. “In a special period during martial law, military personnel may be granted a part of the annual basic leave, as well as leave for family reasons and for other valid reasons with preservation of financial support,” Ukrainian MP Yaroslav Zaliznyak wrote on Telegram. Ukraine’s General Staff has announced that Russia is withdrawing some of its military units and is preparing to evacuate occupation personnel from certain settlements across Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the Kyiv Independent reports. Russian publishers at a leading Moscow bookfair told Agence France-Presse Thursday they were “all very worried” by new restrictions and feared the return of Soviet-like censorship. Yevgeny Kopyov, of the large Eksmo publishing house, said he was worried by the “broad interpretation” of the LGBTQ propaganda law. He warned that it “may affect a large amount of literature, including the classics,” adding, “Everything will depend on our interaction with the regulatory authorities.” US president Joe Biden said he has no immediate plans to contact Russian president Vladimir Putin but is prepared to speak with him if he shows an interest in ending the war in Ukraine, and only in consultation with NATO allies. “I have no immediate plans to contact Mr Putin,” Biden said at a White House news conference after talks with French president Emmanuel Macron, Reuters reports. US president Joe Biden has told the press conference that the US stands with its allies “as strong as ever” against Russia’s “brutal war” against Ukraine. Biden said the support would continue in the face of Russian aggression, which he adds has been “incredibly brutal”. He adds: “I knew Russia was [brutal], but I didn’t anticipate them being as brutal as they have been.” US president Joe Biden and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron have issued a statement beforehand, after a meeting between the two presidents earlier on Thursday. “The presidents strongly condemn Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine and stress that intentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable,” part of it said. EU members are close to agreeing a $60 dollar per barrel price cap on Russian oil, diplomats said Thursday, with just Poland left to give the final nod, Agency France-Presse reports. Europe will begin enforcing an embargo on Russian crude shipments from Monday, so the price cap will apply to oil exported by sea by Moscow to ports around the world. The British adventurist and TV personality Bear Grylls has become the latest celebrity to meet Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv. Grylls posted pictures with Zelenskiy on his Instagram on Thursday afternoon. He wrote that he wanted to know how Zelenskiy was coping for an upcoming programme “but got so much more.” The UK-based Royal United Services Institute defence and security thinktank published a paper on Wednesday that examined the early days of the Russian invasion in February. A few snippets from the report’s executive summary. It believes that a Ukrainian victory is possible, but “it requires significant heavy fighting”. The paper says that according to operational data from the Ukrainian general staff, Russia had a 12:1 advantage over the Ukrainian forces north of Kyiv in the immediate aftermath of the invasion. More than 1,300 prisoners have been returned to Ukraine since Russian troops invaded, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday. Zelenskiy was speaking after a new exchange of 50 prisoners with Russian and pro-Russian forces. “After today’s exchange, there are already 1,319 heroes who returned home,” Zelenskiy said on Instagram, posting a photo showing a few dozen men holding Ukrainian flags. The head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, said it was too early reach a verdict on talks between Poland and Germany about sending the Patriot air-defence systems from Germany to Ukraine. “We all agree on the urgent need to help Ukraine, including with air defence systems,” Stoltenberg said at a joint news conference with German chancellor Olaf Scholz. Ukrainian servicemen of the Armed Forces will now be allowed to take a paid leave during martial law, Euromaidan reports. According to a new law adopted on Thursday, every Ukrainian serviceman is now allowed to take an annual paid leave of ten days. “In a special period during martial law, military personnel may be granted a part of the annual basic leave, as well as leave for family reasons and for other valid reasons with preservation of financial support,” Ukrainian MP Yaroslav Zaliznyak wrote on Telegram. No more than 30 percent of the total number of servicemen of a certain category and unit is allowed to be absent at the same time, he added. Ukraine’s General Staff has announced that Russia is withdrawing some of its military units and is preparing to evacuate occupation personnel from certain settlements across Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the Kyiv Independent reports. Russian publishers at a leading Moscow bookfair told Agence France-Presse Thursday they were “all very worried” by new restrictions and feared the return of Soviet-like censorship. Agence France-Presse reports: Since president Vladimir Putin sent troops to Ukraine on February 24, Russian authorities have strengthened controls on the flow of information, including in the arts. Last week, lawmakers approved a bill banning all forms of LGBTQ “propaganda” in books, films, the media and the internet. Authorities also want to ban the sale to minors of books written by “foreign agents” - a label given to Kremlin critics and activists, but also to a growing number of writers. Leading novelists like science fiction writer Dmitry Glukhovsky and historical fiction novelist Boris Akunin have been slapped with the tag, which has Stalin-era connotations. At the “Non/Fiction” book fair in Moscow - an important annual cultural event in the Russian capital that opened Thursday - many publishers, booksellers and readers were concerned. Yevgeny Kopyov, of the large Eksmo publishing house, said he was worried by the “broad interpretation” of the LGBTQ propaganda law. He warned that it “may affect a large amount of literature, including the classics,” adding, “Everything will depend on our interaction with the regulatory authorities.” Many publishers like Kopyov are waiting for authorities to clarify what they believe is LGBTQ “propaganda” or not. But some bookstores in Saint Petersburg already got rid of problematic books by offering discounts of up to 50 percent, according to local media. At the Non/Fiction fair, Marina Kadetova of the Kompas-Gid publishing house, warned that the restrictions are fuelling “self-censorship.” “When people start censoring themselves, then the problems start,” she said, adding, “In any restrictions that are not justified and not thought through, it is hard to work.” Tatiana Stoyanova, who also works at the same publishers, said the restrictions could lead to a revival of the Soviet “samizdat” practise that saw the underground publishing of banned books. “In Russia, there is such a mentality: the more its forbidden, the more it’s interesting,” she said. US president Joe Biden said he has no immediate plans to contact Russian president Vladimir Putin but is prepared to speak with him if he shows an interest in ending the war in Ukraine, and only in consultation with NATO allies. “I have no immediate plans to contact Mr Putin,” Biden said at a White House news conference after talks with French president Emmanuel Macron, Reuters reports. “I’m prepared to speak with Mr. Putin, if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he’s looking for a way to end the war. He hasn’t done that yet.” Biden and Macron are asked about Republican dissenters about money being sent to support the Ukrainian war effort. Macron responds. Speaking in English, he says: “Look I do thank president and his administration for his great commitment they have vis a vis Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. “Let me just say that our two nations are made of values and a history. What is at stake in Ukraine is now just very far from here, in a small country, somewhere in Europe. But it is about our values. It is about our principles. And it is about what we agreed together in the UN charter, protecting sovereignty and territorial integrity. That’s why I do believe that the US strongly supporting Ukraine in that time is very important, not just for the Ukrainians but also for the Europeans, but for the stability of our world today. “If we consider that we can abandon a country, and abandon the full respect of these principles, it means there is no possible stability in this world. I think it is important to have you so much committed. “We will follow up our own support. We increased our military support, our humanitarian support and our economic support.” He goes on to add that he will not try to strongarm the government in Kyiv into agreeing a settlement they are unhappy with. “We will never urge the Ukrainians to make a compromise that will never be acceptable to them. They are so brave, and they defend precisely their lives and nations and our principles. It will never build a sustainable peace if we want a sustainable peace. We have to respect the Ukrainians to decide the moment and the conditions which they will negotiate their territory and their future.” Emmanuel Macron is now responding to Joe Biden’s comments. Macron said that France led the diplomatic effort to avoid Russia’s invasion in February. “We clearly condemn this war, immediately,” he says. “We support both the Ukrainian army that is resisting and the Ukrainian population.” He thanks the US for its support, saying that it is affecting Europe directly and recognises the money the US has sent as part of the war effort. “The war effort is targeting the civilian infrastructure, bringing even more violence to make the Ukrainian people desperate and make it difficult for them to survive this winter,” the French president said. Macron said the allies are committed to the UN charter, and helping rebuild Ukraine after the war and a “sustainable peace”. Joe Biden has told the press conference that the US stands with its allies “as strong as ever” against Russia’s “brutal war” against Ukraine. Biden said the support would continue in the face of Russian aggression, which he adds has been “incredibly brutal”. He adds: “I knew Russia was [brutal], but I didn’t anticipate them being as brutal as they have been.” “Today we reaffirm that we are going to stand together against this brutality. We will continue this strong support for the Ukrainian people as they defend their homes, their families, hospitals, their nurseries, their sovereignty, their integrity, against Russian aggression.” He adds that France has welcomed more than 100,000 refugees, and Biden thanks them for doing so. “Attacking civilian infrastructure, choking off energy to Europe to drive up prices, exacerbating the food crisis. That is hurting very vulnerable people not just in Ukraine but around the world. But he won’t succeed. “We will work together to hold Russia accountable for their actions, and to mitigate the global impacts of Putin’s war on the rest of the world.” The US president says that the country is helping Europe with its energy security and that a new deal has been agreed with France on civil nuclear power. Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron are set to give a press conference shortly, as part of the French president’s official visit to the White House. They have issued this statement beforehand, after a meeting between the two presidents earlier on Thursday. The main part is that they say that Russia is carrying out war crimes and that they should be held responsible. The presidents strongly condemn Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine and stress that intentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable. They also condemn and reject Russia’s illegal attempted annexation of sovereign Ukrainian territory, in clear violation of international law. The United States and France deplore Russia’s deliberate escalatory steps, notably its irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and its disinformation regarding alleged chemical attacks, and biological and nuclear weapons programs. They reaffirm their nations’ continued support for Ukraine’s defense of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, including the provision of political, security, humanitarian, and economic assistance to Ukraine for as long as it takes. This includes the provision of significant resources to support Ukrainian civilian resilience through the winter, including stepping up the delivery of air defense systems and equipment needed to repair Ukraine’s energy grid. The United States and France plan to continue working with partners and allies to coordinate assistance efforts, including at the international conference taking place in Paris on 13 December 2022. They also intend to continue providing robust direct budget support for Ukraine, and to urge the international financial institutions to scale up their financial support. The United States and France reiterate their duty to uphold applicable international obligations and the principles and purposes of the UN Charter. They also reiterate their steadfast resolve to hold Russia to account for widely documented atrocities and war crimes, committed both by its regular armed forces and by its proxies, including mercenary entities such as Wagner and others, through support for international accountability mechanisms, including the international criminal court, the Ukrainian prosecutor general, UN Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry, and the OSCE Moscow Mechanism, sanctions, and other means. The United States and France remain committed to addressing the wider effects of Russia’s war, including working with the international community to build greater resilience to food and energy disruptions. EU members are close to agreeing a $60 dollar per barrel price cap on Russian oil, diplomats said Thursday, with just Poland left to give the final nod, Agency France-Presse reports. Europe will begin enforcing an embargo on Russian crude shipments from Monday, so the price cap will apply to oil exported by sea by Moscow to ports around the world. Measures will be taken to prevent tankers from shipping Russian oil sold above this price, for example by refusing to allow British and EU insurers to cover vessels and shipments. The EU was already in agreement with Washington on the need to cap the price western clients pay for Russia’s oil, to prevent Moscow profiting from price rises triggered by its own war on Ukraine. The European Commission had suggested the ceiling along with an order that if the trading price of oil falls below $60 then the cap will be cut until it is 5% lower than the market. Poland had been pushing for it to be even lower at $30. The British adventurist and TV personality Bear Grylls has become the latest celebrity to meet Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv. Grylls posted pictures with Zelenskiy on his Instagram on Thursday afternoon. He wrote that he wanted to know how Zelenskiy was coping for an upcoming programme “but got so much more.” “Through this special programme the world will see a side to president Zelenskiy that has never been shown before.” Word started spreading that Grylls was in Ukraine on Wednesday when he was photographed filming at a Ukrainian petrol station. Grylls also posed for pictures on a train with the staff of Ukraine’s state railway company posted on Thursday. Ukraine has not had commercial flights since the invasion. Sean Penn, Ben Stiller and Richard Branson are among other celebrities who have been hosted by Ukraine’s president in Kyiv since the start of the invasion. The UK-based Royal United Services Institute defence and security thinktank published a paper on Wednesday that examined the early days of the Russian invasion in February. A few snippets from the report’s executive summary. It believes that a Ukrainian victory is possible, but “it requires significant heavy fighting”. The paper says that according to operational data from the Ukrainian general staff, Russia had a 12:1 advantage over the Ukrainian forces north of Kyiv in the immediate aftermath of the invasion. The paper’s four authors said that the plan was to invade Ukraine over a 10 day period, which would have led to a full annexation by August 2022. It hoped to draw defending forces away from the capital, enabling a swift capture. However it goes on to say: “The very operational security that enabled the successful deception, however, also led Russian forces to be unprepared at the tactical level to execute the plan effectively. “The Russian plan’s greatest deficiency was the lack of reversionary courses of action. As a result, when speed failed to produce the desired results, Russian forces found their positions steadily degraded as Ukraine mobilised.” It also claims that Russia planned to arrested and execute those involved in the 2014 Maidan revolution, which led to the resignation of pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych. Rusi’s paper says that Russia underperformed tactically compared to expectations, and it was only superior weapons systems and Ukrainian troops using up their ammunition supply that has led to relative Russian successes. The paper also paints a chaotic behind-the-scenes operation for Kremlin troops. It says the Russian army “are culturally averse to providing those who are executing orders with the context to exercise judgement”. It also has lessons for UK and US forces. It says that it is only because of two artillery brigades that Ukrainian forces prevented Kyiv being captured, and initially it was able to match the resources of the Russians. However this has since shifted starkly in favour of Russia, and that the imbalance “must be rectified if deterrence is credible and is equally a problem for the [British] RAF and Royal Navy.” More than 1,300 prisoners have been returned to Ukraine since Russian troops invaded, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday. Zelenskiy was speaking after a new exchange of 50 prisoners with Russian and pro-Russian forces. “After today’s exchange, there are already 1,319 heroes who returned home,” Zelenskiy said on Instagram, posting a photo showing a few dozen men holding Ukrainian flags. “We will not stop until we get all our people back,” the Ukrainian leader said. Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the 50 returning Ukrainians included those who had defended Mariupol and Azovstal. In a meeting with the Red Cross in October Russia said it held about 6,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war. The head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, said it was too early reach a verdict on talks between Poland and Germany about sending the Patriot air-defence systems from Germany to Ukraine. “We all agree on the urgent need to help Ukraine, including with air defence systems,” Stoltenberg said at a joint news conference with German chancellor Olaf Scholz. However, he added, “it is important to understand that this is not only about delivering new systems but ensuring the systems that are being delivered can operate,” Reuters reports, including having enough ammunition, spare parts and maintenance. The time in Kyiv has just gone 6pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s stories so far: Ukraine’s military said Russia had pulled some troops from towns on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River from Kherson city, the first official Ukrainian report of a Russian withdrawal on the main frontline in the south. The statement gave only limited details and made no mention of any Ukrainian forces having crossed the Dnipro. Ukrainian officials also stressed that Russia had intensified shelling across the river, knocking out power again in Kherson where electricity had only begun to be restored nearly three weeks after Russian troops vacated the city and fled across the river. An investigation is under way into a suspected letter bomb sent to the US embassy in Madrid. It would be the sixth after five were sent to the Ukrainian embassy, Spanish politicians, a Spanish airbase and a company that makes rocket launchers on Wednesday. Spanish police confirmed to the Reuters news agency that an envelope similar to the previous letter bombs had been intercepted at the embassy. A private energy company in Ukraine has said that 40% of the country’s power infrastructure is damaged, as Russian attacks continue to target the supply. Millions have been without or with intermittent power since October, as Russia has focused its attacks on Ukraine’s energy system. As Ukrainians wake up on the first official day of winter, nearly 6 million people across a majority of Ukraine’s regions have no electricity, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday night. Ukraine’s state emergency service has said nine people had been killed in fires, after breaking safety rules in an attempt to heat their homes after Russian attacks on power facilities. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said that it was impossible to discuss nuclear arms control while the war in Ukraine continues, claiming the “western involvement” must not be ignored. Lavrov said that the US was trying to break up Russia, and that it was “naive” to think talks could take place while this happened. Ukraine dismissed the deputy chief engineer of its Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday, accusing him of collaborating with Moscow’s forces and treason, the Energoatom state nuclear energy company said. The statement was published a day after Russia said it had promoted the engineer, Yuriy Chernichuk, to serve as the director of the vast nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine. The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, has urged China’s top leaders to use their influence over Russia to end the war in Ukraine. Michel, who chairs EU leader summits, held talks with Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in Beijing on Thursday, in the first face-to-face encounter between the head of an EU institution and China’s top officials since the start of the pandemic. Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz has said that Europe should go back to its prewar “peace order” with Russia if Russian president Vladimir Putin will renounce aggression against his neighbours, according to a report in the Times of his comments at a security conference in Berlin. The US army awarded a $1.2bn contract to Raytheon Technologies Co for six national advanced surface-to-air missile systems (Nasams) for Ukraine on Wednesday, the Pentagon said. The United States has approved sending Ukraine a total of eight Nasams to help fend off Russian missile and drone attacks. Russia said on Thursday the German parliament’s move to recognise the 1932-33 famine in Ukraine as a Soviet-imposed genocide was an anti-Russian provocation and an attempt by Germany to whitewash its Nazi past. In a decision welcomed by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, German lawmakers passed a resolution on Wednesday declaring the death by starvation of millions of Ukrainians – the Holodomor – was genocide. Another PoW exchange will take place later on Thursday between Russia and Ukraine. Fifty prisoners of war will be handed over in the latest swap between the two sides. The UN appealed for record funds for aid next year, AFP reports, as the Ukraine war and other conflicts, climate emergencies and the still-simmering pandemic push more people into crisis, and some towards famine. The United Nations’ annual Global Humanitarian Overview estimated that 339 million people worldwide will need some form of emergency assistance next year – a staggering 65 million more people than the estimate a year ago. France has become the first major western state to publicly back the creation of a special tribunal to try senior Russian officials – potentially including Vladimir Putin – for the crime of aggression in Ukraine. Russian forces tried to advance in eastern Ukraine and trained tank, mortar and artillery fire on Kherson in the south, the Ukrainian military said, as western allies sought to buttress Ukraine and its neighbours against Moscow. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called for the EU to include Russia’s missile industry in its next sanctions package. Kuleba says it is warranted for their part in Russia’s war efforts, including those which have targeted Ukraine’s power infrastructure. Ukraine needs the US made Patriot missile defence systems to protect its civilian infrastructure, under heavy attack by Russia, foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said, adding he would be working with the German government on this issue. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato on Tuesday against providing Ukraine with Patriot systems, Reuters reported. The UK has announced a fresh round of sanctions against 22 Russians, including those the Foreign Office says were involved in enlisting criminals to fight in Ukraine. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said on Wednesday his department would target a new set of officials, including Denis Manturov, the deputy prime minister, who is responsible for troop equipment supplies. US president Joe Biden’s nominee to be ambassador to Russia, Lynne Tracy, pledged on Wednesday to make the release of detained Americans a priority if she is confirmed to one of most important, and challenging, US diplomatic posts. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said Europe should go back to its prewar “peace order” with Russia if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will renounce aggression against his neighbours, according to a report of his comments at a security conference. The Times reports that during a panel discussion at the event in Berlin on Wednesday, Scholz was asked how Germany would act towards Russia once the war was over given the “strong partnership” that had once been in place between the two countries. He said: “At this stage I would say it’s not about partnership, to be very honest. Russia spoilt the peace order we worked on for so many decades and we agreed there should never again be the attempt to change borders by force. “And what Russia is doing today is going back to the imperialistic approach of the 19th, 18th, 17th century where just a stronger country thinks it could just take the territory of the neighbour, understanding neighbours as just hinterland, and some place they can give rules to be followed. And this can never be accepted.” However, he continued: “We have to go back to the agreements which we had in the last decades and which were the basis for peace and security order in Europe. “And for Russia this also means that it accepts that there are open-minded societies, open societies, democracies, that follow completely a different way of how they are governed and how they attract people ... In the end there is no aggression coming from the member states of the European Union, there is no aggression coming from Nato, and all questions of common security could be solved and discussed. There is a willingness to do so. “We can come back to a peace order that worked and make it safe again if there is a willingness in Russia to go back to this peace order.” This is from our correspondents in Kyiv, Isobel Koshiw, and Brussels, Jennifer Rankin, on France backing the creation of a tribunal to try officials for crimes of aggression in Ukraine. France has become the first major western state to publicly back the creation of a special tribunal to try top Russian officials – potentially including Vladimir Putin – for the crime of aggression in Ukraine. The French foreign ministry said on Wednesday it was working with its European partners on the proposal. The statement came after the European Union, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, lent support for the tribunal in a speech on the bloc’s plans for Ukraine. The defendants of such a tribunal would be those with decision-making power involved in committing the crime of aggression, meaning the transgression of Ukraine’s borders by the Russian military. This would very likely mean just a handful of figures, including Putin as well as other figures such as the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. If they were convicted, even in absentia, the sentence would set in stone current relations with Russia by labelling Putin and his team international criminals and make sitting down at the negotiating table nearly impossible.

Ukraine’s military said Russia had pulled some troops from towns on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River from Kherson city, the first official Ukrainian report of a Russian withdrawal on what is now the main frontline in the south. The statement gave only limited details and made no mention of any Ukrainian forces having crossed the Dnipro. Ukrainian officials also stressed that Russia had intensified shelling across the river, knocking out power again in Kherson where electricity had only begun to be restored nearly three weeks after Russian troops vacated the city and fled across the river. Since Russia abandoned Kherson last month, nine months into its invasion of Ukraine, the river now forms the entire southern stretch of the front, Reuters reported. Russia has already told civilians to leave towns within 15 km of the river and withdrawn its civilian administration from the city of Nova Kakhovka on the bank. Ukrainian officials have previously said Russia pulled back some artillery near the river to safer positions further away, but until now had stopped short of saying Russian forces were quitting towns. “A decrease in the number of Russian soldiers and military equipment is observed in the settlement of Oleshky,” the military said, referring to the town opposite Kherson city, on the far side of a destroyed bridge over the Dnipro. “Enemy troops were withdrawn from certain settlements of the Kherson oblast and dispersed in forest strips along the section of the Oleshky - Hola Prystan highway,” it said, referring to a 25-km (15-mile) stretch of road through riverside towns scattered in woods on the bank opposite Kherson city. It said most of the Russian troops in the area were recently mobilised reservists, suggesting that Moscow’s best-trained professional troops had already left. Reuters could not independently confirm the report. Russia’s foreign minister has accused the west of becoming directly involved in the conflict in Ukraine by supplying it with weapons and training its soldiers. Sergei Lavrov also said that Russia’s strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities and other key infrastructure that have left millions without power, heating and water were intended to weaken Ukraine’s military potential and derail the shipments of western weapons, the Associated Press reported. “You shouldn’t say that the US and Nato aren’t taking part in this war, you are directly participating in it,” Lavrov said in a video call with reporters. “And not just by providing weapons but also by training personnel. You are training their military on your territory, on the territories of Britain, Germany, Italy and other countries.” He said that the barrage of Russian missile strikes was intended to “knock out energy facilities that allow you to keep pumping deadly weapons into Ukraine in order to kill the Russians”. “The infrastructure that is targeted by those attacks is used to ensure the combat potential of the Ukrainian armed forces and the nationalist battalions,” he said. An investigation is under way into a suspected letter bomb sent to the US embassy in Madrid. It would be the sixth after five were sent to the Ukrainian embassy and Spanish government officials on Wednesday. Spanish police confirmed to the Reuters news agency that an envelope similar to the previous letter bombs had been intercepted at the embassy. The road outside the embassy in the Spanish capital is closed with police on the scene. The head of the European Council, Charles Michel, has urged China’s top leaders to use their influence over Russia to end the war in Ukraine. Michel, who chairs EU leader summits, held talks with Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in Beijing on Thursday, in the first face-to-face encounter between the head of an EU institution and China’s top officials since the start of the pandemic. Speaking to reporters, Michel said the pair had met for around three hours, where they spent “a lot of time” discussing the situation in Ukraine. Michel said he had urged Xi to use its influence as a permanent member of the UN security council to convince Russia to accept international law. Michel said: President Xi made very clear that China is not providing weapons to Russia,” Michel said, adding that the Chinese leader had also said Russia’s “nuclear threat is not acceptable and not responsible”. I sincerely hope that all the international community, China included, will use all possible tools and instruments to advocate in order to convince the Kremlin and Russia to end the war and to respect the sovereignty of Ukraine The EU demands echo a similar message delivered to Xi by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, last month, when the German chancellor went to Beijing. In a readout of the meeting provided by EU officials, it was said Michel and Xi had discussed “Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked war against Ukraine”. Last month a video message for a Shanghai trade fair by Michel that used similar language was dropped from the programme by Chinese authorities. While Michel’s message is consistent with the EU line on Ukraine, ahead of the trip diplomats had worried about political missteps from the European Council president. EU diplomats also raised eyebrows about Michel’s decision to meet Xi alone, without the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who is responsible for drafting and executing EU policy. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called for the EU to include Russia’s missile industry in its next sanctions package. Kuleba says it is warranted for their part in Russia’s war efforts, including those which have targeted Ukraine’s power infrastructure. After meeting EU foreign policy head Josep Borrell in Poland, Kuleba tweeted: “I thanked the EU for its continued defence assistance and stressed that next EU sanctions should include those hitting Russia’s missile production industry: it must be put to a halt.” More on the letter bombs that have been sent to officials in Spain, including at the Ukrainian embassy (see 10:46am). Spain’s deputy interior minister, Rafael Pérez, told a press briefing that the letters do not justify raising the terror level in the country. Reuters reports that early stages of the investigations suggest that the envelopes were sent within Spanish territory, and that the government was unaware of other letters being received in other countries. You can find our Madrid correspondent Sam Jones’ report below. The Russian embassy in Spain has condemned the sending of letter bombs to the Spanish government, and Ukrainian embassy. In a statement on Twitter, in Spanish, it said: “Any terrorist threat or act, even more so directed against a diplomatic mission, is totally reprehensible.” Switzerland has said it has frozen $7.9bn in Russian assets, in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine. The amount is higher than the figure published by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (Seco) in July. Switzerland is a favoured destination for wealthy Russians and their assets, and has also seen 15 Russian-owned properties seized. The country’s banks are banned from accepting deposits from Russian nationals or people or entities based in Russia, of more than 100,000 swiss francs. The government in Berne positioned itself alongside the EU over sanctions in the aftermath of the invasion in February. Another PoW exchange will take place later on Thursday between Russia and Ukraine. Fifty prisoners of war will be handed over in the latest swap between the two sides. The news was revealed by the Russian-installed official in charge of the Russian-occupied region of Donetsk Denis Pushilin on Telegram. Some more on that news conference with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, earlier on Thursday (see 9:34am). He said that it was impossible to discuss nuclear arms control while the war in Ukraine continues, claiming the “western involvement” must not be ignored. Russia backed out of talks that were due to start on Monday on the Start treaty on nuclear disarmament, which expires in 2026. “It is crystal clear that it is impossible to discuss strategic stability today while ignoring everything that is happening in Ukraine. Because the goal in Ukraine has been declared – not to save Ukrainian democracy, but to defeat Russia on the battlefield, or even destroy Russia,” Lavrov said. The foreign minister claimed that Russia would have looked at extending the Start treaty in the past to include hypersonic weapons, and that the Kremlin was prepared to go beyond a statement in June 2021, issued jointly with the US, that a nuclear war could not be fought and was unacceptable. He said that it could have included that war between nuclear powers would be unacceptable. However Lavrov added it was “naive” of the US to expect Russia to discuss strategic nuclear issues while the US appeared to be trying to destroy Russia, in the view of Moscow. A private energy company in Ukraine has said that 40% of the country’s power infrastructure is damaged, as Russian attacks continue to target the supply. Millions have been without or with intermittent power since October, as Russia has focused on Ukraine’s energy system. “Russia has destroyed 40% of the Ukrainian energy system with terrorist missile attacks. Dozens of energy workers were killed and wounded,” DTEK company said in a statement on social media. “Electrical engineers are doing everything possible and impossible to stabilise the situation regarding energy supply,” the company said, according to Agence France-Presse, adding its technical teams are working “day and night” to quickly repair the infrastructure. Nine people were confirmed to have died on Tuesday according to authorities, as incidents have increased where Ukrainians are trying to find alternative sources of energy, including generators and gas cylinders, both of which can be dangerous. The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s stories so far: Police in Spain are investigating four more incendiary devices and letter bombs, a day after one exploded at Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid. The devices have now been sent to the prime minister, the defence ministry, an arms company that makes rocket launchers donated to Kyiv, and a military airbase near the Spanish capital, as well as the one found at the embassy. Ukraine dismissed the deputy chief engineer of its Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday, accusing him of collaborating with Moscow’s forces and treason, the Energoatom state nuclear energy company said. The statement was published a day after Russia said it had promoted the engineer, Yuriy Chernichuk, to serve as the director of the vast nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine. The US army awarded a $1.2bn contract to Raytheon Technologies Co for six national advanced surface-to-air missile systems (Nasams) for Ukraine on Wednesday, the Pentagon said. The United States has approved sending Ukraine a total of eight Nasams to help fend off Russian missile and drone attacks. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the west had a real chance to avoid conflict in Ukraine, but had chosen to spurn Russian proposals to halt the expansion of Nato and agree a special security status for Kyiv. Lavrov made the comments during a news conference in Moscow, Reuters reported. Russia said on Thursday the German parliament’s move to recognise the 1932-33 famine in Ukraine as a Soviet-imposed genocide was an anti-Russian provocation and an attempt by Germany to whitewash its Nazi past. In a decision welcomed by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, German lawmakers passed a resolution on Wednesday declaring the death by starvation of millions of Ukrainians – the Holodomor – was genocide. The UN appealed for record funds for aid next year, AFP reports, as the Ukraine war and other conflicts, climate emergencies and the still-simmering pandemic push more people into crisis, and some towards famine. The United Nations’ annual Global Humanitarian Overview estimated that 339 million people worldwide will need some form of emergency assistance next year – a staggering 65 million more people than the estimate a year ago. As Ukrainians wake up on the first official day of winter, nearly 6 million people across a majority of Ukraine’s regions have no electricity, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday night. Ukraine’s state emergency service has said nine people had been killed in fires, after breaking safety rules in an attempt to heat their homes after Russian attacks on power facilities. The European Commission president has proposed a special tribunal to investigate and prosecute Russia’s “crime of aggression” against Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen also wants to use the proceeds of Russian funds that have been frozen under western sanctions to aid Ukraine. Russian forces tried to advance in eastern Ukraine and trained tank, mortar and artillery fire on Kherson in the south, the Ukrainian military said, as western allies sought to buttress Ukraine and its neighbours against Moscow. Ukraine needs the US made Patriot missile defence systems to protect its civilian infrastructure, under heavy attack by Russia, foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said, adding he would be working with the German government on this issue. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev warned Nato on Tuesday against providing Ukraine with Patriot systems, Reuters reported. The UK has announced a fresh round of sanctions against 22 Russians, including those the Foreign Office says were involved in enlisting criminals to fight in Ukraine. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said on Wednesday his department would target a new set of officials, including Denis Manturov, the deputy prime minister, who is responsible for troop equipment supplies. US president Joe Biden’s nominee to be ambassador to Russia, Lynne Tracy, pledged on Wednesday to make the release of detained Americans a priority if she is confirmed to one of most important, and challenging, US diplomatic posts. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for the moment. My colleague Harry Taylor will be with you shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Police in Spain are investigating four more incendiary devices and letter bombs, a day after one exploded at Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid. The devices have now been sent to the prime minister, the defence ministry, an arms company that makes rocket launchers donated to Kyiv, and a military airbase near the Spanish capital, as well as the one found at the embassy. The first letter bomb exploded when it was opened by an embassy employee on Wednesday, causing minor injuries to the worker’s hands and leading Ukraine to warn its diplomats to bolster their security precautions. The second, discovered hours later at the Instalaza weapons firm in Zaragoza in the Aragón region that manufactures C90 rocket launchers, was deactivated by bomb squad officers. A child swings at a park in front of damaged residential building due to airstrikes in Vyshorod, Kyiv oblast, Ukraine. Ukraine dismissed the deputy chief engineer of its Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday, accusing him of collaborating with Moscow’s forces and treason, the Energoatom state nuclear energy company said. The statement was published a day after Russia said it had promoted the engineer, Yuriy Chernichuk, to serve as the director of the vast nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez’s office received on 24 November a letter containing an explosive device “similar” to the ones received by the Ukrainian embassy, a Spanish weapons manufacturer on Wednesday and an air force base on Thursday, the interior ministry said. Security around public and diplomatic buildings are to be stepped up after a series of letter-bombs were received around the country, the ministry added. Spanish security forces found a third suspected explosive device hidden in an envelope mailed to a European Union satellite centre located at an air force base in Torrejon de Ardoz, outside Madrid, the defence ministry said on Thursday. After scanning the envelope by X-ray, air force security officers determined it contained “a mechanism”, the ministry statement said. Police were still analysing the parcel on Thursday morning. The satellite centre supports the EU’s common foreign and security policy by gathering information from space intelligence devices, according to its website. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell described such systems as “the eyes of Europe” in September. Two letter-bombs were found on Wednesday addressed to the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid and to a weapons manufacturer, Instalaza in Zaragoza, in northeastern Spain, police said. Instalaza manufactures the C90 rocket launcher that Spain has supplied to Ukraine. The first letter-bomb exploded, causing minor injuries to a Ukrainian embassy official. A bridge is seen collapsed over a river near Lyman city, Ukraine. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov also accused Nato of trying to drag India into what he called an anti-Russian and anti-Chinese alliance at a time when he said the West was attempting to squeeze out Russian influence. Lavrov, speaking at a news conference, added that the South China Sea was becoming a region where Nato was willing to ratchet up tensions and accused the United States of trying to subvert the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the west had a real chance to avoid conflict in Ukraine, but had chosen to spurn Russian proposals to halt the expansion of Nato and agree a special security status for Kyiv. Lavrov made the comments during a news conference in Moscow, Reuters reported. Western countries say Russia’s proposals made in the run-up to the Ukraine war were unrealistic and insincere. Spanish security forces found a third explosive device hidden in a mailed parcel to an air force base in Torrejón de Ardoz outside Madrid, the newspaper El Mundo reported on Thursday morning. Two letter bombs were found on Wednesday addressed to the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid and to a weapon manufacturer in Zaragoza, in northern Spain, police said. The first one exploded causing minor injuries to a Ukrainian official. Russia said on Thursday the German parliament’s move to recognise the 1932-33 famine in Ukraine as a Soviet-imposed genocide was an anti-Russian provocation and an attempt by Germany to whitewash its Nazi past. In a decision welcomed by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, German lawmakers passed a resolution on Wednesday declaring the death by starvation of millions of Ukrainians – the Holodomor – was genocide. In November 1932, the Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin, dispatched police to seize all grain and livestock from newly collectivised Ukrainian farms, including the seed needed to plant the next crop. Millions of Ukrainian peasants starved to death in the following months from what the Yale University historian Timothy Snyder calls “clearly premeditated mass murder”. Russia on Thursday rejected the claim that this was a genocide and said millions of people across other parts of the Soviet Union, including in Russia, also suffered. “There is another attempt to justify and push forward a campaign – being planted in Ukraine and sponsored by the West – to demonise Russia and to pit ethnic Ukrainians against Russians,” Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement. “The Germans are trying to rewrite their history … downplay their own guilt and muddy the memory of the unprecedented nature of the countless crimes committed by Nazi Germany during the second world war,” it added. The ministry accused the German parliament of “reviving the fascist ideology of racial hatred and discrimination and attempting to absolve itself of responsibility for war crimes” by passing the declaration. Geoffrey Pyatt, assistant secretary for energy resources at the US State Department, said on Thursday he was confident that agreement would be reached on the level at which to cap prices for Russian sea-borne oil under a G7 scheme. Pyatt was speaking to reporters in Tokyo after a meeting with his Japanese counterpart, Ryo Minami. A former US ambassador to Ukraine, Pyatt is in Japan to meet officials on aspects of energy security, Reuters reports. The UN appealed for record funds for aid next year, AFP reports, as the Ukraine war and other conflicts, climate emergencies and the still-simmering pandemic push more people into crisis, and some towards famine. The United Nations’ annual Global Humanitarian Overview estimated that 339 million people worldwide will need some form of emergency assistance next year – a staggering 65 million more people than the estimate a year ago. “It’s a phenomenal number and it’s a depressing number,” UN aid chief, Martin Griffiths, told reporters in Geneva, adding that it meant “next year is going to be the biggest humanitarian programme” the world has ever seen. If all the people in need of emergency assistance were in one country, it would be the third-largest nation in the world, after China and India, he said. And the new estimate means that one in 23 people will need help in 2023, compared to one in 95 back in 2015. As the extreme events seen in 2022 spill into 2023, Griffiths described the humanitarian needs as “shockingly high”. “Lethal droughts and floods are wreaking havoc in communities from Pakistan to the horn of Africa,” he said, also pointing to the war in Ukraine, which “has turned a part of Europe into a battlefield”. The global humanitarian plan will aim to provide $1.7bn in cash assistance to 6.3 million people inside Ukraine, and also $5.7bn to help the millions of Ukrainians and their host communities in surrounding countries. As Ukrainians wake up on the first official day of winter, nearly 6 million people across a majority of Ukraine’s regions have no electricity, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday night. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s state emergency service has said nine people had been killed in fires, after breaking safety rules in an attempt to heat their homes after Russian attacks on power facilities. “Only in the last day there were 131 fires in Ukraine, 106 of them in the residential sector. Nine people died, eight were injured,” the emergency service said. The US Army awarded a $1.2bn contract to Raytheon Technologies Co for six national advanced surface-to-air missile systems (Nasams) for Ukraine on Wednesday, the Pentagon said. The United States has approved sending Ukraine a total of eight Nasams to help fend off Russian missile and drone attacks. Ukraine received its first delivery of two Nasams air defence systems in November. Others will be delivered in future months once they are built. “Nasams are just the latest in the diverse set of air-defence capabilities we are delivering to Ukraine,” said Bill LaPlante, under secretary of defence for acquisition and sustainment. These six Nasams systems were part of the fifth Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) package which was announced on 24 August and had a total value of $2.98bn, according to an Army Statement. USAI funds allow the Biden administration to procure weapons from industry rather than taking weapons from existing US weapons stocks. The contract is for the Nasams batteries, training, and logistical support to Ukraine’s military and security forces. Funds for the two other Nasams came from the third USAI package announced in July. Last week Doug Bush, the chief weapons buyer for the Army, told reporters the US Army is accelerating its weapons acquisition process to speed through a backlog of contracts needed to replenish US stocks of weapons depleted by arms shipments to Ukraine. The Pentagon has said the newly US-provided Nasams air defence systems so far have had a 100% success rate in Ukraine intercepting Russian missiles. In total, the United States has committed more than $19.3bn in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden administration. Hi, this is the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine, with me, Helen Sullivan. In Washington, a $1.2bn contract for six national advanced surface-to-air missile systems (Nasams) for Ukraine was awarded to Raytheon, the Pentagon said. The United States has approved sending Ukraine a total of eight Nasams to help fend off Russian missile and drone attacks. Ukraine received its first delivery of two Nasams air defence systems in November. Others will be delivered in future months once they are built. Meanwhile as Ukrainians wake up on the first official day of winter, nearly six million people across a majority of Ukraine’s regions have no electricity, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday night. Here are the other key recent developments: A security officer at Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid was injured when he opened a letter bomb addressed to the ambassador on Wednesday. The security officer suffered light injuries, Spanish government official Mercedes Gonzalez told broadcaster Telemadrid. In the wake of the incident, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba ordered all Kyiv’s embassies abroad to “urgently” strengthen security, a ministry spokesperson said. The European Commission president has proposed a special tribunal to investigate and prosecute Russia’s “crime of aggression” against Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen also wants to use the proceeds of Russian funds that have been frozen under western sanctions to aid Ukraine. Russian forces tried to advance in eastern Ukraine and trained tank, mortar and artillery fire on Kherson in the south, the Ukrainian military said, as western allies sought to buttress Ukraine and its neighbours against Moscow.

Nine people died, eight were injured,” the emergency service said. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, has arrived in Kyiv for a three-day visit to show solidarity with the people and churches of Ukraine. Welby will meet leaders of Ukraine’s churches, refugees and internally displaced people. The head of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, discussed nuclear issues and Ukraine in a meeting this month with the CIA director, William Burns, the RIA news agency reported. Elizabeth Rood, the charge d’affaires at the US embassy in Moscow, previously told RIA that Burns “did not negotiate anything and he did not discuss a settlement of the conflict in Ukraine”. Moscow has promoted the chief engineer of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Yuriy Chernichuk, to become its head, according to Russia’s nuclear agency Rosenergoatom. The position has been vacant since October, when Kyiv says the plant’s boss Ihor Murashov was abducted by Russian authorities. Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said on Telegram early on Wednesday morning that Russian strikes in the region overnight hit a gas distribution point, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no injuries or casualties. One person was killed and another wounded in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Wednesday, the regional governor said. Yaroslav Yanushevych wrote on the Telegram messaging app that several residential buildings and medical facilities had been damaged in the city, which was liberated this month after months of Russian occupation. Ukraine claims to have killed another 500 Russian soldiers in the last 24 hours, bringing the total who have died in combat since 24 February to about 88,880. The general staff of the armed forces said it had taken out three more tanks and six armoured personnel carriers. Ukrainian forces have downed three Russian reconnaissance drones in the last 24 hours, according to its armed forces. In an early morning bulletin from Ukraine, the spokesperson for the general staff of the armed forces, Alexander Štupun, said Ukraine had been subjected to a number of missile attacks from planes and artillery, including on Kivsharivka in Kharkiv and Sloviansk in Donetsk. A teenager was killed in Russian shelling of a hospital in the northern Ukrainian region of Sumy, a presidential aide has said. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian forces had pounded the region with artillery and mortar bombs over the past 24 hours. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he did not believe Russian president Vladimir Putin will use nuclear weapons. He made the comment while speaking by video link at the New York Times ‘DealBook’ summit in New York City. It comes as Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said it was vital to avoid any kind of military confrontation between nuclear powers, even if it only involved conventional weapons, the TASS news agency reported. Russia’s defence minister has said it will focus on nuclear arms infrastructure in 2023, including facilities to accommodate new missile systems. Sergei Shoigu told a meeting of the board of the department on Wednesday that it would be a priority for Russia next year. “When preparing the list of major construction facilities for 2023, special attention will be paid to construction in the interests of the strategic nuclear forces,” Shoigu was quoted by RIA news agency as saying. The city council in the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa has voted to remove and relocate a monument to Empress Catherine the Great of Russia that has been daubed with red paint at least twice. The statue to the city’s founder, which towers over a central square, has been vandalised repeatedly since the invasion of Ukraine that has prompted many Ukrainians to reject their country’s historical ties to Moscow, Reuters reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/jun/27/mike-george-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-27T16:48:10Z","webTitle":"Mike George obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jun/27/mike-george-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/jun/27/mike-george-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Mike George obituary","bodyText":"Mike George, a writer and campaigner on social justice and the environment, who has died aged 75 after contracting a rare form of tuberculosis, was instrumental in advancing ideas for socially useful manufacturing and in developing understanding of consumer vulnerability. George questioned the assumption in the regulation of essential services that there were fixed groups of vulnerable people whose interests needed protecting. He argued instead that vulnerability could potentially affect anyone at any time for a range of reasons, including income pressures or illness, and he devised a risk-factor approach that is now standard practice. His work for the Centre for Consumer and Essential Services at Leicester University heavily influenced the energy regulator, Ofgem, which in 2013 produced the first comprehensive vulnerability strategy in the essential services sector. Other regulators have since followed suit and it is now commonplace for providers of utilities and wider services to take proactive measures to identify people at risk, maintain registers and offer targeted help with bills and other forms of support. George had long had a scientific approach and vision that put him ahead of mainstream thinking. In the late 1970s he was already advocating the manufacture of solar cells, wind turbines and road-rail vehicles by workers being displaced from the motor and defence sectors. In 1978 he was appointed coordinator of the Centre for Alternative Industry and Technological Systems (Caits) at North East London Polytechnic (now the University of East London). Caits was funded by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust to further the work of the trades unions’ joint shop stewards committee representing workers at Lucas Aerospace, a major UK manufacturer, to consider how to manage the potential decline of their industry and avoid job losses. Under the radical “Lucas plan”, the committee proposed switching production from military equipment to products such as kidney dialysis machines. George led the preparation of a 200-page report, Turning Industrial Decline into Expansion – a Trade Union Initiative, which set out detailed and costed proposals for the manufacture of 150 socially useful products. Although the report failed to win political or investor backing at the time, much of its thinking has since become orthodox and several of its ideas have been acted upon. There were no compulsory redundancies at Lucas. After running Caits for 11 years, George turned to freelance researching and writing. He was a regular contributor to the Guardian from the 1980s to the 2000s. His articles for Society Guardian would typically focus on emerging issues below the media’s radar, and sometimes even beyond professional focus, such as hoarding, disabled refugees, the sex lives of people with a learning disability and rural mental ill-health. This concern for marginalised people led George and his wife, Linda Lennard, a consultant on consumer policy whom he had married in 1983 after they met through his work at Caits, to reappraise the concept of consumer vulnerability. Lennard was already a visiting fellow at the Leicester centre and he became a research associate after they set up a joint consultancy in 2006. George led development of the risk-factor approach, arguing that vulnerability could be caused not only by individual circumstances but also by actions or inaction on the part of a regulator or service provider, and could arise from a combination of economic, environmental and social factors, termed intersectionality, identification of which might require providers of different services to pool their knowledge of customers. In April this year, BSI, the business standards and improvement company, launched a new standard and kitemark for the energy, water and financial sectors that requires service providers to identify vulnerability through means including data collection and sharing. Born in Brighton, Mike was the only child of Catherine (nee Symonds), a shopworker, and Ronald George, an engineer. The family moved to Hampshire, where he attended Cowplain county secondary school, Waterlooville, and then Purbrook Park county grammar in Purbrook. Following a short spell working in the chemicals industry, he moved to London to study psychology and zoology at North East London Polytechnic, graduating in 1969. After a false career start in management with the Rochdale-based asbestos manufacturer Turner &amp; Newall, which convinced him he would be better suited on the side of the workers, George left after four years to go travelling across the US and he then took a master’s degree in industrial relations at the London School of Economics. He joined Caits in 1978. George held fast to socialist principles throughout his life, but left the Labour party during Tony Blair’s leadership. As a fervent environmentalist and a co-founder of the Socialist Environment and Resources Association (now Sera), he became involved in recent years with the Green party in St Albans, where he and Lennard had moved from north London. He campaigned particularly against air pollution. While living in London, George and Lennard helped found the Hornsey Vale Community Association, which secured substantial lottery funding to take over disused local school buildings and adjacent land to create a thriving community centre and the award-winning Stationers Park. George’s later life was blighted by illness. He endured two years of lengthy hospital stays until he was finally diagnosed by specialists at the Royal Free hospital in north London as having contracted BCG-Osis, a rare side-effect of BCG immunotherapy for bladder cancer. Typically, George used his experience to pen a series of insightful and challenging blogs about health and social care from the recipient’s perspective. “Too often,” he wrote, “people’s actual experiences at the receiving end of services don’t figure half as much as they should in policy-making or service design and provision.” George co-edited three books: The Politics of Nuclear Power (1978), Japanese Competition and the British Workplace (1984) and Developing the Socially Useful Economy (1986). He wrote unpublished poetry and performed with the Pennine Poets when he lived in Rochdale, where he also developed his abiding love for tramping the English countryside and being in nature. He is survived by Linda. • Michael Christopher George, writer and campaigner, born 14 February 1947; died 3 June 2022"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/24/russia-ukraine-war-ukraine-braces-for-russian-attacks-as-it-marks-independence-day-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-24T18:12:37Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Boris Johnson visits Kyiv as Zelenskiy warns Russia over ‘nuclear blackmail’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/24/russia-ukraine-war-ukraine-braces-for-russian-attacks-as-it-marks-independence-day-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/24/russia-ukraine-war-ukraine-braces-for-russian-attacks-as-it-marks-independence-day-live-news","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Boris Johnson visits Kyiv as Zelenskiy warns Russia over ‘nuclear blackmail’ – as it happened","bodyText":"It’s past 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia had put the world “on the brink of a radiation catastrophe”. Russia has controlled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in south-east Ukraine since March, although it is still run by Ukrainian scientists. Built in the Soviet era, is the largest nuclear reactor in Europe. Boris Johnson visits Kyiv, announcing £54m in support. The prime minister has made an unexpected visit to Ukraine to announce further support including unmanned surveillance and missile systems for the Ukrainian military. UN secretary general António Guterres has called the six-month anniversary of the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine a “sad and tragic milestone”. He said he remained “gravely concerned” about military activity around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. The number of people facing acute food insecurity worldwide has more than doubled to 345 million since 2019 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, conflict and climate change, according to the World Food Programme. The impact of the Ukraine crisis had “massive repercussions” in the Middle East and Africa. Britain is importing no energy from Russia for the first time on record. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released six months after the start of the war found that in June the UK’s imports from Russia were down by 97% and stood at only £33m as sanctions took effect. US president Joe Biden marked Ukraine’s independence day on Wednesday with a new security assistance package nearing $3bn (£2.5bn). Since the beginning of the Biden administration, the US has committed approximately $10.6bn in security assistance to Ukraine. A former mayor of Russia’s fourth-largest city was arrested Wednesday on charges of discrediting the country’s military. Yevgeny Roizman, a critic of the Kremlin, who served as the mayor of Yekaterinburg in 2013-18, faces up to five years in prison if convicted. Pope Francis has renewed calls for peace for the “beloved” Ukraine on the country’s independence day. He also said he thinks of “that poor girl” Daria Dugina, the daughter of a Russian ultranationalist intellectual allied with President Vladimir Putin, who was killed by a car bomb on Saturday. The Pope later came under fire for his remarks on Dugina’s death, as Ukraine’s ambassador to the Vatican, Andrii Yurash, called Wednesday’s speech “disappointing”. UN secretary general António Guterres has called the six-month anniversary of the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine a “sad and tragic milestone”. Speaking at a UN security council meeting, Guterres said “the warning lights are flashing”, AFP reports. The UN chief described the six months of conflict as “devastating”, echoing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as he said he remained “gravely concerned” about military activity around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, Europe’s largest atomic power plant. Guterres added: Any further escalation of the situation could lead to self-destruction. The security of the plant must be ensured, and the plant must be re-established as purely civilian infrastructure. Earlier, Zelenskiy said Russia had put the world “on the brink of a radiation catastrophe”. Vladimir Putin is to blame for British people being hit by high energy bills while Ukrainian people are “paying in their blood”, Boris Johnson has said as he made a final visit to Kyiv as prime minister. In his third visit to the country since Russia invaded in the spring, Johnson urged the international community to “stay the course” in its support for Ukraine. The outgoing prime minister also told the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Ukraine “can and will win the war”. Comparing the costs of Russia’s war, he said: “If we’re paying in our energy bills for the evils of Vladimir Putin, the people of Ukraine are paying in their blood.” Read more here: Ukraine’s independence day was always important. Now it is a matter of life and death A year ago on 24 August – the 30th anniversary of Ukraine’s independence – a new generation of pilots were leading the Ukrainian air forces flying over Independence Square in Kyiv. The fighter jet column was headed by Anton Lystopad, who was recognised as one of the country’s best pilots. He was 30 years old, born in the year of independence. Almost a year later, in August 2022, Lystopad received the Order for Courage from the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. A few days after the ceremony, he was killed in combat. Lystopad’s story may sound almost too symbolic, but Ukrainians have become used to such tragic symbolism. Six months on from the start of the Russian invasion, with its indiscriminate bombardment of peaceful towns, the atrocities and horrors of Bucha and Mariupol, but also the solidarity, resilience and sacrifices we have experienced, everything feels sharper and deeper. The bitterness of losses and the joy of survival. Even before the full-scale war, for Ukrainians, Independence Day was the most important holiday of the year, the brightest day, when we thought not about the death of tyranny and the Soviet empire, but the rebirth of the state and of freedom. Amid the war, a military parade in the capital is not an option – soldiers and equipment must be on the frontline. A civilian gathering may put people in danger. There are concerns that Vladimir Putin’s airstrikes will punish those celebrating something he wants to destroy. But doing nothing would feel like a defeat. Not letting Russia destroy our usual way of life is a form of protest. The installation of destroyed Russian military equipment along Kyiv’s main street, Khreshchatyk, has been applauded by many. It offers an ironic commentary: on 24 February, Moscow wanted its armoured vehicles trundling into central Kyiv.

Olha Kachurenko, 43, a nurse and laboratory worker, and her 13-year-old daughter Marharyta fled their home in the southern city of Mykolaiv, not far from Russian-occupied Kherson, on 18 March, a few weeks after the war started. After reaching Poland they applied for the UK Homes for Ukraine scheme on 23 March. “We started to hear rumours that the Russians wanted to also attack neighbouring countries so we decided to try to move as far away as possible,” said Olha Kachurenko. “I opened the internet and saw information about the UK’s Homes for Ukraine scheme.” Read more here: Isobel Koshiw has reported from Ukraine on how the country is marking its 31st year of independence. As Ukraine marks 31 years of statehood, Kyiv’s streets are a far cry from the way they looked six months ago when thousands were fleeing in panic and military checkpoints operated on most corners. The very real feeling of imminent death – which jolted the population into mounting a large-scale, voluntary resistance – has subsided outside the frontline areas in the south and east. Most restaurants and businesses in the capital have gradually reopened. But like Kyiv’s tree-lined streets and summer clothes, the physical aspects of life returning to normal have not outweighed the inner pain many Ukrainians are experiencing – brought home even more by the muted public holiday. “As I’m speaking to you now, I have goosebumps. People I know, my godson even, is fighting at the front. There is no celebration today. I can’t even believe that this is happening,” said Yana Pasychnyk, a choral singer in one of Ukraine’s national choirs. You can read the full report here: The number of people facing acute food insecurity worldwide has more than doubled to 345 million since 2019 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, conflict and climate change, according to the World Food Programme (WFP). Listing the coronavirus pandemic and the impact of environmental challenges as leading destabilising factors, the organisation also said the impact of the Ukraine crisis had “massive repercussions” in the Middle East and Africa. “Yemen imports 90% of its food needs. And they took about 30% from the Black Sea,” Corinne Fleischer, the WFP’s regional director, told Reuters. In the case of Iraq, an oil-exporting country, food security is at risk, said Fleischer. The country needs approximately 5.2m tons of wheat, but only produced 2.3m tons of wheat, she said. The rest had to be imported, which cost more. Despite state support, severe drought and recurring water crises are endangering the livelihood of smallholders all over Iraq, she said. As Ukraine marks 31 years of independence, European leaders brace for a bleak winter caused, in part, by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. On Wednesday, Germany’s government approved a bylaw restricting the heating of public buildings and banning illuminated advertising hoardings, in an effort to save energy and tackle soaring energy costs. The moves are part of a national effort to save on energy to reduce the dependency of Europe’s largest economy on Russian gas, and more immediately to deal with concerns that Moscow may choose to cut off access to its Baltic Sea pipeline during the winter. Robert Habeck, the minister for the economy, said the measures were central to German energy security. “We want to free ourselves as quickly as possible from the vice of Russian energy imports,” he said. And speaking at his government’s first cabinet meeting after the summer holidays, Emmanuel Macron warned the French they were facing sacrifices and what he called the “end of abundance”. The president, speaking before ministers at the Élysée, said the country was at a “tipping point” and faced a difficult winter and a new era of instability caused by climate change and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Here are the latest photos to come out of Ukraine and elsewhere: Speaking remotely at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Wednesday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia has put the world “on the brink of a radiation catastrophe”. It is a fact that the Russian military has turned the territory of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, into a warzone. The Zaporizhzhia plant, built in the Soviet era, is the largest nuclear reactor in Europe. Russia has controlled the plant in south-east Ukraine since March, although it is still run by Ukrainian scientists. The Ukrainian nuclear firm Energoatom said last week it feared that Russia plans to switch off the functioning power units at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which in normal times provides about one-fifth of Ukraine’s electricity. There have been growing calls from Nato, the United Nations and French president Emmanuel Macron to demilitarise the site. In his address, Zelenskiy called on the International Atomic Energy Agency to take “permanent control” and said “Russia should unconditionally stop nuclear blackmail and completely withdraw from the station.” A western official previously told the Guardian fighting around the plant was considered a lesser risk than a cooling failure, because the nuclear reactors are designed to withstand relatively heavy impact, including that from a passenger jet. It is nearly 6pm in Ukraine. Here is what you might have missed: Boris Johnson visits Kyiv, announcing £54m in support. The prime minister has made an unexpected visit to Ukraine to announce further support including unmanned surveillance and missile systems for the Ukrainian military. Britain is importing no energy from Russia for the first time on record. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released six months after the start of the war found that in June the UK’s imports from Russia were down by 97% and stood at only £33m as sanctions took effect. US president Joe Biden marked Ukraine’s Independence Day on Wednesday with a new security assistance package nearing $3bn (£2.5bn). Since the beginning of the Biden administration, the US has committed approximately $10.6bn in security assistance to Ukraine. A former mayor of Russia’s fourth-largest city was arrested Wednesday on charges of discrediting the country’s military. Yevgeny Roizman, a critic of the Kremlin, who served as the mayor of Yekaterinburg in 2013-18, faced up to five years in prison if convicted. Pope Francis has renewed calls for peace for the “beloved” Ukraine on the country’s independence day. He also said he thinks of “that poor girl” Daria Dugina, the daughter of a Russian ultranationalist intellectual allied with President Vladimir Putin, who was killed by a car bomb Saturday. The Pope later came under fire for his remarks on Dugina’s death, as Ukraine’s ambassador to the Vatican, Andrii Yurash, called Wednesday’s speech “disappointing”. The government has called on more people to take in Ukrainian refugees. But ministers have not announced any additional financial support for UK hosts who take part in the Homes for Ukraine scheme, despite warnings that the cost of living crisis is deterring people from signing up or continuing to participate. Ben Wallace has said the UK can “toughen up” visa conditions for Russians, yet remained uncertain whether an outright ban is the “right way”. The defence secretary’s remarks come as Finland, Estonia and the Czech Republic have called for Brussels to implement an EU-wide ban on new tourist visas for Russians to enter the Schengen free travel area. Ukraine is bracing for possible brutal strikes as it marks its independence day and 31 years since the end of Soviet rule. Authorities have cancelled celebrations in Kyiv as officials warn that Russia is preparing to attack the capital. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he had information from Ukraine’s intelligence services and international partners that there was an increased threat as the US said it believed Russia would target civilian and government infrastructure in the next few days. Britain is importing no energy from Russia for the first time on record after trade between the two countries collapsed after the Kremlin ordered invasion of Ukraine in February. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released six months after the start of the war found that in June the UK’s imports from Russia were down by 97% and stood at only £33m as sanctions took effect. The ONS data shows that by June the UK government had already achieved its objective of phasing out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022 and ending imports of liquefied natural gas as soon as possible after that.

The war will probably run on for a year at least, but is essentially deadlocked and its intensity lessening Six months of war may have gone by, but neither Ukraine nor Russia are ready to stop fighting, despite the losses they have sustained. Ukraine wants its occupied territories back, and Russia wants to keep inflicting pain not just on its opponent but, by proxy, the west also. The Kremlin believes winter will play to its advantage too. There have been no negotiations between the two sides since evidence emerged of the massacres at Bucha, Irpin and elsewhere in territories occupied by the Russians north of Kyiv. But movement in the frontlines has been minimal since the fall of Lysychansk at the end of June. Both sides are struggling for momentum and increasingly appear combat exhausted. 2. Ukraine has no means of effective conventional counterattack, while guerrilla raids are an optimistic way to precipitate a Russian collapse Ukraine would like to retake Kherson on the west of the Dnieper River, but a senior administration figure admitted in private that “we do not have enough capacity to push them back”. Kyiv has shifted its strategy to mounting long-range missile attacks and daring special forces raids on Russian bases deep behind the frontlines. The key presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the aim was to “create chaos within the Russian forces” but, while it will blunt the invader’s effectiveness it is not likely it will lead to invaders collapsing in on themselves and voluntarily conceding Kherson, as some Ukrainian officials have hoped. 3. Russia still wants to pound its way forward but its attention is likely to be shifting to holding on to its gains and annexing Ukraine territory Russia has no new offensive plan other than to mass artillery, destroy towns and cities and grind its way forward. It does this in part because it is effective, and in part to minimise casualties, having lost – on some western estimates – 15,000 dead so far. It continues to adopt this strategy around Bakhmut in the Donbas but progress is slow, partly because it has had to redeploy some forces to reinforce Kherson. The Kremlin may not have achieved what it hoped at the beginning of the war, but Russia holds large swathes of Ukrainian territory in the east and south, and is actively talking about holding annexation referendums. With cooler weather fast approaching, it is likely to focus on consolidating what it has. Read more here: The UK prime minister has made an unexpected visit to Ukraine to announce further military support. In a post on Twitter, with a photograph of Johnson next to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, he wrote: What happens in Ukraine matters to us all. That is why I am in Kyiv today. The latest £54m support package includes unmanned surveillance and missile systems for the Ukrainian military. Johnson said: Today’s package of support will give the brave and resilient Ukrainian armed forces another boost in capability, allowing them to continue to push back Russian forces and fight for their freedom. Speaking in Kyiv, Johnson said: Out of the ashes of your towns and cities, out of the monstrous scars that are being left by Putin’s missiles, something beautiful is blooming and it’s a flower that the whole world can see and admire, and that is the unconquerable will of Ukrainians to resist. In his final visit as prime minister, Johnson received Ukraine’s highest award bestowed on foreign nationals, the order of liberty, for the UK’s staunch support of Ukraine’s freedom. While Johnson visits Ukraine for the fourth time this year, in three weeks’ time, he will no longer be UK prime minister. Despite the country being beset by a series of crises, from the mounting cost of living crisis to war in Ukraine, he has been accused of leading a “zombie” government. Earlier today, Johnson reiterated his support for Ukraine on the country’s independence day. He wrote: “For however long it takes, the United Kingdom will stand with you.” Here are the latest photos to come out of Ukraine and elsewhere, as the nation’s independence day coincides with six months since Russia’s invasion. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has vowed to regain territories taken by Russia in a speech marking 31 years since the end of Soviet rule and six months since the war began. In an address delivered in front of Kyiv’s central monument to independence from the Soviet Union, he said: For us, Ukraine is all of Ukraine. All 25 regions, without any concessions or compromises. It doesn’t matter to us what kind of army you have; what matters to us is our land. We will fight for it until the end. Thousands of people have been killed since the war began on 24 February, with Ukraine acknowledging 9,000 military deaths, and there is little hope that an end to the fighting is in sight From Kyiv, Emma Graham-Harrison looks at the traditional dress of Ukraine’s president as the country celebrates 31 years since declaring its independence from the Soviet Union. Lithuania’s president has expressed concern at Russia’s ambitions beyond the borders of Ukraine, and called the war a “true miscalculation”. Speaking on Sky News, Gitanas Nausėda said: Ukraine is fighting for their freedom, but I think Ukraine is fighting also for us, for the freedom of democracy. Nausėda added: Everybody understands that there’s no limit of appetite of Vladimir Putin and Kremlin’s regime. If they will succeed in Ukraine there will be [a] continuation of this aggression and expansion. When asked if he was worried of Putin’s ambitions to go beyond Ukraine’s borders, Nausėda responded: “Unfortunately, yes.” During a visit to Salisbury Plain, Keir Starmer said the UK “will not be divided politically” in it’s defence of Ukraine against Russian aggression. According to PA Media, the Labour leader met with both Ukrainian and British personnel during his visit this morning, and said: Six months after the start of the conflict in Ukraine, I’ve been here in Salisbury Plain watching Ukrainian troops being trained by British troops with live rounds, simulating the situation they are going to be facing. I’ve been so impressed with the training I’ve seen here, that the global reputation of British forces is of grit, of class and that sort of steely determination and courage on the battlefield. Starmer added: “My mission, my message to the Ukrainian people, to our troops, our Nato allies, is that on the issue of defending Ukraine against Russian aggression, we stand united. We will not be divided politically in the United Kingdom on this and I’ve been able to deliver that message first-hand amongst this very, very impressive training.” US president Joe Biden marked Ukraine’s Independence Day on Wednesday with a new security assistance package nearing $3bn (£2.5bn) to equip the country for a war of attrition fought primarily in eastern and southern Ukraine. Announcing the largest support package for Ukraine since Russia’s invasion six months ago, Biden said: The United States of America is committed to supporting the people of Ukraine as they continue the fight to defend their sovereignty. Since the beginning of the Biden administration, the US has committed approximately $10.6bn in security assistance to Ukraine. Ukraine gained independence in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when hardline Communist leaders attempted to restore central Communist party control over the USSR. Days after the coup, a special session of the Ukrainian parliament voted by 321 votes to two with 31 abstentions to declare Ukraine an “independent and sovereign republic”, in which Soviet law no longer applied. Artist Vitoria Drozdovskaya, in the crowd outside the parliament building in Kiev, said “now we can finally live like human beings after decades of living like animals”. Marta Dyczok in Kiev and John Rettie in Moscow reported for the Guardian on Ukraine’s historic independence on 26 August 1991. Here’s the Guardian piece published on that day: Pope Francis been criticised for his remarks on Wednesday on the death of Daria Dugina, the daughter of a Russian ultranationalist intellectual allied with President Vladimir Putin, killed by a car bomb Saturday. Earlier, Francis, citing “the innocents who are paying for madness”, said: I think of that poor girl who died because of a bomb under the seat of her car in Moscow. In an unusual public criticism of the Pope’s remarks, Ukraine’s ambassador to the Vatican, Andrii Yurash, wrote that Wednesday’s speech was “disappointing”. US and UK financial institutions have been among the leading investors in Russian “carbon bomb” fossil fuel projects, according to a new database of holdings from recent years. Campaigners in Ukraine said these institutions must immediately end such investments, to limit the funding of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and to avoid climate breakdown. Carbon bombs are fossil-fuel extraction projects identified by researchers to contain at least 1bn tonnes of climate-heating CO2, triple the UK’s annual emissions. Russia is a hotspot, with 40 carbon bombs, 19 of them operated or developed by Russian companies backed by foreign finance. The companies are Gazprom, Novatek, Lukoil, Rosneft oil company and Tatneft. Read more on how the UK and US banks are among the biggest backers of Russian ‘carbon bombs’ here: A former mayor of Russia’s fourth-largest city was arrested Wednesday on charges of discrediting the country’s military, part of a crackdown on dissent of Moscow’s military action. Police arrested Yevgeny Roizman, a critic of the Kremlin, who served as the mayor of Yekaterinburg in 2013-2018, following searches at his apartment and office, according to AP. Roizman, 59, told reporters he was charged under a new law adopted after Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. Earlier this year, he was fined on similar charges. If convicted, he faces up to five years in prison. Pope Francis has renewed calls for peace for the “beloved” Ukraine on the country’s independence day and the six-month anniversary of the start of Russia’s invasion. Following his weekly general audience at the Vatican, Francis directed his address to “the beloved Ukrainian people who for six months today have been suffering the horror of war,” AFP reports. Referring to the Russian-controlled nuclear plant in souther Ukraine, and Europe’s largest, which has been the target of military strikes, Francis added: I hope that concrete steps will be taken to put an end to the war and to avert the risk of a nuclear disaster in Zaporizhzhia. Francis also mentioned Daria Dugina, the daughter of a Russian ultranationalist intellectual allied with President Vladimir Putin, who was killed by a car bomb Saturday. “I think of that poor girl who died because of a bomb under the seat of her car in Moscow,” he said. A leading UK choir has released a single based on words by the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the poet Serhiy Zhadan to mark six months since Russia launched the war in Ukraine. A Quiet Night – Tyhoyi Nochi is sung in English and Ukrainian, with music by one of the country’s foremost young composers, Natalia Tsupryk. Tom Herring, the artistic director of the choir, Sansara, said he hoped the work would be performed by refugees from Ukraine and host communities around the world. Sansara’s work is rooted in the belief that choral music has a unique potential to bring people together. A Quiet Night is a musical expression of solidarity with the people of Ukraine but it is also a creative vehicle for choirs to meet and sing with all those displaced by conflict. Tsupryk said: “President Zelensky’s words about ‘a free people’ not allowing ‘occupation to take root in their land’; show Ukrainians for what we are. Far from being victims and losers, we are warriors and winners.” The single will raise funds for the Ukrainian Welcome Centre which supports newly-arrived Ukrainian refugees in the UK. Sansara will perform A Quiet Night on Friday 25 November at St Martin-in-the-Fields in central London. The government has called on more people to take in Ukrainian refugees on the sixth month anniversary of the Russian invasion of the country. But ministers have not announced any additional financial support for UK hosts who take part in the Homes for Ukraine scheme, despite warnings that the cost of living crisis is deterring people from signing up or continuing to participate. Monthly payments to hosts of Ukrainian refugees should double to £700 to help them to provide housing for more than six months due to rising costs, the minister responsible has said. Launching the appeal for new hosts, refugees minister Lord Harrington said: “I would urge anyone who has the room to come forward and join thousands of others in providing a safe haven for people forced to leave their country.” Read more on the ‘desperate’ need for Homes for Ukraine hosts as war reaches six-month point here: Ben Wallace has said the UK can “toughen up” visa conditions for Russians, yet remained uncertain whether an outright ban is the “right way”, PA Media reports. The defence secretary’s remarks come as Finland, Estonia and the Czech Republic have called for Brussels to implement an EU-wide ban on new tourist visas for Russians to enter the Schengen free travel area as punishment for Russia’s war against Ukraine. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Wallace said: I certainly think we can toughen up the conditions of our visas. I am not sure whether an outright ban is the right way. He added: “I think that’s a matter for the home secretary to look at. But I don’t like, and I’m sure none of your listeners like, watching oligarchs’ wives or indeed Russian senior officials’ wives enjoying themselves in Greece or the south of France, or on super-yachts around the world while their army is committing war crimes in Ukraine.” Here are the latest photos to come out of Ukraine and elsewhere on the nation’s independence day, six months after Russia’s invasion. It is just after 1pm in Ukraine. Here is what you might have missed: Russian opposition politician Yevgeny Roizman was shown being detained at his home in a video published on social media on Wednesday, reports Reuters. Video of the arrest showed Roizman, former mayor of the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, being taken away by law enforcement officials. Roizman was seen in the video telling reporters that he was being investigated under a law against discrediting the armed forces. He said he was being arrested “basically for one phrase, ‘the invasion of Ukraine’”. Pope Francis has called for “concrete steps” to end the war in Ukraine and avert the risk of a nuclear disaster at the Zaporizhzhia power plant, reports Reuters. IAEA, the UN nuclear watchdog, said on Tuesday it would visit the Russian-occupied plant in Ukraine within days if talks to gain access succeed. Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of firing at the facility, the largest of its kind in Europe and which pro-Moscow forces took over soon after the 24 February invasion. The United Nations has called for the area to be demilitarised. A Russian-installed head of the town of Mykhailivka in the Russian-controlled part of the Zaporizhzhia region in south-eastern Ukraine was killed in a car bomb on Tuesday, an official said. Ivan Sushko was critically injured when a bomb placed under his car exploded, Zaporizhzhia region administration member Vladimir Rogov said on Telegram. Norway and Britain will jointly supply micro-drones to Ukraine to aid in its war with Russia, reports Reuters. The cost of the Teledyne Flir Black Hornet drones, used for reconnaissance and target identification, will be up to 90m Norwegian crowns (£7.4m), the Norwegian defence ministry said in a statement. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told Ukrainians on Wednesday in an emotional speech to mark 31 years of independence that Ukraine was reborn when Russia invaded and would recapture annexed Crimea and occupied areas in the east. In the recorded speech aired on the six-month anniversary of Russia’s 24 February invasion, Zelenskiy said Ukraine no longer saw the war ending when there was peace, but when Kyiv was actually victorious. Former Conservative leadership contender Tom Tugendhat has disclosed he is in Kyiv as Ukraine marks 31 years since it declared independence from the Soviet Union. “Here in Kyiv we’re in shelters after being woken by the air raid siren,” the Commons foreign affairs committee chair tweeted in response to a post by British journalist John Sweeney. He later posted a video of himself next to destroyed tanks in the centre of Kyiv and praised the commitment of Britain in helping Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Ukraine is bracing for possible brutal strikes as it marks its independence day and 31 years since the end of Soviet rule. Authorities have cancelled celebrations in Kyiv as officials warn that Russia is preparing to attack the capital. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he had information from Ukraine’s intelligence services and international partners that there was an increased threat as the US said it believed Russia would target civilian and government infrastructure in the next few days. Ukraine’s defence ministry advised Ukrainians to be especially careful, citing the threat of missile attacks and “provocations” from Russia. Many civilians are attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack, according to an adviser to Ukraine’s president. Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” that an attack may strike the centres of decision-making in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday. Russia and the Putin regime “are really obsessed with dates and symbols, so it would be logical to be on the lookout and be prepared for independence day to be attacked”, Andriy Yusov, the head of the ministry’s intelligence directorate, said. Zelenskiy has warned Russia of a strong response to any possible independence day attacks. Ukrainian intelligence is working with foreign intelligence, he said in a news conference on Tuesday, warning that Russia “will receive a response, a powerful response”. Zelenskiy also said Ukraine will not agree to any proposal to freeze the current frontlines in its conflict with Russia in order to “calm” Moscow, which now controls about 22% of Ukraine including Crimea. Zelenskiy also vowed to return Crimea to Ukraine, saying that it would become part of the EU, along with the rest of the country. “We will return Crimea, because it is our territory. In any way we decide. We will decide it on our own, without consulting any other state,” he said. “It all began with Crimea, and it will end with Crimea.” Ukraine is not ready for negotiations with Russia regarding a ceasefire, Zelenskiy said. “At the point where we are, we are not ready for a ceasefire. We explained that there will be no Minsk-3, Minsk-5, or Minsk-7. We will not play these games, we have lost part of our territories this way … it is a trap,” he said during a press conference following a summit of the Crimea Platform in Kyiv. Russia’s Donbas offensive is making minimal progress and its forces are suffering from shortages of munitions, vehicles and personnel, according to British intelligence. Ukraine’s intelligence directorate has claimed Russia is attempting to shell the “ash pits” of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to “raise clouds of radioactive dust”. In an update posted to the agency’s official Telegram channel late last night, officials said that mortar attacks on the surrounding suburbs of Energodar aimed to target the ash pits of the plant. The US is set to announce a fresh security assistance package for Ukraine of about $3bn (£2.5bn), officials have said, to equip the country for a war of attrition and secure its medium- to long-term defence posture. The money will fund contracts for as many as three types of drones, and other weapons, ammunition and equipment that may not see the battlefront for a year or two, US officials told the Associated Press. Germany will also supply Ukraine with a further €500m in military aid, most of it earmarked for delivery next year, a government spokesperson said on Tuesday. The equipment will include three IRIS-T anti-aircraft systems, “around a dozen armed recovery vehicles, 20 rocket-launchers mounted on pick-ups … precision munition and anti-drone equipment,” a spokesperson told Agence France-Presse. Andrew Roth reports for us from Moscow: Russian police have detained Yevgeny Roizman, a prominent opposition politician and former mayor of Ekaterinburg, for his public criticism of the Russian war in Ukraine. Roizman, a popular political activist in Ekaterinburg, the fourth largest city in Russia, said he was being charged for his use of the word “invasion” under strict new laws that ban criticism of the Russian armed forces. He could face five years in prison if convicted, Russian state news media reported. Video released by a pro-Kremlin news outlet showed masked police in bulletproof vests storming into the apartment building where Roizman lives. After a search, Roizman was led from the flat past journalists waiting in the stairwell. When asked where he had used the word “invasion”, he replied: “I say it everywhere.” Read more: Russia detains opposition leader over criticism of Ukraine war A Russian-installed head of the town of Mykhailivka in the Russian-controlled part of the Zaporizhzhia region in south-eastern Ukraine was killed in a car bomb on Tuesday, an official said. Ivan Sushko was critically injured when a bomb placed under his car exploded, Zaporizhzhia region administration member Vladimir Rogov said on Telegram. Rogov said: As a result of the explosion, Ivan Sushko was wounded and taken to the hospital in critical condition, where he soon died. The Ministry of Defence has posted the latest map on Russian troop placements and attack locations in Ukraine. Pope Francis has called for “concrete steps” to end the war in Ukraine and avert the risk of a nuclear disaster at the Zaporizhzhia power plant, reports Reuters.

Francis also called arms merchants who profit from war “delinquents who kill humanity”. The Scots Guard band has paid tribute to Ukraine with a rendition of the country’s Eurovision winning entry Stefania. Britain’s defence minister Ben Wallace said today that Russia is in a “very fragile” position, reports PA Media. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I spoke to my intelligence chiefs this morning before coming on, you know, Russia’s advance can be measured in metres per week, not miles. It is grinding in small parts of the country in an attempt to advance – completely opposite of the three-days special operation that it touted at the beginning of this, six months ago. We pretty much accept, well, we do accept, the sort of observations of Russian losses to be – if you combine deaths, injuries, desertions – over 80,000 of their armed forces. That’s 80,000 in six months compared with 15,000 they lost in a decade in Afghanistan. I think we are in a position where Russia is in a very fragile position. On whether Ukraine is realistically in a position to retake the territory that Russia still holds, Mr Wallace said: I think Ukraine is getting itself into that position. First and foremost, Ukraine already has had throughout this the moral component, as we call it in defence, and if you look at the morale of the Ukrainian forces, it is, you know, it is leagues ahead of the Russian morale, you know, which is poorly-trained troops, etc. Journalist Nataliya Gumenyuk argues Ukraine is facing a watershed in the course of the war: A year ago on 24 August – the 30th anniversary of Ukraine’s independence – a new generation of pilots were leading the Ukrainian air forces flying over Independence Square in Kyiv. The fighter jet column was headed by Anton Lystopad, who was recognised as one of the country’s best pilots. He was 30 years old, born in the year of independence. Almost a year later, earlier this month, Lystopad received the order for courage from the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. A few days after the ceremony, he was killed in combat. Lystopad’s story may sound almost too symbolic, but Ukrainians have become used to such tragic symbolism. Six months on from the start of the Russian invasion, with its indiscriminate bombardment of peaceful towns, the atrocities and horrors of Bucha and Mariupol, but also the solidarity, resilience and sacrifices we have experienced, everything feels sharper and deeper. The bitterness of losses and the joy of survival. Even before the full-scale war, for Ukrainians, Independence Day was the most important holiday of the year, the brightest day, when we thought not about the death of tyranny and the Soviet empire, but the rebirth of the state and of freedom. Read more: Ukraine’s independence day was always important. Now it is a matter of life and death Norway and Britain will jointly supply micro drones to Ukraine to aid in its war with Russia, reports Reuters. The cost of the Teledyne Flir Black Hornet drones, used for reconnaissance and target identification, will be up to 90m Norwegian crowns (£7.4m), the Norwegian defence ministry said in a statement. Norway’s defence minister Bjørn Arild Gram said: The drone is used for reconnaissance and target identification. It is easy to operate, robust, difficult to detect and particularly well-suited for combat in urban areas. Charlotte Graham-McLay reports for us from Wellington: New Zealand’s defence minister Peeni Henare has given a statement following reports that a New Zealand soldier, who was not on active duty, has been killed in Ukraine. “I express my condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of the New Zealand soldier who is reported to have died in Ukraine while on leave from the army,” Henare said. “I have been advised the New Zealand army are supporting the soldier’s family through this difficult time.” The soldier was on leave without pay at the time, the defence force said in a statement on Wednesday. New Zealand has sent defence personnel to train Ukraine soldiers in the UK but does not have a military presence on Ukrainian soil. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg is the latest person to wish Ukraine well today. He tweeted: On #Ukraine’s independence day I pay tribute to the brave Ukrainian women &amp; men fighting for their freedom &amp; their country. #NATO has supported Ukraine since its independence &amp; you can continue to count on NATO for as long as it takes. Ukraine will prevail! President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told Ukrainians on Wednesday in an emotional speech to mark 31 years of independence that Ukraine was reborn when Russia invaded and would recapture annexed Crimea and occupied areas in the east. In the recorded speech aired on the six-month anniversary of Russia’s 24 February invasion, Zelenskiy said Ukraine no longer saw the war ending when there was peace, but when Kyiv was actually victorious, reports Reuters. He said: A new nation appeared in the world on February 24 at 4 in the morning. It was not born, but reborn. A nation that did not cry, scream or take fright. One that did not flee. Did not give up. And did not forget. The 44-year-old leader delivered the speech in his trademark combat fatigues in front of Kyiv’s central monument to independence from the Russia-controlled Soviet Union. What for us is the end of the war? We used to say: peace. Now we say: victory.

Tugendhat earlier said he was in the city along with 30 representatives from across Europe “to show our support for Ukraine and stand against Putin’s illegal invasion”, reports PA Media. He added: Where the communists once paraded, now the Kremlin’s callous failure is on display. The Tonbridge and Malling MP has been an outspoken critic of the offensive, calling it a “crime against peace” not long after it began. Tugendhat made it to the third round of the race to succeed Boris Johnson before being bundled out last month. Before I hand you over to my colleague, here is a rundown of where things stand as of 9am in Kyiv. Ukraine is bracing for possible brutal strikes as it marks 31 years since the country broke free from the Soviet Union. Western and Ukrainian officials have warned that Russia is preparing to escalate its attacks.

In an update posted to the agency’s official Telegram channel late last night, officials said that mortar attacks on the surrounding suburbs of Energodar aimed to target the ash pits of the plant. The US is set to announce a fresh security assistance package for Ukraine of about $3bn (£2.5bn), officials have said, to equip the country for a war of attrition and secure its medium- to long-term defence posture. The money will fund contracts for as many as three types of drones, and other weapons, ammunition and equipment that may not see the battlefront for a year or two, US officials told the Associated Press. Germany will also supply Ukraine with a further €500m in military aid, most of it earmarked for delivery next year, a government spokesperson said on Tuesday. The equipment will include three IRIS-T anti-aircraft systems, “around a dozen armed recovery vehicles, 20 rocket-launchers mounted on pick-ups … precision munition and anti-drone equipment,” a spokesperson told Agence France-Presse. Norway and Britain are joining forces to acquire the Norwegian micro-drone Black Hornet to send to Ukraine. The package -at a cost of up to NOK 90m (about £8m) – includes Black Hornet units, spare parts, transportation and training and will be financed by the British-led fund to which Norway has contributed NOK 400m, according to a statement issued by the Norwegian ministry of defence on Wednesday. Russian authorities have reportedly detained Anti-Kremlin politician Yevgeny Roizman for speaking out against Putin’s military campaign in Ukraine, according to Russian media reports. Roizman, a former mayor of the city of Yekaterinburg, is being investigated for “discrediting the Russian army”, Russia state media agency Tass reported, citing Yekaterinburg security services. Moldova is the latest European nation to wish Ukraine well today. President Maia Sandu tweeted this morning: “We admire the courage and defiance of Ukrainian people – defenders of their home and fighters for freedom, independence and democracy. You are an inspiration for generations to come. We stand with you and wish you peace and prosperity.” No 10 Downing Street has been decorated with a blue and yellow flower installation in honour of Ukraine’s independence day. Outgoing prime minister Boris Johnson was seen posing outside the residence. Russia’s Donbas offensive is making minimal progress and its forces are suffering from shortages of munitions, vehicles and personnel, according to British intelligence. The latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads: The Donbas offensive is making minimal progress and Russia anticipates a major Ukrainian counterattack. Operationally, Russia is suffering from shortages of munitions, vehicles and personnel. Morale is poor in many parts of its military and its army is significantly degraded. Its diplomatic power has been diminished and its long-term economic outlook is bleak. Six months in and Russia’s war has proven both costly and strategically harmful.” New Zealand’s defence force says it has received reports that a soldier who was on leave has been killed in Ukraine. Charlotte Graham-McLay reports to us from Wellington. The soldier was on a period of leave without pay at the time and was not on active duty with New Zealand forces, according to a statement provided to the media by email on Wednesday. The comments were not attributed to a named person. The statement said the NZDF was still gathering information “in order to understand the circumstances fully” and could not provide more details. New Zealand’s government announced earlier this month that it would send a further 120 defence force personnel to the UK to help train Ukraine soldiers, in addition to 30 people it had deployed to do so in May. New Zealand’s defence minister, Peeni Henare, said at the time that no New Zealand defence force member would enter Ukraine on duty. Finland has followed suit with its president Sauli Niinistö also congratulating Ukraine this morning. “My most sincere congratulations to President Zelenskiy and to the people of Ukraine on your Independence Day,” Niinistö said. “Finland stands with Ukraine, and we will continue our unwavering support for as long as needed.” Lithuania has wished Ukraine well for its independence day today. President Gitanas Nausėda shared a snap of himself with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Twitter this morning. “Wishing strength to Zelenskiy and Ukraine who fights for freedom with incredible courage, defiance and dignity,” he said. “Lithuania is always with you.” The US has begun to load more military aid bound for Ukraine. The US department of defence published a series of photos showing members of the 305th aerial port squadron loading munition packages bound for Ukraine onto planes at the joint base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. “Our service members are working around the clock to make sure the Ukrainian people have the equipment they need to defend their country,” US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, added. Google has released a doodle in honour of Ukraine’s independence day today. Illustrated by Kharkiv-based artist Olga Shtonda, the design honours this day in 1991 when Ukrainian politicians signed the act of declaration of independence and displayed their national flag within the session hall of the Verkhovna Rada building, signalling its freedom from the Soviet Union. The national holiday remembers all who’ve given their lives for their country, including those still fighting to this day. On 1 December 1991, a national referendum saw 92% of citizens vote in favour of independence. Today’s doodle artwork represents the national symbols of Ukraine, featuring a trident often interpreted as a falcon and the country’s coat of arms, Google said. Ukraine’s intelligence directorate has claimed Russia is attempting to shell the “ash pits” of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to “raise clouds of radioactive dust”. In an update posted to the agency’s official Telegram channel late last night, officials said that mortar attacks on the surrounding suburbs of Energodar aimed to target the ash pits of the Zaporizhzhia plant. These are places where ash is stored, which is formed during the operation of thermal power plants. This waste has a high concentration of toxic substances and a level of radiation that is at least 2.5 times higher than the natural background. When drying, they form dust that can move over considerable distances. As a result of mortar strikes on ash pits, clouds of dust are formed, which are blown by the wind in the vicinity of Energodar. Monitoring of the radiation background, which is carried out near the nuclear plant, indicates an increase in the level of radiation. The occupiers are trying to present these data as the results of mythical ‘strikes by the Armed Forces of Ukraine’.” Norway and Britain are joining forces to acquire the Norwegian micro-drone Black Hornet to send to Ukraine. The package -at a cost of up to NOK 90m (about £8m) - includes Black Hornet units, spare parts, transportation and training and will be financed by the British-led fund to which Norway has contributed NOK 400m, according to a statement issued by the Norwegian ministry of defence on Wednesday. The Norwegian-developed drone is used for reconnaissance and target identification. It is easy to operate, robust, difficult to detect and particularly well suited for combat in urban areas, Norway’s defence minister, Bjørn Arild Gram, said. The micro-drone will be acquired from Teledyne Flir, as a call-off on a framework agreement that the Norwegian Defence material agency has. Procurement, training and delivery of the material will be done in collaboration with and coordinated by the British authorities. An anti-drone system will also be purchased for approximately 100m of the Norwegian funds for the fund. The system chosen is the anti-drone system Nightfighter from British SteelRock Technologies. SteelRock Nightfighter is a portable system that provides protection against drones through effective jamming. The system is particularly suitable for protecting smaller patrols, artillery positions and other important resources A $75m (£63m) superyacht linked to a Russian steel billionaire has been put to auction in Gibraltar in the first sale of an oligarch’s assets since Putin invaded Ukraine in February. The 72.5-metre-long Axioma, was seized from steel billionaire Dmitry Pumpyansky in March following sanctions by the UK, EU and the US. The office of the admiralty marshal in Ukraine said on Tuesday that “63 bids have been received” for Axioma but refused to detail the value of the bids for the yacht, which features six luxurious guest cabins, a swimming pool, a 3D cinema room, gym, jacuzzi and a fully equipped spa. “The successful bidder will be selected by the admiralty marshal but details of the bidder and the value of the offer will remain confidential,” the court said in a statement. “Details about the sale value of the vessel will be made available once the transaction has been completed which could take place in approximately 10 to 14 days.” The sale of Axioma has attracted controversy because it is being sold not for the benefit of the Ukrainian people but for a US investment bank, JP Morgan, which claims Pumpyansky owes it more than €20.5m (£17m). The UN has said it is “very concerned” about plans by Russian-backed authorities to hold trials for captured Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol. Pro-Russian officials appear to be installing metal cages in a hall in Mariupol as part of plans to establish what they were calling an “international tribunal”, a UN rights office spokesperson said, adding that such a process could itself amount to a war crime. Michelle Bachelet, UN high commissioner for human rights, cited reports that Russia and its separatist allies in eastern Ukraine are planning to put Ukrainian POWs on trial, possibly in the coming days. Russian authorities have reportedly detained politician Yevgeny Roizman known for his criticism of the Kremlin and, more recently, of the military campaign in Ukraine, according to Russian media reports. Roizman, a former mayor of the city of Yekaterinburg, is being investigated for “discrediting the Russian army”, Russia state media agency Tass reported, citing Yekaterinburg security services. “A criminal case has been initiated under Article 280.3 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation … Investigative actions are underway,” a law enforcement source told RIA Novosti. Roizman was one of a handful of Kremlin critics who won mayoral posts following a series of big opposition demonstrations as Russian president, Vladimir Putin, campaigned for office in 2012. Russian authorities have prosecuted a number of activists for calling the war on Ukraine a war or criticising Russia’s actions. Germany will also supply Ukraine with a further €500m in military aid, most of it earmarked for delivery next year, a government spokesman said on Tuesday. The equipment will include three IRIS-T anti-aircraft systems, “around a dozen armed recovery vehicles, 20 rocket-launchers mounted on pick-ups... precision munition and anti-drone equipment,” a spokesperson told Agence France-Presse. Most of it will be delivered in 2023, he added. The US is set to announce a fresh security assistance package for Ukraine of about $3bn (£2.5bn), officials have said, to coincide with Ukraine’s independence day and to equip the country for a war of attrition fought primarily in eastern and southern Ukraine. US security assistance is shifting to a longer-term campaign that will likely keep more American military troops in Europe into the future and aid to train and equip Ukrainian forces to fight for years to come. US officials told The Associated Press that the package is expected to be announced on Wednesday. The money will fund contracts for as many as three types of drones, and other weapons, ammunition and equipment that may not see the battlefront for a year or two, they said. The total of the aid package — which is being provided under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative and is the largest to date— could change a bit overnight, but not likely by much. Officials said that it will include money for the small, hand-launched Puma drones, the longer-endurance Scan Eagle surveillance drones, which are launched by catapult, and, for the first time, the British Vampire drone system, which can be launched off ships. Unlike most previous packages, the new funding is largely aimed at helping Ukraine secure its medium- to long-term defence posture, according to the officials familiar with the matter. Earlier shipments, most of them done under Presidential Drawdown Authority, have focused on Ukraine’s more immediate needs for weapons and ammunition and involved materiel that the Pentagon already has in stock that can be shipped in short order. The UN nuclear watchdog will visit the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine “within the next few days if ongoing negotiations succeed”, it said in a statement on Tuesday. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) renewed its request on Tuesday to assess the safety and security at Europe’s largest nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine which Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling, sparking warnings of a possible nuclear catastrophe. In a statement, IAEA director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said: Ukraine informed the IAEA that the shelling on Saturday (20 August) and Sunday (21 August) damaged ZNPP infrastructure including laboratory and chemical facilities, the Director General said. In addition, Ukraine said shelling on Monday (22 August) damaged the transformers of the nearby thermal power plant, causing a disconnection of the power line linking this plant to the ZNPP lasting several hours before it was restored later the same day. These incidents show why the IAEA must be able to send a mission to the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant very soon. … The mission is expected to take place within the next few days if ongoing negotiations succeed.” Zelenskiy has vowed to return Crimea to Ukraine, saying that it would become part of the EU, along with the rest of the country. We will return Crimea, because it is our territory. In any way we decide. We will decide it on our own, without consulting any other state … It all began with Crimea, and it will end with Crimea.” Ukraine is also not ready for negotiations with Russia regarding a ceasefire, Zelenskiy said. At the point where we are, we are not ready for a ceasefire. We explained that there will be no Minsk-3, Minsk-5, or Minsk-7. We will not play these games, we have lost part of our territories this way … it is a trap,” he said during a press conference following a summit of the Crimea Platform in Kyiv. Meanwhile, many civilians are attempting to leave Kyiv amid fears of a Russian attack, according to an adviser to Ukraine’s president. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Alex Rodnyansky said people were worried and that there was “certainly some concern” that an attack may strike the centres of decision-making in the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday. People are reacting to the news. They are trying to ensure they have contingency plans, they don’t want to spend too much time near the centre near the buildings of our government. There is a risk Russia will try to strike exactly at that time to compensate for their inability to have any success on the battlefield, to have any success in subduing Ukraine and basically all the failures they have run up over the last six months. In light of warnings over increased Russian hostilities to coincide with Ukraine’s independence day, Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that any attacks by Russia would be met with a powerful response as Ukraine prepared to mark 31 years since the end of Soviet rule. Ukrainian intelligence is working with foreign intelligence, he said in a news conference on Tuesday, warning that Russia “will receive a response, a powerful response”. Ukraine is bracing for possible brutal strikes as it marks 31 years since the country broke free from the Soviet Union and six months of war with Russia. Speaking during a national address on Tuesday night, Zelenskiy said: Tomorrow is an important day for all of us. And that is why this day, unfortunately, is also important for our enemy. We must be aware that tomorrow hideous Russian provocations and brutal strikes are possible.” Authorities have banned mass gatherings in Kyiv as western and Ukrainian officials warn that Russia is preparing to once again attack the capital. The US on Tuesday said it believed Russia would target civilian and government infrastructure in the next few days. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he had information from Ukraine’s intelligence services and international partners that there was an increased threat. Ukraine’s defence ministry has advised Ukrainians to be especially careful on independence day, citing the threat of missile attacks and “provocations” from Russia. Andriy Yusov, the head of the ministry’s intelligence directorate, said on Ukrainian state TV: Russia and the Putin regime attacked the independence of Ukraine and independent Ukraine. They are really obsessed with dates and symbols, so it would be logical to be on the lookout and be prepared for independence day to be attacked.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

Ukraine has accused Russia of having organised illegal mass adoptions of Ukrainian children after transferring them from occupied territories to the Russia mainland. “More than 1,000 children from Mariupol,” a southern Ukrainian city occupied by Russian troops, “were illegally transferred to outsiders in Tyumen, Irkutsk, Kemerovo and Altai Krai” in Siberia, Ukraine’s foreign ministry said in a statement. The UN has said it is “very concerned” about plans by Russian-backed authorities to hold trials for captured Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol.

The government’s target, announced on Monday with less than a month until the start of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow, is a key component of its pledge to reach net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. That broader effort will probably involve much more widespread use of electric vehicles, and electric heat pumps in the home, meaning the UK must generate much more power but with far lower emissions. The challenges involved are monumental. How much electricity do we use? Demand was just under 35 gigawatts (GW) on Monday but that can rise to about 58GW at peak, on cold winter days. Expressed over the course of a year, the UK used about 330 terawatt hours last year, 5% down on 2019, when the coronavirus pandemic dampened demand. By 2035, demand is projected to reach 460 terawatt hours, an increase of almost 40%. How green is our electricity now? Last year, wind and solar produced a record proportion of UK electricity, at 43%, eclipsing fossil fuels, at 40%, for the first time. The rest was largely supplied by nuclear power and imports through subsea interconnector cables. Easter Monday this year was the UK grid’s greenest day ever, with low carbon sources hitting almost 80%, thanks to sunny spells, blustery winds and low holiday demand. But when conditions are not ideal, it is invariably gas that picks up the slack. Gas emits significantly less carbon than coal, which has been almost eliminated from the UK power mix and should be gone altogether by 2024, but meeting climate pledges means massively reducing gas usage. What needs to happen? The Climate Change Committee (CCC), an independent body launched in 2008, estimates that the carbon intensity of electricity generation needs to fall significantly on the road to net zero. The amount of CO2 emitted per kilowatt hour would have to fall from 220g in 2019 to 10g in 2035. After crunching the numbers, the energy advisory firm Cornwall Insight believes this requires a massive ramp-up of wind and solar to meet up to 86% of electricity demand inside 15 years. This would require offshore wind capacity more than quadrupling from 10GW to 44GW, while onshore wind rises by 14GW to between 30GW and 44GW. Solar would need to increase significantly, too, from 15GW to between 22GW and 30GW. Would that do the job? Not even close. Renewables need reliable backup because of their volatility. Cornwall Insight’s projection adds in 15GW of capacity supplied by interconnectors, 5GW of nuclear power and a further 16GW of gas or biomass plants that use carbon capture and storage technology to reduce CO2 emissions drastically. The CCC’s projections include gas plants being converted to run on hydrogen and meeting about 5% of demand. What about storage? Storage is absolutely key, to ensure surplus renewable energy can be saved up on sunny, windy days for release when conditions are less favourable. The CCC’s plan, the “balanced pathway” to net zero, envisages a wind and solar-dominated grid backed up by 18GW of battery storage capacity by 2035. Battery capacity is at just 1.3GW now, although 20GW of projects are in the works. Hydrogen storage is another option, using electrolysis to extract “green hydrogen” from water, which can be kept for long periods of time and then burnt to regenerate the electricity or used to replace fossil fuels in applications such as transport. This is not to be confused with pumped hydro storage using water, which involves pumping water uphill and then using the downhill flow to generate electricity. One hope is that electric vehicles can be used as batteries to store electricity and release it as needed, when the cars are not in use. But local and national power grids need to be smarter to make that work, while a surge in the number of EVs also creates extra overall power demand. How much will this cost? Cornwall Insight estimates that investment of up to £200bn will be required to bring online the wind, solar and battery power needed for a renewable-powered UK. The CCC says investment must reach £50bn a year by 2030. Still though, no more gas? Not quite. The conventional wisdom is that some level of gas capacity needs to remain on the system, even if it barely contributes more than a few hours of supply here and there. The idea is that it stands ready to provide quick bursts of power when required, at short notice. What about nuclear? Nuclear power plants cost a lot, take years to build and have many vehement opponents, who say they simply do not count as green energy. However, they are capable of generating a large amount of electricity without carbon emissions. The big problem is that most nuclear reactors are scheduled for retirement soon. The current fleet offers capacity of about 8.9GW, satisfying about a sixth of UK demand. But more than half of that is due to come offline by the end of 2024 alone, starting with Hunterston B later this year. Assuming there are no further delays, the new Hinkley Point C reactors do not fire up until 2026 and 2027. The picture has been complicated by reports that the UK government is looking to eject China from nuclear projects. Nuclear enthusiasts hope the 2035 target signals strong backing for EDF’s Sizewell C, in Suffolk, as well as Wylfa Newydd on Anglesey, which has struggled to get going amid investors’ funding concerns. Throw in plans by Rolls-Royce for small modular reactors, colloquially known as mini nukes, and capacity could reach 15GW by 2035. The gamechanger for nuclear could be something called regulated asset base financing, which the government is exploring. That should offer guaranteed returns for investors, attracting much-needed additional backing. Is the 2035 target doable? From a technical perspective, yes, but there are significant policy hurdles to overcome. Energy industry lobbyists point to slow planning consent, infrequent windfarm auctions and insufficient grid infrastructure. Many experts believe the energy market needs to be totally redesigned to adapt to changing needs, potentially overseen by a new body. Helping consumers reduce demand is also important. Energy suppliers have a role to play there but are under increasing pressure because of the surge in gas prices that has resulted in 12 failing this year, with more expected to follow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/mar/28/native-americans-ban-russian-uranium","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-28T10:00:51Z","webTitle":"‘Ready to fight’: how a Russian uranium ban would threaten Native American tribes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/28/native-americans-ban-russian-uranium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/mar/28/native-americans-ban-russian-uranium","fields":{"headline":"‘Ready to fight’: how a Russian uranium ban would threaten Native American tribes","bodyText":"Sacred Native American sites such as the Grand Canyon and Bears Ears may seem a long way from the devastation unfolding in Ukraine. But as the US mulls a ban on Russian uranium, part of economic levers to stop Putin’s war, Indigenous communities living near US mines could pay the price. John Barrasso, a senator from Wyoming, recently introduced a bill that calls for a ban on all forms of uranium imported from Russia. Uranium fuels America’s nuclear power plants, and about 20% of that comes from Russia, while close to another 30% is imported from the Russian allies of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Such a ban would shift American uranium production into overdrive. In an editorial in the Casper Star Tribune, Barrasso pointed out that the US has “vast uranium resources”, including in Wyoming, but 90% of the uranium used in nuclear power plants is imported. “Rather than letting our uranium sit in the ground, we ought to use it,” he wrote. A longtime advocate of the uranium industry, Barrasso also wrote that continuing to buy Russian uranium was funding “Putin’s killing machine”. Mining companies now stand at the ready, with the possibility to ramp up production at sites near the Grand Canyon, Bears Ears national monument in Utah and at multiple locations in Barrasso’s home state of Wyoming. Many of the operations pose environmental and spiritual threats to Indigenous communities who live near the mines and have fought their existence for decades. Amber Reimondo, the energy director of the not-for-profit Grand Canyon Trust, says the Senate’s proposal risks “perpetuating environmental injustices on our own soil”. “If this ban is aimed at saving lives, the answer can’t just be to ramp up US uranium production,” Reimondo says. “The answer has to involve truly respecting and listening to communities on the frontlines of uranium production, especially Indigenous communities … Otherwise, this is not about protecting human life. It is about protecting profits.” An opportunity decades in the making When the cold war began in the late 1940s, the federal government started a uranium boom in the US by offering generous incentives to private mining companies and guaranteeing a purchase price for ore. By the mid-1950s, more than 750 mines were in operation, mostly in and around Native American reservations in the south-west where there were rich uranium deposits. Until 1971, the US government was the primary purchaser of uranium as it built up its military arsenal. Many Native Americans worked in the mines, which were poorly regulated and offered few safety protections for employees or the environment. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, cheap uranium flooded the global market, which effectively shut down the more expensive US uranium mining operations. But with imported uranium prices on the rise after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – up from $17 a pound in 2017 to nearly $60 a pound in the last few days – domestic mining companies see a unique opportunity. Denver-based Energy Fuels Resources, the second largest uranium producer in the United States, told investors in mid-March that the war in Ukraine could improve the company’s bottom line. “With the recent events in Ukraine, security of supply in US of uranium is crucial,” said Mark Chalmers, the company’s president and CEO, in a webcast. He added that for the first time in years the suddenly favorable business environment had made it possible to pursue uranium sales contracts with “pricing and terms that return acceptable project margins”. According to Energy Fuels spokesperson Curtis Moore, the company has a total of six uranium mining facilities in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming that are fully permitted and licensed, and could go into production pending a viable sales arrangement with a nuclear utility. Pinyon Plain mine (formerly called Canyon Mine) has been waiting for such a moment for 35 years. Although the company has built most of the mine’s infrastructure and obtained all the permits, not a pound of ore has ever been extracted because uranium prices have remained too low. The mine occupies 17 acres on Kaibab national forest, nine miles from the South Rim of Grand Canyon and three miles from Red Butte. The rust-colored landmark rising from the Coconino Plateau is the spiritual center for the Havasupai people who have lived in the Grand Canyon for more than 800 years. The 754-member tribe has been fighting the mine since it was first permitted in 1986. In addition to fears about environmental and health hazards, there are also significant spiritual harms caused by the mine that tribal members say are devastating but have been dismissed by federal courts, the mining company and government regulatory agencies. “We have a belief system that they don’t understand,” says the Havasupai elder Carletta Tilousi who has been involved in fighting the mine for decades and also serves on Joe Biden’s White House environmental justice advisory council. “In our stories, that area where the mine is located is Mother Earth’s lungs. So when they dug the mine shaft, they punctured her lungs.” In 2016, Energy Fuels completed digging a 1,400ft-deep mine shaft. The operation pierced an aquifer that has flowed into the mine shaft ever since. About 40m gallons of water with high levels of uranium and arsenic have been managed on the site, where a lined pond holds the water before it is sprayed into the air to evaporate. Environmentalists and the Havasupai argue that the toxic water could eventually make its way into a deep aquifer that supplies the tribe’s drinking water and feeds springs in Grand Canyon national park. If the mine begins extracting uranium ore, the possibility for contamination will become exponentially greater. When asked about the controversy over Pinyon Plain mine and its potential impact on Indigenous communities, Moore attributed the negative claims to environmental groups. “There are some activists who like to spread a lot of misinformation about groundwater pollution or air pollution,” he said. “But it’s just not true.” Reimondo points out that even if Energy Fuels is currently not in violation of regulations from the Arizona department of environmental quality, the water coming out of the mine shaft still contains levels of uranium and arsenic that is about 30 times the amount considered safe by the EPA for drinking water. And there is always the possibility that the pond holding all that water could spring a leak. “The risk of an accident is theoretical with regulators until it actually happens,” says Reimondo. The ore extracted from Pinyon Plain mine would be trucked to Energy Fuels’ White Mesa Mill, a processing facility in southeastern Utah adjacent to the Ute Mountain Ute community and near Bears Ears national monument. As the only operational uranium mill in the United States, White Mesa’s processing business is likely to significantly increase with more domestic uranium production. The 40-year-old mill also produces uranium by extracting it from industrial wastes, and stores leftover radioactive material on site. Like the Havasupai, the Ute Mountain Ute are worried their drinking water could be contaminated by the mill. And they are afraid to gather traditional plants in the area or even let their children play outside when the air smells bad. In August 2021, the tribe passed a resolution declaring that White Mesa Mill should be closed in order to protect the health of the community. But that request has not been acted upon by Utah government officials. “How can we make sure tribal members can get clean drinking water when radioactive waste is just a few miles away?” asks Manuel Heart, the Ute Mountain Ute tribal chairman. A threat that could linger for years Industry representatives counter that fears about uranium mining operations are misguided and based on bad practices from the cold war era rather than the modern technologies used today. “All the mines that would respond to this current demand have gone through the gauntlet of permitting with very high US standards,” says Scott Melbye, president of the trade group Uranium Producers of America. “The United States can do it a lot better, safer and cleaner than developed countries who don’t care about the environment or aboriginal communities. We are the world leaders for 21st-century mining practices in terms of health and safety.” However, Reimondo of Grand Canyon Trust points out that health and safety regulations only focus on monitoring during a short time period, while exposed uranium can pose an environmental hazard for hundreds or thousands of years. The Pinyon Plain mine is anticipated to have an operational life of four to seven years followed by a post-closure monitoring program lasting seven years. “The threat of a uranium mine doesn’t end when it closes,” she says. “In fact, that might be the start of the real threat because nobody is there any more.” Hundreds of abandoned uranium mines remain on the Navajo reservation from operations spanning the 1950s to the 1980s when the US military built up its cold war arsenal. Cancer caused by contaminated ground water is common on the reservation and an ongoing recent study by the University of New Mexico found that many Navajo women and their babies have high levels of radioactive metal in their systems. Uncertainty remains as to whether the uranium ban will come to fruition. According to Senator Barrasso’s spokesperson, the bill has not yet been scheduled for a committee hearing but “he will look for every opportunity to pass it into law”. And although Biden banned imports of Russian oil, gas and coal, he has not announced any policies regarding Russian uranium. Regardless, the Havasupai, who call themselves “the guardians of the Grand Canyon”, are ready to fight. “You may have taken the ground from underneath us but we are still here,” says Tilousi. “We are a small tribe with a very big voice.” • This article was amended on 30 March 2022. An earlier version said that Energy Fuels had “inadvertantly” pierced an aquifer at Pinyon Plain mine that had “flooded” the shaft. In fact, the perched aquifer was pierced intentionally and the consequent flow of water is being continuously pumped out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/may/06/tehran-series-two-review-glenn-close","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-06T08:00:10Z","webTitle":"Tehran series two review – Glenn Close adds menace to this breathlessly exciting thriller ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/06/tehran-series-two-review-glenn-close","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/06/tehran-series-two-review-glenn-close","fields":{"headline":"Tehran series two review – Glenn Close adds menace to this breathlessly exciting thriller ","bodyText":"I cannot think of a more stressful viewing experience than Tehran (Apple TV+), a thriller so hectic it makes Homeland look like one of those ambient noise apps that send you off to sleep. The first season saw Tamar (Niv Sultan), an Israeli Mossad hacker/agent with an Iranian family background, going undercover in Tehran in order to facilitate airstrikes on a nuclear power plant. There was a lot of double-crossing, a lot of shooting, and an awful lot of stress. It ended in fairly disastrous fashion, leaving plenty of options open for what could happen next. All-out war? More subterfuge? Either way, it was unlikely to be relaxing. We join Tamar and her Iranian collaborator Milad (Shervin Alenabi) hiding out in Tehran, two months after the first season’s finale and after all the betrayals it unleashed upon the key players on each side. The old mission is in limbo and must be wrapped up, and Tamar, who has been left adrift, must figure out how to extract herself. But this is not a repeat of season one, and a new mission is to be established. I briefly hoped that, for those of us of a nervous disposition, the new mission might involve manoeuvring Mossad and the Revolutionary Guard towards a cup of tea and a nice lie down. Instead, it involves prisons, hospitals, break-ins and break-outs, secret services, people-smuggling, newly appointed government officials, family members in various states of compromise and, in what looks like a display of Apple TV+’s confidence in the international appeal of the series, a brand new star in the form of Glenn Close. Appearing as British woman Marjan Montazeri towards the end of the first episode, and speaking a mixture of Farsi and English, Close exudes power and malevolence. As she stepped out of the shadows, she reminded me a little of Ozark’s Cartel lawyer Helen Pierce, crossed with the wicked stepmother in a fairytale. She is authoritative and suspicious, and, as this is Tehran, it is impossible to know whether she should be trusted or not. Unfortunately, Tamar, trapped in Iran, still hunted by Faraz and still of enormous use to the Mossad, does not appear to have much choice in the matter. All the standard hacker/thriller tropes are present, and used with effect. No episode is boring – everything is taken right up to the wire. There are uploads and downloads, unravelling at an excruciating pace, and chugging towards 100% on the progress bar, as impending danger threatens to kick down the door. There are long chase scenes every five minutes or so. There is a lot of running around in marketplaces and hiding in dark corners, as atmospheric music pounds ominously. And it seems more grim this time around. The bodycount was never particularly restrained, but there are multiple hangings, shootings, and ridiculously large machine guns. But, in among the relentless action, we occasionally see beyond the espionage into a certain side of life in Tehran. There are drug deals at the gym. The wealthy son of a familiar and crucial commander drives expensive sports cars around the city and is soon to be entangled in business that is highly beneficial to the Mossad’s interests. The aftershocks of the first season continue to have an effect on Tamar, and it feels important to see that she has been traumatised by the horrors she has both witnessed and played a key role in facilitating. Will she be able to maintain the cool, rational judgment she needs to continue to play the long game? Tehran is one of a raft of better dramas that suggest Apple is getting its act together as a streaming service worth paying attention to, after a long period of treading water. Its policy of releasing a couple of episodes then drip-feeding the rest week-by-week works particularly well for thrillers and stories that thrive on twists and turns; I am now waiting for whatever insanity Shining Girls is ready to unleash upon us every Friday. Tehran is a perfect fit for this approach. Two episodes at once is plenty. Bingeing a whole series in one go would be masochistic. Whether the prospect of watching a drama about the distinct possibility of a catastrophic war fought in the shadows and involving nuclear capabilities will float your boat may be up for debate, but perhaps it will be like the early days of the pandemic, when everyone decided that the film they would most like to watch was Contagion. I still have a sneaking suspicion that Tehran thinks of itself as slightly more highbrow than it is, but it is a solid thriller, often breathlessly exciting, and has cracked the code of relentless tension."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2022/mar/23/johnson-to-defy-cabinet-fears-and-push-for-onshore-wind-expansion","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-23T19:33:14Z","webTitle":"Johnson to defy cabinet fears and push for onshore wind expansion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/23/johnson-to-defy-cabinet-fears-and-push-for-onshore-wind-expansion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/mar/23/johnson-to-defy-cabinet-fears-and-push-for-onshore-wind-expansion","fields":{"headline":"Johnson to defy cabinet fears and push for onshore wind expansion","bodyText":"Boris Johnson is expected to open the door to more onshore wind at next week’s energy strategy, despite some cabinet ministers lobbying against relaxing planning laws to allow more turbines. The cabinet is split over whether to aim for more onshore wind projects, which can often get into lengthy planning battles, after officials drew up plans for a target of 30GW by 2030. Ministers have not yet made a final decision but one senior government source said Johnson was “open minded” and “passionate” about offshore wind. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has made clear publicly that he would like to see planning rules relaxed in order to facilitate the building of more onshore windfarms. Michael Gove, who oversees the planning system, has also spoken in favour. However, one cabinet minister said that there should not be a rush towards onshore wind because it was “extremely expensive” and “not cost-effective”. Some are understood to prefer a push for fracking, despite safety and environmental concerns. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit opportunities minister, has publicly declared himself in favour exploiting more onshore gas in the UK. The energy independence plan was announced by the prime minister after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Set to be published next week after some delays, it is expected to propose a rapid expansion of nuclear power and accelerated targets for renewables – but it is unclear whether a relaxation of planning rules around onshore wind will be included. Officials have suggested targets of 16GW of nuclear by 2030, 50GW of offshore by 2030, and 50GW of solar by 2030, the Guardian understands. A Downing Street source said: “All options have to be on the table, given global price increases and the need to be self-sufficient – but nothing is decided yet.” David Cameron’s government tightened planning rules for onshore wind developments in 2014, requiring more local consultation. Sparked by grassroots Tory opposition from communities, which saw the turbines as an eyesore, the move has effectively acted as a moratorium. Eight members of Johnson’s cabinet – including Rees-Mogg, Steve Barclay, Brandon Lewis, Nadine Dorries, Nadhim Zahawi and Mark Spencer – were signatories to a 2012 letter opposing onshore wind, though a No 10 source said: “I wouldn’t read too much into that.” At the time, the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, said: “We need to ensure that protecting the local environment is properly considered alongside the broader issues of protecting the global environment.” Kwarteng has suggested the public’s opposition to windfarms has fallen away, given the push for net zero and the renewed interest in energy self-sufficiency since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “There were quite understandable political reasons that people didn’t want to see large-scale, onshore winds in their vicinity. I think that’s changed,” he told the i newspaper earlier this week. “I think the prime minister has been very clear that onshore wind has got to be part of the mix and we’ve got to look at planning.” He added: “The argument about onshore wind in 2015 was a historic argument even before we committed to net zero and the circumstances today with Putin. Russia, Saudi Arabia, all of those things mean that we’ve got to have more energy independence and I think onshore renewables are absolutely part of that.” When asked if the prime minister agreed with Kwarteng’s view, Johnson’s official spokesperson said on Tuesday: “I think the public has recognised the need to diversify our energy supply and the importance of having sustainable energy sources, which move away from the volatility we see from non-renewables.” Scotland has pushed ahead with onshore wind, with a more liberalised planning system, and is regarded in Whitehall as what one government source described as a “major success story”. The UK has announced that it is seeking to phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of 2022 and will also examine ending Russian gas imports. Johnson was previously sceptical about windfarms, writing in 2013 that they couldn’t “pull the skin off a rice pudding”. The shadow environment secretary, Ed Miliband, has argued that a “sprint” towards renewables, rather than investment in fracking, should be the government’s response to the crisis in Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jan/31/north-korea-releases-images-it-claims-were-taken-from-space-during-missile-test","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-31T05:23:16Z","webTitle":"North Korea releases images it claims were taken from space during missile test","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/north-korea-releases-images-it-claims-were-taken-from-space-during-missile-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jan/31/north-korea-releases-images-it-claims-were-taken-from-space-during-missile-test","fields":{"headline":"North Korea releases images it claims were taken from space during missile test","bodyText":"North Korea has released images it claims show the test-firing this weekend of its biggest missile for several years, as it attempts to use launches of weapons capable of reaching US territories to pressure the Biden administration into restarting nuclear talks. The state-run KCNA news agency said on Monday the country had launched an intermediate-range Hwasong-12 missile capable of reaching the US Pacific territory of Guam. The missile was the most powerful the regime has tested since late 2017. Sunday’s launch – the seventh this month – appears to be part of a push by the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to secure sanctions relief and international recognition of its status as a legitimate nuclear power. After a series of launches involving short-range missiles, some observers believe the regime could be gearing up for tests of nuclear weapons or intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of striking parts of the US mainland. Under Joe Biden, Washington has offered talks “without preconditions” but dismissed North Korean demands that it offer sanctions relief and other concessions as a prelude to negotiations. There are no signs that Biden, who this month approved the first North Korean sanctions of his presidency, is considering a return to the direct diplomacy that led to three meetings between Kim and Donald Trump. Kim has been present at previous launches but did not witness Sunday’s test. The US said it shared concerns that North Korea’s escalating missile tests could be precursors to resumed tests of nuclear weapons and ICBMs, a senior US official said on Sunday. “They are looking to take actions, which we believe are fundamentally destabilising, as a way to increase pressure,” the official told a briefing in Washington. “I think that there probably is a component that is also to validate the systems that they’ve developed and further refine them.” KCNA published two sets of photos of Sunday’s test – one capturing the missile rising from its launcher near the country’s border with China, the other showing images from space it said were taken by a camera installed on the missile’s warhead. The images’ authenticity has not been independently verified. It added that the missile had been fired on a lofted trajectory “in considerations of the safety of neighbouring countries”. An assessment by the South Korean and Japanese militaries estimated it flew about 800 km (497 miles) and reached a maximum altitude of 2,000 km (1,242 miles) before landing in the sea between the Korean peninsula and Japan. By demonstrating a Hwasong-12, North Korea has sent the US its strongest message so far this year. When fired at a standard trajectory, the nuclear-capable ground-to-ground weapon is theoretically capable of reaching anywhere in Japan, as well as Guam and the far western tip of Alaska’s Aleutian Islands chain. In 2017 the regime test-fired a Hwasong-15 ICBM, which some experts said proved it had acquired the ability to strike the US mainland. Observers believe the North could halt missile tests while the winter Olympics are being held in China – its most important ally and biggest aid donor – but warned that that it could launch more powerful weapons after the Beijing Games end later this month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
